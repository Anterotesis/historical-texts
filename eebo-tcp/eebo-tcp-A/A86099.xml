            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169713:9"/>that they are in danger of denying, and caſting off the whole fath of Chriſt. Now for the clearing up of their underſtanding in the point, their confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Doctrine and work of Chriſtianity; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth beſeech them, <hi>as brethren;</hi> yea adjure them by the comming of Chriſt, and their appearance before him to receive rewards of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they would not be ſhaken in their minds, or troubled at the Doctrine broach'd amongſt them, what plauſible pretences ſoever they had for it; though they pretended the [ſpirt] for many falſe ſpirits are gone out into the World, whereof this is one; though they pretend the [Word] <hi>i. e.</hi> that we have imparted this Doctrine privately to them by word of mouth, as if it were an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical tradition; No nor yet though they ſhew you [a letter] for it, as from us; believe it not, tis a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Thus the Apoſtle plucks up every foundation-ſtone thoſe falſe teachers could poſſibly buid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Spirit, Word, Epiſtle;</hi> though they offer to confirm their Doctrine by any or all theſe wayes or teſtimonies: yet be not deceived by any wile, by any means, <hi>be not moved or troubled at it,</hi> 'tis all falſe.

                  <p>Well then, without any more ado, the point I hold forth, and undertake (by Gods aſſiſtance) to make good to you, is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Popes of Rome are the revealed man of ſin, the [now] well known Antichriſt, of Whom Daniel, Paul, and the Apoſtle John, have ſpoken ſuch vile and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things: I ſay in all they have ſaid of the great</hi> Antichriſt, <hi>they have pointed the ſinger at the Popes of</hi> Rome.</p>
                  <p>To make this good, firſt, thus, <hi>Daniel</hi> in Chap. 7. ver. 2. <hi>ſaw the four windes of heaven ſtrive upon the great Sea. i. e.</hi> great commotions in the States
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169713:10"/>of the World, out of which there came four great beaſts, the firſt like a <hi>Lion,</hi> ſhadowing forth the <hi>Babyloniſh Monarchy</hi> with its Pride and Violence; the ſecond like a <hi>Bear,</hi> of a churliſh and ravenous diſpoſition; ſuch a one was the <hi>Perſian Monarchy;</hi> the third like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> having upon his back four wings, very ſubtle, and very ſwift upon the prey; ſuch was the <hi>Grecian Monarchy</hi> ſet up by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, but he ſaw a fourth exceeding ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dreadful, having Iron teeth, and it devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and brake in pieces, and ſtamped the reſidue with his feet, and 'twas diverſe from all the reſt, and had ten hons upon his head. Who theſe beaſts were, you have the Angels interpretation, Dan. 7 17. <hi>Theſe great beaſts Which are four, are four Kings Which ſhall ariſe out of the Earth:</hi> but ſo monſtrous was the fourth, that <hi>Daniel</hi> would needs know the truth of him; the Angel ſpeaks to that ver. 22. and 24. <hi>The fourth beaſt ſhall be a fourth Kingdom upon Earth, which ſhall be diverſe from all Kingdoms, and ſhall devour the whole Earth, and ſhall tread it down, and break it in peices; and the ten horns out of this Kingdom, are ten Kings that ſhall ariſe, and another ſhall ariſe, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis well known, that the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> hath been the fourth great Kingdom of the World, then in its greatneſs and glory of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when Saint <hi>John</hi> writ his <hi>Revelation,</hi> who will tell you yet more of this beaſt and buſineſs. Rev. 17.3. <hi>I ſaw a woman ſit upon a ſcarlet-coloured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169713:10"/>beaſt, having ſeven heads and ten horns.</hi> ver. 9 <hi>[the ſeven heads are ſeven Mountains]</hi> the <hi>Palatine, Capitoline, Aventine, Eſquiline, Quirinal, Vimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and <hi>Janicular,</hi> Mountains, upon which <hi>Rome</hi> in its greatneſs ſtood. And the ſeven heads are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded alſo to be ſeven Kings, ver. 10. <hi>There are ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a ſhort ſpace. [Seven Kings] i. e.</hi> ſeven Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Kings or forms of governments in <hi>Rome,</hi> which made good the ſaying of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the laſt beaſt was diverſe from all the reſt; Now ſaies St. <hi>John [five are already fallen] Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemvirs, Dictators,</hi> theſe five were all fallen and gone in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, <hi>[one is] viz,</hi> government by Emperors, which made up the ſixt head of the beaſt, <hi>[The other is not yet come]</hi> he doth not ſay, the ſeventh, but the other, (as one hath very well obſerved) pointing doubtleſs at the Chriſtian Emperors, who did not differ from the Heathen Emperors, as a diſtinct form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but onely in the quality of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the one perſecuting, deſtroying, Chriſtianity, the other protecting, advancing, Chriſtianity <hi>[and when he comes he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace]</hi> for the Chriſtian Emperors did not reign in their full ſtrength and greatneſs above ſeventy or eighty years, as <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> make it evident. It follows, ver. 11. <hi>And the beaſt that was, and is not, even he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169713:11"/>is the eighth, and is of the ſeven. [The beaſt that was,]</hi> The Papacy was in reſpect of the body of the Empire, but [is not] in reſpect of any preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it was not in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> time; <hi>[Even he is the eighth]</hi> if you reckon the Chriſtian Emperors for one; but in that you ought not ſo to reckon <hi>[He is indeed of the ſeven]</hi> or one of the ſeven; for there have not been eight but ſeven forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernmnt at <hi>Rome,</hi> the laſt whereof is called the <hi>beaſt</hi> by way of eminency, the <hi>great whore,</hi> the <hi>falſe Prophet, Antichriſt</hi> himſelf. So then, find out the laſt head to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and you may ſay of him, this is [<hi>the man of ſin the great</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.] Now who is he? why, lets reckon again, the <hi>Kings</hi> had their time of Governing, that's one; the <hi>Conſulls</hi> theirs, that's two; <hi>Tribunes</hi> theirs, that's three; <hi>Decemvirs</hi> theirs, that's four; <hi>Dictators</hi> theirs, that's five; <hi>Emperors</hi> theirs, that's ſix. All theſe are fallen and gone; and if I ſhould put the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Congregation, who is the ſeventh head of that beaſt, or who ſince <hi>Emperors,</hi> have Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Rome,</hi> I am perſwaded the moſt ignorant man or woman could tell me, they are Popes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> and the <hi>great Antichriſt.</hi> And with this agrees that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> a little after my text, 2 Theſ. 2.6.7.8. <hi>Ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. For the myſtery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, till he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169713:11"/>be taken out of the way. And then ſhall that wicked be revealed.</hi> That the <hi>Papacy</hi> was working in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time, is evident, if you ſearch Scriptures what errors were then taught, and what Doctrines the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth now teach; <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Limbs and Joynts were then a framing, a knitting; the Pope was then a young <hi>Embrio,</hi> and was ſtill grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the womb, but could not break forth till the <hi>Emperors</hi> had made way for him, by removing from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeating themſelves at <hi>Bizantium,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople. Tertullian, Hierom, Chryſoſtom,</hi> and the more judicious of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> have ſtill thus expounded this place. When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had endowed Churchmen with indeed too much temporal greatneſs, eſpecially the <hi>Bishops of Rome,</hi> they then began every day to look more and more like Popes, <hi>i. e.</hi> like the <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> and play <hi>Rex,</hi> which you know they could not do while the <hi>Emperors</hi> ſeat was at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Imperial preſence and greatneſs withheld them; but when the hand of Providence took them out of the way, then they became Popes, and manifeſted themſelves to be the ſeventh diſtinct <hi>Roman</hi> Government, the laſt head of that beaſt. Thus you ſee how both Saint <hi>John</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were guided by one Spirit, when they deſcribe <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to point the finger at the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Take it thus. <hi>He that ſucceeds the Emperors in the Government of the</hi> Roman <hi>State,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169713:12"/>or he that is ſeventh head of Daniels fourth beaſt, he is the great Antichriſt: but the Popes of Rome ſucceed the Emperors in the Government of the</hi> Roman <hi>ſtate, or they are the ſeventh head of the fourth great beaſt; therefore the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>are the great</hi> Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is the man that ſets himſelf above all Rule, and all authority. 2. Theſ. 2.8. <hi>then ſhall the wicked be revealed;</hi> thats our tranſlation, but the Greek is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>the lawleſs man.</hi> v. 4. <hi>Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> How muſt men forfeit their Intellectuals to faſten all this anywhere but upon the popes? For firſt they are Church-men, their ſeat is in the Temple, or reputed Church of God. The great <hi>Turk,</hi> let his pride and domination be what it will, yet he ſits not in the Temple, he's no Church-man, but the Pope is. Secondly he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>the Lawleſs man. PopeGratian</hi> in his decrees, reckons up ſeveral Laws, publike, private Laws, the Laws of Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, written and unwritten Laws, civil and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, the Laws both of God and man; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all he makes, is this, that they are all ſubject to the Popes interpretation and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and that he is the ſpiritual man <hi>who judgeth all things, and himſelf is judged of none.</hi> He allows ſuch marriages as God hath forbidden; You all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169713:12"/>know he allowed <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England</hi> to have his brother <hi>Arthurs</hi> wife, which God expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbids, Levit. 18.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not uncover the nakedneſs of thy brothers wife.</hi> And when the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of it was diſcovered, he would not untye the knot, or allow a divorce (though it got him nothing) and ſo juſtified the ſin of uncleanneſs, and the trangreſſion of Gods Law. He abſolves people from the Laws of obedience to the Powers that God hath ſet over them, contrary to that, <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the [High powers]</hi> ſo the Greeks, or <hi>the Powers that are ſet up on high,</hi> Rom. 13 To kill a Proteſtant, is no murther; to blow up a Parliament, is meritorious; nay though he carry <hi>plures animarum currus ad tartara.</hi> none may ſay unto him <hi>cur ita facis?</hi> Thus he puts all Rule and Law under his feet. Thirdly, <hi>He appoſeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelf above all that is called God,</hi> or is <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,</hi> meaning all civil Powers and Rulers of this World; the beaſt hath lift up his paw at them all; yea and fetched them under too. Rev. 17.12.13. <hi>The ten horns are ten Kings, thoſe have one mind, and give their power and ſtrength to the beaſt i. e.</hi> he had conquered them, and they yeilded themſelves his ſlaves; their power, their ſtrength, their all ſhould be at his ſervice, vigorouſly to promote his deſigns. <hi>Bellarm,</hi> in his fifth Book <hi>de Rom. Pontif.</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>Omnes Imperatores Pontifici Romano debent ſuum imperium,</hi> all Kings and Emperors owe their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169713:13"/>Crowns and Scepters to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> And hereupon the Pope ſtiles himſelf <hi>Rex Regum, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Dominantium,</hi> King of Kings, Lord of Lords; and 'tis not bare words; but he acts accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in depoſing Kings, and giving away their Kingdoms. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third depoſed King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and gave this Land to <hi>Philip Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> but at laſt he abſolved him, upon condition he would hold his Kingdom in Fee of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he ſhould pay yearly a thouſand Marks of ſilver in token of his ſubjection. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth gave the Weſt <hi>Indies</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and ſet them their Limits. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth pronounced the ſentence of degradation and depoſition againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The Monks whipt <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond of <hi>England,</hi> upon the death of <hi>Becket,</hi> and when he ſpoke ſome angry words to them, <hi>Domine</hi> (ſay they) <hi>noli mirarii; nos enim nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las minas timemus, qui de tali curia ſumus quae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuevit imperare Regibus &amp; Imperatoribus;</hi> never threaten us, we fear no threats, we are of ſuch a Court as ruleth our kings and Emperors. I think I could have furniſhed you with a hundred ſtories of like nature. Fourthly, <hi>he ſits in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. Non ait dicens, ſed oſtendens</hi> (ſays one.) <hi>hoc eſt, operibus, ſignis &amp; miraculis nitens oſtendere quod ſit Deus;</hi> He doth not ſay it in words at length, that he's God; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169713:13"/>his carriage, and the prerogatives Royal he claims, are ſuch, as if he were God himſelf. This they ſtick not to ſpeak out, <hi>idem eſt dominium Dei &amp; Papae,</hi> the Rule of God and the Pope are the ſame, <hi>&amp; Jus eccleſiaſticum eſt jus divinum,</hi> their eccleſiaſtical Law is Divine, and muſt bind the conſcience as well as any Laws of God: Hereupon one expounds it (meethinks) very well, <hi>in templo conſcientiarum,</hi> he ſits in the Temple of mens conſciences. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives ſin as God doth, he makes Articles of faith as God doth, he takes to himſelf the Names and Titles that God doth; the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> ſtiles him <hi>[tu es alter Deus in terris]</hi> another God upon Earth, <hi>[Dominus Deus noſter para,]</hi> our Lord God the Pope; he takes Divine worſhip to himſelf as God doth; they bow before him, and kiſs his feet, which an Angel of heaven would not receive of <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 22. <hi>ſee you do it not, Worſhip God;</hi> Nay he takes upon him to do that which God will not do, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with Laws moral and natural, (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to give Indulgences to ſin for time to come; there have been Leaſes granted for years.

                     <hi>ſeſe gerat, quam juſtitiae ſuae ordinem overtere, &amp; ſeipſum negare,</hi> God can as ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his order and courſe of Juſtice yea deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as give men Indulgences to tranſgreſs his Laws, to walk diſorderly; but the Pope hath not ſo bound his own hands; he can be <hi>Dominus Deus,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:169713:14"/>and yet (upon good conſideration and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages) indulge men to violate any or all the laws of God and Nature; He takes upon him to deliver ſouls out of Purgatory, to Canonize Saints at his pleaſure; ſo that what is ſaid of God, is ſaid of the Pope, and more alſo. Take the ſumm of all thus; <hi>He who is the great Churchman, above all Law, and above all Earthly power, and who carries himſelf as if he were God, he is the man of ſin, the great</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; <hi>but the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>are ſeated in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have ſubjected all rule and Authority to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and behave themſelves as if they were God; therefore the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>are the man of ſin, the great</hi> Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Antichriſts <hi>Name is written in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> Rev. 17.5. <hi>[Myſtery] Brocard</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> doth avouch it, that the word <hi>[Myſtery]</hi> is written in the Popes <hi>Mitre;</hi> and many others who have been at <hi>Rome,</hi> do profeſs to have ſeen it, as Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> the late keeper of the Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> will further ſatisfie any man in his Dedicatory Epiſtle to his Treatiſe of the corruption of the Scriptures. What myſtery 'tis that is written upon his forehead. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tell you 2 Theſ. 2.7 <hi>[My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity:]</hi> As the Doctrine of the Goſpel is a Myſtery of Godlineſs, ſo the Papacy is nothing elſe but a Myſtery of iniquity. The Pope pretends to be more for Chriſt then any man in the World, Chriſts Vicar, Chriſts Vicegerent, the viſible head
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169713:14"/>of Chriſts Church, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, to feed the flock of Chriſt, and ſtill he hath Chriſt in his mouth, and who but Chriſt with him? I tell you he pretends to be more for Chriſt then any man alive; but let me tell you withall that there is no man alive ſo much againſt Chriſt as he is; and therefore moſt properly called <hi>[Antichriſt]</hi> which ſignifies both <hi>[for]</hi> and <hi>[againſt]</hi> Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Grace for Grace.</hi> The <hi>great Antichriſt</hi> is one that is pretendedly for Chriſt, but is really againſt Chriſt; which cannot be affirmed of the great <hi>Turk,</hi> or of any other beſide the Pope; but of him it may moſt clearly. That he bears the World in hand, he is Chriſt greateſt friend, I need not prove; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we will all take that for granted; but let me ſhew you how in truth he is Chriſts greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in all points. <hi>One mediator between God and man the man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> 1 Time 2.5. There are other Mediators, ſays the Pope, both for ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and interceſſion; for ſatisfaction, <hi>the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifice of the Maſs, the blood of</hi> Thomas, <hi>the merits of the Church;</hi> for interceſſion; the <hi>Virgin Mary, Saints and Angels are</hi> interceſſors to God (even as to our particular neceſſities) for us, there's but one ſays Chriſt; there are more ſays the Pope. Chriſt alone is <hi>Prophet</hi> of his Church, to be heard in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay. Act. 3. and for this end he opened the ſealed book, <hi>bids
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169713:15"/>every one of his, ſearch the Scriptures, grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, walk in the light of Goſpel-truth:</hi> the Pope expreſly contradicts this, and tells you that the Doctrine Chriſt hath left in the Scriptures, is not ſufficient without his daily ſupplements of unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions, which are of equal Authority with the word of Chriſt, and muſt be beleeved upon pain of damnation. Of the written word, what he pleaſeth he makes authentique; what he pleaſes he cancels; he teaches and interprets all by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible unerring Spirit; He hath ſealed up the book or Bible which Chriſt opened to them, forbidding the people the uſe of Scriptures; Latine Scriptures, Latine Service, all muſt be to them in an unknown tongue; he tells them that ignorance is the mother of devotion; and to believe as the Church believes is knowledge and faith enough. Chriſt hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden all kinde of pictures and Images in the Worſhip of God, Deut. 4.15.16. <hi>Take good heed unto your ſelves (for ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude in the day the Lord ſpake unto you in</hi> Horeb) <hi>leſt ye corrupt your ſelves, and make a graven Image, &amp;c.</hi> John 4.23. <hi>The true worſhippers worſhip the Father in Spirit and in truth; the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him:</hi> No ſays the Pope, you ſhall make Images of the Trinity, and pictures of the Croſs, and ſhall kiſs and worſhip them with the worſhip of <gap reason="foreign">

Chriſt hath taught us <hi>that our own righteouſneſs is as menſtruous rags; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our beſt performances we are unprofitable ſevants; that we are juſtified by faith without the works of the Law;</hi> Tis not ſo, ſays the Pope, good Works are meritorious: there is a merit of congruity in them before converſion, and a merit of condignity in them after converſion; nay that ſome men do works of ſupererogation, more then the Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or is their duty to do, whereby they are not onely juſtified themſelves, but the <hi>overplus</hi> of their merits helps to juſtifie others. Chriſt ſaith, he will have the Sacrament of the Supper adminiſtred in both kinds. 1 Cor. 11 23. to 27. <hi>I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you, that the Lord Ieſus the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and ſayd, take, eat, this is my body; after the ſame manner he took the cup, ſaying, this cup is the new Teſtament in my blood; this do ye as oftenas ye eat this bread and drink this cup, &amp;c.</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi> received of Jeſus Chriſt, delivered it in charge to all and every of the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> both what and how they were to receive: It ſhall not be ſo ſays the Pope: the Prieſt ſhall receive in both kinds: the People ſhall have nothing but the bread. Chriſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169713:16"/>teaches <hi>that marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled.</hi> Heb. 13. No ſays the Pope, 'tis not honorable in the Clergy (ſo they call them) tis not lawful for a Prieſt to marry. Chriſt ſays, <hi>Let no man judge you in reſpect of meats, or drinks, or an holy day</hi> Col. 2. <hi>You are now freed from the obſervation of daies and meats; every creature of God is good if it be received with thanksgiving;</hi> No ſays the Pope, ye ſhall obſerve Saints daies; and for meats, touch not, taſte not any fleſh on ſuch and ſuch dayes and weeks of Lent. But to what end ſhould I thus go on? I profeſs I can hardly name one Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, but the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have thwarted it, either directly or indirectly, and quite ſubverted it. The Pope may ſee himſelf in thoſe old Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, the <hi>Antitactae,</hi> as in a glaſs, who held it reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to contradict the Laws of their Maker, and inſtead of Gods Laws, brought in their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fooleries. Take it thus. <hi>He on whom ſuch a myſtery of iniquity is found as to pretend to be wholy for Chriſt, and yet in every thing croſſes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes Chriſt, he is the man of ſin, the true and great</hi> Antichriſt; <hi>but upon the Pope is this myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity found, to pretend to be wholy for Chriſt, and yet in every thing he croſſeth and oppoſeth Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope is the man of ſin, the true and great</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Saint John Rev. 13. having deſcribed the <hi>Roman State</hi> under ſix of its heads or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169713:16"/>ver. 11. he brings forth the laſt head <hi>viz. Antichriſt</hi> (that beaſt) by himſelf: of him he ſaith <hi>[He had two horns like a Lamb, ſpake like a Dragon, and exerciſed the power of the firſt beafi that was before him.]</hi> How this Deſcription agrees to the Pope, you ſhall ſee. 1. <hi>He hath two horns like a Lamb;</hi> two horns in his <hi>Miter,</hi> two Keys in his hand, a twofold Power, Sacred and Secular, Spiritual and Temporal, as being both King and Prieſt of the Church. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth in the year one thouſand three hundred, who inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the firſt <hi>Iubile,</hi> came out one day in his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical habit; the next day in his Robes imperial having two ſwords carried before him, he cauſed the Herald to cry, <hi>Ecce duo glady,</hi> behold two Swords; he might as well have cauſed him to have cried, <hi>Ecce duo cornua Antichriſti,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the two horns of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Secondly, as like a Lamb as he looks, yet he hath the Dragons tongue in his mouth, <hi>he ſpeaks like a Dragon i. e.</hi> like a raging Devil, ſwelling words of great terror, Rev. 13.5. <hi>There was given unto him a mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great things and blaſphemies.</hi> He. ſpeaks on this wiſe, <hi>whoſoever will not worſhip the beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in their hand or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, they ſhall not buy nor ſell, they ſhall be killed;</hi> he will ſhut heaven againſt them, and paſs ſentence of Damnation upon them, they ſhall go to Hell. That furious Dragon, the Devil, ſpeaks nothing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169713:17"/>but terror to Saints; hath the Pope a good word for any that do truly fear God? He calls them Heretiques, he thunders out his Bulls and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications againſt them; he ſpeaks nothing but Inquiſitions, Blood, Death, Hell unto them. Truly the Pope ſpeaks as like the Dragon, as if he had been ſpate out of his mouth. John 12. ult. Our Saviour ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Whatſoever I ſpeak, even as the Father ſaid unto me ſo I ſpeak:</hi> the Pope may take up the words thus, <hi>Whatſoever I ſpeak, even as the Dragon ſayd unto me ſo I ſpeak.</hi> Thirdly, He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth all the Power of the firſt beaſt that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Look what Power was in the hands of any or all the <hi>Roman Governors, Kings, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemvirs, Dictators, Emperours,</hi> the Pope hath got it all to himſelf, and hereupon is called the Image of the firſt Beaſt. He hath brought Kingdoms and People under him as the former did; Rules over them with as much Pride and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny as the former did; hath ſuppreſſed the preaching of the Goſpel as much as ever they did; is as great a hater, perſecutor, ſhedder of the blood of Saints as ever any or all of them were; Lives in as great ſenſuality, pompous glory, as any did that were before him. So then, <hi>He who hath two horns like a Lamb ſpeaks like the Dragon, and exerciſeth the Power of the firſt beaſt, he is the great</hi> Antichriſt: <hi>but the Pope hath two horns like a Lamb, ſpeaks like the Dragon, and exerciſeth the Power of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169713:17"/>firſt beaſt; therefore the Pope is the great</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall comfirm his Doctrine, Laws, Kingdom, by Miracles, Rev. 13.13, 14. <hi>He doth great Wonders, ſo that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the Earth in the ſight of men; And deceiveth all them that dwell upon the earth by means of the Miracles which he had power to do in the ſight of the beaſt, &amp;c.</hi> This none in the World attempts to do beſide the Pope. Heb. 2.3, 4. Chriſt did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirm that Doctrine, Goſpel, Kingdom he ſet up, <hi>by Signs, Wonders, and divers Miracles</hi> ſo that <hi>Auſtin</hi> long ſince ſaid, <hi>If any man looked for Miracles, he himſelf was a Miracle.</hi> And therefore tis evident, the Pope hath another Doctrine, Goſpel, Kingdom to eſtabliſh and advance in the World; that to perſwade men to receive and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, he muſt be put to the working of new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; Miracles are ſo in eſteem with them, that they are made a mark of the true Church; and ours is a falſe Church, becauſe we can work no Miracles, whereas indeed our Saviour makes them a note of falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, Mark 13.22. <hi>Falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets ſhall riſe, and ſhew ſigns and wonders to ſeduce, if it were poſſible, even the Elect;</hi> The Pope hath come as near ſeducing the Elect as any man did that ever lived. And Saint <hi>John</hi> here makes them a mark of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his Church, ſo alſo doth <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.8, 9. <hi>Then ſhall that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169713:18"/>wicked be revealed; even he whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power and ſigns, and lying wonders.</hi> In <hi>Gregory</hi> the great his time, when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was near to be revealed, Miracles of all ſorts began to be multiplied; there were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions for confirmation of purgatory, praying to Saints, praying for the dead. I have read many ſtories of their Miracles, which here I will not trouble you with; they'l ſerve well for winter-tales; Onely this one word, tis ſayed of Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (called <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh) <hi>that he would as oft as he pleaſed, ſhake fire out of his Gown ſleevs,</hi> to the great terror and aſtoniſhment of the People. Their own Hiſtorians tell us, that above twenty of their Popes have been abominable <hi>Nigromancers,</hi> who by their ſorceries and diveliſh wonders have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the World, ſo gaining credit to their way. But it may be ſome will ask me, what ſhall we think of the many and great Miracles that are amongſt them? I'le tell you, Thoſe Miracles Papiſts ſay they now do, are done with the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt parts of the world; for my part, I am reſolved I will not go to diſprove them; I believe the moſt of them are meer fained lyes: or elſe they are but <hi>mira,</hi> not <hi>miracula,</hi> as applying <hi>activa paſſivis</hi> may produce very wonderful effects: ſometimes the ſenſes of men are bemiſted add deceived as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs</hi> Magicians did their Spectators: Many times the fancy is deluded, they perſwade ſome People
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169713:18"/>they are poſſeſſed, and then perſwade them they are diſpoſſeſſed: but they do it by Holy-water, Croſſes, Exorciſme, not by the Power of the word as Chriſt did; and Chriſt did caſt out divels by day-light, before many witneſſes, yea his very Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but Prieſts caſt them out cloſely in their chambers, in the night, and will have no ſpectators but ſuch as are their ſworn friends. Our Saviour did other Miracles, <hi>He gave legs to the lame, eyes to the blind, he raiſed the dead to life,</hi> but theſe can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but only this about devils; therefore I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there is ſome groſs deluſion or other in it. But well, <hi>gloria Miraculorum</hi> is their badge; and tis moſt evident, if Saint <hi>John</hi> may be believed, tis a mark of Antichriſt and his Church: Take it thus. <hi>He that ſince the Apoſtles and firſt primitive-Chriſtian times will confirm his Doctrine, and ſet up his Kingdom by Miracles, is the great</hi> Antichriſt: <hi>But the Pope (and none in the World elſe) ſince thoſe times, confirms his Doctrines, and ſets up his Kingdom by Miracles; therefore the Pope is the great</hi> Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Sitxhly, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall challenge to himſelf a Power over all Nations and Churches upon the face of the Earth, in reference to Chriſt, as being his Vicegerent, Rev. 13.7. <hi>Power was given him over all Kinreds, Tongues, and Nations,</hi> ver. 16.17. <hi>He cauſeth all, both great and ſmall, rich and poor, bond and free, to receive his mark, and that no man
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169713:19"/>might buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark, &amp;c.</hi> This Power the Pope aſſumes to himſelf, and hath had it; for no man in the World layes claim to it but he; though the great Turk lays claim to all, yet not in reference to Chriſt, as his Deputy; but the Pope doth. It is <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> to challenge Power over the faith and conſcience of one man or Church; tis more <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> to challenge Power over many Churches, as Biſhops do; tis a further degree of Antichriſtianiſm to claim a Power over whole Provinces, as Arch-Biſhops do; tis yet more, to Lord it over the faith of many Provinces and Kingdoms, as Patriarks do; but to challenge ſuch Soveraignty over all the Churches in the world as the Pope doth thats the great <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm.</hi> And (as one wittily ſaith) leſt he ſhould wrong himſelf by too modeſt a claim (for you muſt know he's a modeſt ſoul) he doth not onely challenge a Power over all this world, but in Heaven &amp; Hell alſo where ever Chriſt hath power, yea and even in Purgatory too, where Chriſt hath no Power. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>book of Martyrs</hi> records Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth his Bull againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> where he charges all Patriarks, Metropolitans, Primates, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and all other Eccleſiaſtical Orders downwards, even to the begging Friers: and then all Kings, Electors of the Empire, Princes, Dukes, and ſo on, and at laſt all men throughout the univerſal World upon pain of the great excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169713:19"/>that they do not embrace <hi>Luthers</hi> Doctrine, adhere to, or favor his perſon. Judge you now, if this Language be not the very ſame with that of the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> Rev. 13. And let me tell you, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have exerciſed this ſupremacie for many hundred years. Before I cloſe this in hand; let me in a word anſwer a quaere or two the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſtill putting to us: <hi>Where was your Doctrine, and where was your Church before</hi> Luther? Why, as for our Doctrine, my Anſwer's thus, It was where theirs never was, in the Scriptures. And as for our Church, <hi>where that was,</hi> my Anſwer runs thus. I. Our Proteſtant-Divines have abundantly cleared it to them, that in all Ages there were ſome (they have named the men, and the junctures of time in which they lived) that oppoſed Pope and Popery. Secondly, if we had none before <hi>Luther,</hi> how came they to have ſo much work for their Inquiſitions before <hi>Luther,</hi> for their Armies againſt the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> five hundred years ago? and how came <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his fellow Biſhops in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth of <hi>England,</hi> to condemn and execute ſo many of the followers of <hi>Wickliff;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, that gallant and famous Saint, Sir <hi>Iohn Old-Caſtle.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange there were none of our Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> when there were (its well enough known) ſo many in every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169713:20"/>apprehended and executed for oppoſing the Pope, for denying and rejecting popiſh Doctrine and worſhip. Surely all they may very well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned of our Religion; for they would die before-they would be of theirs. Thirdly If by this they mean, <hi>where was your Church viſible,</hi> tis a Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence quaere; for Rev. 11.2. <hi>the holy City</hi> (meaning the viſible Church of Chriſt) <hi>ſhall they tread under foot forty two Moneths i. e.</hi> all the time of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;</hi> and Rev. 13. <hi>He had Power given him over all People. Nations, and Languages, and all the World wondred after the beaſt.</hi> Twas an impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and inconſiſtent with Gods eternal counſel and decree, that we ſhould have a viſible Church during the [height] of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> reign. It is enough for us that there have been two witneſſes in every age Propheſying in ſackloth againſt him, ſome few haters &amp; oppoſers of him, (very cloſely and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you might hear of two or three Heretiques in a Kingdom or in a County; but perhaps you ſhould not know, many times, where to find one of them, the Beaſt had ſo got all the World under his paws) Take it in this Syllogiſme. <hi>He that uſurps Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the faith and conſcience of all the Kingdoms and Churches in the World, he is the great</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; <hi>but this the Pope hath done, and doth do at this day (at leaſt preſumptively and intentionally; he'l tell you, 'tis his right,) therefore the Pope is the great</hi> Antichriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:169713:20"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Holy Ghoſt hath (upon the matter) named him to us. Rev. 13. and laſt verſe, <hi>Here is wiſdom, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt; for it is the number of a man, and his number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi> As if the ſpirit of God had ſayd, 'tis not over difficult to find out his name, ſeing tis the number of a man, a number that a man may find out or reckon: Then he commends the finding of it out for a ſpecial piece of wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſo every one might be encouraged to ſet himſelf to work, it being natural unto men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be accounted wiſe. In the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Romagnoſh Romanus,</hi> a Roman, the numeral letters make up ſix hundred ſixty ſix. In the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>(the man that uſeth the Latine tongue ſo much.) the numeral letters make up ſix hundred ſixty ſix. You know no expreſſion pleaſeth but this, <hi>eccleſia catholica [Romana,]</hi> and the Latine Tongue, Latine Bible, Latine Service, all muſt be in Latine; out of this number (ſays Saint <hi>John</hi> in effect) find out his name that is ſo much for the Latine. In the Latine tongue, this <hi>[Generalis dei Vicarus in terris]</hi> makes up ſix hundred ſixty ſix. And to give him not onely the name he deſires, but the name he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, In our Engliſh [The Pope by ſuperioritie is the divels Leiftenant] the numeral letters hereof make up ſix hundred ſixty ſix. This number may be found in ſuch names and terms as do rightly ſet him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169713:21"/>out in diverſe Langaages. But the Jeſuites object, that this number may be found in many other names: We ſhall eaſily grant it may, without weakning what hath been delivered: for they can bring no other name to whom all the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> do agree. The Holy Ghoſt doth not ſend us here barely to find out a name, but ſuch a name out of them as will graſp in all the other deſcriptions of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſuch a name as ſutes to all that is ſaid of him in the <hi>Rev.</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; ſuch a name as will hold forth [the man that ſucceeds the Emperors in the Government of the Roman State, or that is the ſeventh head of <hi>Daniels fourth beaſt; that ſits in the temple of God,</hi> as the great Church man, Lording it over the Faith and Conſciences of all men in the world; and <hi>(in ordine ad ſpiritualia)</hi> ſubjecteth all civil rule and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to himſelf; that highly pretends to be for Chriſt, and yet in every thing croſſeth and contradicteth Chriſt; <hi>That looks like a Lamb, ſpeaks like a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and exerciſeth the Power of the firſt beaſt,</hi> viz. <hi>King, Conſuls, &amp;c.</hi>] When we put them to find a name out of this number, that points out a man to whom all theſe particulars do agree, they are at a ſtand, they cannot give us one, though their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and their All lie upon it. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; <hi>That that name whereto all the deſcriptions of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>do agree, is that Saint</hi> John <hi>bids us here ſeek after, and is the name of the great</hi> Antichriſt;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169713:21"/>
                     <hi>but the names before given (pointing out the Pope) are ſuch, as in every one of them all the deſcriptions of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>do meet and concentrate; therefore this is the name; and conſequently the Pope is the [man of ſin,] the [great</hi> Antichriſt.] Thus you have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venfold-ſcripturall demonſtration of the point. It's good to make ſure-work, when we have to do with ſo unruly a beaſt.</p>
                  <p>But why did not the Holy-Ghoſt ſpeak expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who it was? might not he as eaſily have ſaid, the [Popes of <hi>Rome</hi>] are <hi>[the man of ſin,]</hi> the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as expreſſed it thus darkly, and left it ſo liable to doubt and controverſie?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Tis not for us to teach God how he ſhall ſpeak, but duty, when he hath ſpoken, to ſet our ſelves, with reverence, to ſpell out his mind; I might put you off with this. But yet think, I may with ſafety venture to give you ſome reaſons, why God carried it on thus, in the clouds and in the dark. I. 'Twas out of a tender reſpect he had to his People, the prevention of their utter ruine; for had he ſaid, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſtians, ſhould be Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> yea make <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors</hi> bow before them, nay be Maſters of the World; this (inhumane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) would have armed the <hi>Heathen Emperors</hi> (as one man) againſt the Chriſtians; and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans talked ſo much of a Kingdom, that they had ſome thoughts and jealouſies in their heads and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169713:22"/>hearts of them already; therefore certainly if Saint <hi>John</hi> had ſpoke out, their jealouſies had kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into a flame againſt them, that they would have ſet themſelves to have deſtroyed the name of [Chriſtian] from of the Earth, which was this way prevented. Secondly God would ſhew himſelf to be the God of ſecrets, and depths of wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove weak ſhallow man. This book of the [Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation] hath brought many great and learned men to let fall their plumes, the high thoughts of their own wiſdoms and ſufficiencies, hath ſet them a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, hath exerciſed their beſt Intellectuals, brought them upon their knees to God in prayer, that he would be pleaſed to give them a Revelation of the Revelation; the things he hath opened in this book, that he would open them more, and give them his own key; for none elſe can unlock the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet. How hath it ſet men of admiring, that if there be ſuch hardneſs, ſuch depths in Gods [Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,] what unſearchable ſecrets and depths of Myſteries are there in the heart and boſome of God himſelf infinitely above the reach of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of all Men and Angels? God loves to lay vain proud men low; he loves to bring them to the knowledge of themſelves; and tis a great mercy to us that he doth ſo. Thirdly, God ſent <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as the greateſt judgement on men that ever was in the World. Rev. 6.2. God there ſends forth Chriſt in his Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and others
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169713:22"/>
                     <hi>riding ſwiftly on the white horſe of the Goſpel,</hi> and you know how quickly they rid clean through the world, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.34. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18.) but the world did generally deſpiſe the Goſpel of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered to them. In the following verſes of that chapter God ſends out <hi>The red horſe of War, The black horſe of Famine, The pale horſe of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and his name that ſate upon him was Death, and Hell followed him,</hi> verſe the twelfth, <hi>There comes a great Earthquake,</hi> which (upon the ſame account) ſhakes down all the heathen Gods and Monarchies, brings <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great into the Throne, ſets up Chriſtianity in the World, and now <hi>(Regis ad Exemplum)</hi> every one turns Chriſtian; but yet the meer formality of name and notion ſerved their turn, the generality of men received the Chriſtian faith, but not in the love of it; they held the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs; and this (doubtleſs) angered God more then the Heathens open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Goſpel; whereupon God ſet himſelf to bring forth ſome greater judgements on the Chriſtian world then he had on the Heatheniſh, when firſt he had ſecured his own <hi>By ſealing the ſervants of God in the forehead</hi> Chap. 7. In the eighth Chapter <hi>the Trumpets ſound,</hi> whereby all Expoſitors agree, <hi>haereſes &amp; corruptelas verae Doctrinaepraeſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cari;</hi> In the four firſt, chiefly, Hereſies &amp; Corruptions of ſound Doctrine are preſignified, (Temporal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries not excluded) but tis ſomething hard, I find, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169713:23"/>aſſign the right hereſie, and who was the broacher, to every Trumpet. Chap. 9.1, 2. <hi>Tht fifth Angel ſounded, and I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven, and to him was given the key of the bottomleſs pit; And he opened the bottomleſs pit, and there aroſe ſmoak out of the pit, as the ſmoak of a great furnace, and the ſun, and the air were darkned by reaſon of the ſmoak of the pit.</hi> Here Hell breaks looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and now, in the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> was wrath come upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World to the uttermoſt; there were all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this one, 2 Theſ. 2.8. to 13. <hi>Then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whoſe comming is after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Satan, with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them that Periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſved; for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lye, that they [all might be damned,] &amp;c.</hi> Now if God had named the Perſon, and time of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> coming, there are ſuch fearful things ſpoken of him, that all the World would have ſet againſt him, and ſo God had croſſed the decree of Divine Juſtice: but being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thus darkly, the Pope hath been able to corrupt and deceive all the Nations of the Earth, whereby the determined wrath is come upon the ſouls and bodies of Hypocritical and ungodly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. This kinde of revealing of him was moſt ſutable &amp; ſerviceable to the great deſign God had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169713:23"/>upon the baſe, rotten Chriſtian World. Fourthly, The revelation of him in this Book and elſewhere, is ſufficiently clear to all the Elect who have ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to find out Antichriſt. As it fared with the Jews concerning Chriſt, Rom. 11.7. ſo alſo with the Gentiliſh Churches concerning <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> The election have obtained knowledge of him when the reſt are blinded, by their own wilfulneſs, by their ſelf intereſt; and God holds their eyes, (in a juſt judgement) that they ſhall not ſee and know him. Dan. 12.10. <hi>None of the wicked ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand;</hi> If the ſenſe of the Context be rightly drawn down, it ſpeaks to this preſent buſineſs concerning <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and bringing in the Kingdom of our Lord; the men of the world will be blinded to the laſt, but the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe do diſcern and judge of all things. Rev. 15. ult. <hi>The Temple was filled with ſmoak from the glory of God and from his Power; and no man was able to enter into the Temple till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi> This verſe will bear a double Interpretation; one of them is this; the Temple or Church of Chriſt (gained out of the hands of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>) hath the glorious preſence and Power of God abiding in it; for the ſmoak that filld the Tabernacle and Temple upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, had that ſignification, whereto the Holy-Ghoſt here alludes: God hath been powerfully and gloriouſly preſent amongſt his Saints ſince the Vials
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169713:24"/>began to be poured out. The other, (which I aim at) is This, the Temple or Church of Chriſt to the eye of the Antichriſtian Partie, (as a powerfull and juſt judgement of God upon them) is full of the ſmoak of Apoſtacie, ſmoak of Errors, Hereſies, the ſmoak of Schiſme, the ſmoak of Treaſon, the ſmoak of Rebellions: the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Popiſh Faction can ſee nothing of Righteouſneſs, Equity, Honeſty, in any or all thoſe wayes the Saints take againſt them; their Aſſemblies and Councels, their Doctrines and doings are the darkneſs and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of ſmoak unto them, and will be ſo yet a while; <hi>for none of them</hi> (ſays the text) <hi>can come into the Temple;</hi> To be true members of the Church of Chriſt, to own the Aſſemblies of the Saints in their worſhip and wayes, <hi>till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels be fulfilled:</hi> I ſay till then (ſuch a ſmoak is in their eyes) they will not be able to get any clear viſion of things, though there be the light of noon day to guide us in our work and way. The whore hath layed Kings, mighty men, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and all them (both great and ſmall) that dwell upon the Earth, (except two poor witneſſes, dead-drunk with the wine of the ſpiritual fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Rev. 14. Thoſe who are drunk with Hereſies, Errors, their own Inventions, and Opinions, can have no right underſtanding or diſcerning ſpirit in them, neither of themſelves nor of the great <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> nor of the true Church, nor of God in Chriſt;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169713:24"/>God in his works or worſhip; they know no body, they know nothing, but what their drunken fancy and ſtrong deluſions ſuggeſt to them. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is a myſtery, 2 Theſ. 2. Rev. 17. and do you wonder if Papiſts and carnal impenitent People, do not, or cannot underſtand myſteries? See but one text more, Hoſ. 14.9. <hi>Who is wiſe, and he ſhall underſtand theſe things? prudent, and he ſhall know them? for the wayes of the Lord are right, and the juſt ſhall walk in them; but the tranſgreſſors ſhall fall therein.</hi> This Scripture can hold truer in nothing then in this buſineſs between Chriſt and <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> wicked men are blinded in it; they ſtumble at it and fall, but the Saints of God being wiſe and prudent, they diſcern, they know, &amp; go on in the right wayes of the Lord. I am perſwaded there is no man in the World that hath the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt in him, that is a Saint indeed, but if he ſet himſelf to ſtudy this point, which Humility, Diligence, Faith, and Prayer, he ſhall be led into the very City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and there comparing predictions with the Popes actions, (for <hi>Paul</hi> had no other way mightily to convince the Jews, that that ſame Jeſus who was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered ſo ignominouſly under <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> was the very Chriſt, but by laying his birth in the circumſtances of it, his manner of Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, to the Propheſies that went before of him; and this did it) I ſay when he ſhall have taken a full veiw of things.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169713:25"/>there, comparing the Popes carriage with what <hi>Daniel, Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> have ſpoken of him, and ſee how fully they joyn and cloze one with another, he ſhall be forced to ſit down ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> are the great <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> and the oftner he reads this Chapter of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Theſſalonians, and Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Revelation, he ſhall wonder at the clearneſs of this truth ſhining and breaking in upon him more and more, and marvel that any who ever read Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> do not ſee it. Though God hath expreſſed things darkly in this point, yet clear enough to all the Elect; if the reſt be deceived and periſh, he matters it not; 'tis the Elect he intends, to Communicate ſecrets, Myſteries, and do good unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>that were once (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon confeſſion) ſuch good men, ſome of them even Martyrs for Chriſt; they were planted (as</hi> Jeremiahs <hi>expreſſion is) wholy a right ſeed; how were they turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange Vine, into the Vine of the Earth?</hi> Rev. 14.18. <hi>How came they to ſo much vilenes, as to make up the man of ſin, the great</hi> Antichriſt?</p>
                  <p>For ſatisfaction to this; 1. Thoſe of them that were truly good, righteous and holy perſons, doubtleſs their ſeed abode in them; ſo they lived and ſo they died; their Righteouſnes, Holineſs, Services, Sufferings went along with them. Secondly God hath not ſo annexed grace to any Function or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169713:25"/>Rank of man, not yet to any one place in the World, but in proceſs of time that Function may fail, that place baſely degenerate. Sure if God had En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed grace and goodneſs on any ſucceſſion of men, it was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and thoſe that followed in the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but how it was with them, may be known if you read 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 2.12. to the end of that Chapter. The Holy Ghoſt ſpake nothing bad, but all good of the Angel and Church of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> yet now tis the Synagogue and habitation of <hi>Turks</hi> and Devils. But a moſt ominous Prophetical Warning did <hi>Paul</hi> give the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Rom. 11.17. to 23. <hi>If ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild Olive-tree wert graffed in among them, and with them partakeſt of the Root and Fatneſs of the Olive-tree: Boaſt not againſt the Branches; if thou Boaſt, thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root thee. Thou wilt ſay then, the Branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in: Well, becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith; be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God; on them that fell ſeverity, but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs; otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> Are theſe Bugbears, windie Bladders? Can theſe words poſſibly import leſs then that God and Grace were not ſo made over to them, but time might produce a change both in Paſtors
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169713:26"/>and Church, from good to bad, from bad to worſe; and that if they did not walk humbly, and watch to the keeping of the Faith, they ſhould certainly be cut off. Thirdly, Together with <hi>Conſtantines</hi> large Endowments and Immunities, there aroſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Idleneſs, Errors, Images, Superſtitions, Pride, Affectation of outward greatneſs, eſpecially in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and thus ſhe forſook her firſt Love; and the ſpirit daily quenching, yea dying, in them, they knew no way to keep up, but by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting themſelves with a carnal and outward ſtrength. <hi>Socrates,</hi> in his ſeventh book and 11. Chapter, ſaith, <hi>Now began an ill name to ſtick on the Biſhops of Rome, who beyond their prieſtly bounds, have ſtept into principality.</hi> This was in the daies of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the yonger, ſcarce fourſcore years ſince their low poor condition, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> raiſed them from. The next remarkable thing we read of, was this; <hi>Philippicus</hi> &amp; <hi>Leo,</hi> with ſome other Emperors after them (not without the advice of Pratriarks and a whole Eaſtern Councel) threw Images out of Churches, as being decreed Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous: Whereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeizes the City and Territories about into his own hands, makes himſelf Lord thereof, which till then was Governed by a Greek Magiſtrate, abſolves all Italy of their Tribute and obedience due to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, upon this goodly occaſion. Then to bear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out in theſe pranks, he takes upon him by Pap<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:169713:26"/>ſentence to unthrone <hi>Chilpericus,</hi> gives the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to <hi>Pepin,</hi> and ſo made him his faſt friend and Champion; for by him he preſently got all <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and annexed it to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> as lawful prize to Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> I muſt not now ſtand to tell you, how, throughout the fift and ſixt hundred years after Chriſt, diverſe of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did openly contend for ſupremacy, but were ſuppreſt in ſeveral Councels, of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> Twas not long after when <hi>Phocas</hi> murthered his Maſter, the Emperor <hi>Mauritius,</hi> and then (ſays the Hiſtorian) <hi>Bonifacius obtinuit a Phoca, ut Rom. Eccleſia eſſet caput omnium Eccleſiarum. Pope Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> obtained of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be head of all Churches. From that time forward, that Antichriſtian Juriſdiction and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie grew ſtill more and more, till it became an overgrown Monſter, even to give Laws to all the Kingdoms and Churches in the World. Fourthly, It is ſaid Rev. 13.2. <hi>The Dragon gave him his Power, and Seat, and great Authority.</hi> The Pope hath the Keys of the bottomleſs pit (<hi>Rev</hi> 9) in his hands; the devil freely beſtowed them on him, and made him the great ſteward of his houſe; his heart reſts ſecurely in him. Fithly, God made them <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in that ſenſe which he's ſaid to harden <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart: <hi>They not receiving the truth in the Love of it, but holding the truth of God in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; for this cauſe God gave them up</hi> to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169713:27"/>what you have heard, to receive in and upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that recompence of their Errors and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was meet. Thus you have the cauſe of his Riſe, and Growth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But haply, ſome man will ſay to me, Is not the Pope Saint</hi> Peters <hi>ſucceſſor?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Anſwer's this. That he is the great <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> hath been (I think) ſufficiently cleared; then whether he is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, or no, I leave thee to judge. But for your clearer light in this point, what if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> were never Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> as for my part, I verily beleeve he was not. And becauſe here is the very foundation of their Papacie, give me leave to ſpeak to it: not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but I ſhall ſay enough to convince thee; there is no juſt Warrant to make it a point of thy Faith, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whatſoever <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Peters</hi> Journals (for he ſpeaks as punctually as if he had travelled with him from firſt to laſt) hath no ſolid ground to reſt the ſole of its foot upon at all. He ſays, in the fifth year of Chriſts paſſion, <hi>Peter</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and continued in that Biſhoprick ſeven years: Then he went to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſecond year of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, ibi<expan>
                           <am>

                  <p>But that ever <hi>Peter</hi> was ſeven years Reſident at <hi>Antioch,</hi> (for thats required in a fixed Biſhop)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169713:27"/>and twenty five at <hi>Rome,</hi> or moſt part of thoſe years in thoſe places, he brings not one text of Scripture to prove either; you have his bare word for it; but who'l take that for good proof in his own cauſe, I wonder. For the former of theſe, we read concerning the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and conſtituted it. Act. 11.19.20, 21, 22. ver. 25.26. We find alſo who were the chif Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Doctors of it, Act. 13.1. We do not find in all the Scripture that <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but in one place, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and that <hi>in tranſcurſu,</hi> he took it only in his way. Is here ſufficient ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> for ſeven years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? I have ſtood the more upon this, to ſhew you, that if upon ſuch ſlender grounds they have concluded him Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> for ſuch a ſpace of time; certainly they will catch at ſmall things to conſtitute him Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereby their own turn is ſo much ſerved: Search all the New-Teſtament from one end of it to another, and where ever you find <hi>Rome</hi> named, if you find men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Peters</hi> being there twenty five years, or ten years, or one year, or one day, then let me paſs for a lyar. Yea ſays <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> 'tis evident he was at <hi>Rome, Ex eo quod fuit in Babylone,</hi> in that he was at <hi>Babylon.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13.

                  <p n="1">1. Let God have the glory of his own truth out of his Enemies mouths. Rev. 17.4, 5. <hi>The woman was arrayed in Purple, and Scarlet colour, and decked with Gold, and Precious Stones, and Pearls, having a golden Cup in her hand &amp;c. And upon her forehead was written, Myſtery, Babylon the great, the mother of Harlots and the abominations of the whole Earth.</hi> All this then by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own confeſſion muſt be underſtood of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the great whore or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> is not to ſit at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (as he ſays in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; lyars had need of good memories) but at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>He muſt reign in Babylon; Bellarmine</hi> interprets, and ſais, that is at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though by <hi>[Babylon,]</hi> we muſt alway underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> doth in therefore follow that by <hi>[Babylon,]</hi> we muſt underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> in all other places of the New-Teſtament? becauſe <hi>John</hi> in his myſtical and typical viſions by <hi>[Babylon]</hi> points out <hi>Rome:</hi> muſt therefore <hi>Peter</hi> needs in the bare ſalutation of an Epiſtle, by <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> mean <hi>Rome?</hi> is there either Example or reaſon of ſpeaking myſtically, and by a figure in a meer Salutation?

                  <p>But briefly to give you my reaſons (beſide the

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> (we all know) was an a Apoſtle, and conſequently had an unlimited commiſſion in reſpect of place, (according to that Mat. 28. <hi>Go teach all Nations</hi>) and to be a Biſhop alſo fixed to one place, is not this <hi>(diminutio capitis)</hi> to fetch him a hole lower then Chriſt had ſet him? are not theſe <gap reason="foreign">

During the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> abode at <hi>Rome</hi> (how long twas in all we are not certain,) he wrote divers Epiſtles, but in none of them doth he ſpeak ought of <hi>Peters</hi> being there, but ſeems rather to hint the contraty, 2 Tim. 4.16, 17. <hi>At my firſt anſwer no man ſtood with mee, but all men forſook me; I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Lord ſtood with me, that by me the preaching might be <hi>[fully]</hi> known, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion.

                     <hi>[that by me the preaching might be fully known,]</hi> there having been nothing of Chriſt and his wayes known but what the brethren who were there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, ſet on foot. <hi>Paul</hi> made the Goſpel <hi>[fully]</hi> known to them; he revealed the whole Counſel of God to the Jews at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the ears of all the Gentiles alſo. Had <hi>Peter</hi> been fixed Biſhop there, ſurely <hi>Paul</hi> could not have carried this honor from him. <hi>Peter</hi> long before this would have, <hi>[fully]</hi> preached the Goſpel of the Kingdom to all, both Jews and Gentiles; the work had not been to do when <hi>Paul</hi> came. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.7. to 13. He there reckons up a few names, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> is none; <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are of the Circumciſion, and theſe</hi> [onely] <hi>are my fellow-workers unto the Kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.</hi> From <hi>Pauls</hi> firſt arrival there, to the time of writing this Epiſtle, <hi>Peter</hi> could not be at <hi>Rome;</hi> if he had, of a certainty he had made theſe lines falſe; for he could not but have been a chief fellow-worker with and comforter of <hi>Paul.</hi> Whence an argument may be drawn from the leſs to the greater (which is more then <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ab authoritate negative,)</hi> that if <hi>Paul</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inferior perſons, thoſe whoſe welfare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects twas of leſs concernment to ſpeak of at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; then much more would he have mentioned <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apoſtles, him to whoſe care and charge they were all chiefly committed (being made univerſal head of the Church) had he been
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169713:30"/>there at any of thoſe times that <hi>Paul</hi> writ either to, or from <hi>Rome;</hi> But he doth not once name him, neither in that Epiſtle he wrote to the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor yet in theſe he afterwards wrote from <hi>Rome</hi> to other Churches; therefore ſurely <hi>Peter</hi> was far from being fixed Biſhop there. And let me tell you, this hath more Authority and prevalency to determine my faith in the Point, then all that <hi>Papias,</hi> a ſuppoſitious <hi>Clemens,</hi> and <hi>Higiſippus,</hi> the firſt Authors of <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſcopacy there, have; men (tis well known) much given to unwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, deceiving and being deceived thereby (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,) which is manifeſt from that diſcord and contradiction in thoſe authors who do aſſert this, not onely to the Scriptures, but among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Peter</hi> to have been fixed Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> contradicts the voyce or concluſion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence in the eminent ſucceſs of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. Gal 27, 8. <hi>The Goſpel of uncircumciſion was committed to me</hi> (says <hi>Paul,) the Goſpel of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion unto</hi> Peter: <hi>For he that wrought effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in</hi> Peter <hi>to the Apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles.</hi> And when twas evident to them all, that God would work effectually &amp; mightily with <hi>Peters</hi> miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the good of the Circumciſion or People of the Jews: is it likely that <hi>Peter</hi> would or durſt ſo thwart the ſpirit and mind of God, as to fix his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169713:30"/>ſeat among the Gentile? were they not bound to lay forth themſelves beſt for the advantage of the Goſpel? yes doubtleſs; and therefore you may find them giving one another their hands and ſolemn Engagements that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhould be preachers to the Gentiles: hereupon ſays <hi>Paul</hi> Act. 19.21. <hi>After I have been at Jeruſalem, I muſt alſo ſee Rome:</hi> and God confirmed this concluſion of their, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.11. <hi>The Lord ſtood by him, and ſaid, be of good cheer, Paul; for as thou haſt teſtified of me in Ieruſalem, ſo muſt thou bear witneſs alſo at Rome:</hi> And at <hi>Rome</hi> you find him, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, had they taken the Riſe of their ſucceſſion from <hi>Paul,</hi> they had puzled us more then now they have; for <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Spirit ſpeaks expreſly, <hi>That he was not behind the very chief of the Apoſtles, ſpake with more tongues then they all, the care of all the Churches lay upon him:</hi> I ſay, had they made themſelves a Church, and claimed Supremacy from <hi>Paul,</hi> they had put us more to't: but God hath befooled them in their Counſels; they lay claim to all from <hi>Peters</hi> fixed Epiſcopacie there, contrary to the mind and ſpirit of God in that eminent ſucceſs <hi>Peter</hi> ſtill had in laying forth Chriſt to the Jews; as alſo contrary to that ſolemn and well-grounded Covenant among themſelves, <hi>that he together with James and John ſhould be miniſter of the Jews.</hi> Oh ſays <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> tis meant <hi>principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter Judeorum</hi> chiefly of the Jews. 'Tis very true,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169713:31"/>but I would it had been conſidered by him, that at this very time <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſuppoſing him twenty five years Biſhop of <hi>Rome)</hi> had already ſpent ſome years of his fixed Epiſcopacy, and preſently after this Engagement was to return to his ſeat and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and there ſpend out his daies: how could ſuch an Engagement ſtand with wiſdom or honeſty of Spirit? his in accepting, theirs in putting it upon him? Therefore what an errant diſſembler and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-breaker do they make their firſt Biſhop and head of their Church? But for my part, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <hi>Peter</hi> did take the Engagement with much wiſdom and honeſty of Conſcience; it ſo nearly concerned the greater Growth and Advantage of the Church, that he did lay forth his miniſtration (though now and then as occaſions were ſtarted to the Gentiles) principally, and for moſt part, to the Jews. And indeed conſider</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, how Scripture looks with a full face towards this, to make it good. Gal. 1.18. <hi>Then after three years</hi> (meaning of <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion) <hi>I went up to Jeruſalem to ſee</hi> Peter, <hi>and abode with him fifteen days.</hi> Paul found him there and left him there, and this was <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> thirty ſeven. Eight years after this he was at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for <hi>Herod</hi> had him in Priſon. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. and this was the forty fifth year of Chriſt, and third year of <hi>Claudius.</hi> Six years from that he was at <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> writes Gal. 2.11. <hi>then fourteen years after,</hi> (that is,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169713:31"/>from the third year of <hi>Pauls</hi> converſion mentioned Gal. 1.) <hi>I went up again to Ieruſalem with Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, and took Titus with me alſo.</hi> Where he found <hi>Peter, ver</hi> 7.8 9. and this was in the year of Chriſt fifty one; At which time, the learned ſay, that council ſpoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was held <hi>viz.</hi> in the eighteenth year of Chriſts paſſion: but if that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous council was after the time that <hi>Paul</hi> came up by <hi>Revelation</hi> Gal. 2.2. it ſtill makes more againſt them; for <hi>Peter</hi> was at the council. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7. From the council he did not return to <hi>Rome</hi> (for thence all the <hi>Jews</hi> were Baniſhed by <hi>Claudius</hi>) but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled up and down thoſe Countries, teaching the ſcattered <hi>Iews,</hi> to whom he had writ his former Epiſtle, and in this peregrination he came to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, where Paul withſtood him to his face.</hi> Gal. 2.11. In the ſixty third year of Chriſt and eighth year of <hi>Nero, Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he ſalutes by name all his familiar friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but not a word of Biſhop <hi>Peter:</hi> was [he] not one of <hi>Pauls</hi> dear friends; or was he not there at that time? No ſay they, he was gone to viſit and confirm the Churches; but are they ſure <hi>Paul</hi> knew as much, that upon that ground he ſhould forbear to mention him? but ſuppoſe he had known of his abſence, it would have ſtood both with wiſdom and piety to have ſaluted and ſent commendations to him.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, It would have manifeſted to them all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169713:32"/>how worthy <hi>Peter</hi> was of Remembrance, and very dear to <hi>Paul,</hi> and provoked new flames of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on in their hearts towards their abſent Paſtor, which <hi>Paul</hi> was uſed to do. 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 5.12.13. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If this Salutation could not have been conveyed to him by letter from ſome of the Church: yet upon <hi>Peters</hi> firſt return to <hi>Rome</hi> he had doubtleſs met with it, which could not but have been a great refreſhing to his wearied ſpirit. Four years after this Epiſtle was written, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf came Priſoner to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſixty ſixt years of Chriſt, and eleventh year of <hi>Nero;</hi> he lived two whole years in his own hired houſe (as I ſhowed before,) and was there ſome time more in another way; that's implied; Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Nero,</hi> the laſt year of his reign; he reigned in all but thirteen years, eight moneths; when his thirteenth year and ſomewhat more was expired, tis evident <hi>Peter</hi> had not been at <hi>Rome.</hi> A ſtrange fixed Biſhop who is never mentioned in any of the letters either to or from <hi>Rome;</hi> none that ever were there could either ſee or find him there; no nor yet he himſelf left any [indubitable] teſtimony of [his) Epiſcopacie amongſt them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am ſatisfied that <hi>Peter</hi> made-good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Engagement, laying forth his Apoſtleſhip principally and generally to the Jews, and at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem;</hi> and ſo neither was nor could be a fixed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169713:32"/>Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> at all, much leſs for twenty five years together.</p>
                  <p>But In the next place, ſuppoſe (and I do but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) it that <hi>Peter</hi> had been at <hi>Rome</hi> yea had lived and died Biſhop there, what ground or warrant can they ſhow which neceſſarily infers, that he muſt have a Succeſſor in that Prerogative and Dignity? There is no Law or Command in all the Book of God for it; and was there ever any Kingdome or Soveraignty Spiritual or Temporal, (and this of theirs is both) without Laws made touching the Succeſſion thereof, and forms of Election? but here is no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Peter</hi> wrot his ſecond Epiſtle to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church [indefinitely, <hi>to them that had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained like precious faith with him, and the reſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1.] I cannot but wonder why he did not then declare to all the Churches in the world, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were to inherit Succeſſively, his place and honour of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie;</hi> and will'd them after his death, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and own the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtill under that Name and Notion; eſpecially when he had ſo handſome an opportunity of bringing it in, 2 Pet. 1.14. <hi>[Knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my Tabernacle, even as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.]</hi> Might he not have brought it in very pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here? But you ſee he did not; for doubtleſs there was never any ſuch thing in his head or heart.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:169713:33"/>
                  <p>Chriſt had ſhewed nothing of that.</p>
                  <p>But further; Suppoſe we grant a neceſſity of a Succeſſour in that Dignity and Office; did it not of right fall to S. <hi>John,</hi> who was an Apoſtle, and lived many years after S. <hi>Peters</hi> death? The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle whom Jeſus ſo loved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly if any one could have been found fit and worthy to have been left <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal head of the Church,</hi> 'twas he: but <hi>Peter</hi> did not at his death confer it upon him, willing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſignifie ſo mcuh to him, and bring him to that See: for ſurely <hi>Peter</hi> was acquinted with no ſuch office, much leſs neceſſity of ſuch a Succeſſion. Whereunto add but this one word. They themſelves confeſs an Apoſtle to have been above any Biſhop (tis a truth more clear then could ever yet be denyed;) now, how could <hi>Linus</hi> if he ſucceeded <hi>Peter</hi> in the place of <hi>univerſal Supremacyſhip,</hi> but be above the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Iohn?</hi> and yet with the ſame breath they ſay, an Apoſtle is above a Biſhop. But you know it is a Myſtery of Lying Iniquity, <hi>abovo admalum,</hi> from the root to the very fag end of it.</p>
                  <p>But well: In the laſt place, the Pope will needs be Succeſſor to an Apoſtle. I confeſs I think he is; but 'tis to <hi>Iudas;</hi> and my reaſons are theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Pope continued a great while in the Church undiſcerned; a cloſe Hypocrite, but a real hater of that he did profeſſe to love, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:169713:33"/>
                  <p n="2">2. He's a Theif as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, and bears the bag too.</p>
                  <p>I told you how he firſt came to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all <hi>Italy;</hi> and preſently after, of all <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi> juſt as a thief gets a purſe on the high way. Do I need to tell you what vaſt Treaſures of wealth their Sorceries, and Legerdemain of Pardons, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Purgatory, Canonization, and the like, have brought them in yearly? they make Merchandize of mens ſouls; <hi>Vendit Alexander claves, Altaria, Chriſtum;</hi> and what is this but mear cheating and thievery?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudas</hi> (you know) was ſuch a thief and lover of the bag, that he grudged his Maſter the Oyntment the good woman poured on him; the Pope, tis the grief and vexation of his heart, that a drop of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or comfort falls upon Chriſt in any of his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is as perfect at <hi>Hail Maſter, and kiſſing Chriſt,</hi> and then betraying him in his Truths, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Saints, Diſcipline, Kingdom, to be ſpit on, reviled, crucified, as ever <hi>Iudas</hi> was.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Saviour calls <hi>Iudas the ſon of perdition,</hi> Joh. 17.12. which very expreſſion the Holy Ghoſt here takes up, and calls him alſo the <hi>Son of perdition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, <hi>Iudas went to his own place,</hi> Act. 1. The ſame is ſaid of the Pope, Rev. 17.11. <hi>He goeth into perdition:</hi> And Rev. 19.20. <hi>The falſe Prophet was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169713:34"/>taken and caſt alive into the Lake.</hi> The Pope in the pride and baſeneſs of his heart, makes himſelf S. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor; but God in Wiſedome an Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, declares him to be <hi>Iudas</hi> Succeſſor; and this (indeed) is the true foundation upon which the preſent <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſtately <hi>Babel</hi> of Papacie is built.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e.</hi> I ſhall now make ſome improvement of the point by Application; and firſt be informed, That as the <hi>Iews</hi> have framed a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo the Popiſh Clergy have framed an Anti-Chriſt that God never made mention of; for the Deſcriptions they give of him, when applyed to the True One, are all of them moſt falſe and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilous.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One of them is this, <hi>That the Great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt muſt be a ſingle individual perſon, as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle o<hi rend="sup">e</hi> denotes; therefore the Pope cannot be he; for there have been many Popes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly he muſt build a great and ſtately Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſit in, <hi>and there be worſhipped as God</hi> (ſay
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169713:36"/>they;) but ſuppoſe all the materials at hand, it would ſpend moſt, if not all that time before it could be finiſhed; and his ſitting times ſurely will be but ſhort, conſidering what his work muſt be, if his whole ſhould be but three years and a half.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He muſt wage war, and fight great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, bring down mighty Kings and Kingdoms, and make himſelfe drunk with the blood of all the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He muſt have a flouriſhing reign without any viſible or conſiderable oppoſition. Rev. 11.2. <hi>The Court which is without the Temple, meaſure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles, and the Holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty two months.</hi> Rev. 13.7. <hi>Power was given him over all Kindreds, Tongues, and Nations.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>All the World wondred after the Beaſt</hi> and ver 4. <hi>Who is like unto the Beaſt? Who is able to make war with the Beaſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tell me now, that likelyhood in reaſon is there that all this ſhould be effected in three years and a half? Thus you ſee they who willfully left God, have left, yea loſt both Religion and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in that which moſt nearly concernd them to be quick-ſighted in. But I wonder not, if they that are dead drunk, ravingly talk their own irrational Fancies. Other fond and groundleſs deſcriptions they give of that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> they have framed to themſelves; but theſe three being fallen, the reſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169713:36"/>cannot ſtand. 'Tis not worth while to trouble you or my ſelf any further with them, as thoſe who will ſearch after them cannot but confeſs; and I judge it better to ſay enough, then all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Is the Pope Antichriſt? You ſee then, Firſt, what a ſad caſe they are in, who of Proteſtants turn to be Papiſts; they ſubmit themſelves to the Beaſt, and ſtand engaged to fight againſt Chriſt, his Kingdom, and their own Salvation; and what the iſſue of that will be, you ſhall hear upon the next Subject, and they ſhall feel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You may hence gather what it is to be an able, a learned Papiſt; this; a grown ſtrong man armed, a <hi>Goliah,</hi> defieing God, the Iſrael of God, and the Goſpel of God with all its grace and hopes. We uſe to ſay of Jeſuites, <hi>quo meliores, eò deteriores,</hi> the better they are, the worſe they are; it holds true of all Papiſts whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Pope being <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> you may eaſily know what all Popiſh Ordinances are, their Doctrines, Auricular confeſſions, Pennances, Holy water, Crucifixes, Beads, Extream Unctions, Altars, Bloodleſs Sacrifices, Merits, Satisfactions, Images, the Worſhip of Saints and Angels with Invocation of them; Indulgences, Pilgrimages, Burying in a Franciſcans-hood, Purgatory, Canonization; all this will all other appurtenances of their Religion, are all Antichriſtianiſm; the Holy-Ghoſts expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169713:37"/>of them, is, <hi>They are the blood of a dead man.</hi> Rev. 16.3. No bettter then the polluting, Choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Killing blood of a dead man: therefore take heed and beware of their Religion; hate it with a right perfect hatred, even all thoſe forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Formalities, Ceremonies, any thing, every thing that is a kinn to it, as you would hate, when you are athirſt, drinking blood.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You may hence alſo learn what heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing balm for a wounded Conſcience, what true comfort for him that is weary, and burdened heavily with his ſin, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and their Religion can afford; Alas what balm, what heart-conſolations can <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm hold forth? They themſelves are ſo far convinced of this, that they have made it a Doctrine and point of Faith, that to talk of aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is preſumption; onely Apoſtles and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chriſtians have attained to aſſurance; but tis preſumption and boldneſs for the People to think of it; to believe as the Church believes is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Cold comfort, this, the Lord knows, for an enlightned and wounded Conſcience at the hour of Death, to have nothing to take off the guilt of ſin, to break the power of luſt, to appeaſe an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, and deliver the poor ſoul out of the jaws of Death and Hell, but a few Beads and Crucifixes, and Reliques, and the menſtruous raggs of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-righteouſneſs, and performances, a few emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169713:37"/>wiſhes, and hopes, and believing as the Church believes; how may all ſuch cry out, as one of them did, <hi>O animule, quo vadis?</hi> Poor deſpicable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Soul, whither goeſt thou? <hi>Cornel. E. Lapid.</hi> in his Comment on the eleventh of Numbers tells this ſtory of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> who Excommunicated Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Cuus eſſem religioſus, ſperabam bene de ſalute animae meae; Cardinalis factus, extimui; Pontifex creatus, penè deſpero.</hi> When I was in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders, I hoped well of the Salvation of my ſoul; being made a Cardinal, I was ſore afraid of it; but ſince I was created Pope, I een deſpair. Rev. 9.5. <hi>And to the Locuſts was given that they ſhould not kill men, but that they ſhould torment them five months; and their torment was as the torment of a Scorpion when it ſtrikes a man.</hi> Natural Locuſts come in <hi>April,</hi> and continue till <hi>September,</hi> five months; whereto the Spirit of God here alludes, and ſays, <hi>thoſe myſtical Locuſts that came out of the ſmoak, the bottomleſs pit, ſhould torment men five months,</hi> that is, throughout their whole duration: <hi>and their torment is as the torment of a Scorpion when he ſtriketh a man;</hi> Now the ſting of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poin, is not at firſt perceived: but when it is, it works after ſuch a lingering manner that it affords ſome hopes of life, yet doth certainly bring death in the end. When the poor ſoul is enlightned, and conſcience ſtird with appredenſion of Divine diſpleaſure, Popiſh Ordinances and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169713:38"/>prove no better then the ſtings of Scorpions to them; afflicted and vexed they are with them; yet ſome faint hopes they have from them; but at laſt finding themſelves deluded, they vainly wiſh Death it ſelf, as if that would help them, ver. 6. <hi>They ſhall deſire to die, and Death ſhall flie from them,</hi> leaving them ſtill to the mercy of Popiſh racks and torments. Know aſſuredly that Pope and Jeſuites by any thing that is in their Religion, are not, nor can they be, but skinners over (at the beſt,) ſlight healers of the wounds of Conſcience; miſerable Comforters, Phyſitians of no value: the Lord in mercy keep all his own out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>

The next Uſe is exhortatory, that every one of us would admire and bleſs the Lord and his goodneſs, that he hath brought us forth in ſuch a juncture of time, and caſt our lot in ſuch a place, that we are not conſtrained <hi>to receive the mark of the Beaſt in our hands or in our foreheads.</hi> I deſire to bleſs God every day, that God did not bring me forth in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but that I am born an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man,</hi> and at ſuch a time when Popery is not the Religion of the Nation, but the light of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhines amongſt us, and into us. Troubles I confeſs we have ſeen and felt, but put them all together with their utmoſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, (ſo far as concerns the outward man,) and they are not worthy to be compared with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169713:38"/>great happineſs we enjoy in our deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Egyptian darkneſs and bondage of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; eſpecially if you take in the light and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Chriſts blood and Goſpel-truths we walk in. What would have become of thee (poor ſoul) hadſt thou lived in times wherein the Sea of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were no better then the blood of a dead man? The Lord grant every one of us to know our Goſpel-happineſs and priviledges, to rejoyce in the light and work the works of him that ſent us (while we have the light) even comfort and Salvation to our ſelves, glory to Chriſt, advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Kingdom; and all this <hi>by receiving the truth in the love of it, and holding forth the word of life.</hi>

Why then, let it not trouble you, when ever, or where ever you ſee Chriſt and his Armies (in the greatneſs of their ſtrength and fury) marching out againſt them.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Pope and his Kingdom are appointed of God to moſt remarkable deſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, God hath foretold and threatned it. Rev. 13.9.10. <hi>If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into captivity: He that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword. Here is the Patience and Faith of the Saints.</hi> God hath proclaimed it to all who have ſpiritual ears to hear, that he hath captivity and a killing ſword in ſtore for thoſe who have been ſuch cruel enemies to his People. And he would have all his Saints act their faith in believing this threat, and their patience in waiting the full Execution of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt <hi>(into whoſe hands all power in heaven and Earth is committed)</hi> hath ſworn it; I ſay, God hath not onely threatned it, but Chriſt hath ſworn it, Rev. 10.5, 6. <hi>The Angel which I ſaw ſtand upon the Sea, and upon the Earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven: And ſware hy him that liveth for ever, who created Heaven, the Earth, and Sea, with all things that are therein, that there ſhould be time no longer.</hi> The Angel of the Covenant, ſet one foot upon the Sea, the other upon the Land (Sea and Land, you know, make up the terreſtial Globe) whereby is prefigured his throwing <hi>Antichriſt</hi> out of all, and taking poſſeſſion of all the World him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He lifts up his hand, the ancient ceremony of an Oath. The thing he ſwears, is this, <hi>That there ſhould be time no more;</hi> not ſimply, but for the Man
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169713:40"/>of ſin to reign, havocking and deſtroying his Church. Look upon the ſtructure of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the power and policy of its conſtitution and Government; and who could in reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould ever be deſtroyed? Says Chriſt, you have my word for it, you have my Oath for it, it ſhall ſhortly come to paſs, that the time of their domination ſhall be no more. I will certainly eaſe you of her; <hi>God willing, more abundantly</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks Heb. 6.) <hi>to ſhew unto the Heirs of promiſe, the immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath: that (by two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable things</hi> (his Word and Oath) <hi>in which it was impoſſible for God to lye) we might have ſtrong conſolation in the aſſurance of Romes headlong down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Holy-Ghoſt brings it in as fully performed, as either ſayd or ſworn, in the Groſs or Lump, and alſo in the Particulars of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in the Groſs and Lump. Dan. 12.1. <hi>At that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the children of thy People, and [there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to that ſame time;] and at that time thy People ſhall be delivered.</hi> You have a Parallel to this, Rev. 16.17.18.19. <hi>The ſeventh Angel poured out his vial into the air, and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169713:41"/>from the Throne, ſaying, 't is done. And there were Voyces, and Thunders, and Lightnings, and there was a great Earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great. And the great City was divided into three parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell, and great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the feirceneſs of his wrath.</hi> Such an Earthquake will God raiſe under them, ſuch ſhowers and ſtorms ſhall God ſend down upon them (as tis in the laſt verſe of that Chapter. <hi>There fell upon men a great hail out of Heaven, every ſtone about the weight of a Talent, that made them curſe and blaſpheme; for the plague thereof was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great.</hi>) I ſay ſuch terrible Earthquakes and plaguing Storms of troubles will befall them as never any Kingdom in the World felt or heard of. Rev. 14 19, 20. <hi>And the Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the Earth and gathered the Vine of the Earth,</hi> (the Church of Chriſt is a Vine of Heaven, its root is in Heaven, all its fruitfulneſs is from Heaven, and for Heaven; whatſoever conſtitutes or compleats it, is from God out of Heaven, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. to 15. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Vine of the Earth, its origination is of the Earth, Earthly Head, Earthly Members, Earthly Doctrines, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worſhip, Earthly Diſcipline; whatever is peculiarly theirs, is of the Earth Earthly.) <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel thruſt in his Sickle, and gathered the Vine of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169713:41"/>Earth, and caſt it into the great Winepreſs of the wrath of God; And the Winepreſs was troden without the City, and blood came out of the Winepreſs, even unto the horſes bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs.</hi> This ſpeech of the Holy Ghoſt is doubtleſs hyperbolical; the import of it is this [a ſlaughter that hath dimenſions, height and depth, length &amp; bredth in it.] Rev. 18.8. <hi>Her plagues ſhall come in one day, Death, Mourning, Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire; for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi> Take one text more for it, Rev. 10.3, 4. <hi>He cryed with a loud voice as when a Lion roareth; and when he had cryed, ſeven thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders uttered their voyces. And when the ſeven thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had uttered their voices, I was about to write; and I heard a voyce from heaven, ſaying unto me, ſeal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not.</hi> I take it, this Scripture contains as much terror in it againſt the Antichriſtian State, as any in all the book of God. Moſt fearful and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious things are written againſt <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> but as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with written Doctrines, but would have alſo their unwritten Doctrines and Traditions to fight againſt Chriſt and his Church withall, for more full execution ſake: So God will not content himſelf with Judgements upon them that are written in this book (though they be exceeding many and great) but he hath Judgements alſo that are not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169713:42"/>written, for more remarkable execution and ruine of them; even ſeven Judgements, every one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is cloathed with thunder, ſealed up and kept cloſe in Gods armory, to be certainly brought forth in that day, beſide all mens thought and expectation.</p>
                     <p>Go as far in Imagining the terribleneſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as the line of your Fancy will be ſtetched to, and the event or iſſue will ſurely exceed what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever formidable things you have Framed to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; the thunder of a ſevenfold wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure from God will come upon them over and above.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Holy-Geoſt gives you his ruine in the particulars of it. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall be ſo ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>ut ſentiat ſe mori,</hi> he ſhall feel himſelf die, for more full revenge ſake.</p>
                     <p>And here I muſt have recourſe to the ſeven Vials, which are called (Rev 15.1.) <hi>the ſeven laſt plagues in which is filled up the wrath of God,</hi> that is upon the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Antichriſtian State.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>[Vials,]</hi> I know, that ſeveral learned men ſay of them, they are veſſels wide beneath, but of narrow mouths; &amp; ſo, though they contain much, yet what they contain falls out <hi>guttatim,</hi> drop by drop, &amp; ſoaks deep. It is very ſure, that where a Viall of Gods wrath falls, it peirces deep, &amp; wounds dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But I am more inclined to their judgement, who ſay they are drinking veſſels: wide-mouth'd Veſſels. <hi>Phialae dicuntur,</hi> ſays <hi>Primaſius, quia haec ſupplicia
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169713:42"/>non occulta futura ſunt, ſed manifeſta omnibus, &amp; Phialae patent;</hi> they are open-mouthd, plain drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pots; when you turn them up, whats in them comes forth violently and een all at once, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to every eye; hereupon the Angels command is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not diſtill out, or drop out, but <hi>[pour] out upon them.</hi> And indeed moſt evident it is, that whereever a vial hath fallen, there hath been much [remarkable] wrath upon that part of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian State.</p>
                     <p>It fares with us in handling Divinity, as it doth with travellors in certain places of their way, where the follower muſt ſet his foot in the very place of his leader, leſt otherwiſe he ſtep in: he that comes after in handling ſomepeices of Divinity, muſt ſpeak or write, (in ſome particulars thereof,) the very words of him that went before; elſe he's ſure to fall into Error, if not Hereſie. I cannot tell what material thing can be added to that holy and judicious Tract of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> upon the ſixteenth Chapter of the Revelations. I find that whoever have touched upon the Vials ſince that peice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, have light their candles at his torch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall give you but hints upon them, nor ſcarce ſtand to clear up the reaſon of interpretations; for if thou beeſt a ſcholar into whoſe hands theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of mine are fallen, I perſwade my ſelf thou haſt read him, (for few Divines and men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have not:) but if it be otherwiſe with thee,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169713:43"/>I [purpoſely] ſay no more then will be enough to whet thee an Appetite to get him (the price being but ſmall,) from whom upon this Subject of the Vials, thou mayſt have Ample and full ſatisfaction, what wages God deviſed for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> from all Eternity, and hath been for above this hundred years a working out againſt him, and is ſtill vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly going on with, not to ceaſe but in his utter Ruine.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Vial falls upon the Popes myſtical Earth or foot-ſtool, (Rev. 16. ver. 2.) the common ſort both of Laicks and Clergy.</p>
                     <p>The Martyrs in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, did diſcover what a dangerous ſtate (in reference to Eternity,) Common ordinary Catholiques were in, that ſo living and ſo dying, twas not their Beads, nor Almeſdeeds, their good Hoſpitality, nor their ignorant devotions, and believing as the Church believed, would ſave them; if they died in the faith and worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would prove no better then damned Reprobates. This was a greivous botch and ſoare upon moſt of the People, to be told, and (in effect) convinced, that they were in a ſtate of deep damnation; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſtrove which ſhould make moſt haſte with Fire and Fagot to burn thoſe who teſtified ſuch dangerous things concerning them. But they made a further diſcovery of ſuch as were in religious
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169713:43"/>orders, their pariſh-Prieſts, that their lives were very baſe, giving us themſelves to eaſe, Idleneſs, Pride, inſatiable Avarice, and ſerving their own bellies, and ſo were fitter to have been ſwine-heards then Preachers, or to have followed the Plough then lived in holy Orders. The Martyrs of thoſe times did not at all bluſh or fear to tell them all this to their faces; and they themſelves being convinced that what was laid to their charge, was both very baſe, and yet very true; mend their lives and manners they would not; keep off this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the poor ſouls thus fiercely poured out upon them, they could not; whereupon they were filled with as much vexation and Torment, as if the noiſome grievous ſoares of <hi>Egypt</hi> had been upon them from head to foot. This was a plaguing judgement upon <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> thus to have the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſmitten that did ſo ſtrongly ſupport him.</p>
                     <p>The Second Viall [<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.3.] is poured out upon the Antichriſtian Sea. In this, God came nearer to him then in the former; for the ſea is above the land, as tis the proper place of the fire to be above the air; the place of the air to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the water; ſo tis proper to the water to be above the earth; tis kept from overflowing all by the power of that word <hi>[hitherto ſhall thy proud waves goe, and no further.]</hi> Upon the pouring out of the firſt viall, finding themſelves in a decaying ſtate, they lay their heads together how to plaiſter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169713:44"/>their ſoars, and heal themſelves of the noyſom botches and boyls that had lately broken out upon them, and were ſo viſible in every ones eye; for which end the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was calld, where all the ſtreams of Popiſh doctrine, Popiſh worſhip and diſcpiline were brought together, the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof the Holy Ghoſt there calls [Sea.] Upon this there did appear in the Reformed Churches, men of moſt eminent Godlineſs and Learning, who did abundantly diſcover this <hi>Sea</hi> of theirs both by writing, and preaching, to be a <hi>ſea of blood, the blood of a dead man,</hi> and no better. In the true Goſpel Ordinances there is to be had the living, purging, ſaving blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but Popiſh Trental Ordinances were not ſuch blood; they were <hi>a ſea of blood of a dead man;</hi> clotted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed blood; polluting, choaking, killing blood; this is the Beſt word God affords them; and no marvell, when the death of ſouls was all their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and effect <hi>[Every living ſoul dyed in the ſea]</hi> All thoſe who contented themſelves to abide and ſwim in that Popiſh Sea, that had no other life but what was begot and nouriſhed in the Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, dyed and periſhd eternally. This Vial tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their religion inſide out, and ſhowed it to all the World in its native colours and baſeneſs; till this time, Every one took it, that it was the bad Lives of the Common ſort of people, and worſe Lives of the Pariſh-Prieſts that were in all the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169713:44"/>fault; their Religion in itſelf good enough; but now tis made apparent to all that will nor ſhurt their eyes, that even the Religion itſelf is naught, and baſe and Antichriſtian all over; And this was yet a hotter Vial of wrath and torment upon them.</p>
                     <p>The Third Angel. (<hi>Rev.</hi> 16.4, 5, 6, 7.) pourd his Viall upon the rivers and fountains of waters; that is upon Seminary Prieſts and Jeſuites who compaſs the earth to and fro, conveying the ſalt of Popiſh Trental doctrines and worſhip, to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nations and languages; <hi>[and they became blood]</hi> the meaning is, <hi>they had blood given them to drink.</hi> Now to give a man blood to drink, is to kill him. They were executed (by vertue of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Law, enacted with conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the year 1581.) as Traitors, hangd, drawn and quartered. A Book entituled <hi>[Juſtitia Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae]</hi> was publiſed in ſeveral Languages, to clear the Chriſtian equity and juſtice that was in ſuch her proceedings with them. The United Provinces of the Low Countries, come from under the Altar of Perſecution for Chriſt and Truth, (1.) being freed from the fearfull Tyrannies of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaniard,</hi> took at her in the year 1586. and made a Law to the ſame effect againſt them; <hi>That if any Prieſt or Ieſuite, whether Forreigner or Home-born, ſhould come into any of the Provinces, it ſhould be death to them being apprehended,</hi> and ſo they ſaid <hi>[Amen]</hi> to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169713:45"/>the Law and Juſtice of Queen <hi>Elizabeth; Let it be even ſo, Lord God; true and righteous are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Pope to have capital puniſhment execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon his <hi>Emiſſaries,</hi> (the ſupporters and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers of his Kingdom and Glory) could not but be a tormenting <hi>vial of wrath</hi> upon him; as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking what meaſure he himſelf might look for, if he ſhould fall into their hands; even he that had drunk the blood of others ſo freely, to have his own heart-blood given him to drink, with a <hi>[Satia te ſanguine]</hi> take your fill of blood and murther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ial is poured out upon the Sun, Rev.</hi> 16.8, 9. Papacy is reſembled by an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> world, where there is earth, ſea, rivers, fountains, and a Sun ſhining gloriouſly.</p>
                     <p>If we take this Myſtical and moſt Illuſtrious light, according to their conceits and fancie, then tis the [<hi>Popes</hi> Supremacie in Temporals;] Papiſts will tell you, <hi>The Pope is as far above the greateſt Monarch in this world, as the Sun is above the Moon; and the ſeveral glories of the Kings of the earth, are but lights derived from him; Temporal glory being in the Pope, as light is in the Sun.</hi> But how is the glory of the <hi>Popes Supremacy</hi> in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals everywhere darkened, and in many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes quite put out? You do not not now hear in any of the Popiſh Nations of his Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169713:45"/>Kings, Depoſing Kings, and giving away their Kingdoms; ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. God hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly darkened, almoſt quite deſtroyed that Sun of the <hi>[Popes Supreme power in Temporals,]</hi> which hath been a ſcorching <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ial of wrath</hi> to him and his Clergy, and drawn from them ſufficient blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>But if you underſtand the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of things, as indeed they be, then doubtleſs tis the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> or the <hi>German</hi> Emperour. It is well known that the Emperours (before the <hi>Pope</hi> ſet up his Kingdom of <hi>Temporal greatneſs</hi>) were the Sun and glory of the Political world, they being the ſixt head of the fourth, or <hi>Roman Beaſt,</hi> were wounded deadly by the incurſions of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Rev.</hi> 13.3. But the <hi>Pope</hi> growing up to his height, vouchſafed to be their <hi>Surgeon;</hi> his skill failed him not; for he quickly healed that deadly wound by ſetting up an Emperor in <hi>France,</hi> and after that, tranſlating the Empire into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Taking things as they really are, of a certainty this is the earthly Sun that ſhines moſt illuſtriouſly <hi>in the Popes Antichriſtian world:</hi> It matters not whether the <hi>Pope</hi> will own the Emperour as above himſelf, or no; we know he ſet him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the old Emperours, or ſixt head, who were (by all mens confeſſion) the Sun of the Political
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169713:46"/>world, and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> but Stars, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 9.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God and Scripture have ſtill made the ſupreme Magiſtrate <hi>(in Temporals)</hi> the greateſt luſtre and ſplendor of any State; and therefore with very good reaſon may the Emperour be here pitched upon, who hath been the greateſt Light and Glory of the Popiſh world for hundreds of years.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was <hi>the Angel out of the Temple, who poured this Vial upon the Popiſh Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial State,</hi> as if ſcorching flames of fire had light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
                     <p>And here give me leave to inſert a diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Kings.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that he who follows truth too near the heels, may chance to have his brains daſhd out; at leaſt may derive a great deal of ſpight and <hi>odium</hi> upon himſelf, which a politick wiſe man would not do; but that of <hi>Solomon</hi> prevails with me, <hi>The uprightneſs of the upright ſhall deliver him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I find upon ſearch, <hi>That when Chriſt is going in good earneſt to ſet up his Kingdom, in the name and glory of it, there is a great hazard,</hi> I may ſay, <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall make this good to you from four scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of them is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>The Kings of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169713:46"/>the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith was fulfilled at Chriſts apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, tryal, and death, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.25, 26, 27. <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate, the Chief Prieſts, and others, conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſet themſelves againſt him, when he had but given out ſome hints of his Kingſhip.</hi> This was that which ſtirred them up ſo againſt him, <hi>[Tell us, art thou the King of the Iews:]</hi> And when <hi>Pilate</hi> was minded to let him go, they cryed out, <hi>[He that makes himſelf a King, ſpeaks againſt Caeſar:]</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Pilate</hi> went and paſſed Sentence upon him.</p>
                     <p>When there was but ſome talk that Chriſt would ſet up a Kingdom, they preſently band themſelves againſt him, and he dyes for't; and ſo they think they have <hi>broke the Cordes of his Government aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as tis <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                     <p>In the 4. <hi>verſe, God laughs at them, being wroth.</hi> verſe 5. <hi>Speaks that which vexes them,</hi> [<hi>Yet</hi> (or notwithſtanding all their combined powers, and policies againſt him) <hi>have I ſet him up King of Sion, verſe</hi> 6.] And ſays God, <hi>I will declare the decree, thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> verſe 7. This was fulfil'd in his raiſing him up from death to life, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33.</p>
                     <p>God hath paſſed an Eternal Decree concerning his Son, <hi>That when they ſhould kill and bury him, he would the third day bring him forth out of the womb
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169713:47"/>of the grave, and own him for his Son, and ſet him at his own right hand, there to intercede, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould not be in vain: [Ask of me</hi> (ſays the Father to him,) <hi>and I will give the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> ver. 8.] As if he had ſaid, I will ſet thee in poſſeſſion of thy inheritance, which ſhall have the uttermoſt parts of the earth for its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, (according to that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.8. <hi>He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</hi>) For God to declare the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, is to act it; for <hi>Dei diſcere eſt facere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the time is at hand, he muſt be thus ſet in actual poſſeſſion of all the Dominion, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Glory that God hath promiſed him; if the Kings of the earth did ſet themſelves, and the Rulers took councel together againſt him, when he did but ſpeak ſomewhat of his Kingly Office: how much more will they do it then, when they ſee his throne a building, and his Kingdom a going up to the no ſmall prejudice of their Intereſt? <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15, 17, 18. When he begins to put forth, and act his <hi>Great Power,</hi> and do ſomething towards taking the Kingdoms of this world into his own hands and reign, then <hi>[the Nations are angry]</hi> at him, that is, they act againſt him in their anger, wherein Kings are chief, as you may ſee, Rev. 16.14, 16. But do they carry it? no; and [<hi>thy wrath is come, Rev.</hi> 11.18.] Chriſt in his wrath fights the battel with them in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:169713:47"/>
                        <hi>(Armageddon)</hi> that is, where he gives them a moſt remarkable overthrow and deſtruction, which this 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> expreſſes plainly, <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters veſſel, v. 9.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Be wiſe now therefore (O ye Kings) be inſtructed ye (Judges) of the earth, v.</hi> 10. as if he ſaid, look <hi>(You)</hi> well to your ſelves; be his ſervants (without Complement) and rejoyce with trembling when he comes about this work, <hi>v.</hi> II. <hi>Kiſs the Son</hi> (with kiſſes of Reverence, kiſſes of Obedience) <hi>leſt he be angry</hi> (and then a little thing will provoke him) <hi>and ſo ye periſh in the mid-way</hi> (in the mid-way of your plots, enmities, oppoſitions of him;) for if <hi>his wrath be kindled but a little, bleſſed are all thoſe</hi> (thoſe Kings and Rulers eſpecially) that have Wiſdom and Faith to get intereſt in him, and be of his ſide; thoſe that have not, the fire of his wrath will certainly conſume them, ver. 12. The ſecond Scripture is Iſaiah 24. ver. 18.19, 20. <hi>Marlorat</hi> who profeſſes to have taken the marrow and ſubſtance of his Comment out of <hi>Vatablus, Luther, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus, Calvin, Oecolampadius, Pagnin, &amp;c.</hi> hath theſe very words upon the latter end of the eighteenth ver. <hi>pertinet autem proprie hic contextus ad Papiſtus noſtros,</hi> Chriſt in this Propheſie, ſays he, chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Popiſh State. Upon a following verſe he hath theſe words, <hi>'hoc vaticinium proprie ad Chriſti regnum pertinet,</hi> this other part of the Propheſie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169713:48"/>doth chiefly reſpect the kingdom of Chriſt; he means his glorious kingdom, expreſſed in the laſt words of the Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The Popiſh and Goſpel-oppoſing World is here ſet out by the <hi>[Earth]</hi> as it is alſo in diverſe places of the Revelations, Rev. 14.19. Chap. 16.1. Here is mention of <hi>[heavy tranſgreſſion]</hi> according to Rev. 18.5. <hi>Her ſins are reach'd up to heaven.</hi> The tranſgreſſion is ſayd to be <hi>[ſo heavy]</hi> upon it, that the foundations of the Earth ſhake, reel to and fro, yea are utterly broken down, fall, and riſe no more; the ſame you may read Rev. 16 18, 19. and Rev. 18.21. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day,</hi> (that is, in the day of the Earthquake) <hi>that the Lord ſhall puniſh the (Hoſt of the high ones) that are on high;</hi> Who are they?</p>
                     <p>I take the next words to be Exegetical; why the Kings of the Earth upon the Earth ver. 21. The moſt of the Kings and high Ones of the Earth will be Engaged aganſt him, enough to make an Hoſt, whom Chriſt will fall upon and puniſh <hi>(upon the Earth)</hi> with temporal judgement (according as you have heard) when he is abought to Raign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>(Ancients gloriouſly)</hi> as 'tis ver: 23. If this Propheſie have been at all fulfilled, it will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be much more fulfilled in that day; for Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies many times have a gradual fulfilling.—The third Scripture is Pſalm 110. <hi>Sit on my right hand, till I make thy Enemies thy footſtool,</hi> ver. 1. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169713:48"/>thoſe Enemies, you may get ſome light out of Luke 19. ver. 14. the Citizens hated him and ſent this meſſage after him, <hi>We will not have this man to [Raign] over us,</hi> and ver. 27. <hi>Thoſe mine [Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies] which would not that I ſhould [Reign] over them, &amp;c.</hi> The Father ſpeaks of thoſe who were Enemies to Chriſt (as a King,) Enemies to his Raigning. When Chriſt had caſt down heatheniſh Idols and Government, Rev. 12. in all reaſon he might have expected (in <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Emperors, and ages) to have ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but then upſtarts the Pope, that Beaſt with his ten horns or Kings, who by their ſmiting and puſhing, keep Chriſt out of all; Whereat (to ſpeak after the manner of men) Chriſt ſeems to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; but the Father appeaſes him with theſe words, <hi>Son, ſit you down on my right hand, I will make all your Enemies your foot-ſtool. I will ſend the rod of thy ſtrength</hi> (that is, the Goſpel) <hi>out of Sion i. e.</hi> from among my Saints and Churches, into all Nations, <hi>and thou ſhalt rule in the midſt of the Enemies i. e.</hi> the power of thy Scepter ſhall prevail amongſt them: and it ſhall not be a forced ſubjection, <hi>Thy People ſhall be [willing] in the day of thy Power;</hi> (Rev. 11.47.) they ſhall then come in to thee wittingly.</p>
                     <p>But ſhall they be Saints indeed? ſayes Chriſt, my heart is ſet upon ſuch; Yes, they ſhall come in to thee in the <hi>[beauties of holineſs.]</hi> But their number
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169713:49"/>will be but ſmall, as hitherto it hath been? Nay, <hi>from the womb of the morning thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> as if he had ſayd, the number of them ſhall be as the drops of dew in the ſummers morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, innumerable. But how ſhall all this be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? <hi>Why, the Lord hath ſworn and will not repent; thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec,</hi> ver. 4. the blood and interceſſion of thine everlaſting Prieſt-hood ſhall merit and effect it. But Father, where's my footſtool? to this tis anſwered in the following verſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſtrike through Kings in the day of thy wrath.</hi> ver, 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt fill the places with dead bodies,</hi> that is, make great ſlaughters amongſt thy Enemies; <hi>and ſhalt wound the [heads] of many Countries.</hi> ver. 6. <hi>and ſhalt drink of the brook in the way,</hi> (of the water next at hand, being in the heat of purſute,) <hi>and ſo ſhalt lift up thy head:</hi> As if the Father had ſayd unto him, thou ſhalt have a footſtool made up of Kings, and the heads of many Countries, and thereby ſhalt lift up thy head <hi>i. e.</hi> to a great height of Rule and glory of dominion. I have thus brought down the ſenſe of theſe ſeveral Scriptures, from verſe to verſe, the more clearly to convince that I have quoted them properly for my purpoſe.—The laſt proof of it ſhall be undeniably clear, Rev. 16 14 16 with Rev. 19.18.19.20. <hi>The Kings of the earth and of the World are gathered to battel againſt him, in Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geddon;</hi> there cannot be a better gloſs or comment
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169713:49"/>on <hi>[Armageddon,]</hi> then that Rev. 19. <hi>Chriſt feaſteth the fowls of the air with the fleſh of (Kings,) Captains, mighty men</hi> takes the (Beaſt) and falſe Prophet, and throws them alive into the lake of fire burning with brimſtone. And doth not the ſtorm beat violently at this day upon all the Kings of Chriſtendome? You know how Chriſt hath lately trampled upon the Royal glory of this Nation. What by the Rules of common law and reaſon may be ſayd for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Inſtruments thereof, I ſhall not ſtand to diſpute; I am no Stateſman; but (as a Divine) I am ſure I may ſay, that God hat ſometimes given men Commiſſions that all the World knew not of, nor any in the World beſide themſelves could read or underſtand.</p>
                     <p>Let me clear up this to you (elſe I do nothing, as to the preſent ſtate of things amongſt us) Act. 7.23. <hi>When Moſes was full forty years old, it came into his heart to viſit his Brethren; [It came into his heart,]</hi> that is, from God; God reachd him down a Commiſſion into his heart, that no eye was aware of but his own. In obedience to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he ſets to act. ver. 24. <hi>Finding an Egyptian beating and Iſraelite, he ſmote the Egyptian and ſlew him; ſuppoſing,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>that his Brethren would have underſtood that God by his hand would have delivered Iſrael. [That God by his hand would have delivered them]</hi> not in the ſame way he did deliver them; that doubtleſs was the furtheſt thing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169713:50"/>in <hi>Moſes</hi> thoughts; for you know when God calld to him out of the burning buſh, and told him <hi>he muſt go deliver his People Iſrael,</hi> what a quarter had God with him before he could bring him to't? God is put to work two Miracles to create belief in him; elſe it had been ſoon enough to have wrought them in <hi>Egypt</hi> before <hi>Pharoah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is put there to anſwer five Objections; and further is fain to drill him on with carnal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; <hi>Aaron thy brother he's an eloquent man, can ſpeak well, he'l meet thee at Horeb, and when he ſeeth thee he will be glad in his heart;</hi> thats one of them. <hi>Fear not, go into Egypt, for all that ſought thy life are dead,</hi> there's the other.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſtill <hi>Moſes</hi> hangs off, <hi>till</hi> (the text ſaith) <hi>the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt him:</hi> then he yeelds. Read the third and fourth Chapters of <hi>Exod.</hi> and you'l ſee all this. <hi>Therefore when Moſes ſuppoſed his Brethren would have underſtood, that God, &amp;c.</hi> He nere thought of the way in which he did deliver them. How then? Why, you know he was <hi>called the Son of Pharoahs Daughter,</hi> he was heir apparent to the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and upon <hi>Pharoahs</hi> deceaſe he himſelf ſhould have been <hi>Pharoah</hi> (as is hinted) <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24.25, 26. he was in ſome pauſe and diſpute with himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould uſe means by <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daughter and others, to get his pardon, and ſo come at laſt to the honors, riches, and pleaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169713:50"/>ſhould flie, adhere to Chriſt and a good Conſcience, and ſuffer in this World, as the reſt of Gods People did. It is implied that if he had gon about it, he might have effected the former; but being acted by a principle of Grace he choſe rather to flie and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuppoſed, they ſeing him thus ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly kill and Egyptian to revenge a poor Iſraelites quarrel, would have eaſily gathered and comforted themſelves in this, that if ever he came to be King, he would ſoon deliver them from their ſlavery and oppreſſions. This is the true ſenſe of the verſe, and not that any ſpirit of Propheſie was then upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Well, in the following verſes you'l find by the next dayes viſit and occurrence, that it was known; <hi>then</hi> (the text ſays) <hi>Moſes fled from the face of Pharoah;</hi> well knowing that as to men, and Law, he was guilty of murther; for they could not ſee, nor underſtand the Commiſſion by which he acted; men ſhould not have condemned him, but been better informed by him; God owned and juſtified him in it, he killed a Tyrannical oppreſſor; he had his Commiſſion for what he did, but 'twas an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>But you'l ſay, this was an extraordinary caſe, and therefore not to be brought down to tranſactions of our times. VVhoever thou art that replieſt this, tis but thy, <hi>I,</hi> and my <hi>no;</hi> and my denying is as good as thy affirming, unleſs thy affirmation be backed with a ſtronger reaſon then my negation. I have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169713:51"/>cleared it, that when tis ſayd, <hi>He ſuppoſed they would have underſtood, &amp;c.</hi> this was no ſpirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie upon him.</p>
                     <p>Beſide, had <hi>Moſes</hi> curſed him in the name of the Lord, and he fallen down dead, or the ground had opened and ſwallowed him up alive; or had <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> called down fire from heaven and conſumed him, or the like, then indeed it had been an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſe, an act above nature, yea an act above the power of ordinary grace; but twas neither ſo nor ſo; therefore certainly the caſe was but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and was recorded, and tranſmitted to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Will you pleaſe to conſider the caſe of <hi>Phineas. He finds Zimri and Cozbi committing uncleanneſs, and with a javeling kills them both at once.</hi> Now what could, as to men and Law, be ſaid for this mans act? ſurely nothing that I can bethink my ſelf of, but much againſt him. <hi>He was Phineas the Son of Eleazer, the Prieſt;</hi> what had he to do with the civil ſword of Juſtice? but ſuppoſe he had, was he to do Juſtice in a private way, when Juſtice might have been obtained eaſily in a publike way? Had it not been Charity to have cauſed them to have been apprehended, their ſin laid home to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; peradventure they might have repented; though their bodies had fallen, yet their ſouls might have been ſaved. Had it not been both wiſdom and Piety to have brought them to publike Triall,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169713:51"/>and publique condemnation, and thereupon all the People to have ſtoned them, that ſo others might have ſeen and feared and done no more ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly?</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Phineas</hi> ſteps out of his place, makes himſelf Judge, Jury, Witneſs, Executioner, all; in a heat, ſtabs them both through the guts to Hell. How the Law and men of thoſe times looked upon him in this act, I know not; but this I know, he had a Commiſſion for what he did, that no man in the World knew of, or could read beſide himſelf. Numb. 25.10. <hi>[And the Lord ſayd unto Moſes]</hi> for doutleſs <hi>Moſes</hi> was at a ſtand, and knew not what to think or judge of this Act of his thus Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced; but God inſtructed him concerning it, that <hi>Phineas</hi> in the ſparklings of his zeal, had done well, and excellently well, and he would reward him and his for it, as you may ſee, ver. 11.12, 13. <hi>Behold I give unto him my Convenant of peace. He ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an everlaſting prieſt-hood, becauſe he was zealous for his God.</hi> If you ſhall ſay this was extraordinary, I deny it; what extraordinarineſs can there be for one man with a Javelin to kill two that lye along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him?</p>
                     <p>Whether God gave theſe men that are now in place and power with us [this kinde of Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] for that eminent and exemplary peice of juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, as I will not affirm it, ſo I will not deny it; but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169713:52"/>this is granted of all, they were the Inſtruments in the hand of Divine providence [whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations are alwayes juſt and righteous.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But what might be the reaſon that Chriſt hath ſuch an eminent and incenſed quarrel at Kings? a Viall of wrath is reſerved peculiarly for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My anſwer in general is that which a wiſe man of this Land once ſayd <hi>[Kings of all men have been moſt beholding to God, and God hath been (of all men) leaſt beholding to Kings.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why do you think did God call the four great Kingdoms of the World, Dan. 7. <hi>four great beaſts,</hi> but becauſe the Kings and Rulers of each of them, were as ſo many wild, raging, untamed beaſts, prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the poor Peoples eſtates and perſons at their pleaſure, ſetting up their own wills for a Law; and none of them ſo cruel this way as the <hi>Roman Monarchy.</hi> Dan. 7.7. <hi>Behold the fourth Beaſt was dreadfull, and terrible, and ſtrong exceedingly, and it had great iron teeth, and it devoured and brake in peices, and ſtamped the reſidue with its feet, and it was diverſe from all the beaſts that were before it, and it had ten horns.</hi> Theſe ten horns are ten <hi>Europaean</hi> Kings, and who ever reckons them up, I finde, brings in the [Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi>] for one of the horns of this terrible and fearfull Monſter.</p>
                     <p>See yet more of theſe <hi>Europaean</hi> Kings, Rev. 17.12, 13, 14. <hi>The ten horns which thou ſaweſt are ten Kings. Theſe have one mind and ſhall give their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169713:52"/>and ſtrength to the Beaſt; Theſe ſhall make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhall over-come them, for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi> To have gone on in wayes of violence &amp; oppreſſion towards any ſort of people, had been enough to have ſet Chriſt againſt them; but when theſe ten Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> ſucceſſively have one minde for the Beaſt, give their power and ſtrength to the Beaſt, to make war with the Saints and with the Lamb: do you marvel at that which follows? the Lamb falls par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and after a ſpecial manner upon them, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the <hi>European</hi> Kings, as being reſolved to have this known in the World, <hi>that [he] is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hiſtory tells us, that in the years four and five hundred after Chriſt, the Barbarous Nations of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> broke the weſtern Empire all to peices, at which time the <hi>Saxons</hi> were ſetled in <hi>England, Franches</hi> in <hi>Gall,</hi> the weſt <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Eaſt <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Almains</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> theſe growing into civil States, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their manners change their religion, cloſe with the Pope, ſettle their Governments ſo as was moſt ſutable, yea ſerviceable to his Intereſt. And the Pope got in upon their Conſciences, and brought them into Oaths and Obligations to defend the Rights and Priviledges of holy Church, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian againſt the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:169713:53"/>
                     <p>And now when the time of Chriſts taking the Kingdoms of this World into his own hands draws dear, the moſt of theſe <hi>European</hi> Kings are yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly for the Pope, in oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt, to keep him out.</p>
                     <p>Do you all know this? and do you ask a reaſon why Chriſt pours out wrath upon the Political fun of every Nation of <hi>Europe,</hi> why he makes the thrones of Kings to totter?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bvt you'l ſay, the Kings of</hi> England <hi>caſt off the Pope long ſince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, <hi>Henry</hi> the eight (it cannot be denyed) did caſt off his Supremacy, but <hi>Jehu</hi> like (as <hi>Calvin</hi> hath obſerved of him) ſo far as ſerved his own, turn, in Temporals only, but was ſtill zealous upon the ſix Articles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denyed any of thoſe Articles of Popery, they were burnt for it.</p>
                     <p>Then came that bleſſed child, and doubtleſs now glorified Saint of God, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, into the Throne, who repealed the ſix Articles, threw Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages out of Churches, and furniſhed the Land with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Service-boook or Liturgie: He had Wars with <hi>Scotland,</hi> Inſurrections at home, a plain War in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> his time very ſhort, his age very green; We cannot blame him for reforming no more, but muſt wonder at him, and bleſs God for his reforming ſo much.</p>
                     <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (you know) brought us again
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169713:53"/>full ſail into the Popes arms or boſom; but let her Reign paſs in a red Parentheſis.</p>
                     <p>Next came Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and, to give her her juſt praiſe, made ſome encreaſe or improvement of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reformation; but yet for all that (if the real truth might be ſpoken out) <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were ſtill faſt tied together by the tails of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, Ceremonies, and form of worſhip, the waters whereof ſwelled high in King <hi>James</hi> time, and became a Land flood all over the three Nations after his deceaſe, drowning ſome, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying others full Tyde back again to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'le tell you if you'l hear me with meekneſs and patience of ſpirit, what ſatisfies me; that he fell for the Popiſh Antichriſtian Intereſt, (which if well underſtood, Peoples ſpirits would more acquieſce in his fall, then now they do.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There was this upon his account, the profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day by a Law; I mean, by that wretched book of ungodly Sports and Liberties. The day which our Lord Chriſt and the reformed Laws of the Land had ſet apart for all ſorts of People to have ſtudied the Scriptures, encreaſed their Spiritual knowledge, and their faith, againſt all falſe Doctrine and Worſhip; and for the People to be authorized and inſtigated by the edict of a King to gaming, ſporting, mixt danceing on that day; (as you know they were,) what could the Pope himſelf, had be been in <hi>England</hi> (conſidering
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169713:54"/>the ſtate of the Nation) have done more, or been more Popiſhly politique for the undermining, for the undoing of our religion, as the beſt and ſpeedieſt means of uſhering in his own? Had the Sabbath taken its name according to his deſire in that edict, it might rather have been called <hi>Dies Daemoniacus,</hi> then <hi>Dominicus,</hi> the Divels day then the Lords day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Never was any man a more ſtiff upholder of Epiſcopacy then he was, which indeed is nothing elſe but the Popes Supremacy (only under another name) multiplied, or broken into ſo many peices, everyone whereof hath the form and nature of the whole. Was not every Biſhop in his Dioceſs a little Pope lording over both the flock &amp; his co-presbyters? This peice of Popery he held faſt to his dying day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He ſuffered the Biſhops ſo to mannage and improve the reliques of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Kingdom, the whole rabble of Ceremonies, (<hi>Calvin</hi> called them <hi>tolerabiles ineptiae,</hi> by give me leave (as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience hath taught) to call them <hi>into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerabiles ineptiae,</hi> intolerale fooleries) I ſay to improve them ſo to the Popiſh intereſt, that many hundred precious witneſſes of Jeſus Chriſt were impriſoned, perſecuted, forced into ſtrange Countries, yea many of them to take up their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in a Wilderneſs amongſt wild beaſt, and more ſavage men; Nay ſome blood was ſhed in a publike and juridicial way; by <hi>Gallio</hi> cared for none of theſe things, ſtood an idle unconcernd ſpectator,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169713:54"/>I fear I am too <hi>benignus interpres,</hi> more favourable to him, as to this particular, then he deſerved; We uſe to ſay (you know) <hi>qui non vetat peccare &amp;c.</hi> He that doth not forbid, yea ſuppreſs ſin, when he's able, commands it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There was Maſſe, and Maſſe Prieſts, Idols and the worſhip of the Beaſt, I might ſay of divels (for ſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks Rev 9.20.) ſet up by conjugal promiſe and Covenant, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept and obſerved; I mean, the <hi>French</hi> Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, from whence went no ſmall animation and protection to Prieſts and Popery clean through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I cannot but lay at his door, that new common prayer book that had firſt been at <hi>Rome</hi> (I have had it from ſome of deep inſpection into State-affairs) and was there confirmed by the Popes own hand, and then ſent by that Arch-prelate into <hi>Scotland,</hi> about fourteen years ago. Their throats being too narrow to ſwallow it, they were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaimed <hi>[Rebells]</hi> in all the pariſh Churches and Chappels in <hi>England,</hi> proclaimed <hi>[Rebells.]</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the <hi>[King]</hi> was affronted and diſobayed in their rejection of it; VVhereupon an Army was raiſed againſt them, thinking to have forced that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſs upon them, but at <hi>Barwick</hi> God gave him the Check.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, His arming Papiſts by Proclamation to deſtroy his Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and his making
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169713:55"/>peace with the <hi>Iriſh rebels,</hi> and proclaiming them his good Catholike Subjects, (what other language could have come out of the Popes own mouth?) Thus he openly profeſſedly joyned intereſt with the Antichriſtian Party. You may be ſure, Papiſts in both Kingdoms would never have run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives and Eſtates with him in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate a war, but that they well ſaw and knew (if the day were his, whereof they made no queſtion) how to make no ſmall advantage to themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true Proteſtant, yea and had promiſes and aſſurances thereof from him.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That title of <hi>Defender of the faith</hi> (for which I know I ſhall be much wondred at) was found upon him, as likewiſe upon his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He for his part, had been a ſorry defender of godly zealous Proteſtants (the Lord knows) from firſt to laſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it is a Mark ſet upon the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by the Popes own hand, is better known then can be denyed. King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth wrote a book againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> (I have ſeen it,) he inflicted death upon diverſe that owned Goſpel light and diſclaimed Popery; whereupon the Pope ſent him this Title <hi>(Defender of the faith)</hi> with a great ſword, to ſlaughter (indeed) the true ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. Let any man judge whether this was not a mark of the Beaſt upon him, and twas ambitiouſly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169713:55"/>derived one from another. King <hi>Edward</hi> and and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhould have caſt off this as ſoon and as zealouſly any of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I remember <hi>Luther</hi> ſays in one place, <hi>That if the Pope, as Pope, ſhould command him to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or preach to the People, he would not (therefore) do it.</hi> Chriſt would not ſuffer the divels to call him the Son of God, (though indeed he were ſo,) yea he would not own his own name and Titles out of their mouth; he took it as no honor at all to him. Thus our Kings, when this Title came to them from the Pope, they ſhould have thrown his title at his face again, and told him that God had given them the civil ſword which they would not bear in vain, but zealouſly and conſtantly defend the true Goſpel faith of Jeſus Chriſt, without his command; and for his Title, they looked upon it as no honor at all to them, but a dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</p>
                     <p>Well, now that Chriſt is gone forth to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, not onely for Popery it ſelf, but even for the leaſt dregs of it in all places of the world, this mark of the Beaſt alſo was found upon him, yea and actions tending to the Popes mind and ſenſe upon it. Where Chriſt finds the leaſt ſignes or marks of the Beaſt, ſuch ſhall certainly feel his wrath; much more cauſe had Chriſt to pour out a Vial of wrath and juſtice on him, upon whom ſo much of Antichriſt and his Intereſt was manifeſtly found;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169713:56"/>and if one Inſtrument will not do it, another ſhall.</p>
                     <p>I am perſwaded, had not our neighbour Nation owned &amp; proclaimed him whom they did, the hand of providence had never raiſed this ſtorm againſt them. I do not lay this down as a certain Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (for, <hi>Judicia Dei non ſunt temere diſcutienda, ſed formidoloſo ſilentio veneranda,</hi>) tis only my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, which you may receive or reject, as God ſhall guide your hearts. Yet I am not more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that this book of the Bible came out of the mouth of God, then that the childe is born who ſhall ſee a general tottering and ſhivering to peices of Thrones and Scepters; and that-upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the quarrel that is already one foot between Chriſt and Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Begin at forty one, or thereabouts, and make up a Century, and obſerve it in your dayes, and then leave it to your children to be obſerved by them, if this now current Century, I ſay, be not more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to moſt or all that hold Scepters in their hands, but eſpecially to <hi>Europaean</hi> Scepters, then ever any was ſince this World began. The text is expreſs Rev. 16.14 16.18. Chiefly in reference to Kings, who (being confederate in a crafty war, having fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions but exceeding bad intentions) marched in the head of their Regiments againſt, (indeed) Chriſt and his Kingdom: but a Divine <hi>Anathema</hi> or curſe falls upon [them;] <hi>there is an Earthquake
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169713:56"/>raiſed, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the Earth, ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great;</hi> to anſwer the greatneſs of the adverſaries engaged againſt him; to ſhake to pieces thoſe great and mighty ones of the Earth, which an ordinary Earthquake could not have effected.</p>
                     <p>But how can this be? for tis ſaid Rev. 17.16. <hi>The ten Horns which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire.</hi> The Pope falls by them, and not they by adhering to the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I anſwer, what I have ſayd to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, you ſee, I have built upon plain Scriptures, and I think according to the ſenſe and mind of the Holy Ghoſt in them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by <hi>[Hornes]</hi> here, it is not needfull to underſtand Kings in the ſtrictneſs and formality of the Notion; and my reaſon is gathered from Rev: 17.9.10. <hi>The ſeven Heads are alſo ſeven Kings, five are fallen, and one is.</hi> Here, Conſuls, Tribunes, Decemvirs, Dictators are called by the Holy Ghoſt [Kings.] when as we know, ſtrictly, they were not ſo, onely they had Supream power in their hands.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, What Proteſtant, whoſe eyes are open, doth not ſee that moſt or all the Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> in their preſent poſture, are directly framed for the Popes intereſt. Indeed his and their [now] intereſt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169713:57"/>make up one Linſey Woolſey piece; they are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven and mixt, that Chriſt muſt be fain to open the whole fabrick of Kingly Government to the very foundations thereof, before the curſed roots and ſeeds of the myſtery of iniquity will be got out.</p>
                     <p>Will you tell me, that he who lately ſwayed the Scepter here, and he that now endeavours to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, would ever have been perſwaded, ſo to hate, as to make war againſt Pope and Papiſts, for the ſetting up in the World Goſpel-Ordinances in their purity and power? and if it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the preſent Proteſtant Princes, can it in reaſon be hoped for, from the preſent Popiſh Princes? therefore they are in no ſmall danger, moſt or all of them, to be ſhaken quite to peices by the Earthquake.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the ſtrength of a beaſt, to do his greateſt hurt, lies in his horns; they are the higheſt and moſt eminent parts of him; and ſo by <hi>[ten hornes,]</hi> is meant only, [the ſupream power of the ten Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by what names or Titles ſoever they are called.] Chriſt by the Earthquake will ſhake down thoſe powers in whom are found a deal of carnal &amp; Popiſh dregs, and ſet up thoſe in their room that are men of other ſpirits, <hi>pares negotio,</hi> fit for ſuch a buſineſs as Chriſt hath in hand. Doubtleſs, the ten horns, are the [ten Supream Powers] of <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſhal do the deed, that is ſo much deſired and prayed for of all the Saints.</p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:169713:57"/>
                     <p>And now if any man herein differ from me, let him differ, I judge him not.</p>
                     <p>God forbid that in ruining Antichriſt, I my ſelf ſhould be ſo Antichriſtian, as to attempt to Lord it over the faith of any man; Why ſhould I be offended, that thou canſt not ſee that which I ſee; nor believe as I belive? (if God intends thee good, I doubt not, but he'l find a time to reveal even this unto thee, that one civil Government is no more of Divine right then another, and that thy Conſcience ought not to engage or give it ſelf up <hi>in perpetuum</hi> to any one of them, but thou art free from Oaths &amp; Convenants when tis ſufficiently clear God hath layd aſide that civil power to whom thou didſt ſo ſwear or Covenant.) Onely I think it but reaſon to entreat this of thee, that fancy, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of argument, cuſtome, novelty of the things delivered, private ends and aims, ſelf intereſt, may not be layd in the ballance againſt me; theſe are poor, beggarly, chaffi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, irrational things; be carefull to ſtart from me upon ſome ſolidity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I do profeſs in the ſight of God, that as I have balked nothing for fear of any mans diſpleaſure (for though I reſpect and honour many men: yet, ſo far as I know my own heart, I fear no man) ſo neither have I brought in or delivered any thing purpoſely to grieve or provoke any mans ſpirit. I hope, I have otherwiſe learned Chriſt; You have it in the ſingleneſs of my heart, ſo as God brought it to my hand.</p>

                     <p>The fifth Angel <hi>poured out his Vial upon the ſeat of the beaſt,</hi> (Rev. 16.10, 11.) Here Expoſitors do generally pitch upon the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be [this ſeat] of the beaſt; But ſure, tis not ſenſe to ſpeak of the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> till <hi>Euphrates be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up,</hi> which is under the ſixrh Vial; and you muſt know that the Vials are placed in this Chapter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of events or tranſactions; and therefore the Popes material ſeat cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by this Vial.

                     <p>A throne (you know) admits but of one; finde a Government where one alone doth rule, and what can this be but Epiſcopacy? Epiſcopacie is a is a Government where one and no more hath the Throne or Seat; all the reſt keep their diſtance and are under Command.</p>
                     <p>There were holy and learned men, as <hi>Beza, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, Bains, Parker,</hi> who caſt ſome drops of wrath upon this Seat; but twas not long, ere all <hi>Scotland</hi> got the Vial into their hands, and poured it out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Epiſcopacy to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Then came the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and rooted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169713:58"/>up Epiſcocal Government by the very roots; and in both Nations it was done with a great deal of Judgement, Wiſdom, Courage, Piety. <hi>[And his Kingdom was full of darkneſs.]</hi> So our tranſlation; but the Greek imports but this, <hi>[his kingdom was darkned]</hi> what <hi>Scotland</hi> had done in a judicial way, and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had done in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial way, I ſay, when the news thereof came to the Popes ears, to the ears his Cardinals, Jeſuites, and all his religious orders, and Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> can you imagine leſs but it was black and ſad news to them, and news of a dangerous conſequence, and a ſhrewd perſage to all the lovers and upholders of that Government? what a deal of Popiſh luſtre and glory was there in the three Nations by reaſon of Epiſcopacy, Eaſt, Hoſt, Altar, Tapers, Copes, Surpleſſes, dreſſing up of Chappels with the Pictures of Chriſt, Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Apoſtles, Adorning Church-Widdows with the ſtories of the Bible in time to have become Laymens books, Altar-adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sacrament-adoration, Organs, Singing of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; that travellors, from beyond Seas, when they ſaw the poſture of things, would ſay one to another, we are at home, were but the ſervice in Latine as tis in Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>And what great hopes had the Pope of the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of theſe Kingdoms to himſelf again? and all by means of that height of Epiſcopacy amongſt us. But when a Vial full of wrath was poured out upon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169713:59"/>it (according as you have heard) how was the popiſh luſtre and glory in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> quite put out? and a very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of loſs, ſorrow, and darkneſs brought in upon the Popes whole dominions, ſo as made them ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally bite their tongues for madneſs, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Vial is <hi>poured out upon the great river Euphrates. Euphrates</hi> muſt be here taken myſtically, for that which is the maintenance and defence of <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian, as that river was anciently of old <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are five ſtreams of baſeneſs that run into one, and ſo make up this great <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> mentions them Rev. 9.20, 21. Images, Murthers, Sorceries, Fornications, Thefts; by theſe <hi>Rome</hi> hath encreaſed her wealth, and by theſe <hi>Rome</hi> hath been upheld and ſecured.</p>
                     <p>Now when the ten Chriſtian Kings or Supream Powers ſhall be ſo far converted to God, and have the eyes of their underſtanding ſo far enlightned, as to ſee all this their perverting of Religion, and theſe groſs abuſes, out the Chriſtian world, their hearts will then riſe againſt her, ſo as to dry up, and withdraw theſe ſtreams of baſe revenues, by which they have been ſo enriched and defended. They'l pull down Images, whereby the ſimple people have been deluded; ſeverely puniſh their Sorceries, whereby they have ſo awed and terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169713:59"/>the World; their fornications and whoriſh ſtews, whereby ſo many have been daily drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſenſuality and undone eternally; they'l put an end to their Inquiſitions, whereby ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants of God have been cruelly murther'd; an end alſo to their ſpiritual Thefts, and Robberies, when they perceive the merits of the Alſufficient ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt is held forth to them freely for the remiſſion of ſins, according to that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1.2. They'l refuſe to trade with them any more for their rotten creature-righteouſneſs; their Pardons and Indulgences ſhall bring in no more treaſures into the Popes Coffers; they'l part with no more monies to have the ſouls of their departed friends prayed and ſung out of Purgatory, and will caſt all their Trumperies out of their dominions. And thus ſhall the great river <hi>Euphrates</hi> be dryed up; <hi>[That be way may be prepared for the Kings of the East,]</hi> that is, that the ten Kings or Supream powers, now finding (in the eye of reaſons) the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> feaſable, may encourage one another to the work, and diſpatch it: they are called Kings of the Eaſt, in alluſion to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who came Eaſt from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and took it. Or thus, <hi>[that way may be made for the Kings of the Eaſt] i. e.</hi> for the briging home the People of the Jews, who are here called Kings. You may ſee another notable interpretation of this Vial in Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> Sermon preaced before the Houſe Aug. 28. 1644. page 41.</p>

                     <p>The ſeventh and laſt Vial is <hi>poured out into the Air.</hi> The Air in which the <hi>Antichriſtian world</hi> lives, <hi>is the ſmoak of the bottomleſs Pit, Rev.</hi> 9. or the darkneſs of Ignorance; for out of this came their <hi>Locuſts,</hi> all their helliſh Doctrines and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Upon the pouring out of this Vial, the Glory of the Son of Righteouſneſs, and of Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doth ſo break forth, as quite prevails againſt that <hi>Infernal Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Ignorance</hi> which bred Papacy, and in which Papacy had ſo long breathed and lived: and ſo the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Air being deſtroyed, they fall a gaſping, and the pangs of Death come upon them: for immediately there comes a voyce from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>[Tis done]</hi> there's an end of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Kingdom, and all the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let me ſpeak a little to the following verſes. Verſe 18. <hi>[There were voyces, and thunderings, and lightnings]</hi> and (as it were) the ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets upon mens Spirits, that make their hearts quake and tremble within them: and alſo <hi>a great earth-quake; ſuch a one as was not ſince men wer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth; ſo mighty and ſo great.</hi> Theſe will be ſad days with the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> party; ſuch thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, voyces, lightnings from above; ſuch an earth-quake from beneath them; the face of things threatning as if Heaven and Earth would come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Do you marvel if at their Worlds end, they be at their Wits end?</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:169713:60"/>
                     <p>The effects of theſe lightnings, thunders, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, follow <hi>verſe</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>[The great City was divided into three parts.]</hi> But by this <hi>Great City,</hi> I underſtand <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, which was ſhaken into three factions, and ſo became weak, that it could not defend it ſelf againſt the Beſiegers.</p>
                     <p>There have been three factions amongſt us, (I call them <hi>Factions,</hi> onely becauſe each have ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of other) peradventure it will run upon a threefold Party of Faction to the end of the War. <hi>[Then the Citits of the Nations fell] i. e.</hi> fell off from her, and left her doſolate of all former help and comfort; and ſo <hi>[Babylon the great came into remembrance before God, [to give unto her the cup of the wine of the feirceneſs of his wrath.]</hi> See how this is expreſſed Rev. 18.8. <hi>Her plagues come in one day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire.</hi> The latter end of that nineteenth verſe doubtleſs looks as far as the great battel of God Almighty, the iſſue whereof is ſet down, Rev. 19, 20. the <hi>Beaſt was taken and with him the falſe prophet, and were both caſt alive into the Lake of fire burning with brimſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet all this contents not Chriſt; he ſtill goes on to purſue his Victory, Rev. 16.20. <hi>[Every Iſland fled away, and the mountains were not found.]</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo remote as the Iſlands, nothing ſo ſtrong as the Mountains; but the Antichriſtian Iſlands fled
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:169713:61"/>and periſhed before the ſtroak of Chriſt; the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were beaten to duſt: Chriſt will not leave Papacy ſo much as a Mountain to flie to, or an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to hide itſelf in; he'l leave no peice of the frame of Antichriſtianiſme ſtanding in any part of the World.</p>
                     <p>And yet ſtill he goes on, ver. 21. <hi>[There fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every ſtone about the weight of a Talent, and men blaſphemed God becauſe of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.]</hi> Here is an Alluſion to Ezek. 13.11. to 16. I conceive the genuine ſenſe of the verſe to be this. Thoſe ten Kings or Supream powers who follow Jeſus Chriſt in this Expedition, have Commiſſions, or Commands from the God of Heaven, (though <hi>Rome</hi> be burnt, yea and the great battell of God Almighty fought and finiſhed) to go on with their braining, deſtroying judgements, upon all thoſe everywhere, wo are found to have had any intereſt in the Popes cauſe or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in worſhipping the Beaſt, or any way been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for his preſervation and defence. They ſhall be purſued and deſtroyed with ſuch plagues and judgements as that it ſhall be evident, they are from God, and that heaven it ſelf fights againſt them, to root out that accurſed race to the laſt man from off the Earth.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe by this time you are all willing and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169713:61"/>ready to ſet your ſeals to this truth, that, <hi>[The Pope (who is the great Antichriſt) and his Kingdom ſhall be deſtroyed with moſt remarkable deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I know, the firſt <hi>Quaere</hi> youl make within your ſelves upon what hath been delivered, and deſire ſome ſatisfaction in, wil be that of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Mat. 24.3. <hi>tell us when ſhall theſe things be; and what ſhall be the ſign of their comming?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I confeſs theſe are marvellous hard Queſtions; but I ſhall freely tell you my thoughts upon them. I find the time of Antichriſts reign ſet down Rev. 11.2. <hi>The Holy city ſhall he tread under foot forty two months,</hi> &amp; alſo Rev. 13.5. <hi>and it was given him to continue forty and two moneths,</hi> (by the way, let me tell you, his reign is reckoned by the moon, which rules the night, to hint thus much to us, that Antichriſts works are night works, his whole reign is a reign of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) but, to the thing itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Forty and two months, allowing thirty dayes to a moneth (for they are <hi>Lunar</hi> moneths, I told you) make up a thouſand two hundred and thereeſcore days, the juſt time of the witneſſes propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſackcloth, Rev. 11. or three years and a half.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I underſtand theſe numbers of a certain and determinate time, becauſe every one of them is a broken number; round numbers as we call them, ten, a hundred, a thouſand are put moſt times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinately,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169713:62"/>a certain for an uncertain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but this is not a round, but a broken num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe 42. months, or three years and a half, cannot be taken ſtrictly for 42. of our months, or three of our years and a half; becauſe (as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you before) tis an utter impoſſibility that the Riſe and Growth, the Glory, and all the buſineſs of his Kingdome, ſhould be compaſſed in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Thirdly, they muſt be taken accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.6. <hi>I have appointed thee each day for a year.</hi> Every day in theſe 42 months being put for a year, the whole amounts to 1260 years, the juſt raign of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> But when the time of his raign did begin, confident I am, there is no man alive (without extraordinary Revelation) can ſpeak certainly, and to a day: and hereupon it is that all divines are at a loſs as to a punctual certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for his fall and ruin.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the time of the ſeetting forth of this Giant to run his courſe, there are two or three opinions, and I ſhall quickly tell them unto you.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Some begin it as high as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> when he left <hi>Rome,</hi> about the 19. year of his raign, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Eaſt.</item>
                        <item>2. Others place it as low as about the year 455. when <hi>Genſericus</hi> the <hi>Vandal</hi> took and burnt <hi>Rome,</hi>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:169713:62"/>at which time the Empire was broken all to pieces, and utterly extinct.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>There are a third ſort who pitch it about the year 410. or 412. when <hi>Alaricus</hi> the <hi>Goth</hi> came and conquered, and ranſacked <hi>Rome.</hi> Now they who ſay his 1260 years began when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> left <hi>Rome,</hi> pitch his fall about <hi>Luthers</hi> time, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above 100 years ago. They who ſay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at 455. make his fall and ruin 65. years yet to come. They who affirm it began 410. or 412. lay him on his Death bed about twenty years hence.</p>
                     <p>It may be you will ask me my opinion amongſt theſe.</p>
                     <p>Truly in a buſineſs of this abſtruſeneſs, twould be wiſedom to put you off with other mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conceal my own; but I ſtill finde that the ſigleneſs of my ſpirit gets the predominancy of my Politicks.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I like their opinion well who reckoning from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> pitch his fall in <hi>Luthers</hi> time; for indeed <hi>Luther</hi> laid the foundation of his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ruin. It is not unuſual with Scripture to ſay, a work is done (if it be of God) <hi>when tis but begun, Revel.</hi> 16.17. for it ſhall be as certainly done, as if it were done already: God calls things that are not, as if they were.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I think their Concluſion may be right, who counting from 455. ſpin out his life to threeſcore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169713:63"/>years hence and upward; but ſure tis to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>that great battel of God Almighty,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.19, 20. I verily perſwade my ſelf, they who live threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore years hence, ſhall neither ſee <hi>Pope,</hi> nor form of <hi>Popery</hi> eſtabliſhed by a law, defended by a power in any Kingdome in the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They moſt take with me, who counting from 410. pitch his fall 20. years hence; for about the year 410. or 412. the ten Horns or Kingdoms (as Hiſtorians generally tell us) were fairly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and ſurely the ſixt head was going off at leaſt, if not quite off, when ſome of the horns that grew on the ſeventh head, were ſo viſible. The <hi>Pope</hi> muſt of neceſſity be before them; for he is the ſeventh head upon which thoſe horns grew; it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12. <hi>They receive power one hour,</hi> or (as the Original might be better rendred) the firſt hour <hi>[with the beaſt.]</hi> But ſome read it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not <hi>[with]</hi> but ſomewhat <hi>[af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter]</hi> the beaſt.</p>
                     <p>And indeed about this time the <hi>Popes</hi> ſhewed themſelves openly to all the world, and ſpake out what they wounld have, that the cenſures of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all other cauſes of moment, ought to be reſerved to the Audience of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> calling themſelves the <hi>Father of Fathers, and Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the year 413.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169713:63"/>ſent and acquainted <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> with their Acts, deſiring him <hi>That he would add his Authority;</hi> his Anſwer was to this effect, <hi>That they had due regard of the Sea Apoſtolick, and of him who had the care and charge of all the Churches;</hi> the very language of the <hi>Beaſtly Antichriſt, Rev.</hi> 13.7. So that at this time we may ſafely conclude him actually ſet down in his Chair of Peſtilence; and thence may as ſafely conclude, that his <hi>Throne,</hi> to wit, <hi>the City of Rome,</hi> and the glorious viſibility of his raign and Kingdom, will be laid in the duſt twenty years hence.</p>
                     <p>In a buſineſs of this Nature, you ought in reaſon make ſome grains of allowance to our gueſs: poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly it may fall out three or four years either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or over; and what will you ſay if it fall out that <hi>Rome</hi> will be begirt and burnt too, about 16. years hence?</p>
                     <p>I'le tell you what my opinion is built upon; that of <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> the laſt, <hi>Let him that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, count the [number of the beaſt,] His number is ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix.</hi> Obſerve tis indefinitely called <hi>the number of the beaſt;</hi> the Holy Ghoſt may perhaps ſpeak much in a little, two things at once: thus, that 666. is the number of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> his name, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the number alſo of his raign expired, that his Seat and Throne ſhall be pulled down and burnt, his formall viſible reign ſhall be at an end about the year 666.</p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:169713:64"/>
                     <p>But in this (I confeſs) I have no man to ſtand by me; tis onely my opinion, which ſtarted up in me upon my poring upon that Text: yet I have this to countenance me; the Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>The Earth-quake that muſt ſhake his Throne and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome all to pieces</hi> (when once it begins, and for my part, I am ſatisfied tis begun) <hi>will be a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty and ſo great, Rev.</hi> 16. And this may be ſome Anſwer to thoſe who think theres more work then can be done in ſo ſhort a time: When God ſets upon it, he will make quick work with him. The Earth-quake being ſo mighty and ſo violent, may poſſibly reach the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi> by that time; after which Popery will have a being for ſome years.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rome</hi> is burnt in the 18. Chapter of the <hi>Revel.</hi> But the <hi>Beaſt and falſe Prophet, with their Armies,</hi> their deſtruction is deſcribed in the 19. Chapter, as being (I ſuppoſe) to be done ſome ſpace of years after.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but there are divers of you who hear me this day, that ſhall out-live <hi>Romes</hi> ruin; and that your childrens children will moſt certainly out-live the great battel of God Almighty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> ſhall be utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But what ſhall the ſign of theſe things be?</hi> Why, let me tell you, Scripture hath given a ſign of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169713:64"/>ruine, and thats the killing of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Concerning which, I ſhall briefly premiſe a few things, as,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that they are not to be reſtrained to any ſort of men; for tis ſayd of them Rev. 11.4. <hi>Theſe are the [two Olive-trees,] and the two [Candleſticks] ſtanding before the God of the Earth.</hi> In calling them the Olive-trees, the Holy Ghoſt doubtleſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to Zach. 4. Where <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Magiſtrate and the Prieſt, are in the viſion, the two Olive-trees, in the interpretation, the two annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones that ſtand by the Lord of the whole Eaarth: the witneſſes Comprehended all thoſe Magiſtrates and Miniſters that have in any juncture of time (out of a principle of Religion and Conſcience for God) any way ſet themſelves againſt the Pope. By <hi>[Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks]</hi> we are taught from Chriſts own mouth, to underſtand <hi>[Churches,]</hi> Rev. 1.20. <hi>The ſeven Candleſticks which thou ſaweſt, are ſeven Churches.</hi> The reſt of Saints and Churches added to Godly Magiſtrates and Miniſters, make up the witneſſes. And we muſt needs take them thus; for the Holy Ghoſt divides all throughout the reign of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> into but two witneſſes (or Prophets) and the Gentiles, Rev. 11. So that all beſide thoſe of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Party or Faction, are witneſſes, or are of the witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are ſayd to be two;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In relation to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169713:65"/>brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> who brought the People of God from their <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity: So theſe bring the Church of Chriſt out of the more then <hi>Egyptian Babylonian</hi> bondage of Popery.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are ſayd to be two in reference to the legality of their teſtimony, two being a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number in Law to bear witneſs againſt him: and ſo God to be juſtified in their condemnation as being clear and righteous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For their paucity; thoſe who witneſſed againſt him were but a very few in every Nation in reſpect to thoſe droves and innumerable Multitudes that followed him; all the World wondered after the Beaſt, though toward the end of their Propheſie they grow apace (Rev. 14.6, 7, 8.) <hi>I ſaw another Angel flie in the [midſt] of heaven having the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel to preach to every Nation, Kindred, Tongue, People, ſaying fear God, give glory to him; for the hour of his judgement is come. And there followed another Angel ſaying Babylon is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> that is, hath begun to fall, ſince <hi>Luther</hi> and others have ſo publikely and openly preached the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes that ſince we have called the Pope <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> his Kingdom hath waſted and been incomparably leſs then before; the witneſſes have increaſed, the Gentiles have decreaſed; but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the moſt of his reign they were but two; very
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169713:65"/>weak and inconſiderable was the number that ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Antichriſt hath been killing witneſſes all along, Rev. 11.2. <hi>The holy City ſhall they tread under foot [forty and two moneths]</hi> throughout his whole domination hath he been been ſtamping Saints to duſt, in every age, in every Kingdom; but that ſlaughter of the witneſſes the ſpirit of God ſo largely deſcribes, and points the finger to, as the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the indubitable ſign or fore-runner of his ſudden downfall, I take to be done at one time, and in one place.</p>
                     <p>It is notoriouſly known what our Prelates did in <hi>England,</hi> how for a long time they ſet themſelves againſt the zealous Proteſtant; and by means of their Courts, Canons, Ceremonies, book of ſports, new &amp;c. Oath, they ſilenced, made to hide in Corners, drove into ſtrange Countries, Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, thouſands upon thouſands.</p>
                     <p>At laſt there roſe up two or there ſomewhat more bold then their fellows, whom they took and made them high Examples off their Popiſh juſtice and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, cut off their ears, and ſent them to priſons, far diſtant one from another.</p>
                     <p>How much they glorified and pleaſed themſelves in this their Conqueſt, you all know: and doubtleſs this fact of Proteſtant Biſhops (for ſo they were called) was an univerſal token to the Popiſh World that the day was theirs. If Proteſtant Biſhops
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169713:66"/>(ſay they) have done ſo valiantly for <hi>Romes</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſurely the day is ours, and perfect Victory is got.</p>
                     <p>Now let me ſhew you (but very briefly) how the Circumſtances of that Providence ſtand in joynt with the Text, both the thing itſelf, and the ſequeles of it.</p>
                     <p>For the thing itſelf;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Beaſt ſet upon them when they had finiſhed their teſtimonie, ver. 7. The ſtricteſt ſenſe may not be put upon this; for when they have quite finiſhed their teſtimony, the beaſt will be abſolutely ruined, he and they being contemporaries, Rev. 11.2.3. they both begin and end together; elſe Chriſt ſhould have none to be for him during ſome part of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> raign: therefore it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when they were [about] to finiſh their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, had brought it [almoſt to a period] becauſe the [Beaſts] raign and Kingdom was come [almoſt to a period.]</p>
                     <p>This war is to be when Antichriſt is near upon his fall; may it not then be looked for in our time, when he is grown ſo old and gray-headed, of his 1260. years having run up a 1240. or little leſs: Seeing that from <hi>Daniel, Paul</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> we underſtand the ruine of the man of ſin to fall into the lap of the Century wherin we live; the more ſafely may any man conclude, that what hath fallen out in our times, may be the killing of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169713:66"/>witneſſes, and ſignal token of his ruine. It conſiſts well enough with the Text for the time wherein the Witneſſes are to be killed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The text well looked into and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, doth clearly give it to be not a bloody, but [myſtical or civil ſlaughter] ver. 7. compared with verſe 11. their reſurrection is not a proper, but a civil or Myſtical reſurrection (as ſhall anon be made good) therefore it muſt needs follow (to thoſe who love not to be contentious) that ſuch alſo muſt be their death (there being ſtill the ſame reaſon of Oppoſites,) turned out of their places, ſilenced, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from ſpeaking, moving, or acting in a publike way: but thus we know, the men ſpoken of, were killed and lay dead.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They thus lay dead (the text ſaith) <hi>In the ſtreet of the great City,</hi> which is ſpiritually called <hi>Sodom, Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was crucified, ver. 8. <hi>Rome</hi> is elegantly here deſcribed to be <hi>Sodom</hi> for uncleanneſs, <hi>Egypt</hi> for idolatry, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for murther, <hi>Oh Ieruſalem thou that killeſt the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> It is called the <hi>[great City]</hi> as being made up of its ten Kingdoms; and in the <hi>[ſtreet]</hi> (tis not ſtreets) but in the ſtreet or in that Kingdom where they ſhall be killed, there they ſhall lie, that whole Kingdom or dominion being a ſtreet of the great City ſo made up, whereto agrees the ſlaughter of theſe men being killed in one place, which then was within <hi>Romes</hi> boundary, and that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects.</p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:169713:67"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, In the ſtreet they lay <hi>[unburied,]</hi> they were not ſuffered to be put in graves, ver. 9. (this alſo muſt be expounded myſtically) thoſe that are put in graves, are out of every ones eye; theſe dead men their friends were not ſuffered to afford them graves, that is, to allow them any harbour or hiding place; all muſt ſhut them out of doores; but they lay there where their Enemies might feed and glut their eye upon their miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They were in this condition for the <hi>[ſpace of three dayes and a half]</hi> ver. 9. Which (being a broken number) do certainly point out a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate time; neither can they be taken ſtrictly for three natural days and a half; for in that time the news of their killing could not be ſent throughout the Antichriſtian World; and what ſpace were that to congratulate, and ſolace themſelves and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the ſlaughter of them? and beſides how litle is half a day perceived in ſuch feaſting and jocand ſolemnity? and therefore they muſt be underſtood prophetically, three days and a half for three years and a half: and tis well known that theſe men were under the bands of Confinement, or power of their civil death juſt ſo long, neither more nor leſs, three years and a half <hi>a die ad diem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, It is ſayd, <hi>They that dwell upon the Earth, ſhall rejoyce over them, make merry and ſend gifts one to another, becauſe theſe two Prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the Earth,</hi> ver, 10. All the witneſſes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169713:67"/>did torment them, but theſe laſt eſpecially: whom having conquered and killed, the Popiſh, Prelatical party pleaſe and content themſelves in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt exceedingly, as thoſe of old upon their Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Solemnities and Feaſting dayes did uſe to do; <hi>they made merry and ſent gifts,</hi> to which the Holy-Ghoſt here alludes, and ſays, <hi>they rejoyced over them;</hi> obſerve, <hi>rejoyced [over] them;</hi> for they had theſe men ſtill in their clutches.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, At the end of the forementioned time <hi>[the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they ſtagger up again]</hi> ver. 11. God by unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected means did looſe the bands of their death; they are ſuſpended no longer, ſilenced no longer, kept in <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> clutches no longer; and after three years and an half (through a principle of life from God beſtowed upon them) they get upon their feet again; even thoſe ſame men that were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; had the ſpace of their lying dead been an Age, or 2. or 3. Ages, I ſhould have ſought this Reſurrection in their Succeſſors, or men of ſuch like Spirits riſen up after them; but it being but three years and a half, I can eaſily believe that thoſe ſame numerical men that were ſilenced, ſuſpended, and ſo killed, might have their suſpenſions taken off, their mouths open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they ſet upon their feet to Propheſie again, and ſo 'twas a Myſtical or Civil Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, <hi>They heard a voice from heaven, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, come up hither.</hi> The Decree or Vote of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169713:68"/>calling them out of their low and dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, into Liberty, Freedom; to a competent Maintenance, and comfortable Eſtate, wherein they alſo protected them in the ſight and ſpight of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> and all their enemies, ſo that they were as ſecure from thoſe that had lately killed them, as if they had been taken up into heaven it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, <hi>They aſcended up to heaven in a cloud, Heb.</hi> 12.1. There a multitude of Believers are called a <hi>cloud of witneſſes:</hi> When theſe men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from their impriſonment, 'twas wonderfull to ſee what a cloud of witneſſes they were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied withall, rejoycing greatly at this their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and happy Freedom, every one help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lifting them up into their Heaven, what they could.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, [<hi>Their enemies beheld all this</hi> (but could not hinder it) <hi>and great fear fell upon them</hi>] As eaſily apprehending, that being tormented with them before, they ſhould be now much more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by them, for the late injury done them (to ſay nothing of old quarrels;) and beſides, a freſh and more full ſupply of the Spirit of God was come upon them; and now are days fear, ſwallows up and devours their whole three years joy and more, ſo that there is no ſign left of it amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>You perceive how this piece of Providence agrees with the Text in all the joynts and creeks of it.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:169713:68"/>
                     <p>The like you ſhall ſee in the ſequels of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they are four, all ſet down <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of them, this, <hi>[The ſame hour the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes roſe, there was a great earthquake]</hi> A vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhaking of Church and State, even of the whole Kingdom, in the breaking out of theſe late Wars between King and Parliament; there have been ſuch Commotions amongſt us, as may well be called a <hi>[great earthquake]</hi> and it began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the quickening or return of theſe men.</p>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>[that] tenth part,</hi> where the laſt of the Witneſſes were killed, in ſo different and ſignal a way: <hi>[that] tenth part,</hi> that is ſo eaſily diſcernable from all the reſt, <hi>Et pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitùs toto diviſi ab orbe Britanni;</hi> in plain terms, <hi>England.</hi> You'le ſay, was <hi>England</hi> but ſhaken off from <hi>Rome</hi> by this late <hi>Earthquake?</hi> I anſwer, it was in part, but not wholly; in Doctrine, but not in Worſhip and Diſcipline: for (as I told you) <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:169713:69"/>and we were faſt tyed together by the tails of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy,</hi> Ceremonies, and Formes of Worſhip, though their bodies were looſe, and heads looked ſeveral ways: Yet truly, let me tell you this, that in our times the heads were turning and looking one upon another with marvellous benigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and were working their bodies together again as faſt as ſuch great and unweldy bodies could be moved: There were ſuch Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Popiſh Practiſes, and Popiſh ordering of Church-affairs (to ſay nothing of the State) in moſt points and places, that the Pope had good cauſe to aſſure himſelf of <hi>Englands</hi> return into the Boſom of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>But when the Parliament aroſe (for Parliaments themſelves roſe from the dead; you know how long we had been kept without them; and at laſt a Proclamation ſet forth, that men ſhould not [think] of a Parliament) and quickened the dead Witneſſes, Voted down Epiſcopal Government with all the Appurtenances of it, and (being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to't) took up Arms, reſolving to live and die in the defence of thoſe Votes; then, and not till then (I dare boldly ſay it) did <hi>England,</hi> a tenth part of thoſe Kingdoms <hi>that had given their power to the Beaſt,</hi> utterly, totally fall off from <hi>Rome;</hi> that in reaſon they can have no hope of ever fetching it back again, to ſerve the Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:169713:69"/>
                     <p>The third is this, [<hi>In the earthquake were ſlain of men</hi> 7000.] This being a round and perfect number, you need not underſtand it of juſt ſo many and no more (for indeed 7000. is not a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable number for ſuch an earthquake, but it may be a certain number for an uncertain [<hi>and in the earthquake were ſlain</hi> 7000.] <hi>i. e.</hi> thouſands upon thouſands.</p>
                     <p>But ſearching the Original, I finde That runs thus, <hi>[In the earthquake were ſlain, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, names of men]</hi> that is, men of name, men of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown: the like <hi>Hebraiſme</hi> you have <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.4. So in this Fall of the tenth part of the City, were ſlain men of name, note, quality (beſides the common ſort of People) 7000. meaning of the Witneſſes enemies; ſome loſt their blood and lives, others their places, powers, livings, livelyhoods; and thus there were ſlain of noted Stateſmen, and noted Churchmen 7000. which in reaſon may be conceived a competent number in this late earthquake.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſequel is this, <hi>[And the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of Heaven.]</hi> Obſerve, 'tis not ſaid the remnant repented, but were terrified; and indeed, nothing is more evident then that an awe and terrour is fallen upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe that remain; and (as <hi>Joſhua</hi> exhorted <hi>Achan to confeſs and give glory to God</hi>) ſo, they are conſtrained; it burſts out of their mouths (fore
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169713:70"/>againſt their wills) that ſince the reſtoring of thoſe men every Providence of God hath fought againſt them. And though they ſpeak evil of dignities and inſtruments (as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>) yet they will confeſs that this is <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> the juſt handy-work of God upon them: they have nothing to accuſe God of, for ſuch his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them. Whatever they think or ſay, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men and preſent Powers, yet being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they confeſs, and give glory to the God of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Tell me now in the ſingleneſs of your Spirits, have not Providences ſuted marvellous patly to the Text? Hath not ſomething fallen out in our days, that may with more perſpicuity of Reaſon be called the [ſignal] killing of the Witneſſes, then hath in any Kingdom you can name, all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces complying fully with the ſtandard of the Word? Confident I am, that ſince the quickening and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of theſe men, there can no Kingdom in the World be named where the Beaſt hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt the Zealous Proteſtant party, ſo, as it may be ſaid he is yet killing Witneſſes; he hath enough to do to hold his own, and in many places is apparently on the looſing, ſinking hand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I may draw the concluſion, it ſhall be this, <hi>[That which we all ſo much fear, is paſt,]</hi> and let <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and thoſe of his Faction, take what follows.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:169713:70"/>
                     <p>I remember what our Saviour ſaid to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.32, 33. <hi>When the Fig-tree putteth forth her leaves, you uknow that Summer is nigh: Likewiſe ye, when ye ſhall ſee all theſe things, know that it is near, even at the door.</hi> So ſay I to you; When ſomething hath paſſed before our eyes, which we cannot in reaſon but call <hi>the killing of the witneſſes, and reſurrection of the witneſſes,</hi> from that time, from that ſign, know that <hi>Antichriſts utter ruin is near, even at the dore.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>God hath a nature that conſtrains him to give to every one according to their works; but ſuch have been <hi>Antichriſts works and carriage,</hi> that it is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualleſt thing in the world that God ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and pour out upon him, all thoſe fearfull things which <hi>Daniel, Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle Iohn</hi> have foretold, and threatned him withal. <hi>He who hath made himſelf [the Man of Sin,]</hi> God can do no leſs then make him <hi>[The Son of Perdition,]</hi> as tis in the Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. <hi>An Angel cryed with a

                     <p>Hiſtorians do generally with one mouth tell us in that one Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> 400. years ago, they ſlaughtered ten hundred thouſand of thoſe godly <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:169713:72"/>
                     <p>The Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> boaſted, <hi>He had deſtroyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 18000. <hi>Hereticks in the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>in the ſpace of ſix years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt 30 years after the Order of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> was ſet up, tis found that above fourſcore thouſand were ſlain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition</hi> in the ſpace of 30 years, made away no leſs then one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1572. was the Maſſacre at <hi>Paris;</hi> in a few days ſpace there were above 30000. treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and baſely murtherd.</p>
                     <p>In our Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days, in leſs then 4 years, were conſumed with fire and faggot, 277 perſons, every one whereof it might be ſtrongly preſumed were true Members of Jeſus Chriſt, his Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                     <p>In the late rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> (to ſpeak with the leaſt) one hundred thouſand were murthred before we could get ſo much as one Breaſt-work againſt them.</p>
                     <p>And now by theſe hints I have given you, can you make any gueſs at the number of thoſe that have been ſlain in all thoſe ten Kingdoms, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him throughout the ſpace of above 1000 years? Certainly they do exceed all humane <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmatick,</hi> Rev. 17.12, 13, 14. <hi>The ten horns which thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings, theſe ſhall give their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſtrength to the Beaſt, theſe ſhall make war with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169713:73"/>the Lamb.</hi> The ten Kings of Europe with all their power and ſtrengths, were nothing but the Popes inſtruments of blood and cruely.</p>
                     <p>I may be bold to ſay it, the Popes little finger hath been heavier upon the people of God, then were the Loyns of the ten Heatheniſh Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>To ſhed the innocent blood of any man, is a ſin that cryes to God, and will certainly prevail with him for vengeance; how much more then to ſhed the blood of an Innocent Saint? I am confident if one had ſhed the blood of a hundred thouſand men, that were indeed Reprobates, and the blood of but one true Saint of God, he ſhould find a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der task and pull of it to come off with Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for the blood of that one Saint, then for all the other hundred thouſand: there's reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for it, they being but <hi>Chaff, Bryars, and Thorns, Dung, Scorpions, and worſe then naught;</hi> but tis ſaid, <hi>the death of a Saint is precious with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Saint is a Member of Chriſt, helps to make up that body <hi>which is the fulneſs of him that fills all in all;</hi> is the <hi>pupilla oculi, the very apple of Gods eye;</hi> yea ſo dear to God, that the very hairs of his head are numbred; and therefore no marvel if he have a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pull of it.</p>
                     <p>But the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſhed the blood of more then one Saint; indeed no other blood relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:169713:73"/>with them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. and laſt verſe, <hi>In her was found the blood of Prophets and of Saints, and of all that were ſlain upon the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A vein of cruelty &amp; bloodſhed went down from <hi>Cains</hi> days, even to the Popes times, who was ſo far from putting a ſtop to it, that he eagerly cloſed with it, made it wider and deeper then before; and his actions have juſtified all the murthers of the Saints that ever were yet committed in the world.</p>
                     <p>There hath not been a war in Chriſtendom for this thouſand years and upwards, but a Prieſt, or ſome eminently of the Popiſh Faction, hath been the incendiary; and they have ſo taken up their cups, that they have made themſelves dead drunk. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>I ſaw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Ieſus; and when I ſaw her, I wondered with great admiration:</hi> as at their ſin, what that was, ſo at their puniſhment, how great in juſtice and equity it muſt needs be when it ſhould come upon them.</p>
                     <p>To be drunk is a great ſin; to be drunk with blood is monſtrous; but to be drunk with the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jeſus, is ſtrangely hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
                     <p>I could tell you how at <hi>Burges</hi> they buried one <hi>Marion</hi> alive; how in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes a woman being delivered at the ſtake, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant by its ſprawling like to get out of the fire,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169713:74"/>they threw it with their forks into the fire again; they digg'd up <hi>Wickliffs</hi> bones and burnt them forty years after his death; <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> wife at Oxford, Mr. <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Paulus Phagius</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> were ſerved no better. We uſe to ſay, <hi>Vrſinon ſaevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt in Cadavera,</hi> ſavage Bears will not rage againſt dead Carcaſſes. Now Lord, if theſe be <hi>Saints,</hi> who are <hi>Scythians;</hi> if theſe be <hi>Catholiks,</hi> who are <hi>Canibals?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> are <hi>the ſtar that's ſayd to fall</hi> Rev. 9. <hi>from Heaven to Earth.</hi> Their falling away from Chriſt and the Faith is called the great Apoſtacy of the latter times 1 Tim. 4. as Learned Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath judiciouſly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, It is ſayd Rev. 13.5, 6. <hi>That he had a month ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, and he opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his name, and Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> They take thoſe Titles to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that are peculiar unto God, and ſo blaſpheme his name; They call the true Doctrines and worſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, Hereſie and Schiſme, and ſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his Tabernacle.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe that God hath damned they canonize, and affirm them to be in heaven; and thoſe that God hath glorified in heaven, them they affirm to be damned ſouls in Hel, and ſo they blaſpheme Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the inhabitants thereof. One of them would eat his <hi>Pork</hi> in ſpight of God; another of them, if God were ſo angry with <hi>Adam</hi> for eating
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169713:74"/>an apple, might not he much more for his <hi>Peacock?</hi> &amp; ſays a third <hi>quantas nobis divitias comparavit iſta fabula Chriſti,</hi> what a deal of wealth hath that Fable of Chriſt (ſpeaking of the Goſpel) broguht us in?</p>
                     <p>A Biſhop here in <hi>England,</hi> when one he knew well, was brought before him for medling hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with Scriptures, <hi>what a devil</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>made thee meddle with Scriptures?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixthly, We read of their Fornication Rev. 9. and laſt v. tis true enough, there was once of ſhee-Pope, <hi>Ego non dubito</hi> (ſays <hi>Functius</hi> the <hi>Chronologer) quin divinito ita ſit permiſſum, ut faemina fieret Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex, &amp; eadem Meretrix;</hi> I make no queſtion of it, but that God in his wiſdom permitted a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtrumpet to be advanced to the Popedom, that he might, in her, ſhew to all the World, what the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were, <hi>even that great whore with whom the Kings of the Earth committed Fornication;</hi> I ſay tis true enough, there was once a ſhee-Pope, who cried out (I mean, fell into the pangs of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel) as ſhe was going on proceſſion, (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occaſioned their <hi>Porphery Chair,</hi>) and ſo God openly declared her to be not onely myſtically, but even literally the whore of <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> calls her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the Mother of all Churches, but the Holy Ghoſt much truer calls her <hi>the mother of Harlots</hi> Rev. 17. Common notorious ſtews are upheld in the Holy City if ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Their covetouſneſs is ſo baſe, that they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169713:75"/>make merchandiſe even of mens <hi>[ſouls]</hi> as you may ſee, Rev. 18.11.12.13. It is ſtoried of Pope <hi>John</hi> the twenty two, that when he dyed, there was found in his treaſure two hundred and fifty tuns of gold.</p>
                     <p>And tis recorded of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, that he was able to ſhew more mony then all the Kings in Chriſtendom.</p>
                     <p>Surely God hath long ſince ſmitten his hands at their diſhoneſt gain, and that endleſs wealth, the inventions of their covetouſneſs (Pardons, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Pugatory, &amp;c.) hath brought them in.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, We read of their idolatry Rev. 9. and laſt verſe; worſhip a piece of bread, kneel before the Croſs &amp; kiſs it, &amp; alſo the Images of Saints. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th:</hi> in the year 610 beg'd of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror the <hi>Pantheon;</hi> he preſently throws out the Heathen Images, and ſets up the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> as chief, and fills it with the Images of all the reſt, and thereupon inſtituted the Feaſt of all Saints.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, we read in the ſame place of their Sorceries. Their own Hiſtorians tell us (as I touch'd before) that two and twenty of their Popes were abominable <hi>Negromancers,</hi> of whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> faith, they were <hi>parum probi homines,</hi> ſcarce to be called honeſt men; but <hi>Platina</hi> ſpeaks out and calls them <hi>Monſtra et portenda hominum,</hi> divels clad with fleſh, and ſhapes of men onely.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:169713:75"/>
                     <p>Tenthly, They have kept Chriſt out of his brith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and lawfull inheritance above a 1240. years already, and he ſhall never have it but by ſtrong hand.</p>
                     <p>If it went ſo hard with <hi>Ahab</hi> for taking <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard awhile, what will become of them who have ſeized Chriſts own inheritance ſo long a time, and killed thoſe he hath ſent unto them to demand his right out of their hands?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They are the moſt impenitent wretches that ever breathed upon Gods ground; they have had the witneſſes to call them to repentance from the very beginning; and God reaifed up the Turk as a ſcourge of Popery, yet the reſt of the men (ſays the text Rev. 9.20.21.) that is, they of the Weſt repented not. God gave the old World a 120. years to repent in before the broght the Flood upon them; he hath given theſe as much ſince <hi>Luther</hi> firſt preached the Goſpel; but they are as far from repenting as the old World was when <hi>Noah</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Ark. Rev. 16. ver. 9. <hi>When a Vial was poured upon the Sun, they blaſphemed the name of God; they repented not.</hi> ver. 10.11. <hi>the fifth is poured upon the Throne of the Beaſt; they gnawed their tongues, blaſphemed God, and repented not of their deeds, but prepared war againſt God,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>When great hail-ſtones fell upon them out of heaven;</hi> You read not of their repenting ver. the laſt, <hi>but that they blaſphemed God to the laſt, becauſe of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169713:76"/>plague of hail.</hi> Impenitent blaſphemous wretches they have lived, and impenitent blaſphemous wretches (for the generality of them) they'l certainly dye.</p>
                     <p>Now when God ſhall empty his laſt and hotteſt Vials of wrath upon her, and all her plagues come in one day, Rev. 18. <hi>Death, Mourning, Famine,</hi> and ſhe's ſet all on a flaming fire, not to be quenched, for tis ſayd, <hi>her ſmoak goeth up for ever and ever,</hi> thoſe who ſhall then wonder why God deals ſo hardly and ſeverely with her, God may anſwer them, <hi>are not my wayes equal, have I done unto her without cauſe all that I have done unto her, have not her ſinnes reached up to Heaven?</hi> Do not you know that I am a juſt God, and reward every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their works, <hi>judge I pray you between me and my enemies, if I have not done the thing thats right?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>

                     <p>Oh, we are no Papiſts, I, but art thou none of the Popiſh Faction, is not thy heart with thoſe that have joyned hands with Papiſts in one common cauſe? if ſo, in Gods interpretation thou art a Papiſt, and if thou doſt not come out from amongſt them, expect a ſhare in their plagues. And as for thy not going to <hi>Maſs,</hi> tis true, I think thou doſt not love a Latine <hi>Maſs,</hi> but peradventure thou loveſt an Engliſh <hi>Maſs,</hi> but peradventure thou loveſt and Engliſh <hi>Maſs</hi> with all thy heart; How welcom would the old <hi>Common prayer Mumpſimus</hi> be to thouſands and Millions in this Nation, before any miniſter of Chriſts-praying, or worſhipping in the Holy Ghoſt, as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſes it. And doſt not thou love and allow thy ſelf in ſome ſins? lying is a Popiſh ſin; Swearing, Blaſpheming are popiſh ſins; Apoſtacy from Chriſt and the faith to follow our own Fancies, and Deluſions, a Popiſh ſin; Pride and ſelf-conceitedneſs, a Popiſh ſin; hating and fighting againſt God and his Saints, a Popiſh ſin; ſleighting the power and purity of Ordinances, and profaning the Lords day, theft or any known diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt gain, the ſin of Uncleanneſs, Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and Impenitency; all theſe, yea many more that might be named, are Popiſh ſins; The <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> though they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yeat took too much of <hi>Egypt</hi> along with them, their ſins in the Wilderneſs were indeed <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſinnes; We of the reformed Churches, though we left <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind us, yet we brought too much of <hi>Rome</hi> along
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169713:77"/>with us, moſt or all thoſe vile ſins that are practiſed amongſt us, our Anceſtors found and learned them in the boſom of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; and though they did let go their Doctrines and forms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a great meaſure, yet they held faſt very much corruption of manners, which we have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited and improved (I fear) to a greater pitch and ſtock of Impiety by far then when twas left us; the Eternal God be mercifull to us. I ſay if theſe or any other Popiſh ſins be found amongſt us, God will put little difference between us and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; theſe Popiſh ſins, if they be not put away from amongſt us, will ſurely bring Popiſh plagues on us ſooner or later.</p>
                     <p>In this late Earthquake amongſt us, many (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were of the Popiſh Eaction, and Popiſh ſins were found in them) were ſhaken all to peices, and as much of the Vial fell upon them as did upon Papiſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps thou'lt tell me. thou haſt eſcaped, as many others alſo have; I adviſe thee then, <hi>ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee;</hi> repent, or elſe (believe it) that wrath which is due to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt will one day find thee out. Therefore friends, let all of us have our ears and hearts open to this voyce from heaven, and come out from amongſt them; thoſe ſinnes any Papiſt lives in, do not thou live in; eſpecially the wayes a Papiſt walks in, let not us walk in; that party or deſign a Papiſt ever
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169713:77"/>did or will own, let us hate and diſclaim as we love our ſelves; and ſo we ſhall not onely eſcape their Plagues, but ſhare in the Peace of God, and bleſsings of his own People.</p>

                     <p>The grand Intereſt of all the People of God this day in Chriſtendom, is, the ruine of Pope and Popery: till that be done, I dare deliver it, Firm and Bleſſed Peace and Happineſs, in any Church or State, there will be none.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p>Let me tell you, this quarrell that now Chriſt is engaged in, tis of the neareſt concernment to him to proſper and ſpeed well in it, that ever any was

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Would not have any one think that I am able (no, nor any man now alive) to ſet forth the ſo-much-expected Kingdome of CHRIST in the true worth and glories of it: let it ſuffice, if I give you ſome rude draughts of it. The Prophets of old did ſpeak very clear and excellent things concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> his Birth, Life, Miracles, Doctrine, Death, Reſurrection, and what was to follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; inſomuch that <hi>Iſaias</hi> is uſually called by Divines, the Evangelical Prophet: But when <hi>John</hi> was come, our Saviour ſaith of him, <hi>Mat. 11. He was the greateſt of thoſe that had been born of women,</hi> meaning in reſpect of his knowledge of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> nay, that <hi>he was was more then a Prophet, i. e.</hi> he had more abilities to ſpeak of Chriſts nature, offices, and excellencies of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then any or all the Prophets that had been before him: But yet, ſayes he, <hi>The leaſt in the kingome of God, is greater then
<pb facs="tcp:169713:84"/>John the Baptiſt:</hi> After the aſcenſion of Chriſt, and deſcenſion of the Holy Ghoſt, the meaneſt Miniſter of the Goſpel was able to hold him forth, in all points, more excellently then <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was.</p>
                  <p>To bring this home to the preſent buſineſſe: We that now ſpeak concerning this great, this bleſsed Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, onely as Prophets, (yet not by any private ſpirit, but groundedly from the Word) may ſpeak very clear, undoubted, and (in their eares eſpecially to whom this ſubject is ſomwhat ſtrange and new) very wonderful things, almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall come to be buried in its own aſhes, and after that the great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of God Almighty fought and finiſhed, and Chriſt hath his Kingdome actually upon the Anvil, hammering and working it out; thoſe whoſe lot it ſhall be to ſtand forth Miniſters of the Goſpel then, and be eye witneſſes of Chriſt ſo at work, of them it may be ſaid, They are the greateſt of thoſe that have been born of women, in reſpect of their diſtinct knowledge of the Kingdome of our Lord; nay more then Prophets, men far more accompliſh'd
<pb facs="tcp:169713:84"/>to ſpeak of the parts, government, glory of his Kingdome, then any or all the moſt holy learned men that have been before them, who ſaw it only at a diſtance, through the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the more dark and general Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſpake of it by way of Propheſie: But they who ſhall be ſo far honoured and bleſſed of God, to be <hi>called to the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb,</hi> (as the expreſsion is <hi>Rev. 19.</hi>) to ſee this Kingdome drawn forth in all the juſt parts and lineaments of it, ſet up to the height of its greatneſse and glory; I ſay, the leaſt of them will be greater then <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> my meaning is, will be far more able to preach forth the excellencies of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in all the dimenſions of it, then were thoſe who were ſpectators of Jeſus Chriſt when he was but at work upon it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore (Reader) I ſay again, ſince you ought in reaſon, let it anſwer your expectation, if I ſet before you only ſome unpoliſht draughts of it: The Church of God will have more knowledge of this buſineſſe, ere it be long. Dan. <hi>12.4. Shut up the words, and ſeal the book, even to the time of the end; many
<pb facs="tcp:169713:85"/>ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> The context rightly under ſtood clearly gives it thus: That when the time of Antichriſts reign, and the Jews captivity ſhall draw towards an end, men and matters will be hurried to and fro, there will be great ſtirs in the world; but then the ſealed Book will be opened; the knowledge of the Popes ruine, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jewes, the ſtarry luſtre of Chriſts kingdome will break forth, increaſe, and ſhine more and more unto the perfect day. Which is the daily and fervent prayer of</p>

(<hi>Jer.</hi> 31.15. <hi>A voice</hi> (of an old Grandmother raiſed out of her grave) <hi>was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refuſed to be comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not.</hi> This was fulfilled, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went captives into <hi>Babylon;</hi> which will be undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably clear, if you read on to the 22 verſe: and yet when <hi>Herod</hi> kill'd the children, upon his ſearch after him that was born King of the Jewes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.17, 18. then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>In Ramah was a voice heard, lamentation,</hi> &amp;c.) If <hi>Iſaias</hi> propheſie of Chriſts reigning before his Ancients, hath been at any time fulfilled, much more will it be fulfilled in the day may Text points at; then it will be fulfilled to the uttermoſt, fulfilled gloriouſly; you ſee 'tis epithited, A glorious reign.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:169713:87"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt his then-mannagement of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Holy Ghoſt ſets it forth in ſuch high lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (to anſwer the reality of the Kingdom) as hath deceived many thouſands, as if it ſhould be a glorious perſonal raign. 2 Theſ. 2.8. <hi>Then ſhall the wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord hath two wayes to bring down Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. Firſt, <hi>He conſumes him by the ſpirit of his mouth, i. e.</hi> by the miniſtry of the Word; ever ſince <hi>Luther,</hi> the Pope hath been in a Conſumption; you might ſee it in his face. The ſecond, is, by his own coming, <hi>the brightneſs of his coming;</hi> ſome take it for a perſonal appearance to give him his deaths wound. Rev. 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which peirced him, and all Kinreds of the Earth ſhall wail becauſe of him; even ſo, Amen.</hi> That this cannot be meant of the day of Judgement, is evident, becauſe, the mourning here ſpoken of, is a penitential mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is taken out of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. at the laſt day, all the Saints ſhall rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory; all the wicked ſhall be hardned in impenitency, and though they may howl over their own miſery, yet not mourn after Chriſt; there will be no penitential mourning in that day; and therefore Chriſt will appear in the clouds before that day, and every eye ſhall ſee him, eſpecially the people of the Jews.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:169713:88"/>
                  <p>I could give you other Scriptures that ſpeak to the ſame effect: But yet theſe (as expreſs as they are) with the reſt which look that way, are not fully convicing, as I conceive; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I find often in Scripture, whats carried on by Inſtruments, aſcribed to God as if the had done it perſonally, without the uſe of any ſuch Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Rev. 16.456. <hi>The third Angle poured out his Vial upon the Rivers and Fountains of Waters, and they became blood; and they ſay unto God, Thou art righteous O Lord [who haſt judged thus, and thou haſt given them blood to drink.]</hi> All grant that this Vial was poured out (as were alſo all the reſt) by men, holy and ſpiritual men; yet they ſpeak to God, and ſay, <hi>[thou] haſt judged thus, [thou] haſt given them blood to drink.</hi> 1 Chron 16.13. <hi>Let the heavens be glad, and let the Earth rejoyce, and let men ſay among the Nations, the Lord reigneth.</hi> ver. 33. <hi>The Trees of the Wood ſhall ſing out at the preſence of the Lord, becauſe he cometh to judge the Earth.</hi> Pſ. 22.28. <hi>The Kingdom is the Lords, and he is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among the Nations.</hi> Iſai. 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our judge, the Lord in our Law-giver, the Lord is our King:</hi> but none of all this immediately by himſelf, or perſonally, but in the uſe of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>So that thought it be ſayd, he ſhall deſtroy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt with the brightneſs of his coming (at which time alſo he'l ſet up his Kingdom and raign) yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169713:88"/>may it well enough be underſtood of a coming in thoſe ten Kings or Supreme powers that Scripture ſaith <hi>ſhall hate the whore and burn her fleſh with fire;</hi> and he may as well ſet up his kingdome, and reign alſo in and by them, and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How can a circumſcribed body (as Chriſt hath) be perſonally, viſibly in all and every of his kingdoms at once? When he ſhall reign viſibly, perſonally on mount Sion or at Jeruſalem, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the ſame time reign perſonally and viſibly here in this Nation, but muſt rule it and all others by his Deputies: therefore tis ſafer to let him keep his place at Gods right hand in heaven, then bring him down to ſway an earthly ſcepter, ſeeing he may do it in his Spirit by ſome ſpecial Inſtruments; and comparatively, in reſpect of thoſe he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ruled in, it may be ſaid that Chriſt himſelf reigns, not perſonally upon earth, but after ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and wonderfull a manner, in certain ſelect ſervants, as he never reigned in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt will uſher in his kingdome with the moſt glorious conqueſts over earthly powers, that ever were known.</p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken much to this already; it was the ſubject of the laſt point; yet for method ſake give me leave to ſpeak a word to it here. <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.12. to the end. <hi>I beheld when he opened the ſixth ſeale, and lo there was a great earthquake, and the ſun
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169713:89"/>became black as ſackcloth of haire, and the moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as blood; and the ſtars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as figtree caſteth her untimely figs when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted as a ſcroll when tis rolled together, and every mountain and Iſland were moved out of their places. And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every freeman hid themſelvs in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains, and ſaid to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> The moſt and beſt reformed Expoſitors, do (with one mouth) tell us, that upon the opening of the ſixth Seale, Chriſt in <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did pull down Heatheniſme, ſet up Chriſtianiſme; and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were ſo great, ſo terrible, that by their deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption you would think them to be the end of the world: The terrors of Jeſus Chriſt were ſo upon the ſpirits of Kings, Captains, mighty men, as that had the earth ſhaken under them, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Iſlands moved out of their places, had the ſun turned to darkneſſe, the moon to blood, ſtars fallen from heaven, had heaven and earth come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the world been at an end, there could not have been greater feares, greater outcries to the rocks and mountains, to be hid from the wrath
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169713:89"/>of the Lamb; ſome poyſoning, ſome hanging, ſome drowning themſelves, ſome flying and fell by the ſword, all at their wits end. Thus Chriſt ſet up Chriſtianity by <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> But (as I ſhewed you at large) it ſoon degenerated into Antichriſtianiſm or Papacie, (the moſt Politique and ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitution againſt Chriſt that ever any was) the very foundation-ſtones whereof the muſt and will pluck up, that ſo he may build up himſelf a ſure throne and kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, 'Tis impoſſible Chriſt ſhould bring in his worſhip and kingdome with greater and more terrible conqueſts over the Kings of the earth, then thoſe he got over the Heatheniſh powers. Let me tell you, Nothing is impoſſible to the <hi>Lord God omnipotent;</hi> He tels us, he'll bring in his Reign with far greater. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16 17.18. <hi>When the ſeventh Angel poured out his Vial into the aire, there were voices, and thunderings, and lightenings, and there was a great earthquake [ſuch as was not ſince men were upon earth] ſo mighty an earthquake and ſo great.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe underſtand that of <hi>Dan</hi> 12.1. <hi>At that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince which ſtandeth for the children of thy people, and there ſhall be [a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation, even to that ſame time] and at that time thy people ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</hi> Theſe matchleſſe troubles ſhould be at that time, when <hi>Daniels</hi> people, the Jewes, all the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169713:90"/>twelve Tribes, that are now loſt in the duſt, ſhould be ſound out and delivered: which Scripture tels us in places enough, ſhall be upon the breaking of Antichriſt. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. <hi>And in the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdome, which ſhall [break in peeces all theſe kingdomes] i. e.</hi> all theſe kingdoms of the world, putting all rule and authority (that is carnal, and ſtands in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to this deſignes) under his feet. Many and mighty victories (you know) make a Kings reign glorious; why, Chriſt himſelfe never got ſuch victories over men in this world, as then he'll doe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Scripture ſets it forth as the day of his marriage ſolemnity. <hi>The Lord God omnipotent reigneth;</hi> ſo my Text; the next verſe expreſſeth it thus, <hi>[The marriage of the Lamb is come;]</hi> and <hi>v</hi> 9. They who are called to have a ſhare in this kingdome, are bleſt of God, being called to the <hi>[marriage ſupper of the Lamb]</hi> to a continual and the moſt ſumptuous Feaſt that ever was. You may be ſure that Chriſt on that day will appeare in no mean royalty and glories, which may be gathered from the deſcription of the Bride; for 'tis ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>She hath made her ſelf ready, araied finely,</hi> v. 8. In <hi>Solomons</hi> time ſhe was brought in raiment of needle-work, nay <hi>her cloathing of wrought gold, ſo the King did greatly deſire and delight in her beauty,</hi> Pſ. 45. But the Bride is deſcribed (upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169713:90"/>the fall of Antichriſt) at a higher rate. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2. <hi>I ſaw the holy city, New-Ieruſalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband.</hi> Not dreſſed with needle-work, or cloth of gold, things here below of the earth earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but ſhe's prepared and dreſſed as if ſhe had dropt out of heaven, cloathed with the glories of heaven, and this onely to fit her in ſome meaſure for the Bridegroom. If the Church ſhall be ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that day, ſhal not the King upon the throne in the height of his ſtate and government, be more exceeding glorious in all eyes?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, His reign will be wonderfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd, in reſpect of the extent of his domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>And I ſaw a mighty Angel come down from heaven, and he ſet his right foot upon the ſea, and his left foot upon the earth;</hi> (Earth and Sea, make up the whole Globe) thereby ſignifying that he would (when time ſerved) take poſſeſſion of all the world; the power and majeſty of his throne and ſcepter ſhould be extended over ſea and land. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Pſal. 72.8. <hi>He ſhall have dominion from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</hi> Rev. 15.3, 4. <hi>Thou King of Saints, who ſhall not feare thee? [All nations] ſhall come and worſhip before thee, for thy judgments are made manifeſt,</hi> viz. upon the Pope and his kingdome.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169713:91"/>Iſa. 2.2. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, that the mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the top of the mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hils, aod all nations ſhall flow unto it.</hi> The generality of the Nations ſhall come flocking in as Doves to the windows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe Ten Kingdoms that had given their power to the Beaſt; all ties, all bands of peace and amity between them ſhall be ſtrangely broken and diſſolved; nay, ſuch a ſpirit ſhall come upon them, that <hi>they ſhall hate the whore, and even burn her fleſh with fire,</hi> Rev. 17. This (you muſt confeſs) is a great, eminent coming in, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to and for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He will find out and bring home to himſelf his old dear people. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26 <hi>I would not, brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſterie, that blindneſſe in part is happened to Iſrael, untill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, There ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhall turn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe from Iacob.</hi> I like their interpretation beſt, who by <hi>[fulneſſe of the Gentiles coming in]</hi> underſtand the fulneſſe or moſt part of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that had given themſelves to Popery, when then eyes ſhall be opened to ſee what they have done, and then (giving themſelves to Chriſt) in an holy indignation ſhall ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, yea quite deſtroy Pope and Popery; this will mightily work
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169713:91"/>upon the hearts of the two Tribes, in time on the ten Tribes. The fulneſſe of the Gentiles being thus come in, then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall come in and be ſaved, as 'tis written, <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſſe from Jacob:</hi> Now <hi>[Iacob]</hi> (you know) comprehends all the twelve Tribes; for the twelve Patriarks, from whom all the twelve Tribes deſcended, came out of <hi>Iacob's</hi> loines. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the Lord ſhall ſet his hand again [the ſecond time] to recover the remnant of his people which ſhall be left, from Aſſyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cuſh, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math, and from the Iſlands of the ſea. He ſhall gather together the disperſed of Iudah, and aſſemble the outcaſts of Iſrael, from the four corners of the earth.</hi> God had gathered them from all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from all the places whither he had cauſed them to be carried away captive once before, as you may ſee <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.14. He had fetch'd them out of <hi>Babylon</hi> and out of all the Provinces round; but this is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and he'll gather together the outcaſts of <hi>[Iſrael]</hi> and the diſperſed to <hi>[Iudah]</hi> (which ſince their great diviſion, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. he never yet did) and make them one, as you have it <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.19.21, 22. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will take the ſtick of Ioſeph which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the Tribes of Iſrael his fellowes, and will put them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169713:92"/>with him, even with the ſtick of Iudah, and make them one ſtick and they ſhall be one in my hand. And thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael from among the Heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every ſide, and bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation; and one King,</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall be King to them all; <hi>and they ſhall be no more two nations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.</hi> This hath not been yet fulfilled, but will be in the day of Chriſts kingdome. Take one place more <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people,</hi> (as at this day we know it is) <hi>there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Ye are the ſons of the living God. Then ſhall the children of Iudah and the children of Iſrael be gathered together, and appoint themſelves one head, and they ſhall come up out of the land,</hi> (i. e. out of every land where they haven been loſt) <hi>for great ſhall be the day of Iezerel. [Iezerel]</hi> ſignifies both <hi>[ſcattered]</hi> and <hi>[the ſeed of God.]</hi> Great ſhall be the day of <hi>Iezerel,</hi> (i. e.) great ſhall be the day of bringing in the ſcattered, the ſcattered people: Or thus; <hi>Great ſhal be the day of Iezerel,</hi> (i. e.) great ſhall be the day of the ſeed of God, of ſpringing up of the ſeed of Gods people: they have lain a great while under the clods, as if they had been loſt or quite dead; but God hath a day wherein his ſeed ſhall ſpring up into a harveſt of joy, and all
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169713:92"/>that ſee them ſhall acknowledge they are the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed, as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.9.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after theſe, the reſidue of the Nations ſhall be the Lords, Zach. 8.22, 23. <hi>Many and ſtrong Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of Hoaſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord. And in thoſe dayes it ſhall come to paſs, that ten men ſhall take hold out of all languages of the Nations, even ſhall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we will go with you for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> That which was done <hi>Act.</hi> 2. will not agree to this Text; for we do not read of many and ſtrong Nations coming in then. You will ſay, how can many and ſtrong Nations come in to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> at any time? Doubtleſs it will be by Agents or Meſſengers, according to <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.2, 3. when the Jews ſhall ſend forth their Emiſſaries into all Lands to Preach Chriſt to them, there ſhall go a great bleſſing, a mighty power of the Spirit along, that the hearts of the Nations generally ſhall be mightily taken with them; and there ſhall be certain men out of every Nation and Language authorized to take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, and ſay, we will go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with you (for God and Chriſt are with you) to have the moſt exact and perfect Directory, that we and our whole Nation may worſhip God aright. Once Chriſt in his Rule and Government was kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow bounds of <hi>Jury;</hi> then he ſtretched
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169713:93"/>forth the arms of his power over the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> firſt the Eaſtern, then the Weſtern Churches: but the day is coming wherein he will lift up a Scepter over all the Nations of the world, Dan. 7.14. <hi>There was given him Dominion, Glory, and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi> He reigns a glorious King indeed, that is, King of all Kings, of all Kingdoms &amp; Nations in the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Chriſt will then given his People more purity and power of Ordinances then ever the Churches did enjoy. Take me (I pray you) in my own ſenſe: Ordinances as they came from the Apoſtles themſelves, were pure, perfect, becauſe they were the immediate inſpirations or breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Holy Ghoſt: but conſider them in the hands of divers others, and in the hands of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers and Churches: and what Errors, yea, damnable Doctrines were there preſently found amongſt them? Which increaſed daily, grew worſe and worſe, till at laſt there came out of the womb of them the great Antichriſt. But when Chriſt ſhall ſet up this Kingdom whereof we ſpeak, there ſhall be no danger by any groſs Errors, or ſeducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by falſe Teachers: Iſa 30.25, 26. <hi>There ſhall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and ſtreams of waters, in the day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers, fall. Moreover, the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun; and the light of the Sun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the light
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169713:93"/>of ſeven dayes, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his People, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound.</hi> Theſe rivers and ſtreams of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall break forth in all the Churches in the day of the great ſlaughter, and when the Towers fall, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> when the Pope and towring Kings ſhall be brought down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 17. to 21. There ſhall be this wonderfull increaſe of Goſpel-light, when God ſhall heal that ſpiritual wound the poor <hi>Jew</hi> lies ſo ſick of to this day, when he ſhall bind up the breach that is between the ten and the two Tribes, making them one in faith and love. Rev. 22.1. <hi>He ſhewed a pure river of water of life, clear as Chryſtal, proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb. Romiſh</hi> Ordinances were the blood of a dead man, but the Ordinances of Chriſts Kingdom ſhall be a river of life moſt clear and pure. ver. 2. <hi>In the midſt of the ſtreet of it, and of either ſide the River, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every moneth, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the Nations.</hi> Chriſt in his Ordinances will be a wonderfull tree of life, bearing both all plenty, and all variety of fruits, free and open for every one to pluck and feed upon; a healing vertue there is in the very leaves thereof; the moſt outward parts of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will have ſaving efficacie upon mens hearts. God will then ſend forth men of eminent parts and graces, <hi>Obad.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>Saviours ſhall come up on
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169713:94"/>Mount Sion, to judge the Mount of Eſau, and the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords.</hi> In the day when the Lord ſhall take the Kingdom to himſelf, there ſhall be Saviours raiſed up upon Mount Sion; in the Margent of your Bibles you have a parallel place put, 1 Tim. 4.16. <hi>Save the ſelf and thoſe that hear thee,</hi> q.d. be a Saviour to thy ſelf &amp; others, <hi>Obadiah</hi> cals the then-Miniſters of the Goſpel <hi>[Saviours]</hi> becauſe their Goſpel-diſpenſations ſhall be in the holineſs &amp; power of the great Saviour of men, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And there will be the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and impartial exerciſe of Church-diſcipline that ever was, to keep out, to purge out both the prophane and the erroneous; for which take two or three Scriptures, Rev. 21.27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it (i. e.</hi> into the holy City which comes down from God out of Heaven) <hi>any thing that deſileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or maketh a lye, but they which are written in the Lambs book of life.</hi> Not but that (doubtleſs) there will be hypocrites in the Church; but they ſhall be ſo cloſe, they ſhall ſo artificially paint and varniſh themſelves over with ſeeming holineſs, that they may very well be taken in the judgement of charity, for ſuch whoſe names are written in the Lambs book of life; but if once they appear to be defilers of themſelves or others, any kinde of way, nay if they be but catched in lying, if ſuch offer themſelves, they ſhall not enter, ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169713:94"/>if they be got in, they ſhall quickly be ſent packing again, Zach. 13 1. <hi>In that day [when there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem becauſe of him whom they had pierced,</hi> Chap. 12.10, 11.] <hi>There ſhall be a fountain opened for ſin, and for uncleanneſs, i. e.</hi> abundant ſtreams, not only of Doctrine and Worſhip, but alſo of Diſcipline; for it follows, <hi>That Idols and falſe Prophets ſhall be cut off.</hi> ver. 2. <hi>And if any one continue to Propheſie or Preach lyes, even his Father and Mother that begat him, ſhall cauſe him to be thruſt thorow,</hi> with the ſword of the Spirit, or Church-cenſure; ſuch zeal and impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will there be in the exerciſe of Diſcipline. The effect or ſucceſs thereof follows, ver. 4. <hi>They ſall be aſhamed of their falſe Propheſies or Lyes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In this (as alſo in many other Propheſies) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are clad with legal and old terms.</note> and ſhall caſt off their formal garbs, and varniſhes, whereby they have paſſed for Prophets, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the People. And ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ver. 5. and ſay, <hi>I am no Prophet, I am a Husbandman</hi> (a Weaver, a Mercer &amp;c.) <hi>for man taught me to keep Cattle from my youth.</hi> Yea, they ſhall come to own, to love, and thank thoſe that thus put the penal Laws of Chriſt in force againſt them. ver. 6. <hi>One ſhall ſay unto him, what are theſe wounds in thine hands? then he ſhall anſwer, thoſe with which I was wounded in the houſe of my friends.</hi> Thoſe who diſcovered me, that witneſſed againſt me, that ſmote and cenſured
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169713:95"/>me, they were my friends. See both in one place; tis Mal. 3. ver. 2 3 4 5. <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming, and who ſhal ſtand when he appears? for he is like a Refiners fire; and like Fullers ſoap. And he ſhall ſit as a Refiner, and purifier of Silver, and he ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi, and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in righteouſneſs. Then ſhall the offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord, as in the dayes of old. And I will come near to you in judgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the Sorcerers, and againſt the Adulterers, and againſt falſe Swearers, and againſt thoſe that oppreſs the hireling in his wages, the widdow, and the fatherleſs, and that turn aſide the ſtranger from his right, and fear not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> If this Scripture have been at all fulfilled, it ſhall at this time be much more fulfilled; it ſhall at this time be much more fullfilled; there will be Soap and Niter in his Ordinances, fire in his Diſcipline; and if men be Sorcerers, or Adaulterers, or Oppreſſors, or any way diſcover it, that the fear of God is not in them, God will bring in ſwift witneſs againſt them, and ſharp ſentence upon them. Chriſt will be very glorious in that day in the diſpenſation of all kinds of Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, ſuch as the Ordinances are, ſuch will their effects be upon the hearts and conſciences of men, whom they ſhall bring in as preſents to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the King; excellent Ordinances, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169713:95"/>excellent Converts. In the verſe after my Text, the marriage of the Lamb is come, his Wife hath made her ſelf ready; what her cloathing was, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 8 ſhe was arraied in fine linnen, clean and white; the fine linnen is the righreouſneſſe of the Saints. They'll be fine Saints, gallant Saints; <hi>Herods</hi> gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous appare; did not reflect more gloriouſly to the peoples eyes, then the righteouſneſſe, holineſſe good words ſhall do, which Chriſt in that day ſhall cloath and dreſſe his Church withall. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. This whole Chapter can properly be underſtood of no other time then that of Chriſts kingdom: and ſays God to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</hi> I underſtand the verſe thus; All that are righteous (and many will be ſo) will be eminently righteous; they'll be ſuch fruitfull branches, that every one muſt ſay, they are none of mans pianting, no ordinary plants, but the ſpecial planting of God himſelf; they'll be ſuch excellent Saints, that all muſt acknowledge them the work of Gods own hands after a more eſpecial manner then former Saints were; they'll be every way ſuch, that God will be glorified in them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.12. <hi>They ſhall be called the [Holy people]</hi> (the Context there ſpeaks to this very time and buſineſſe) there ſhall be ſuch a glory of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon them, that they ſhall take a name from it, and be thereby known and diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169713:96"/>Saints and men of other times. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.20, 21. <hi>In that day there ſhall be upon the Bels of the horſes, [Holineſſe to the Lord]</hi> yea, <hi>and every Pot in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem and in Iudah ſhall be [Holineſſe to the Lord.]</hi> I take the meaning to be this; They ſhall diſcover much holineſſe, not only when they are in religious duties, but alſo in the civil uſe of every creature they meddle with, they'll uſe all as in the very ſight of God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And there may be cauſes aſſigned of ſuch their excellencie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Much of the wickedneſſe that hath been in the world hitherto, hath come from Satan. Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible, unconceivable was the ſinfulneſſe of that ſin our firſt parents committed; but you know who tempted them into't; <hi>the Serpent beguiled me,</hi> ſayes <hi>Eve. David</hi> numbred the people; but the Text ſaith, that Satan ſtir'd him to it, or elſe he would never have done ſo vain, ſo proud an action. You remember the counſel <hi>Peter</hi> gave our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and what anſwer Chriſt gave <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> not that <hi>Peter</hi> was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Satan, but that Satan was crept into <hi>Peter. Iudas</hi> betrayed Chriſt; but 'tis ſaid, <hi>Satan entred into him.</hi> Act. 5. <hi>Ananias</hi> had the face to lye, not to men only, but unto God; but he acted from him who is the Father of lyes; <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thy heart?</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay; for what is more then

But [then] Chriſt will tye him up faſt enough in his place, <hi>Rev</hi> 16. The Kings of the earth, and of the whole world (inſtigated, acted by the Spirits of Divels) engage in battell againſt God Almighty: Well, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.

                  <p>He had no ſooner carried his Father news (to ſpeak after the manner of men) what a total rout and conqueſt he had got over his Enemies, but while the heat of his rage is yet upon him, he comes down from heaven, <hi>having the key of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, a great chain in his hand, and laid hold on the dragon, that old Serpent, which is the devil, and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years, caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, ſhut him up, ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive Nations no more, till the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> Rev. 20.1.2.3.

After the Apoſtles dayes he did ſo beſtir himſelf as to improve the errours of Chriſtians, the corrupt lives of Chriſtians into the great Apoſtacy or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtianiſm; Then the Dragon gave the Pope his Seat, his Keys, his Power, and great Authority; and the Text ſays, <hi>the bottomleſs pit was opened: yea kept open; for the ſmoak of that helliſh furnace aſcended daily, and darkned the ſun and aire, and ſo continued to do above a thouſand years:</hi> Tis ſtrange to me, that the Devil ſhould be ſhut up, and Hell open: Therefore I am ſatisfied, this Propheſie of binding <hi>Satan</hi> will be fulfilled after the great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of God almighty (and not till then.) Chriſt hath ſhortened his Chain, given him many a curb and check within this hundred years, and will ſo yet more and more; but bound, ſhut up, ſealed up, he will not be, till after the Beaſt and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet are taken and deſtroyed, but then he will, and ſhall deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand years are paſt.</p>
                  <p>In your Iron Mills a fire there might be; but were the bellows taken away, certainly not ſo great, ſo violent a burning by an hundred fold. The Devils that continually day and night haunt &amp; wait upon us, are the great bellows of mens luſts, whereby ſuch a world of flaming iniquity is amongſt us; but when Chriſt ſhall come, and take away theſe bellows, and lock them up, the fire of mens corruptions muſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169713:97"/>needs be exceedingly abated, not only of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, but alſo of men unregenerate. I dare ſay, were it not for the devil, and his Angels, we ſhould not run into ſo many ſins and exorbitancies in a year, as now we do in a moneth. Upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Heatheniſm Satan was caſt down to the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. but upon the pulling down of Pope and Popery, he, with all his Regiments, ſhall be caſt into hell, a trap door let fall upon him, ſealed up, and ſo ſhall not come forth to provoke men to impieties againſt God for a long time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond cauſe of the exceeding great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie that ſhall be in the Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is the abundance of Grace that will come down from heaven upon them. The 72 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is chiefly, if not wholly ſpent upon this Kingdome of Chriſt: <hi>v.</hi> 6. Ye read thus; <hi>He ſhall come down [like rain] upon the mowen graſſe, as [ſhowers] that water the earth. Zach.</hi> 12.10. (I have before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared it; this and the following Chapter ſpeak directly to the time and buſineſſe I am upon) <hi>I will poure upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the spirit of grace and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> (the grace of Faith) <hi>they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced;</hi> (the grace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) <hi>they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſſe for him.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the expreſſion; 'tis not, <hi>I will ſprinkle grace upon them,</hi> but <hi>I will [poure] grace upon them,</hi> the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169713:98"/>grace of faith, the grace of repentance, in which are comprehended all other graces; God will then poure out his Spirit upon them abundantly. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a fountain open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the houſe of David</hi> (<hi>viz</hi> the two Tribes) <hi>and to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the ten Tribes) <hi>for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> We have but ſmall Rivulets, they'll have the Fountain of the blood of Chriſt opened, flowing full ſtream upon them. As I have ſaid before, if theſe two Propheſies were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the dayes of primitive Chriſtians, much more will they be fulfilled in the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day of Chriſts kingdom. Take one Text more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 10, 11. <hi>He ſhewed me that great City, the holy Ieruſalem, deſcending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, and her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a Iaſper-ſtone, cleare as Chryſtal.</hi> Which expreſſions reſolved into their true and native ſenſe, muſt needs be this; The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of precious and glorious graces God will will then ſend down out of heaven upon his people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third and laſt cauſe may be made up thus: The pains and vigilancy of Paſtors over their Flocks, which will be very great, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances falling more immediatly then ever, in the Power, Majeſty, Authority of God upon their hearts; the quick and ſmart acting of Diſcipline which then will be; and that ſpirit of watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169713:98"/>that every man will have over himſelf, and his neighbour alſo; every Saint in that day will be not only his own, but his brothers keeper, and ſtirrer up to the thing thats good. Jer. 50.4, 5. <hi>In thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, [the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Judah to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether] going and weeping, they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God, ſaying, [Come let us] joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> (But the leaſt part of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was fulfilled upon their return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> it chiefly points at a time when <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> all the twelve Tribes ſhall come together to ſeek the Lord, and when they ſhall joyn themſelves to God in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; they renewed their Covenant upon their return out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but that hath been long ſince forgotten; but when they ſhall be called again, then their Covenant with God will be perpetual indeed, from generation to generation, and never be forgotten more) but that which I aym at in this Scripture, lies in theſe words <hi>[Come, let us]</hi> their zeal will mightily provoke one another; you have yet a more pregnant place for it. Zich. 8.20, 21. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, it ſhall come to paſs, that there ſhall come people, and the inhabitants of many Cities; and the inhabitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſaying, let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts, I will go alſo.</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:169713:99"/>That it ſpeaks how the pulſe of Saints will beat one towards another upon the calling of the Jews, the two laſt verſes ſufficiently clear it to any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and intelligent Reader. So then (to give you briefly the ſumme of what I have ſaid upon this branch of the Kingdom) Satan, the bellows that blew mens luſts into ſuch flames, ſhall be taken from amongſt them, whereby their natural corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall lie very ſtill in them: Next, God will ſend down Grace abundantly into their hearts, and nature, which will ſearch out, and exceedingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the luſts that are in men, though they lie hid never ſo cloſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. And laſtly, there will be Paſtors, Ordinances, Diſcipline, and keeping Centinel one over another: by all which means, their Gifts, their Graces and goodneſs will be raiſed to a more abundant height then otherwiſe they would or could have been. I tell you, there will be gallant times for grace and holineſs, ſuch as the world was never acquainted with before.</p>
                  <p>Eigthly, his reign will be wonderful for the peace that ſhall accompany it: when once the great Battle of God Almighty is fought and paſt, Chriſt will then appear to the world to be the true <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> not only King of Righteouſneſs, (as I but now ſhewed you) but alſo King of Salem, <hi>i e.</hi> King of peace, ruling all the Kingdoms of the world (for the generality of them will be his) in external peace. Iſa. 9.6, 7. <hi>To us a Child is born, to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169713:99"/>us a Son is given, he ſhall be called the Prince of Peace; of the increaſe of his government and peace,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> his government of peace, or peace of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) <hi>there ſhall be no end</hi> (and that this be not limited to internal peace) it follows, <hi>upon the Throne of David to order and eſtabliſh it:</hi> but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Throne and government of peace was exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; therefore ſo alſo ſhall Chriſts be. Iſa. 2.2. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt dayes, that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed upon the top of the Mountains, and all Nations ſhall flow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>He ſhall judge among the Nations, and rebuke many People, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plough-ſhares, and their Spears into pruning hooks, and National ſhall not lift up ſword againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> Iſa. 11.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Woolf ſhall dwel with the Lamb, the Leopard ſhall lie down with the Kid, the Calf, the young Lion, and the fatling together; and a little Child ſhall lead them. The Cow and Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lie down together, and the Lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the Oxe. The ſucking Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned Child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den. They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea.</hi> The Prophet goes on in the 10, 11, 12. verſes concerning this Kingdom, and, ſayes he, ver. 13. <hi>The envy alſo of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169713:100"/>Ephraim ſhall depart, the adverſaries of Judah ſhall be cut off, Ephraim ſhall not envy Iudah, Iudah ſhall not vex Ephraim.</hi> Iſa. 60.18. <hi>Violence ſhall be no more heard in thy Land, waſting nor deſtruction within by borders;</hi> and therefore is it ver. 11. <hi>Thy gates ſhall be open continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night.</hi> And ſure ſuch a City who never ſhut their gates, take themſelves out of all poſſibility of danger. This 11. ver. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> quotes, Rev. 21.25. <hi>The gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day, for there ſhall be no night there, (i. e.)</hi> no night of darkneſs cauſed by enemies, wars, ſorrows, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; <hi>for</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I will make all thine Officers peace,</hi> Iſa. 60.17. There were no end of giving you Scriptures that muſt of neceſſity be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the peace of this Kingdom. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 3, 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.24, 25. <hi>My ſervant David</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be a Prince amongst them. And I will make with them a Covenant of Peace, and will cauſe the evil beaſts to ceaſe out of the Land, and they ſhall dwel ſafely in the wilderneſs, and ſleep in the wood, (i. e.)</hi> without fear or danger, which is unuſual and unknown. Ver. 28. <hi>They ſhall no more be a prey to the Heathen, neither ſhall the beaſts of the Land devour them, but they ſhall dwel ſafely, and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi> He gives you light ver. 29. when this ſhall be, <hi>And I will raiſe up for them a plant of Renown, and they ſhall be no more conſume with hunger in the Land, neither bear the

He ſpeaks to our preſent purpoſe, as the context there clearly gives it.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, His Reign will bring wonderful plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and outward proſperity to his Subjects, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.23. <hi>Then ſhall he give the rain of thy ſeed that thou ſhalt ſow the ground withall, and bread of the increaſe of the earth, and it ſhall be fat and plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; in that day ſhall thy cattell feed in large pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>The oxen likewiſe and young aſſes, that ear the ground, ſhall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the ſhovel, and with the fan.</hi> There being ſuch plenty, they will not grudge it them, they may well afford them clean provender.</p>
                  <p>The two following verſes, I quoted under the ſixt Head; they ſpeak of the abundance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Bleſſings Spiritual, all which (ſays the Prophet) ſhall be in the day of the <hi>great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Rev.</hi> 19.20.

                  <p>Tenthly, The ſetting up of this Throne of his will make ſuch a change (from bad to good) in all points, that in Scripture tis called a new world. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. <hi>And I ſaw a new heaven and a new earth, for the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſt away,</hi> viz. The Political Heavens and Earth of Popiſh wordly powers, they vaniſhed, and new ones came up in their place. According to this Text muſt divers others be underſtood, <hi>Iſa</hi> 66. from the 18. verſe to the end of the Chapter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Treats wholly of this Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt verſe, he bids you look on the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes, of the men that had tranſgreſſed againſt Chriſt, how remarkably and everlaſtingly they are deſtroyed: In the 18, 19, 20. verſes, you have the Calling of the Jews, and Nations of the Gentiles: In the 21. and 23. verſes, you have the Miniſters and Ordinances of the Goſpel ſet<note n="*" place="margin">Though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Legall terms.</note> forth; and verſe 22. all this <hi>called new heavens and new earth.</hi> In the Margent of this Scipture, there are divers quotations: I would commend two of them to your notice; One is, <hi>Iſa</hi> 65.17. <hi>For behold I create new heavens, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169713:102"/>new earth; and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into my minde.</hi> That which God will do, is ſo ſtrange, ſo mighty a Work, that in compariſon of Gods former Works of Providence, tis called a Creation of new Heavens and new Earth, which cannot be underſtood concerning the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Heavens and Earth; for 'tis a Propheſie of ſomething to come, that then was not; but there was as much, yea the very ſame Heavens and Earth (properly taken) then, as there is now, or ever will be; there will be no change in the now Viſible or Material Heavens &amp; Earth, but the ſame Earth, Sea, Sun, Moon, Stars to Chriſts laſt coming: Therefore the Prophet means and calls them <hi>[new]</hi> in reſpect of former ones (as tis in the Text) <hi>the former ſhall not be remembred, Honoris gratiâ:</hi> The Political Heavens and Earth (as I ſaid before) of the Pope and Popiſh worldly Kingdoms, theſe ſhall paſs away, and Chriſt ſhall ſet up new Heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> a Heavenly King and Government over all the World; Heavenly Officers to rule under him, <hi>Thy exactors ſhall be righteouſneſs;</hi> heavenly Ordinances, heavenly gifts and graces ſhall ſhine forth, heavenly Paſtors and Diſcipline: and a new earth of external peace, and external plenty: the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes of that 65. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> will force your thus to underſtand it.</p>
                  <p>The other Scripture the Margent quotes, is 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Looking for, and haſtening to the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169713:102"/>coming of the day of God, &amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs we, according to promiſe, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs, <hi>q.d.</hi> though I bid you look for and haſten to the great day of God, wherein all ſhall be ſet on fire; yet nevertheleſs (take ſpecial notice how that word [<hi>nevertheleſs</hi> v. 13.] comes in) do not fear that you ſhall loſe that glorious Kingdom upon earth, that your hearts are generally ſo much ſet upon. (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Lord, wilt thous now reſtore the kingdom to Iſrael;</hi> That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would do it, 'twas commonly known, and believed of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by theſe taken for granted; our Saviour denyes not the matter of their Quaere, ſuffering them to go on in their Faith of the thing it ſelf, only gives check to their curioſity, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons the Father hath put in his own hands.</hi>) Fear not (ſay <hi>Peter</hi>) before the great and laſt burning, we (groundedly from a promiſe) expect that God will make, and give us (in our Poſterity) <hi>new heavens and new earth,</hi> in which ſhall dwell, none of that baſe ungodlineſs, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent heavens and earth of the Kingdoms of this World are full of, but in which ſhall dwell Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs (as tis <hi>Rev</hi> 9 8.)

                  <p>If we that live now, who have taken notice of the preſent ſtate of things, might be raiſed out of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169713:103"/>our graves, and have a full view of the Kingdom Chriſt will ſet up everywhere, certainly there would be no more ſpirit in us; we ſhould cry out, here is noting of that World that was when we were upon earth; we ſee none of the old Kings and Queens, old Rulers, old Governments, old Sins and Sinners, old wayes that formerly were; <hi>all the old things are gone, and behold all is become new:</hi> Here's a new King, and new Officers, new kinde of Preachers, new Ordinances, new Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, new Saints, new Church, new State, <hi>all's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new:</hi> Why, this is not the World that was when we were alive; behold here's a new World that the Lord Chriſt Omnipotent hath Created.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This Kingdom ſhall be of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Surely Chriſt will not be at all this care, coſt, pain, to pull down, to ſet up, to make a new World of it, and all this but for a day, or a year. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years to play <hi>Rex</hi> in; now indeed 'tis pitty <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould not have as long a Reign in the World at leaſt.

I leave it to your judgement what number of years (in this caſe) are to be accounted many; the Saints ſhall enjoy this bleſſed, this glorious reign of Chriſt for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:169713:104"/>
                  <p>But that which goes immediatly before is this, <hi>I will make thee an eternal excellency,</hi> ſpeaking of the Church: The word <hi>[eternal]</hi> here being to be underſtood comparatively, to other great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms that have been ſet up, and in time fallen, muſt import a duration as great as to the end of the World; an eternal excellency <hi>(i. e.)</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency while the World ſtands, according to <hi>Dans.</hi> 2.44. <hi>In the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the kingdom ſhall not be left to other people, but ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> Dan: 7.14. <hi>His dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But youle ſay, how can this be reconciled with that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.7, 8, 9. <hi>When the thouſand ſhall be expired, Satan ſhall be looſed out of priſon, and ſhall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battell, the number of whom is as the ſand of the Sea: And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compaſſed the camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City,</hi> hoping to make an end of them at once, that the world might be troubled with them no more. Where is the glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt at this time, ſhall it not be even broken and loſt?</p>

                        <item>3.

                           <hi>Blindneſſe in part is happened to Iſrael, untill the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentiles be come in, and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved; as it is written</hi> (Iſa. 59.20.) <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Diliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſſe from Jacob.</hi> And ſayes God, when I ſhall make this good unto them, I will bind my ſelf to them by covenant, that my Spirit which I ſhall put upon them, my word which I ſhall put into their hearts and mouth, ſhall not depart from them, nor from their ſeed, nor from their ſeeds ſeed, while the world ſtands. I ſay, ſurely the people of the Jewes, when once they are brought in to Chriſt again, they'l not forſake him any more for ever; which will be enough to make Chriſt a viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon earth: And when all the powers and policies of the world are united in this deſigned of compaſſing, and ſo deſtroying the holy City. Chriſt will not ſuffer his Scepter to be wreſted out of his hand, nor the viſibility of his kingdome and dominion to faile, and therefore<note n="*" place="margin">Some judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that all muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be from God.</note> fire comes down from God out of heaven, and deſtroys them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9. whereupon the glory of this Church and Kingdome will revive and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh again; and thus his dominion is an everlaſting dominion which ſhall not paſſe away, and his Kingdome that which ſhall not be deſtroyed. When we ſpeak of the great and glorious Rule and Kingdome of Chriſt over the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169713:105"/>generality of nations, peoples and languages, (as here we do) of this we ſay only, it ſhall laſt a long time, it ſhall continue a thouſand years, it ſhall be the joy of many generations.</item>
