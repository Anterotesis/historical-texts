         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, no better motiue there is for a safe gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
sincere meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of death, (equalling Kings to beggers)
and of the seuere and exact iustice of God, requiring of
him, that the good suffering miserie in this life, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
ioy in the other, and the wicked flourishing secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, might be punished in the other. That which pleaseth lasteth
but a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth is euerlasting. Many things we see vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded
or vnpunished in this inferior world, which in the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
weights of Gods iustice must be counterpoised elsewhere. but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and secret murder hath seldome bene observed to escape vndisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
or vnpunished euen in this life, such a particular and notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
perpetually followeth it; to the end that they who ar either
<hi>Atheists, Lucianistes,</hi> or <hi>Machiauellists</hi> may not trust too much to there
owne wits in doing so horrible iniustice. Wold to God your Majestie
wold well consider what I have often sayd to my Master King <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi>
The greatest policie is honestie, and howsoëuer any man seeme to
him selfe wise in compassing his desires by trickes, yet in the end he
will prooue a foole. for falsehood euer deceiveth her owne master at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:348:3"/>
length, as the deuill author of all falshood alwayes doth, leauing his
adhaerents desolate, when they haue greatest need of his helpe. No fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
without iniustice, no iniustice without falshood albeit it were in
the person of a king. There is no iudge in the world more tied to doo
iustice then a King, whose coronation tieth him vnto it by solemne
oath, which if he violat he is salfe and periured. It is iustice that maketh
Kings, iustice that maintaineth Kings, and iniustice that bringeth both
Kingdomes and Kings to destruction to fall in miserie, to die like asses
in ditches or more beastly deathes, with eternall infamie after death, as
all histories from time to time doe clearly testifie. What need hath
mankinde of Kings, but for iustice? men ar not borne for them but they
for men. What greater, what more Royall occasion in the wold could
be offered vnto your Majestie to show your vnpartiall disposition in
matter of iustice at the first entree of your raigne then this which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
my iust complaint against <hi>Buckingham;</hi> by whom your Majestie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
your selfe so farre to be led, that your best subiects ar in doubt,
whether he is your King or you his. If your Majestie Know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how he hath tyrannised ouer his Lord, and master, King
<hi>Iames,</hi> the worldly creator of his fortunes, how insolent, how ingrat
an oppressor, what a murtherer and treator he hath proued himselfe
towards him, how treacherous to his vpholding friend the <hi>Marquis</hi>
of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and others, your Maiestie may think the giuing way to the
lawes demanded against him, to yeeld a most glorious field for your
Majestie to walke in, and display the banner of your Royall vertues.
Your Majestie may perhaps demand, what interest haue I therin? What
haue I to doe therewith, that I should stirre, all others being quiet. Sir
the quietnes or stirring of others expecteth onely a beginning from
me, whom they know to be so much obliged to stirre as that none can
be more, both in respect of knowledge of passages, and in regard of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
obligation, and of my independencie from the accused or any
one that his powar or credit can reach vnto. Many know not what I
know therein, others ar litle or nothing beholding to the dead,
others albeit they know as well as I, and ar obliged as deeply as
I, yet dare not complaine so safely as I, being out of there reach who ar
inseparable from him by his enchanteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and able to obscure my selfe
vntill that the powar of iust reuenge vpon him and his adherents be
obtained from God. What I know sufficient against him, I haue set
downe in my petition to the parliament, vnto which if your Majestie
dismisse him sequestred from your Majestie, chiefely in an accusation
of treason, your Majestie shall doe what is most iust, and deliuer your
selfe, and your Kingedoomes from the captiuitie in which he holdeth
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:348:3"/>
them and your Majestie oppressed. How easily I may ecclipse my selfe
from his powar to do me harme vnlesse he hath legions of infernall
spirits at his command to pursue me, your Majestie may well know, I
being vltramarin vnto these dominions where he raigneth and rageth.
How farre I am obliged to complaine more then others I will only in
few words expresse, that neither your Majestie nor any man may
thinke otherways, but that I haue most iust reason not to be silent in
wrongs so intolerable. The interest of bloud which I haue to any of
them of whose death I complaine, either by the house of <hi>Balgony Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
or by the house of <hi>Siluertonhill,</hi> albeit it is easy to be made manifest
and sufficient to moue me, yet is it not the sole motiue of my breach of
silence.</p>
            <l>For birth, and ancestors, and vvhat vve haue not done,</l>
            <l>Scarce call I ours.</l>
            <p>But the interest of receaued courtesies, and the heape of infallible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of true affection is more then sufficient to sturre me therto, vnlesse
I wold proue the most ingrate in the world, and senselesse of the
greatest iniuries that can be done to my selfe. For who hath killed King
<hi>Iames</hi> and the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> in that parte of the iniurie
which is done to me, therein he hath done as much as robbed me of
my life and of all my fortunes. Friends with such constant and louing
impressions of me, ar neither to be recouered nor duely valued. For his
Majestie from the third yeare of my age, did practise honourable tokens
of singular fauor towards me, dayly augmented them, in word, in writ,
in deed accomplished them, with giftes, patents, offices, recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
both in priuat and in publicke, at home, and abroad, graced me so
farre that I could scarce haue asked him any thing which I could not
also obtaine. How much honor he hath done to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me there needeth no
witnes vnto your Majestie who is sufficient for many. No lesse was my
Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> his friendship established by mutuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of most acceptable offices continued by our ancestours these
three generations, engrauen in the tender mindes and yeares of
the <hi>Marquis</hi> and me, in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our soueran King <hi>Iames.</hi> For when
the <hi>Marquis</hi> his father with the right hand vpon his head, and the left
vpon mine, did offer vs young in yeares so ioyned to kisse his Maiesties
hand, recommending me vnto his Maiesties fauour, said, I take God to
vvitnes that this young man his father vvas the best friend that euer I
had or euer shall haue in this vvorld. Wherupon the young Lord resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to put trust in me, and I fully to addict myu selfe vnto him, to deserue
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:348:4"/>
of him as much commendation as my father did of his father. This
Royall celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our friendship rooted it selfe so deepe in my minde
that to my selfe I proposed this remembrance, giuing it to the young
Lord and to my familiar freinds, and set it vpon all the bookes of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

            <p>Neither was it in vaine. for both our loues increased with our age,
the <hi>Marquis</hi> promising to ingage his life and his whole estate for me if
need were, and to share his fortunes vvith me, and not only promising
but also performing vvhen euer there vvas occasion. Yea for my cause,
offering to hasard his life in combat, vvhose minde in vvishing me
vvell, vvhose tongue in honouring of me, and vvhose hands and meanes
in defending me both absent and present, vnto the last period of his life

euery particular fauor so manifestly knovve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the whole court
and to the freindes of both. Who then can iustly blame me for deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
iustice as vvell for the slaughter of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> as of
my most gratious soueran King <hi>Iames,</hi> seinge I knovve vvhom to accuse.
My profession of Physick, nor my education to lettres, can not serve to

to vvrit and doo earnestly against him, as may very vvell appeare. For
since the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> his death, the most noble <hi>Marquis</hi> de
Fiatta, embassador for the most Christian King of France, and also <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
his mother sent on euery side to seeke me, inuiting me to them:
but I did forsake them, knowing certenly the falshood of <hi>Bukingham,</hi>
who wold rather haue suffered the <hi>Embassador</hi> to receiue an effront,
then to be vnsatisfied of his bloodthristie desire of my blood to silence
me with death (for according to the prouerbe, the dead can not bite) if
he could haue found me. for my <hi>L. Duke</hi> of <hi>Lenox</hi> who was often cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and with his brother, and the <hi>Erle</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
and others now dead, was one of the roll found of those that were to
be murdered, vvell assured me, that where <hi>Buchingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> once misliked,
no apologie, no submission, no reconciliation could keepe him from
doing mischeefe. Neither do I writ this in this fashion so freely, for
any entertainement here present, which I haue not, nor for any future,
which I haue no ground to looke for; seing <hi>Buckingham</hi> hath so misled
your Maiestie that he hath caused not only here, but also vnto all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s all

buried with King <hi>Iames</hi> the glorious title of a peacemaker Kinge: who
had done much more iustly, &amp; more advisedly if he had procured peace
vnto Christiandome. Wherby small hope I have of obtaining iustice
in my most iust complaint, vnto vvhich my true affection to my dead

is the preseruation and protection of the subiects
liues, liberties, and estates, from priuat or publike iniuries,
to the end that all things may be caried in the equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of iustice; without the which no <hi>Monarchie,</hi> no
common wealth, no societie, no familie, yea no mans life or estate can
consist albeit neuer so little: it can not be thought iniust to demand of
Kings and parliaments the censure of wrongs. The consideration her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was so great in our late <hi>Monarch</hi> of happy memorie King <hi>Iames,</hi>
that he hath often publikly protested, euen in the presence of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
heire, that if his owne sonne should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit murther or any such
execrable act of iniustice, he would not spare him, but would haue him
die for it, and wold haue him more seuerely punished the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other. For
he well obserued, no greater iniustice, no iniury more intolerable ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be
done by man to man then murther. In all other wrongs fortune hath recours,
the losses of honor or goods may be repaired, satisffaction may be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:348:6"/>
made, reconciliation may be procured, so long as the party inuried is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
but when the person murthered is bereft of his life, what can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
it? what satisfaction can be giuen him, where shall the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
meete with him to be reconciled to him, vnlesse he be sent out of
this world to follow his spirite, which by his wickednes he hath sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body? Therfor of all iniuries, of all the actes of iniustice,
and of all things most to be looked into, murther is the greatest, and of
all murthers the poysoning vnder trust aud profession of freindship, is
the most haynous. Which if you suffer to go vnpunished, let no man
thinke him selfe so secure to liue amongst you, as amongst the wildest
aud most furious beastes in the world. for by vigilancie and
industrie meanes may be had to resist, or euite the most violent beast
thar euer nature bred, but from false and treacherous hartes, from poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
murtherers what wit or wisdome can defend? This concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
your lordships every one in particular as well as any. They of
whose poysoning your petitioner complaineth, to wit king <hi>Iames,</hi> the
L. <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and others whose names after shalbe expressed,
haue beene the most eminent of the kingdome, and satte on these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
benches wheron your honors now do sitte. The party whom
your petitioner accuseth the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is so powerfull that
vnlesse the whole body of a parliament lay hold vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, no iustice ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be had of him. For what place is there of iustice, what office of the
crowne, vvhat degree of honor in the kingdome vvhich he hath not
sold, and sold in such crast that he can shake the buyers out of them,
and intrude others at his Pleasure? All the Iudges of the kingdome, all
the officers of the state ar his bound vassals, or allies, or afeared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his outcasts, as is notorious to all his Maiesties true and loving
subiects. Yea so farre hath his ambitious practises gone, that vvhat he
vvold have done should have beene performed vvhether the king
would or not, and vvhat the king vvold have done could not be done if
he opposed, vvherof many instances may be given vvhensoeuer they
shall be required, neyther ar they vnkovven to this honorable assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.
Hovvsoeuer the meanes he vseth be lavfull or vnlavvfull, humane
or diabolike, so he tortereth the kingdome that he procureth the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
breaking or continuing of parliaments at his pleasure, placeing or
displaceing the Officers of iustice, of the counsell, of the kings court, of
the courtes of iustice to his violent pleasure, and as his ambitious villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
moueth him. What hope then ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your petitioner have that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainte

iustice he may dispaire, to provoke the Duke to send forth a poysoner
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:348:6"/>
or other murtherer to dispetch him, and send him after his dead
freinds allready murthered, he may be sure this to be the euent. Let
the euent be what it will, come what soeuer can come, the losse of his
owne life your petitioner valueth not, having suffered the losse of the
lives of such eminent friends, esteeming his life can not be better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
then vpon the discovery of so haynous murthers. Yea the iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the cause, the dearenes aud neerenes of his freinds murthered,

which against any privat man ar sufficient for his apprehension

only for the present declare vnto your honors the two most eminent
murthers committed by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> to wit of the Kings Majestie, and
of the L. <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> which for all the subtilitie of his poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
art could not be so cunningly conveyed as the murtherer
thought, but that God hath discovered manifestly the author. And to
observe the order of the time of there death because the L. <hi>Marquis</hi>

well knowing that the L. <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> was acknowledged by
King <hi>Iames</hi> to be the prime man in his dominions, who next to his
owne line in his propre season might clame an hereditarie title to the

neuer suffered the King to be at rest, but vrged him alwayes to send

so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne with <hi>Buckingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> neece making greate promises of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which

the meane familie of the bride could not performe vvithout the kings

thousand florens) vvith the <hi>Erledome</hi> of <hi>Orknay</hi> vnder the title of a
Duke whatsoeuer the <hi>Marquis</hi> vvold accept, euen to be the first Duke of
<hi>Britan.</hi> The glorious title of a Duke the <hi>Marquis</hi> refused tvvise vpon spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reasons reserued to him selfe. The matter of money vvas no motiue
to cause the <hi>Marquis</hi> match his sonne so vnequally to his degree, seing
<hi>Buckingham</hi> him selfe the chief of his kinred vvas but a nouice in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
his father obscure amongst gentlemen, his mother a seruing vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and he being infamous for his frequent consultations vvith the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders
of witches, principally that false Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> publikly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for vvitchcraft. VVherby the <hi>Marquis</hi> knovving that the
king vvas so farre bevvitched to <hi>Buckingham</hi> that if he refused the
match demanded, he should find the kings deadly hatred against him.
And seing that <hi>Buckinghams</hi> neece vvas not yet nubile in yeares, and
that before the mariage should be confirmed a vvay might be
found out to annull it, vnto vvhich he vvas forced by deceitfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
therfore he yeelded vnto the kings desire of the match.
wherupon <hi>Buckingham</hi> and his faction fearing that delayes Wold
breed lets, vrged my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> to send for his sonne upon a sunday
morning be times in all hast from <hi>London</hi> to courtat <hi>Greenvvich,</hi> where
neuer a word Was spoken of mariage to the young lord, till a <hi>Litle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
supper, and the mariage made before the king after supper. and to
make it more authentike <hi>Buckingham</hi> caused his neece be layd a bed
with the <hi>Marquis</hi> his sonne for a short tyme in the kings cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, and in
his Majeties prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, albeit the brid was yet innubile. Many vvere astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
at the suddaine nevves thereof. All the <hi>Marquis</hi> his friends fretting
thereat, and some writing vnto him very scornefull letters for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
The <hi>Marquis</hi> hauing satisfyed the kings demand, did what he could
to preuent the confirmation of the mariage, and intended to send his
sonne beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the seaes to travel through <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> and so passe his
tyme abroad vntill the tyme that meanes were found to vntye that knot
which <hi>Buckingham</hi> had vrged the king to tye vpon his sonne. But
<hi>Buckingham</hi> to contreuene the <hi>Marquis</hi> his desaine caused the king and
the Prince to make the <hi>Marquis</hi> his sonne be sworne gentleman of the
Prince-his bedchamber, and so to be detayned with him vvithin the
kingdome vntill that the bride vvas of yeares ripe for mariage.</p>
               <p>The tyme expired that <hi>Buckingham</hi> his neece became marigeable,
<hi>Buckingham</hi> sent to the <hi>Marquis</hi> to desire him to make the mariage
completly confirmed. The <hi>Marquis</hi> not vvilling to heare of any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:348:7"/>
such matter answered breefly, he scorned the motion. This ansvver re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and he seing him selfe likly to be frustrate of his
ambitious matching of his neece, and perceauing that the <hi>L. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>
vvas able to raise a great faction aganst him whether king <hi>Iames</hi>
did liue or die, was mightily ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed against the <hi>Marquis,</hi> at his first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with him did challenge him of speaking disdainefully of him
and his house. The <hi>Marquis</hi> replyed that he did not remember of any
offensiue words vttered by him selfe against <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Then <hi>Buckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>
proudly sayd vnto him out of the words of thy mouth I vvill iudge
the. For you haue sayd you scorned the motion of matching vvith my
house, vvhich I made vnto yovv. The <hi>Marquis</hi> ansuered that if he
had sayd so, it became not the Duke to speake to him in that fashion.
So <hi>Buckingham</hi> threatned to be reuenged, the <hi>Marquis</hi> vttrered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance.
and thus the quarrell begoud, vvhich foure or fiue tymes reiterate
and as often reconciled by the <hi>Marquis</hi> de Fiatta a litle before the
<hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> fell sicke, vvherin it is euident that the
quarrell hath been very violent that needed so many reconciliations,
the Ducks fire of his anger and furie being inextinguible, as king
<hi>Iames</hi> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure him in his absence albeit a fauorite, that he vvas
vvo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully vindicatiue vvhose malice insatiable tovvards my <hi>L. Marquis</hi>

can any man tell vvhether by the <hi>Marquis</hi> in his sicknes <hi>Buckingham</hi>
vvas more suspected then accused of the poyson giuen or to be giuen
him. For he vvold not tast of any thing that vvas sent to him by any of
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> freinds but he vvold first haue some of his seruants tast it
before; and for the loue that was mutuall betvvixt him and your peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner

your petitioner also tasted of all that he tooke at that time, vnto
whom his suspicion of <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he expressed by name, and to other
sufficient witnes, who will iustifie it vpon oath, if there be any course
taken therin for the searche therof. All the tyme of his sicknes he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
your petitioner not to suffer my L. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to come neere
him, but your petitioner hauing often sent word aud also sometymes
signified him selfe to <hi>Buckingham</hi> that there vvas no fit oportunitie to
see the <hi>Marquis,</hi> pretending something to be ministred vnto him, but
vvhen your petitioner could find no more excuses, he tould my L. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis</hi>
that he had put my <hi>L.</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> avvay so often that he could
not keepe him avvay any longer, but that he must needs see him. Then
he knovving <hi>Buckinghams</hi> visit to proceed of dissimulation, requested
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:348:8"/>
your petitioner at least to find the meanes, to gett him avvay quikly,
vvhich your petitioner did, interrupting <hi>Buckinghams</hi> discourse
and intreating him to suffer my. <hi>L Marquis</hi> to be quiet. This did
euidenly shovv my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> his disliking and distrusting of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> whereas he was well pleased with other noblemens
compainie. all the tyme of his sicknes the Duke and my L. <hi>Denbigh</hi>
wold not suffer his ovvne sonne to come to him, pretending
that he was also sicke, which vvas false for the tyme that my
L. <hi>Marquis</hi> called for him after that your petitioner aduised his
Lordship to dispose of his estate and of his conscience, because his
sicknes was not without danger. which your petitioner four dayes
before my L. his death did in such maner that he gaue him no
cause to dispare of his health, but intreated him to commit all the
caire of his health to God and his Physitians, assuring him how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he had gotten wrong abroad, he should get none in the
cure of his disease. At length his lordship burst out in these words
to my lord <hi>De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bigh,</hi> it is a greate crueltie in you that yovv vvill not suffer
my sonne to come to me when I am a dying that I may see him
and speake to him before I die. so they delayed his comming with
excuses vntill my L. his agonie of death vvas neere, to the end that
he should not haue tyme to giue his sonne priuat instructions to
shun the mariage of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> neece, or to signifie vnto him the
suspicion that he had of poyson, for they had rather his sonne should
knovve any thing then either of these. Yet many did suspect his
poyson before he dyed, for tvvo dayes before his death tvvo of his
seruants dyed with manifest signes and symptomes of poyson, one
belonging to his wine seller, and another to his kitchin. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
houre being come that my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> deceased, your petitioner
intreated them that were present to suffer no man to toutch his body
vntill that he retourned to see it opened, for then he protested earnestly
that all the tyme of his sicknes he iudged him to be poysoned, and
in all consultations vrged allvvayes antidotes to be administred, but
this poyson vvas such and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> farre gone that none could helpe.
Neuerthelesse to haue the matter concealed <hi>Buckinghams</hi> folks wold
haue had him buryed that same night in, <hi>VVestminster</hi> church, and the
ceremonies of the buriall to be made aftervvard, saying that such
delicate bodyes as his, could not be long kept. But his friends taking
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:348:8"/>
hold of the caueat giuen them by your petitioner, refused so to doe
and replyed that they vvold haue him as became him buryed in
<hi>Scotland</hi> in his ovvne Chappell vvhere his ancestours haue beene buryed
about this four hundreth yeeres ago, and that his body must be
first visited by his Physitians. No sooner vvas he dead, vvhen the
force of the poyson had ouercome the forces of his body, but it begoud
to svvell in such sort that his thighes vvere as big as six tymes
there naturall proportion, his belly became as big as the belly of
an oxe, his armes as big as the naturall quantitie of his thighes,
his necke so broad as his shoulders, his cheekes ouer the tope
of his nose, that his nose could not be seene or distinguished, the
skinne of his forehead ouer his eyes, and the same skinne, vvith all
the rest of the skinne of his head tvvo finger high svvelled, his
haire of his beard, eyebrovves, and head, so farre distant one from
an other, as if an hundreth had beene taken out betwixt euery
one, and when one did toutch his haire it came avvay with the skin
as easily as if one had pulled hay out of an heape of hay. He
Was all ouer his breast, necke, shoulders, and armes, blistered
with blisters so big as ones fist, with blisters I saie, of six diuers colours
full of vvaters of the same coulours, some white, some blacke,
some red, some yeallovv, some greene, some blevv, and that
as well within his body as vvithout. Also the cauities of his
liuer greene, his stomake in some places a litle purpurated vvith
a blevvish clammie matter adharinge to the sides of it, his mouth
and nose foming blood mixt with froth of diuers coulors a
yard high. Your petitioner being sent for to come visit his body
and his seruants all flocking about him saying see, see, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
weeping sayd he vvas poysoned, and that it vvas a
thing not to be suffered, moreouer he sayd that albeit his speach
might cost him his life, yet seing his sorrovv had extorted that speech
out of him, he vvold make it manifest and vvold haue a iury of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians

be guylty (sayd the <hi>Captaine</hi>) it will show it selfe. Which in deed
it did. For the Duke being aduertised hereof sent for his owne
Physitians and others out of London, whom he caused first to be
brought to him before they went to see the <hi>Marquis</hi> his body, giuing
them his direction in these words, my masters there is a brute spred
abroad that the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> is poysoned. Go and see, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
what yow speake of poyson, (which he said in a threatning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of deliuery) for now euery noble man that dyeth must be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.
If his conscience had not beene guilty should he not haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Physitians to inquire be all meanes possible, and make it
knowen rather then to suppresse the speech of the poysoning. These
Physitians being come, your petitioner with the one hand leading
Doctor <hi>Moore</hi> to the table where the <hi>Marquis</hi> his body was laid to
be opened, and with the other hand throwing of the clothe from the
body sayd to him, looke yow here vpon this pitifull spectacle. At the
sight therof Doctor <hi>Moore</hi> lifting up both his hands and his hat and
his eyes to the heauens astonished, sayd <hi>Iesus</hi> blisse me, I neuer saw
the like. I can not know him, I can not distinguish a face vpon him,
aud in like maner all the rest of the Doctors and also the Chirurgians
affirmed that they never saw the like, albeit they had traveled and
practised through the greatest part of Europe, only one that saw my L.
of <hi>Southamptons</hi> body opened in <hi>Holland</hi> (which L. was also one of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinghams</hi>
opposits) sayd that my L. of <hi>Southamptons</hi> body was blistered
all within the breast as my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> his was. <hi>Doctor Leester</hi> one of my
L. of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> creatures, seing Doctor <hi>Moore</hi> and others so amased
at the sight of my lords body, drew first him a syde and then the others
one after an other, and whispered them in the eare to silence them.
wherupon many went away without speaking one worde, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who remayned acknowledged that those accidents of the dead
body could not be without poyson, but they sayd they could not know
how such a subtil art of poysoning could be brought into <hi>England,</hi>
your pettioner replying that money could bring both the art and
the artist from the furthest part of the vvorld into <hi>England.</hi> from
vvhence since your petitioner departed he hath conferred vvith the
skilfullest pestmasters that could be found, vvho visit the bodyes of those
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:348:9"/>
that die of the venime of the pest. They all admire the description oe
my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> his body, and testifie that neuer any of the pest hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such
accidents, but carbuncles, bubons, or the spots, no such huge blis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
with waters, and such an huge vniforme swelling to such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sions
aboue six-tymes the naturall proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But he hath met with
some, who haue practised the poysoning of dogges to trie the forces of
some antidotes, and they haue found that some poysons haue made the
dogges sicke for a fortnight or more, without any swelling vntill they
were dead, and then they swelled aboue measure, and became bliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with waters of diuers colours, and the haire came away vvith the
skin vvhen it vvas toutched. The Plysitians then vvho remained were
willing to certifie with there handwrit that my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> was
poysoned, but your petitioner tould them it was not needfull, seing we
must attend Gods leasure to discouer the author, the matter being so
apparent, and so many hundreths hauing seene his body to witnesse it,
for the doores were kept open for euery man to behold and to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
who wold. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> making some counterfeited
show of sorrow to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great qualitie, found no other shift to diuert
the suspicion of the poysoning of the <hi>Marquis</hi> from his selfe, but to
lay it vpon his Master the King, saying that the <hi>Marquis</hi> for his
perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, spirite, &amp; cariage, was such that he was borne worthy to reigne,
but the King his Master hated him to death, because he had a spirit
too much for the commonwealth. Wherby the Duke shew him selfe
no good subiect of the Kings, who made the Kings humor to be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall,
and the King a bloodthristie murtherer, and a most vile dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler
hauing heaped so many honors dayly vpon the <hi>Marquis</hi> euen
to the very last, making him Lord high <hi>Stevvard</hi> of his Maiesties house
and iudge of the verge court, whom he had made before <hi>Viceroy</hi> of
<hi>Scotland</hi> for the tyme of the parliament in <hi>Scotland, Erle</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
a priuy counselor in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> and Knight of the garter, as if he had raised
him to all these honors that the murthering of him might be the lesse
suspected to proceed from him. The Kings nature hath bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allways ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
to be so gratious and so free harted to euery one, that he would
neuer haue wished the <hi>Marquis</hi> any harme vnlesse that <hi>Buckingham</hi>
had put great feares and ialousies in his minde, for if any other had
done it, he would haue acquainted his fauorite therewith, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was it
<hi>Buckinghams</hi> duety to remoue from the King such sinistrous conceits
of the <hi>Marquis,</hi> as the <hi>Marquis</hi> hath ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doone for <hi>Buckingham,</hi> vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him in all occasions, and keeping the King from giuing way to
introduce any other fauorite. Wherefore <hi>Buckingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in that diuersion of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:348:10"/>
the crime from him selfe, hath not only made the King but also
himselfe guylty of the <hi>Marquis</hi> his death. But <hi>Buckinghams</hi> falshood
and euill intention long before vvas rightly discouered, vvhen he did
what he could to make the <hi>Erle</hi> of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

neere Kinsmen of my Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> so ince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed at him, that they had
likely all three killed one an other if it had not been that my L. <hi>Marquis</hi>
by his vvisdome did let them all knovv how they vvere abused. if any
dissimulation be greater then <hi>Buckinghams</hi> let any man iudge, for
vvhen my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> his body vvas to be transported from Whitehall
to his house at <hi>Bishopsgate, Buckingham</hi> came out muffed and furred in
his coatch, giving out that he vvas sick for sorrovv of my L. <hi>Marquis</hi>
his death, but so soone as he vvent to his house out of <hi>London</hi> before
his coming to the King he triumphed and dominired vvith his factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
so excessively, as if he had gayned some greate victorie, and the next
day comming to the King put on a most lamentable and mournefull
countenance for the death of the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton.</hi> No greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
could he haue gotten to his mind, then to haue destroyed that
man vvho could and vvould haue fetched his head of his shoulders if
he had outliued King <hi>Iames</hi> to haue knovven his cariage in the poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him in his sicknes, wherfore he thought it necessary to remoue
the <hi>Marquis</hi> before hand. The same day that my <hi>L. Marquis</hi> dyed <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>
sent my Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> his sonne out of the towne, keeping
him as a prisoner that none could haue priuat conference with him
vntill his mariage of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> neece was complete, but allwayes
either my L. <hi>Denbigh</hi> or my lady <hi>Denbigh</hi> or my L. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> or
the countesse of <hi>Buckingham</hi> or the Dutchesse of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
that none could let him vnderstand how his father was murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
euen your pertioner him selfe when he went to see him within
few dayes after his fathers death was intreated not to speake to him of
the poysoning of his father which he did conceale at his first meeting
because there sorrovv vvas too recent, but he vvas preuented of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
meeting. Neither vvould <hi>Buckingham</hi> suffer the young lord to go
to <hi>Scotland</hi> to his fathers funeralls and to take order vvith his freinds
concerning his fathers estate, for feare that there intended mariage,
should be ouer throvvne. This captiuitie of the young lord <hi>Marquis</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
so long vntill that <hi>Buckingham</hi> caused his Maiestie King <hi>Charles</hi>
take the young lord with him selfe and <hi>Buckingham</hi> into K. <hi>Iames</hi> his
<hi>Parke</hi> discharging all others to follovv them, and there to perswade
and vrge the younge lord without any more delay to accomphih his
mariage vvith <hi>Buckinghams</hi> neece, which instantly vvas performed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:348:10"/>
so that <hi>Buckingham</hi> trusteth and presumeth that albeit the young lord
should vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hovv his father vvas poysoned by his meanes, yet
being maryed to his neece, should not sturre to reuenge it, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with it. To all what is obserued before, it is vvorthy to be added
that the bruit vvent through <hi>London</hi> long before my L. Duke of
<hi>Richemonds</hi> death, or his brothers, or my lord of <hi>Southamptons,</hi> or of the
<hi>Marquis,</hi> that all the noblemen that vvere not of <hi>Buckinghams</hi>
faction should be poysoued, and so remoned out of his way. Also a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
vvas founde in kingstreete about the tyme of the Duke of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>
death, wherin the names of all these noblemen vvho haue dyed
since vvere expressed, and your petitioners name also set next to the
lord <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamiltons</hi> name, vvith these vvords <hi>to embavvme</hi>
him. This paper vvas brought him by my lord <hi>Oldbarres</hi> dawghter
cousin german to the lord <hi>Marquis. Likevvays</hi> a mountebanke about
that tyme vvas greatly countenanced by the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and by
his meanes procured letters patents and recommendation from the
King to practise his skill through all <hi>England,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to <hi>London</hi>
offered to sell poysons to kill men or beasts within a yeere, or halfe
a yeare, or tvvo yeares, or a moneth, or tvvo, or vvhat tyme praefixed

Moreouer the Christmas before my L. <hi>Marquis</hi> his death one
of the Prince his footemen sayd that some of the greate ones at court
had gotte poyson in his belly but he could not tell vvho it vvas. Here
your honors considering the premisses of my L. of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his
ambitious and most vindicatiue nature, his frequent quarrels vvih my L.
<hi>Marquis</hi> after so many reconciliations, his threatning of him, his
threatning of the Phisitians to speake of poyson, his triumphing after
my Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> his death, his detayning of his sonne almost as a
prisoner vntill the mariage complete vvith his neece, the preceeding

how that the King begoud to censure him in his absence freely,
and that many spoke boldly to the King against him, and how the

and how the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton</hi> vpon the suddaine nevves of the
Prince his departure, had noblely reprehended the King, for sending the
Prince vvith such a young man vvithout experience, and in such a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat
and suddain manner, vvithout acquainting the nobilitie or counsell
thervvith, vvrotte a very bitter letter to the Lord <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
conceiued nevv ambitious courses of his ovvne, and vsed all the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

he so caryed him selfe that vvhat soeuer the King commanded in his

perceiuing the King highly offended and that the Kings minde
vvas beginning to alter tovvards him, suffering him to be quarrelled
and effronted in his Maiesties presence, and obseruing that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
my Lord of <hi>Bristou</hi> to be a rod for him, vrging dayly his dispetch

vvold secund my Lord of <hi>Brestovves</hi> accusations against him. He knevv
also that the King had vovved, that in despite of all the deuils of hell
he vvold bring the <hi>Spanish</hi> match about againe, and that the <hi>Marquis</hi>

old man, it vvas novv tyme for him to be at his rest, and to be confined
to some parke to passe the rest of his tyme in hunting, and the Prince to
be crovvned. The more the King vrged him to be gone to <hi>France</hi>
the more shiftes he made to staye, for he did euidently see that the
King was fully resolued to rid him selfe of the oppression wherin he
held him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:348:11"/>The King being sicke of a tertian ague, and that in the spring
which vvas of it selfe neuer found deadly, the Duke tooke his opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
when all the Kings Doctors of Physicke vvere at Dinner vpon
the munday before the King dyed, without there knovvledge or
consent, offered to the King a white povvder to take, the which the
King longtime refused, but ouercome by his flattering importunitie at
length tooke it, drunk it in wine, and immediatly became vvorse and
worse, falling into many soundings and paynes, and violent fluxes
of the belly so tormented, that his Maiestie cryed out aloud, o
this white povvder! this white povvder! wold to God I had neuer
taken it, it wil cost me my liffe. In lyke maner the countesse of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> my L. of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> mother vpon the fryday therafter,
the Physitians also being absent and at dinner, and not made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with her doings, applyed a plaster to the Kings harte and breast,
wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Maiestie grevv fainte, short breathed and in great agonie.
Some of the Physitians after dinner retouning to see the King, by
the offensive smell of the plaister perceiued some thing to be about
the King hurtfull to him, and searched what it could be, found it out
and exclamed that the King vvas poysoned. Then <hi>Buckingham</hi> entring
commanded the Physitians out of the roome, caused one to be
committed prisoner to his ovvne chamber, and another to remoue
from court, quarrelled others of the Kings servants in the sick Kings
ovvne presence, so farre that he offered to dravv his svvord against
them in the Kings sight. And <hi>Buckinghams</hi> mother kneeling before
the King, vvith a brazen face cryed out iustice, iustice, sir I demand
iustice of your Maiestie. The King asking for vvhat? she answered,
for that vvich there liues is no sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t satisfaction, for saying, that my
sonne and I haue poysoned your Maiestie, poysoned me sayde the King.
vvith that he turning him selfe sounded, and she vvas remoued, The
sunday thereafter the King dyed, and <hi>Buckingham</hi> desired the Physitians
vvho attended the King, to signe vvith there handvvrits a testimonie
that the povvder vvhich he gaue the King vvas a goode and a safe
medicin, vvhich they refused to do. <hi>Buckinghames</hi> creatures did spred
abroad a rumor in <hi>London</hi> that <hi>Buckingham</hi> vvas so sory at the Kings
death, that he vvold haue dyed, that he vvold haue killed him self, if they
had not hindered him. Which your petitioner purposly inquired of
them that vvere neere him at that tyme, vvho sayd that neither in the
tyme of the kings sicknes nor after his death, he vvas more moued
then if there had neuer happened either sicknes or death to the King.
One day vvhen the King vvas in great extremitie he rode post to
