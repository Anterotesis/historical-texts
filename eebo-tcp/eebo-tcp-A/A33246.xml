         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat miſerable Circumſtances we lay under,
during the late <hi>arbitrary Reign;</hi> by <hi>Rapes</hi>
and <hi>Violences</hi> committed upon our <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Laws,</hi> by the impudent <hi>Violation</hi> of the moſt ſacred
<hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> by the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of <hi>Property,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is a thing ſo palpable and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
that 'tis allmoſt incredible any men but <hi>Papiſts</hi>
ſhould be in <hi>Love</hi> with it; and yet by ſad Experience we
find there is a <hi>degenerous Race of Proteſtants</hi> among us, that
ſeem to be fond of their former <hi>Slavery,</hi> and, like the
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are hankering after the Fleſh pots of
<hi>Aegypt;</hi> they are infatuated with the name of <hi>Divine
Right of Monarchy,</hi> and being carried headlong with that
<hi>fallacious Notion,</hi> fall into a <hi>Frenzy</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> againſt
the preſent <hi>Lawfull</hi> Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103602:3"/>
Almighty God has no where determined in his Word
a <hi>Model</hi> for our <hi>Civil Government,</hi> but has left us, as <hi>all
other Nations,</hi> to ſuch a <hi>Form</hi> as ſhall be agreed upon by
the People; and where this <hi>Agreement</hi> is not, 'tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Government</hi> but <hi>Tyranny;</hi> for without
it the Judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Eccl. Pol. l. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 86.</note> 
               <q>There
is no reaſon why one man ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to be Judge or Lord over another; becauſe for
the Manifeſtation of this their Right, and mens more
peaceable Contentment on both ſides, the Aſſent of
them who are to be governed ſeemeth neceſſary.</q> And
a little after he ſays, <q>All publick Regiment, of what
kind ſoever, ſeemeth evidently to have riſen from deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
Advice, Conſultation, and Compoſition between
men, judging it convenient and behoovefull.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what he ſays concerning the Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he applies to the Power of <hi>Making</hi> of Laws, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to govern, and ſhews, <q>That the lawfull Power
of making Laws to command whole politick Societies,
belongs ſo properly to the ſame entire Societies, that
for any Prince or Potentate, of what kind ſoever upon
Earth, to exerciſe the ſame of himſelf, and not either by
expreſs Commiſſion Immediately and Perſonally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God; or elſe by Authority derived at firſt
by their Conſent upon whoſe Perſons they impoſe Laws,
it is no better than mere Tyranny.</q> And he adds, <q>Laws
they are not therefore, which publick Approbation
hath not made ſo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103602:3"/>
The Judgment of this great Man I could back with
very many good Authorities; but there is no need, he
alone being <hi>Inſtar Omnium,</hi> Equal to All, whoſe Five
firſt Books of Eccleſiaſtical Polity have been received
as Oracles, even by thoſe very Perſons who now differ
from him.</p>
            <p>When this Authour makes for them, as he does abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in vindicating Church Ceremonies, then he is the
<hi>LEARNED</hi> &amp; <hi>JUDICIOUS</hi> Mr. <hi>HOOKER,</hi> but when
he goes againſt their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> though not againſt the <hi>Truth,</hi>
then he is decried, and branded with being Erroneous.
But tis not Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Fate alone to be thus dealt with;
for they treat all Authours as ill, that are againſt their
Exotick and new fangled Notions of Sovereignty and
Allegiance: For when the Authour is not for them,
they reſolve to be againſt the Authour, though it ſhould
be againſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jewiſh Theocraſie</hi> is no Precedent to the <hi>Engliſh
Monarchy;</hi> there God immediately governed; he gave
that Nation all their Laws, Moral, Judiciary, and
Ceremonial; but we can make no pretence to ſuch a
<hi>Divine Conduct;</hi> we muſt have recourſe to the <hi>wholſome
Laws and Cuſtoms of our Countrey,</hi> for our Direction in
<hi>Civil Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither our Saviour, nor his Apoſtles, intermeddled
with <hi>Civil Government,</hi> but left that as they found it.
Chriſt's Kingdom was not of <hi>this World,</hi> and therefore
he and his Apoſtles meddled no farther with the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the World,</hi> than to teach all their Duties in their

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103602:4"/>
reſpective Stations, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to <hi>rule,</hi> and the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
to <hi>obey</hi> in the Fear of God. I know not where they
command a <hi>Pasſive Obedience</hi> to <hi>Illegal Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
if the Law be for a Man, it cannot be <hi>Rebellion</hi>
in him to defend himſelf by it; but if the Law be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a man, then he has a proper Reaſon for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of <hi>Non-reſiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle bids us <hi>be ſubiect to the Higher Powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Rom.13. 11.
But he does not command us this without reſtraction,
<hi>for Rulers muſt not be Terrour to good Works,</hi> but <hi>to the evil,</hi>
being appointed <hi>for the puniſhment of evil Doers, and for
the Praiſe of them that doe well.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 14. This is the
End of their Government, and the reaſon of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>When they govern as according to the Laws of our
Countrey, and diſcourage Vice by Puniſhing it, and
encourage Vertue by Rewards; <hi>Reſiſtence</hi> is then <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>
with a Witneſs; but when <hi>Rulers</hi> fail in all this,
and of <hi>Nuyſing Fathers</hi> (which they ſhould be) degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
into <hi>bloody Murtherers</hi> of their Countrey, (which they
ought not to be,) <hi>Reſiſtence</hi> is not <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but a juſt
and lawfull Defence againſt unjuſt and unlawfull Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Standard</hi> then of our <hi>Civil Goverment</hi>
is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> It is ſuperiour to all <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
and <hi>Banks</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and looks with an <hi>equal
Aſpect</hi> upon the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> According to

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103602:4"/>
to this <hi>Law</hi> we are <hi>invaded,</hi> (as we were in the
late King's time in every thing that was near and dear to
us,) we may <hi>juſtly defend</hi> our ſelves againſt ſuch <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal
Doings</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and join with a <hi>Stranger</hi>
that will take upon him to <hi>protect us</hi> againſt the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of an <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> In ſuch a Caſe as <hi>this</hi>
we may take the beſt means we can for our <hi>Safety.</hi> Muſt
the Lives of <hi>Innocent Millions</hi> be endangered to gratifie
<hi>One Man's Arbitrary Luſt?</hi> Muſt <hi>Popery</hi> be ſet up contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>Religion</hi> that has not ſo much <hi>Charity</hi> in it as <hi>Mahometa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi>
and much leſs <hi>moral Juſtice and Honeſty?</hi> And muſt
we be content to wear the <hi>Chains</hi> and <hi>Fetters</hi> of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi>
and <hi>Civil Slavery,</hi> when we may enjoy a <hi>Goſpel
Service,</hi> which is <hi>perfect Freedom,</hi> and live under the <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt</hi>
and <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>Governments?</hi> Should we conſent to all
this, as it cannot be avoided if the late King's Intereſts
muſt be advanced, <hi>Bedlam</hi> or <hi>Bridewell</hi> were the fitteſt
place for us.</p>
            <p>There has nothing been done (ſaving ſome enormities
of the <hi>Mobile)</hi> in this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wonderfull Revolution,</hi> but
is juſtifiable before <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi>

Let us go according to the Apoſtle's Advice,
<hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath</hi> (by his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            </p>
            <p>But theſe are Maxims that were firſt invented by
Court <hi>Paraſites,</hi> and <hi>Flatterers,</hi> raiſed by the Prince's <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
and live by his <hi>Bread,</hi> and have ever ſince been
maintained by a <hi>Generation</hi> of the <hi>ſame Stamp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were our <hi>Government</hi> an <hi>abſolute Monarchy,</hi> an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would not lie; but being <hi>limitted,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103602:5"/>
to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> repreſented in <hi>Parliament,</hi> for all
the <hi>Outrages</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> committed by his means;
otherwiſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> would be <hi>uſeleſs, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
and <hi>Property empty Names.</hi> And whereas, ſay they,
the King <hi>can doe no Wrong,</hi> unleſs it be underſtood
with this limitation, <hi>He acting by, and according to Law,</hi>
He may, no doubt, be altogether as <hi>Arbitrary</hi> as
the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are <hi>pernicious Poſitions,</hi> and advance the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Monarchy too high, becauſe they infer an <hi>Inerribility</hi> in
the <hi>King,</hi> which is as dangerous to the <hi>State,</hi> as <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let then every true Patriot and <hi>Engliſhman</hi> fix here:
<hi>That the King is intruſted with the Executive power of the
Law for the good of the People, and the People are to obey and
aſſiſt him in the Execution of this high Truſt; but if he abuſes
this Power, as the </hi>Diſſerter <hi>did, to the monifeſt Oppreſſion
of his People, the People repreſented in Parliament may take
that Truſt from him, and give it to another, who will govern
them in </hi>Juſtice <hi>and</hi> Clemency, <hi>and defend them in their</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>and</hi> Civil Rights.</p>
            <p>And now (methinks) 'tis ſtrange that any who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſhould declare <hi>Love</hi> for the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and yet ſay, they cannot in Conſcience <hi>Renounce</hi> the
<hi>late King.</hi> The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Intreſt are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
as <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> and a <hi>Popiſh Head</hi> upon a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Body,</hi> is like committing a Flock of <hi>harmleſs Sheep</hi>
to the Cuſtody of a <hi>Ravenous Wolf:</hi> They ſhall be <hi>kept,</hi>
but it is only for <hi>Prey</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:103602:6"/>
We cannot have a <hi>Popiſh King</hi> without a <hi>Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
either <hi>tolerated,</hi> or <hi>authorized</hi> in this Nation. <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated</hi>
it may be for a time, as 'twas in the <hi>late violent
Reign,</hi> but that <hi>Toleration</hi> was purely to get ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to it, till it was able to weather all Oppoſition,
and then to have given it the <hi>Protection</hi> of a <hi>Law;</hi> ſo that
the <hi>Adherence</hi> to, and <hi>Eſpouſing</hi> of the late King's Cauſe,
can ſignifie no leſs in the natural tendency and conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, than an <hi>Affection</hi> for Popery, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conſequences thereof, the Loſs of <hi>Engliſh Liberty</hi>
and <hi>Property;</hi> ſeeing the one cannot be had without the
other.</p>
            <p>It is now farther made apparent; that His <hi>Intereſt</hi> and
the <hi>French</hi> King's are linked together, their <hi>Counſels</hi> and
<hi>Deſigns</hi> the ſame, Both conſpiring in one <hi>great Plot,</hi> to
<hi>extirpate</hi> the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in General.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Friends</hi> then his <hi>Favourers</hi> are to the <hi>Reformed
Religion,</hi> may be ſeen plain enough without the help of
Spectacles. Whereas we ought to <hi>Oppoſe</hi> him as a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Enemy,</hi> even with our <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes;</hi> and, as
a Branch of our juſt Allegiance to their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi>
diſcover all Treaſonable Attempts and Practices againſt
them, and vigorouſly ſupport their <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi>
againſt the <hi>blaſphemous Harangues,</hi> and <hi>ſeditious Libels,</hi>
that are too frequently vented among us.</p>
            <p>But (alas!) how ſoon have ſome men forgot both the
<hi>Day,</hi> and the <hi>glorious Inſtrument</hi> of our <hi>Deliverance?</hi> What
Murmuring and Diſcontent, what falſe Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
what unkind Returns and Prejudices, would,

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103602:6"/>
if it were poſſible, darken the Son of the moſt <hi>Heroick Prince,</hi>
and pervent the Ends of the moſt <hi>chriſtianly generous Enterprize</hi>
in the World? Were we not appointed as <hi>Sheep</hi> for the
<hi>Slaughter?</hi> But God ſent him to interpoſe between the Knife
and the Sacrifice. When the great Tree of our <hi>Government</hi>
was in a manner quite cut down by the <hi>Romiſh Axes,</hi> he came
and <hi>ſecured</hi> it from falling, and made it grow again even to
a Miracle. If ever a <hi>Deliverer</hi> was worthy of the chief Seat
in our Affections, it muſt be this <hi>Incomparable Prince.</hi> Trophies
and Statues, and <hi>Panegyrical Orations,</hi> are fit for thoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
Monarchs who have no <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Intrinſick</hi> Worth;
but the Unparallel'd <hi>Vertues</hi> of our <hi>Excellent <hi>Deliverer,</hi>
               </hi> as
they are far above ſuch poor, periſhing Pageantry, ſo his
<hi>Merits</hi> will be get him a more <hi>laſting Monument</hi> of Love, Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and Gratitude in the Hearts of his People.</p>
            <p>In a word, We are, under God, indebted to <hi>Him</hi> for all
that we <hi>have,</hi> for our <hi>Religion,</hi> our Laws, our Lives, our
Liberties and Eſtates. What an <hi>Infamy</hi> then will it bring
upon us and our Memories to be <hi>ungratefull?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would therefore adviſe all thoſe who go under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and yet appear <hi>ſticklers</hi> for the <hi>late
King's Intereſt,</hi> to make timely Retractation, and endeavour
to compenſate the <hi>Diſſervice</hi> they have done the Proteſtant
<hi>Cauſe,</hi> by a chearfull and hearty <hi>compliance</hi> with the preſent
Government, and by paying hence forward a <hi>conſciencious Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And particularly, let thoſe of the <hi>Clergie,</hi> whoſe <hi>paſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy</hi>
has been a conſtant Lecture of <hi>Rebellion</hi> to the, People,
change their <hi>Text,</hi> and let their future <hi>good Example</hi> be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

of <hi>Obedience.</hi> Let them doe their <hi>Duty</hi> as <hi>Divines,</hi> and
leaving <hi>civil Things</hi> to the <hi>civil Powers,</hi> approve themſelves
the <hi>Ambaſſadours of Chriſt,</hi> by preaching thoſe <hi>Healing Doctrines</hi>
of Humility, Peace, and Love, and by ſpeaking all the <hi>ſame

Ends of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Declaration, <hi>(Decl.</hi> p. 13.) printed
at the <hi>Hague, Octob.</hi> 8. 1688. <hi>the Eſtabliſhing of a good Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the</hi> Church of England <hi>and all Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
Let them (whether <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Sons</hi> of the Church) be
intreated to lay down all <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Diſſention</hi> about <hi>Indifferent
Things,</hi> and that Spirit of <hi>Perſecution</hi> which by <hi>Eſtranging</hi> our
Brethren, and <hi>hindering</hi> their <hi>Union,</hi> hath formerly too much
<hi>weakened our own,</hi> and ſtrengthened the <hi>Roman</hi> Party.</p>
            <p>Conſider our Saviour hath recommended to us the Spirit of
<hi>Love, Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> and the Apoſtle hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to have <hi>no Diviſioms, but to keep the Unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace, and in righteouſneſs of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a <hi>monſtrous Folly</hi> and <hi>Madneſs</hi> is it to differ about
<hi>Indifferent Things,</hi> and not at all <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation? To
quarrel about the Bark, about the Shell and Carkaſs of <hi>Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember we have ſtrove ſo long already about <hi>Rites</hi> and

            <p>If this paſſionate but modeſt Addreſs may prevail to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
thoſe for whom it is writ, then ſhall the Hopes and
Deſigns of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi> de defeated, our Fears ſhall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
our Religion and our Laws ſhall triumph, and the
Golden Age be reſtored to theſe Kingdoms.</p>
