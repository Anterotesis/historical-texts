            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>What the title in the front professeth, FOR GOD, AND THE KING, the substance thereof was by me preached in two Sermons on the last fifth of November, 1636. to teach my people obedience to both. And for this, I was by the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed to this Text (Prov. 24. 21. 22.) My Sonne, feare thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change. For their calamity shall arise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruine of them both? The Doctrines of which text, as I thought the more necessary to be preached and pressed in these times of Apostacy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the due obedience both of God and the King: So I dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that day (the memoriall whereof should cause all loyall subjects for ever to detest all Innovations tending to reduce us to that Religion of Rome, which plotted that matchlesse treason) the most seasonable for this text, as wherein our Solemne acknowledgement of our sacred thankes to God for our great deliverance (the fruits whereof we injoy at this day under your Royall and happy government) being a strong ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and inducement to every good duty both to God and the King, might worke the more kindly effect in the hearers; a word in season, being (as the Wiseman saith) like Apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>
            <p>Now although the generall good acceptation of the word then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, whereby the peoples hearts were much affected, being instructed
<pb facs="tcp:7339:3"/>
and exhorted to sticke closse to God and the King in all manner of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to each, that none of those, of whom my text admonisheth, might worke a disvnion, might have beene a sufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of publishing those Sermons in print, for the generall good of all your Majesties loving Subjects throughout this your Kingdome; yet Lo a necessity it now layd upon mee. For on December 3. after my house had beene searched by a Pursuivant, Constables, and Wardens of the Company of Stationers for a booke which I had not, then and there, the Pursuivant served me with Letters Missive from the High Commission to appeare on Twesday then next ensuing, before Doctor Ducke at Chesewicke, there to answer to Articles against me. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were all of them against my preaching, and in speciall, and by name, against my Sermons on November 5. on Prov. 34. 21. 22. Therein was objected to me, that I preached against sundry Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (which indeed was one speciall point in my text) as alterations in the booke for the fift of November; alterations in the new Fast-booke, contrary to your Majestes Proclamation, which Orders the old Fast booke set forth by your Majesties authority to be reprinted and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; alterations in the Booke of Common Prayer, set forth by Act of Parliament; a turning out of the Collect for the Queene and Royall Progeny, these words, Father of thine Elect, and of their seed, as if they would blot out your Majesty, Qeene, and Royall Progeny out of the number of Gods Elect: and in the Epistle on Sunday before Faster, for, IN the name of Iesus, is now put, AT the name of Iesus, &amp;c. alterations in setting up of Altars, Images, Crucifixes, in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Altar: in putting downe afternoone Sermons on the Lords dayes in sundry Diocesse: in allowing no other Catechising, but by bare Question and Answer out of the Booke, without expounding of the maine Principles of Religion to the ignorant youth and people in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a second Service at the Altar, in the upper end of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, where in many great Churches the people cannot possibly heare, &amp; not even in lesser Churches, or indifferent, without a stentorious voyce of the Minister: together with sundry other things of the like nature: some truely alledged, which I am readie to maintaine against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators, and some falsely and maliciously perverted, whereof I am readie to give your Majestie a true account. And in the end of all the Articles, I was charged to bring in a true copie of my Sermon. The conclusion was, a booke tendred to me to sweare to answer to those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7339:3"/>
Here at I startled, admiring that these things should be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as crimes, which both were truthes, and pertinent to my text, and necessarie to admonish my people of, as leading them from the feare of God, and of the King. I also (upon the suddaine) apprehended, that I could expect small iustice of those, that were not only the countenancers, but practisers, yea and (which is the highest degree of all iniquity) open maintainers of such innovations, and that in that very Court where they ought rather to bee severely Censured and Suppressed: but that on the contrarie I should be there censured as a Delinquent, for executing my Ministerie, in speaking the trueth, and reprooving of Sinne. And againe considering with my selfe that this cause was of a higher nature, then to be so much as hazzarded upon the iudgement of these, who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed parties; I presently reflected my thoughts upon your Sacred Majestie, as not only worthie to take the cognizance of so waightie a cause, and the best able both in respect of your Princelie wisdome, and unpartiall iudgement to waigh it in a just ballance: but also as the prime and principall person, next unto God, whose honour and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre it most neerelie concerneth; and who next after God, are ingaged in my text to inquire into. So as my replie to Dr. Duke was, Sir, I humblie appeale to the Kings Majestie my Soveraigne and Patron, as my judge in this cause, and before whom I shall be both a Defendant, and Complainant. For I hold it not fit, that they who are my adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, should be my Iudges. These were the verie words of my Appeale to Your Majestie as I remember.</p>
            <p>Now thou my Gracious Soveraigne, that which my profest adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in so just a cause did unjustlie and against the Law require of me, namelie to bring them a copie of my Sermon, that so they might at their pleasure take advantages by perverting of my words. I doe here most freelie and faithfullie in all humblenesse present to Your Majestie, yea and that with manie additions and inlargements (like to Ieremies rowle) that in the chiefe place Your Majestie may take a full account of the whole matter whereof nothing is concealed; and so also, as all Your loving and loyall Subjects may make good use of it. Herein (besides manie other things, the reading whereof will not (I hope) be losse of time to Your Majestie) I haue observed sundrie peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous innovations set on foot in this Your Kingdome, worthie Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties saddest consideration. And to whom (next unto God) should I addresse my complaint herein, but to Your Majestie whose honour I
<pb facs="tcp:7339:4"/>
cannot but be most tenderlie sensible of, so deeplie suffering in those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations herein mentioned? For how frequentlie and Solemlie hath your Majestie made most Sacred Protestations to all Your loving Subjects, that you would never suffer the least innovation to creep into Your Kingdome? And here, both for the comfort to us Your faithfull people, and for the conviction and condemnation of our Innovators, and for the refreshing of the memorie of Your Majesties Golden Sayings, never to be forgotten, as most honourable to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie let me set downe a few of them. Your Majestie in Your Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to all Your loving Subjects, of the causes that mooved You to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the last Parliament, published by Your Majesties Speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, 1628. pag. 21. hath these words: We <note n="*" place="margin">Golden sentence.</note> call God to record, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom wee stand, that it is, and alwaies hath been our hearts desire to be found worthie of that title, which we account the most glorious in al our Crowne, DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, neither shall wee ever give way to the authorising of anie thing, whereby ante innovation may steale or creep into the Church, but preserve that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Doctrine and Discipline established in the time of Queene Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, whereby the Church of England hath stood and florished ever since. And in your Declaration prefixed to the Articles of Religion, speaking of Ordinances and Constitutions in Convocation by Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties leave, and under Your Seale, is added this <hi>Proviso,</hi> Providing that none be made contrarie to the Lawes and Customes of the Land. More might be added. All which well considered, how audacious, yea how impious are our Innovatours, how fearelesse of Your Majestie, how regardlesse of Your Royall Honor, that in their Innovations made such havocke, commit such outrages, and that upon the open theater? New Rites and Ceremonies doe now, not <hi>steale and creep into the Church,</hi> but <hi>nudo capite</hi> are violently and furiously obtruded upon Ministers and people, and that with suspension, excommunication, ejection out of house and home, threatnings and thundrings to the refusers, who dare not yeeld conformity unto them, as being against both Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and these your solemne declarations So as it seemeth these Innovators will put it to the triall, whether their practises will more prevayle against your Majesties Solemne and Sacred Protestations to the contrarie, which stand upon Record, <hi>in aeternam rei memoriam.</hi> that so they may as much as in them lyeth, blast the beautie and glorie of Your Royall Name delivered in Annales to posteritie, as if it should
<pb facs="tcp:7339:4"/>
be said, This King had no regard to sacred Vowes, and solemne Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations (which God forbid it should ever enter into the thought of any of Your loving Subjects to suspect) or whether your Majestie will looke moore narrowly into their desperate practises, &amp; (not suffering your self to be abused through credulitie of their blandishing flatteries, and bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full suggestions, and Your people most intollerably oppressed under their lawlesse power) will bee pleased upon others true reports (true reports, I say; for who dare report falsely of them, whom so few dare speake the truth against them, they be so potent and vindicative) to make a full Scrutiny, and inquiry into their exorbitant and extravagant courses, and thereupon to acquit Your honour in executing of Iustice upon the Delinquents. I doe not charge any one particular person. That honor is reserved to Your Majestie. For as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>it is the honor of Kings to search out a matter.</hi> And for me Your Majesties old and faithfull Servant, while as Christ Minister, &amp; a watchman of Israel, yea a Sentinell perdu, I discover both present, and thereupon (in my apprehension) consequent dangers to my Soveraigne and his State, and while, as the poore sheep, I appeale and complaine to my Shepherd: oh never let my Shepherd either leave me in, or deliver me into the power of the wolfe! And while all along I plead for God and the King, for Feare and Obedience, and against Innovators, the enemies of both; oh let my God and my King protect their poore Servant against his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries; the Innovators in my text! Who if they quarrell these my charges, I beseech Your Majestie lay Your charge upon them to make a full and cleare answer unto them.</p>
            <p>What shall, or can I say more? Your Majesties wisedome can pierce deeper into this cause, then my shallownesse is able to give inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, wherein you will easily discerne how deeply You are ingaged to close with God and Your good Subjects against all those Innovators, the disturbers of the peace, and distractors of the unitie of Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, so as thereby You shall become the most glorious Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, formidable to Your enemies, and amiable to all Your good Subjects, whose hearts and affections being indecred hereby, will become a richer Mine to Your Majestie, then all the Westerne Indies to the King of Spaine.</p>
            <p>And if my stile seeme sharper then usuall, be pleased to impute it to my Zeale and Fidelitie for God and for Your Majestie, when I am to encounter with those that he adversaries to both. And if any word
<pb facs="tcp:7339:5"/>
have dropped from my pen, which malice may pervert and wrest to my prejudice, I beseech Your Majestie to be my Iudge Your selfe, and to consider, as on the one side a weake man, so on the other a Minister of Christ, whose message hee durst not but faithfully discharge to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost power, and at his uttermost perill. Nor must I looke to fare better then the Prophets of old, who complained of those, who made a man an offender for a word, and laid a snare for him that reprooued in the gate; Yea then Christ himselfe, whom the Pharisees thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle in his words: Yet my comfort is, that a Prince so gracious, so righteous, so religious shall be my Iudge. And if my simplicitie shall be by my captious Adversaries found worthy of censure for a word misplaced, or so: I shall the more willinglie undergoe their censure, so as they may haue their condigne punishment according to the Law, for their most perrillous Innovations. In fine, my last comfort is, and will be, that in case they shall for the present beare me downe, together with so Noble a cause as this is (which yet I know will in time, beate all us Adversaries downe, sith it is Christs owne Cause) I haue been a true witnesse of Christ, and a faithfull subject of Your Majestie, in thus freeing mine owne soule by discharging of my duety: What ever become of my body, which is every day threatned by Pursuivants to bee haled to Prison, if Your Majesties Iustice, and good Lawes doe not all the better safeguard mee. But prison or not prison, I heartily thanke my Lord Iesus Christ, who hath accounted mee faithfull, and called me forth to stand for his cause, and to witnesse it before all the World, by publishing my said Sermons in Print, that thereby also I might cleere both the cause, and my credit, which they haue publikely, before hearing, branded with sedition. All which I humbly commit to Your Majesties Royall Patronage, as Who next under God, are most interessed in the Cause. Now the Lord Iesus Christ, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, so unite and combine your heart unto Himselfe, that You being guided by His Spirit of Wisedome and Vnderstanding, of Councell and strength, and of the feare of the Lord, You may doe Valiantly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper, in stopping the course of all Innovators and Backe-sliders into Popery, that so with and under Christs Kingdome, Yours may be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in Righteousnesse to You and your Royall Posteritie, untill time shall be no more, Which is the daily Prayer of,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His time is a time of sorrow and humiliation: but this day a day of joy and festivity, to bee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in this our anniversary thankfull remembrance of a great and memorable deliverance, as on this day, 31. yeeres agoe. So as this day fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in so sad a season, is like a starie peeping and shining forth through the cloudes of a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7339:6"/>
duskie night, and by and by ready to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verclouded againe. Such is our joy, such is our <note place="margin">Invicem ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt dolor &amp; voluptas, brevior vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptas. Senec.</note> sorrow, this long, that short, this, a summer and a winter plague, that a widowes joy, a blaze, and away. Yet sith God is pleased in the midst of judgement to remember Mercy, there is no reason that this calamitous time should so farre dampe us, as to deprive both us of our comfort, and God of his glory this day. Therefore wee may say with <hi>David, Why art thou cast downe, o my soule? I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 42. 11</note> 
               <hi>and my God.</hi> Or as Psal. 101. <hi>I will sing of Mercy and Iudgement.</hi> And surely that joy is soundest, which is seasoned with some sorrow. <note place="margin">Psal. 2. 11.</note> As saith the Psalmist, <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and rejoyce with trembling.</hi> It's good to be <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> as saith the Proverbe. Sadnesse is as salt that seasoneth our mirth, and preserues it from corruption. Well, blessed be God, who in the midst of many sad dayes, hath sent us this joyfull day to sing praise unto him for that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which hath made it a day of joy unto all good Christians, and all good Subjects in this land.</p>
            <p>Sutable therefore to the occasion of this day, and season, I have made choice of this Text: It comprehends one of those wise Sentences, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells or Proverbs, which King <hi>Solomon,</hi> a Preacher also, inspired with the spirit of Wisedome from God, hath left recorded for instruction of the Church of God in all ages. If wee seeke to find the coherence, or dependance of these words, wee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7339:6"/>
may quickly loose our selues, and our labour. For this Booke, of the Proverbs is fitly compared to a bagg full of sweete and fragrant spices, which shuff led and shaken together, or taken single, doe yeeld forth a most pleasant and comfortable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. Or to the Starres in the firmament, each in itselfe glorious, and independent of another, yet all receive their light from the Sunne. Like as Eccles. 12. 11. <hi>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nayles fastened by the Masters of assemblies, which are given from one Shepheard. This one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> is Christ, <hi>the Sunne of Righteousnesse,</hi> who inlightens all the Prophets. Or heere are <hi>studds of silver in borders of gold:</hi> Cant. 1. 11. <hi>Or apples of gold in pictures of silver.</hi> Prov. 25. 11. <hi>And these things belong to the wise.</hi> v. 23.</p>
            <p>The words recited containe three things in generall. 1. an Exhortation. 2. an Admonition. 3. a reason of the admonition. The Exhortation in these words, <hi>My son, feare thou the Lord and the King.</hi> The admonition in these words, <hi>And med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with them that are giuen to change:</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the admonition in these words, <hi>For their calamity shall arise suddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Exhortation, these particulars are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable. 1. The Person Exhorting, and that is King <hi>Solomon</hi> instructing the people as from Gods owne mouth. 2. The persons exhorted, to wit, all Gods people, represented heere in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, under the name of one sonne: and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7339:7"/>
this by a neere bond of relation, by a strong cord of affection, distinguishing him from others, and appropriating him as Gods owne peculiar, <hi>My Sonne.</hi> The duty exhorted unto, is <hi>feare:</hi> the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this feare is twofold. 1. <hi>The Lord. 2. The King.</hi> In all which we are to observe three things, 1. The order of this feare, first <hi>the Lord,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly <hi>the King.</hi> 2. the connexion of these two, as things inseparable in this duty of Feare, <hi>Feare the LORD, and the KING.</hi> 3. The speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this duty, as peculiar to the child of God, above all other, <hi>Mysonne, feare THOV the Lord and the King,</hi> as if <hi>Solomon</hi> should have said, <hi>My sonne,</hi> how ever the sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the men of the world cast off all feare, both of God and man, yet <hi>feare THOV the Lord and the King.</hi> This is the resolution of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Admonition, wee are to note three things. 1. The admonition it selfe, <hi>meddle not.</hi> 2. Who they be of whom Gods children are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, namely such as are said here to <hi>be giuen to change.</hi> 3. The antithesis or opposition, betweene these changlings, and them that truely feare <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the reason of the admonition annexed, which is taken from the dangerous condition, that these, who <hi>are given to change,</hi> are obnoxious unto: wee observe, 1. The matter of their danger, in these words, <hi>Calamity and ruine:</hi> then the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their calamity and ruine, set downe, 1. In it's suddennesse, and 2. in its certainty. It shall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7339:7"/>
rise suddenly: and lastly the unexpected meanes of their ruine, contrary to all outward appearance, And who knoweth the ruine of them both: That is, though there be no outward appearance of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine to these men, but that all things prosper with them, and seeme to be on their side, yet their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine shall be from both these, as wee shall further open by and by.</p>
            <p>Now having distributed the words into their severall parts, and that without curiosity, taking them as they lie naturally in the text: come wee briefely to give you the sence of the words. First, <hi>My sonne,</hi> a compellation frequent and familiar in this book of the Proverbs, as ye may see through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. It is a voice beseeming a father to his child, or an ancient to a young man, or a Pastor and Preacher to his hearer, or God Himselfe to his people; by his Minister; as in this place. So Prov. 23. 26. <hi>My sonne giue mee thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. which cannot be understood, but as spoken by <hi>Solomon</hi> both from and for God, as who may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge our heart, and none but hee. So heere.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for <hi>feare</hi> here: what kind of <hi>feare</hi> is here meant? There are in Scripture sundry kinds of feare: as 1. a naturall feare, which was in Christ himselfe, as man, and is in every man: 2. a filiall feare, as in genuine children to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: 3. a Servill feare, as in all wicked men, and in the divels themselves, who tremble at God: 4. a civill feare, as of Subjects to their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7339:8"/>
Prince. 5. a religious feare, as in true Christians towards God. Now this <hi>feare</hi> in this place is to be distinguished, though not in name, yet in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kinde, according to the difference of the severall objects of it. So as when it is ascribed to God, as the object of it, it is a religious feare: but as it is applyed to man, as its object, as here, it is a civill feare. The feare of the Lord then, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> that is, God the Father, and Christ, as the ordinary Glosse, is a religious feare: the feare of the King is a civill feare. And though these two feares differ in their kind, yet in resemblance and similitude they are not unlike. As, the feare of the Lord is a filiall feare: so is the feare of the King: the feare of God comprehends in it all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of his children: the feare of the King all duties required in Subjects towards their Prince: there is a feare of universall obedience due to God: and there is a feare of universall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence next under and after God, due to the King: there is a feare of adherence to God: and a feare of adherence to the King. So much in briefe for the opening of this word feare: <hi>Feare thou the Lord and the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the admonition: <hi>Meddle not.</hi> It is not meant here, that wee may not meddle at all, by way of reproofe, detection, conuiction, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or impeaching their wicked courses and practises: but not to meddle, that is, haue no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, side not, countenance not, approoue not, applawd not such men in their euill wayes. As
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7339:8"/>
               <hi>(Gen. 49. 5.) Iacob</hi> said of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of cruelty, O my soule, come not thou into their secret; vnto their assembly mine honour be thou not vnited.</hi> Or as Psal. 1. 1. not to <hi>walke, stand, sit</hi> with them in their <hi>Counsels, wayes, chaire.</hi> Or as Pro. 1. 10. 15. <hi>My sonne, if sinners intice thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thou not, walke not thou, in the way with them, &amp;c.</hi> But who are these men we are admonished of? Such as are giuen to change. The best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters expound it of innouations either of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or of the Republick: So <hi>Mercer,</hi> and <hi>Lauater Pagnin</hi> renders <hi>gnim shonim—cum iterantibus ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatis. Vulg. cum detractoribus. Tremellius &amp; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, cum</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Id est, cum variantibus ac perfrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentibus Dei, suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum mandata denique deficienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vita sua immorigera à reverentia Dei &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</note> 
               <hi>varijs,</hi> Such as change and breake the Commandement of God, and of their Princes, and fall away from the feare of God, and the King in their rebellious life. But we need goe no further then our owne translation, which is very full, meaning it of all such as are factious, sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, giuen to change the Lawes of God, and the King.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for the reason annexed, one terme seemes somewhat difficult, as being subject to different interpretations: <hi>the ruine of them both:</hi> wat's meant by <hi>them both?</hi> Some (as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Glosse, and Lyra) referre it to detractors, and those that intertaine and hearken vnto them: to Arch-hereticks, and those that are seduced by them: to such as derogate from Christ, and others that ioyne with them. Others againe, as <hi>Mercerus</hi> and <hi>Lauater,</hi> vnderstand ruine of them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7339:9"/>
both in an actiue sense, referring the ruine of those that are giuen to change, to <hi>God and the King,</hi> who shall bring ruine vpon them: as if it were expressed thus, <hi>who knoweth the ruine, that God and the King,</hi> whose lawes they violated and innouated, shall cause suddenly to arise and fall vpon them. So as though these bee different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, yet they may well bee reconciled together, and may serve for the mutuall ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and illustration of each other. For inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uators are alwayes notorious detractors and syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, derogating from those things, which they goe about to innouate or abrogate, that so they may establish their owne nouelties, whither in Church, or State, or both. And euer such ringleaders have their disciples and followers, ready to be instruments of their wicked designes. These ringleaders with their adherents and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices shall both fall and perish together: and both God and the King, that is, the iustice of Gods Law, and mans Law shall conspire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to root them out.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to shew the manner of their vnexpected ruine or calamity, it is sayd, It shall <hi>rise:</hi> that is, although they seeme to bee so high, as to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all feare of dangers, as trampling all vnder their feet: yet calamity shall rise aboue them, and bring them to ruine. As the Lord saith, <hi>Ier.</hi> 37. 10. Also, Their calamity, noteth that God hath layd up judgements in store, proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the wicked. This for the sense of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7339:9"/>
words; wherein if I have beene a little the longer, yet it is not fruitlesse, both because we may take a view of the sense of the whole text together and also lay the better grounds for those sundry instructions, which will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally issue from the same.</p>
            <p>Come wee then to points of instruction arising from this text.</p>
            <p>The first is this, from this compellation, <hi>My sonne:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Point. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> That every one ought so to addresse himselfe to the hearing of the Word of God, as a Son of God. Here we see God speakes unto us, as unto sons, <hi>My son, feare &amp;c. My son, heare the instruction of a Father:</hi> as chap. 4. 1. &amp; 2. 1. &amp;c. So Heb. 12. 6. <hi>And yee have forgotten the Exhortation, which speaketh unto you, as unto children, My sonne, despise not thou the chastning of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> This is that exhortation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
            <p>But how can poore men, as we are, be said to be the <note place="margin">Question.</note> Sonnes of God?</p>
            <p>In briefe: not by nature, for so Christ onely is the Son <note place="margin">Answer.</note> of God: but by adoption and grace we are made the Sons of God through faith, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
            <p>Now this addressement, as of sons, to heare Gods Word, is very effectuall and profitable in sundry res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects: As 1. It is a strong motive, and sweet prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a reverend attention. <hi>I will hearken</hi> (saith Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) <note place="margin">Psal. 85. 8. 1. Thess. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>what the Lord God will speake: for hee will speake peace unto his people, and to his Saints.</hi> And the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians are commended, and <hi>Taul</hi> thanketh God, <hi>that they received the Word, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of God.</hi> When a sonne heares the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his Father, that is wise, loving, kind, true, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7339:10"/>
powerfull to make good what he saith, it drawes on, and commaunds attention. Such a Father is God, infinit inall his Attributes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to heare as a son, makes for fervent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in loving, imbracing, and highly esteeming the Word of God. The reason that many men doe not receive the Word of truth in the love of it, is because they are none of his sons. They are as <note n="*" place="margin">1. King. 22</note> 
               <hi>Ahab,</hi> they heare the truth at the Prophets mouth, but they hate him and the truth. As Christ said to the Iewes, when they boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that God was their Father, and they were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> children: <hi>If God were your Father, you would love</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 39. 41. v. 42. 39.</note> 
               <hi>me: And if Abraham were your father, you would doe his workes, for hee rejoyced to see my day.</hi> It is therefore a son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like affection, that intertaines Gods Word with love, whither hee checke, or whither hee cherish, whither hee threaten, or comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To heare as a sonne, is an inducement to frequent meditation of the Word heard. As <hi>Prov. 7. 1. 2. 3. My sonne, keepe my words, and lay up my Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with thee. Keepe my Commaundements and live; and my Law, as the apple of thine eye. Bind them upon thy</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nec quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam senem audivi obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urum abruisset. Omnia quae curant, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunerunt. Cre. de Senectute.</note> 
               <hi>singer, write them upon the table of thine heart.</hi> For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of such a Father, are so many Iewels. As Prov. 1. 1. 9. <hi>an ornament of grace to thy head, and chaines about thy necke: yea a crowne of glory.</hi> Prov. 4. 9. Now a man will alwayes bee minding his treasure, where his Iewels bee. Where the <hi>treasure is, the heart will bee,</hi> saith Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To heare Gods Word as his sonne, makes for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent observation and obedience. This is the true try, all of Sons, if they observe their Fathers commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7339:10"/>
               <hi>If I be a Father,</hi> saith God, <hi>where is mine honor.</hi> Our <note place="margin">Mal. 1. 6.</note> Fathers honor is our following of his counsells, and obeying his Commaundements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. For tryall of our Son-ship, by these former signes and markes: by our reverend attention in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as to gods owne Word, by our fervent love in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Word; by our frequent meditation of it; and by our diligent observation. As <hi>Zach.</hi> 6. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For instruction: this is the maine duty of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to bee most carefull of his behaviour and frame of spirit, about the hearing of Gods Word. And therefore Christ often admonisheth his disciples, <hi>Take heed how ye heare,</hi> and <hi>Take heed what ye heare.</hi> For according to our hearing is our soule indueth with faith, and seasoned with grace, and illuminated with sound and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, and the whole course of our life regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and framed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And lastly, for reproofe and conviction those, as no Sons of God, but enemies, and rebels, that hate and despise Gods Word in the powerfull Ministry of it, and doe with might and maine labour to oppose and oppresse it. Such plainly shew themselves whence they come, namely as those mysts and foggs from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit, which darken the cleare light of the Sun and Starres: so doe these overclowd the beames of the Gospel, that they cannot shine forth to the Church of God. Or they are those froggs, uncleane spirits out of the mouth of the Dragon, and Beast, and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, whose croking cryeth downe the voyce of Gods Ministers, and which doe corrupt the pure streames of the waters of life by their filthinesse. In a word, these
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7339:11"/>
are the limbs of the Beast, even of Antichrist, taking his very courses to beare and beat downe the hearing of the Word of God, whereby men might bee saved; like to the Iewes, of whom the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stle sayth, <hi>who both killed the Lord Iesus and their owne Prophets, and have persecuted us, and they please not God, and are contrary to all men, Forbidding us to speake to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fill up their sinnes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> way; for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</hi> And surely the wrath hangs over the heads of these men, which must needs sease upon them ere long, if they speedily repent not, whereof there is little hope. But leave wee them and come we to the matter of the exhortation.</p>

As Eccles. 12. 13. <hi>Let us heare the end of all, Feare God and keepe his Commaundements: for this is the whole man:</hi> that is, the whole duty which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of his children.

                  </gap>ements of men.</hi> And Acts 10. 35. <hi>In every nation hee that feareth God, and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted of him.</hi> Thus by these places
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7339:11"/>
wee see, how the true feare of the Lord, is taken for the whole worship and service of God, both internall, and externall, and so for every grace of Gods Spirit in us, as faith, hope, love, and the like.</p>
            <p>Reasons of this point. 1. Because the true feare of God is a fundamentall grace, and respecteth all the Commaundements of God, as the object of it. As Psal. 112. 1. <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, he delighteth greatly in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because where God is not truly worshipped, there is no feare of God. As in Esay 29. 13. <hi>This people draw neere me with their mouth, and with their lips doe honour me, but they have remooved their heart farre from me.</hi> And the reasonis added: <hi>Their feare towards me is taught by the precept of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Because where other vertues be not, the reason is, because true feare is not. Which argues, that true feare of God is inseparably combined with other graces. As Rom. 3. 10. 18. the Apostle reckoning up a bead-row of iniquities, concludes with this reason, <hi>There is no feare of God before their eyes.</hi> So Mal. 3. 5. <hi>I will come neere to you to judgement, and will bee a swift witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sorcerers, and against the adulte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppresse the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherlesse, and that turne aside the stranger from his right.</hi> Well, what's the ground of all this wickednesse, It is there added, <hi>And feare not me, saith the Lord of Hoasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Because holy feare is the seasoning and salt of every vertue, and of the whole worship of God. As Psal. 5. 7. <hi>In thy f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are will I worship towards thy holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> So Psal. 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord in feare.</hi> Which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7339:12"/>
I say, is such a feare, as hath in it faith, love, affiance and other graces.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, wee are bound to performe all obedience to God in a holy feare, by vertue of the Word of God as the rule, and of the Covenant God hath made with us in his Word, and we with him. Gods Law is so the rule of our feare, and obedience to God, as it is death to feare or obey him otherwise, then hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded us in his Law. Els it is rebellion, not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will worship, not service to God. And this wee are bound to, by mutuall Couenant. 1. God binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be our God and King by Covenant in his word: as Exod. 20. Secondly, wee bind our selves by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Covenant, as in our Baptisme to bee his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to serve him as hee hath commaunded in his Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> of this point is first for reproofe and conviction of the whole Romane Synagogue, as being altogether devoyd of the true feare of God; and consequently, is no true Church of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>one of the Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, none of his spowse. Why? For all her feare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God is taught by the precept of men; her service of God is a Masse of Idolatry and Superstition, Will-worship of mans invention; and therefore though they draw neere to God with their lipps, yet their hearts are farre from him. And so in vaine they worship him, nay they worship the Devill, and not God, as the Apostle sheweth, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. For all Idolatry, as that of the breaden god in the Masse, is the worship of the Devill. They will say, they worship God in the Host: So did the Pagans plead for themselues, that they worshipped God in their Idols. Yet, saith the Apostle, I say, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7339:12"/>
the things, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> sacrifice, they sacrifice to Devills, and not to God. And God disclaimes all worship of Him, that is not according to His Word, and He abhorres such presumptuous worshippers, as those that doe not feare him. So as secondly heere are justly reprooved those men, as wanting the true feare of God, who in these dayes shew themselves Antichrists Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, both in teaching, practising, and pressing new Formes of worship, <hi>Secundum usum Sarum,</hi> and setting them up againe in Churches, as Altar-worship, Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship, Image-worship, Crosse-worship, and the like. A plaine evidence, that these men (what ever they most hypocritically pretend, and would bee accounted as a new kind of Saints dropped downe out of the cloudes, as most holy and devoute persons) have no true feare of God in them. Yea their hearts are far from God. Their feare is more towards an Altar of their owne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, towards an Image and Crucifix, towards the sound and sillables of Iesus, then towards the Lord Christ. For did they truely feare Christ, they would not (as they doe) so desperately and furiously persecute him in his faithfull Ministers and members, and make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocke, and turne upside-down the very glory of Christ's Kingdome in the Ministery of His Word, and power of Religion, and purity of his worship, which they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether trample under, and defile with their Wolvish feete. Therefore, forasmuch as they set up and teach a false feare, and worship of God in the Churches, I (saith the Lord) <hi>will proceede to doe a marvellous worke among the people, even a marvellous worke, and a wonder: for the wisedome of their wise men shall perish, and the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their prudent men shall be hid.</hi> And v. 16. <hi>Surely
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7339:13"/>
your turning of things upside-downe, shall bee esteemed at the Potters clay.</hi> But of these more in their proper place.</p>

Not to swerve one haires bredth from it. Againe, that true feare of God stnads in an universall obedience to all and every of his Commandements, not onely those of the first Table, but those of the second; nor onely those of the second, but those of the first.</p>
            <p>So as Thirdly, this may condemne two sorts of grosse Hypocrites. 1. Those that seeme exact and punctuall in observing the Commandements of the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: they are no Adulterers, no Drunkards, no inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate livers; they are not notorious offenders; and what then? Hereupon they applaud themselves, and would be esteemed of the World good Christians, and with the Pharisee thanke God, that in these things they are not as <hi>other men, Extortioners, Vnjust, &amp;c.</hi> They live peacably with their Neighbors, they pay every man his owne, and the like. But what's all this without the feare of God? Where is their Piety, and Love to God, expressed in the duties of the first Table? Are they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and grosly ignorant of the knowledge of God? Doe they hate, contemne, neglect his words? Doe they despise his faithfull Ministers? Doe they speake evill of the Way and Profession of Godlinesse? Doe they profane the Lords Sabbaths? Yea, doe they comply with Idolaters in their Altar-worship, and Iesu-worship, and the like? and yet would they bee accounted good
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7339:13"/>
honest men? Can they be honest and good men, that are enemies of God, and of the Profession, yea and name of holinesse, and of the power of Religion, and of the true Saints and servants of Iesus Christ? Can they be good Christians, which <hi>are enemies to the Crosse of Christ, whose</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>end is damnation, whose God is their belly, and which minde earthly things?</hi> On the other side, there is another sort of Hypocrites, who place all their Religion in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performances and duties of the first Table, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse a great deale of Religion, would seeme very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, but yet are like the Pharisees, who under a colour of long prayers, devoure Widowes houses. Of these Hypocrites, there are two sorts. 1. Of them, that are all for outward formality, but their hypocrisie bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe two wayes: First, in that though they seeme very devoute, in frequenting the Church, yet it is in a false way, mingling mens devices of will-worship with Gods Ordinance; &amp; in dividing the Lords day betweene God and the Devill, allowing to <hi>God</hi> onely two houres of the day for his publike worship, and the rest of the day to the lusts of men. Secondly, in that they place all the service of <hi>God</hi> in reading of long Prayers, and thereby exclude Preaching as unnecessary. And yet they make no bones of oppressing <hi>Gods</hi> people, and the Kings good Subjects with burthens intollerable to bee borne. The second sort is of them, that will seeme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and to give <hi>God</hi> his due, but make no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of giving to all men their due: they will make no scruple of Lying, of over-reaching in bargaining, of living in some secret raigning lust, of oppressing, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frawding, and the like. These are so much the more to be abhorred, because by their meanes, Religion, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7339:14"/>
the name of God is evill spoken of. And such have beene, and will bee in all ages. Yet woe be to them, that hereupon take occasion to cast an aspersion of reproach upon religion, and all the sincere Professors thereof, because of a few hypocriticall and false hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, so called, who have <hi>a forme of godlinesse, but deny the power thereof.</hi> There was among the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles one <hi>Iudas,</hi> a traytor, a thiefe, a notorious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: were therefore all the rest so? God forbid. And yet is not this one of those subtile practises, which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and their complices, the Popes Factors here in England doe familiarly use, taking all occasions, by laying forth the examples of some faylings or perhaps some grosse sinne in one that is a Professor, to brand the whole profession of Religion? In so much as they take the paines, and spend their time and witts, in setting forth pamphlets, yea some larger volumes, as of that poore distracted man <hi>Ap-Evans,</hi> who (as they write) should kill his Mother and Brother, and all (forsooth) because they kneeled in receiving the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is most evident to every sober and rationall man, that this poore wretch was out of his witts, else he had never done such an outragious act. And yet what a hubbub is made hereof, how must the Presse sweat with printing this tale of a mad man? how must the Court, and City, and Countrey, ring of it? And to what end? Namely, to beware of these Puritans, &amp; to hate all Puritans for <hi>Evans</hi> his sake. Alas poore Puritans, must they all fare the worse, for one mad man? Yet this is the charity of those, that are profest enemies to true sanctity and sincerity. And it matters not whither it be true or false: it must be believed for truth; though this of <hi>Evans</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7339:14"/>
was in another written copy (offered to be licensed, but rejected) shewed to be quite contrary to the first relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus the accuser of the brethren wants not his agents, to make advantage of the falls, or faylings of some Professors, not only to the branding of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but even of Religion it selfe, and the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it. As when some, possessed and overcome with that malevolent humour of blacke melancholy, through Satans prevailing over the weaker part, doe make themselves away: oh how is this exagitated, and occasion taken thereby to exclame against Religion, or some Puritan Preachers, that by the doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination drive men to dispaire? and therefore some strict order must bee taken for the suppressing of this Doctrine, as dangerous and desperate; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the 17. article of our Religion commends, Saying, <hi>The godly consideration of Predestination, and our</hi>

               <hi>working of the spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirme their faith of eternall salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be inioyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God.</hi> So the article, which I note by the way. But the conclusion is, the men of the world will have <hi>Gods</hi> children, or Professors of Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the pure and perfect Angels, without the least spot of sinfull infirmity: or if they be at any time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with humane frailty, then they must be taken for blacke divels, and their religion to come from hell. But all good Christians, and wise men of upright judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7339:15"/>
will beware of this rocke, not to bee Scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and fall fowle upon the Religion of Christ, either for the hypocrisie of some false Professors, or for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of those that bee sincere, and upright in their way, but are attended with faylings, and humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Concerning which the Apostle gives this good les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, yee which are spirituall, restore such a one in the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <note place="margin">Galath. 6. 1.</note> Considering thine owne selfe, least thou also be tempted. And againe, we that are strong, ought to beare the infirmities of the weak, and not to please our selves. So much of this point, That it is the duty of every true <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 1.</note> Christian thus to feare the Lord, as hath beene sayd.</p>
            <p>Againe, as there is in Scripture a feare of obedience, which feare comprehends the whole service of God, and is the <hi>whole</hi> of a Christian man. So there is also a feare of adherence, whereby the soule cleaveth insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to God. This feare is layd downe in Ier. 32. 40. v. <hi>I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good: but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> This is the feare of adherency. And this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sheweth, how this feare is not without faith, hope, and charity, as without which it cannot adhere unto God. Now from this feare of adherency, we learne:</p>
            <p>That the true feare of God in his children, preserves them from falling from God, and his worship. This is <note place="margin">Point. 3.</note> confirmed by the forenamed place in <hi>Ieremy.</hi> And this is notably set forth, Psal. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. <hi>Blessed is the man, that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord, &amp;c. Surely he shall not be mooved for euer,</hi> v. 6. <hi>hee shall not be afraid of evill tidings, for his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord,</hi> v. 7. This is a speciall property
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7339:15"/>
and character of the true child of God. So 1. Iohn 2, 19. speaking of Apostates, <hi>They went out from us, for they were not of us, for had they beene of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi> Where wee note these particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. All they that are <hi>of us,</hi> to wit, true believers, <hi>doe no doubt continue</hi> in the Communion of Saints.</p>

So 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God: hee that abideth in the Doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Sonne. And it is worth the nothing, by the way, what is added in the very next words, <note n="*" place="margin">V. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If there come any unto you, and bring you not this Doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for hee that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evill deeds.</hi> So that this is the doctrine of Christ, namely the doctrine of adherency and perseverance of the Saints in grace, as here in the grace of feare.</p>
            <p>This doctrine might further be illustrated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many reasons: as 1. from the covenant of <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> God, <hi>I will make an everlasting Covenant with you, that I will not turne away from you to doe you good: Ier.</hi> 32. 40. This is that <hi>foundation</hi> of God that <hi>stands sure, and hath this Seale, The Lord knoweth who are his. 2. Tim.</hi> 2. 19. And because this covenant is founded on God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his free and gracious love depending on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alone, and not on weake, and impotent man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what should be able to undoe or revoke this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7339:16"/>
Covenant? Not man, nor divell. For <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor powers, &amp;c. shall be able</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>9.</note> 
               <hi>to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from the nature of true feare, which is a gift of grace from God. 1. a grace of a saving nature, and 2. of free gift of grace. Therefore it is here added to Gods Covenant, that as Gods Covenant is, <hi>that Hee will never turne away from us to doe us good:</hi> So hee puts his <hi>feare</hi> into our hearts, that wee <hi>shall never depart from Him.</hi> Thus God is tyed to us, and wee to him by sure bonds. And where God gives this feare, he never takes it away. <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> And God gives it to that end, that wee shall <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> 
               <hi>never depart from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly from regeneration: Hee that hath this feare hath the new birth, hee is borne of God; and being <hi>borne of God, sinneth not,</hi> that is, <hi>not to death,</hi> and the reason is there rendered, <hi>because the seed of God remaineth in him,</hi> and hee cannot sinne, because hee is borne of God. The reason is most forcible. And <note n="*" place="margin">Examen.</note> 
               <hi>Arminius</hi> is so puzled with it, as hee cannot tell what to say to it, confessing it is the strongest place that is brought for perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Yet that hee may not say nothing, though to no purpose, hee saith, <hi>The seed of God remaineth so long as it doth remaine.</hi> A poore and pitifull shift. So hee may clude all Scripture. So hee may say, Gods Covenant not to turne away from his people to doe them good, is everlasting so long as it is everlasting. Were not this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous? So Christ saith, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 39.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Fathers will, that of all, which he hath given me, I should loose nothing.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:7339:16"/>
Now were it not absurd to say, <hi>It is the fathers will, so long as it is his will?</hi> Even so it is heere, the constant and perpetuall remaining of the Seede of God in us, whereby we are begotten and borne of God, is rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holy Ghost, as a grond and reason, why such cannot sinne unto death, or fall away from grace, either totally or finally; and <hi>Arminius</hi> would make it non-sence, saying, <hi>So long as the Seed of God remaineth in him that is borne of God.</hi> For hee saith, This Seed may bee lost. If it may be lost, then God hath lost His credit: Who saith, <hi>Hee that is borne of God cannot commit sinne, for the Seed of God remaineth in him.</hi> But if the Seed of God remaine not, then hee that is borne of God, may commit sinne, and so perish for ever, which is contrary to Gods Trueth. And let God be true, and every man a lyar. Yea, this is backed also with another reason: <hi>Neither can he sinne, because hee is borne of God.</hi> Hee that is once borne of God, cannot sinne, that is unto death: For God cannot die, of whom hee is borne againe. All the <hi>Arminians</hi> in the world, with their father <hi>Arminius,</hi> are here either at a nonplus, or of necessitie they must speake non-sence.</p>
            <p>Hereunto might be added many other reasons of the Saints perseverance in the grace of feare; as because it is the godly mans treasure, Esa. 33. 6. <hi>The feare of the Lord is his treasure.</hi> Now there is nothing, which a man keepes more carefully and safely, then his treasure. And to be sure, Gods child layes up his <hi>treasure in heaven,</hi> unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible to the <hi>rust,</hi> or <hi>moth,</hi> or <hi>thiefe:</hi> because this feare is combined inseparably with other graces, as faith, hope, charity, which never faile: for faith is <hi>the foundation of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. and Hope, <hi>as an
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7339:17"/>
anchor of the soule, both sure and stedfast, entereth within the vaile,</hi> Heb. 6. 9. <hi>and hope also maketh not ashamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is giuen unto us.</hi> So as the holy Ghost also is that <hi>power of God, whereby through faith we are kept unto Salvation.</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 5. And whereby wee <hi>are sealed,</hi> even with the holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</p>
            <p>But this suffice for the proofe and Illustration of the point.</p>
            <p>Vse 1. For terror of all the enemies of grace, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papists, Pelagians, or Arminians, who hold and teach the Apostacy of the Saints, that they may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from grace totally and finally: Surely these men are none of Gods Children, they have none of this fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all feare of adherencie, they never had this feare put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, that they shall not depart away from God. And forasmuch as many in these dayes are fallen away from this doctrine of Christ, so cleerely laid downe in the Scriptures, so as they oppugne it with might and maine, and with an inveterate hatred: certaine it is, that they are <hi>gon out from us, because they were not of us; for had they beene of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi> And by the way, wee must not meddle with, shew no countenance to, make no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, have no familiarity with such Apostates, such chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Doctrine of Christ. For if there come any unto you, and bring you not this Doctrine, <hi>receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for hee that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Ioh. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evill deeds.</hi>

Secondly, Let this bee for admonition to us all in these dayes of Apostacy; by a godly and filiall feare to sticke close unto God, and his Doctrine, and worship in purity; that nothing may be able to separate us from Christ. You see, or heare at the least of old heaving and shooving to erect Altar-worship, and Iesu-worship, and other inventions of men, and all (as it is too plaine) to set up Popery againe: and for not yeelding to these things, Ministers are Excommunicated, suspended, yea threatned with <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Corbet Chancellor to the Bp. of Norwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Point 4.

            <p>But yet this Parrhesia, this liberty, and freedome of speech in such cases, is not without the feare of God, but is a branch and fruit, that springeth of it. And this feare showeth it selfe in sundry manners, according ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the present occasion, or the naturall disposition of a child of God, being seasoned and sanctified and guided by Gods Spirit. Sometimes it showes it selfe in meeknesse and mildnesse, sometimes in a greater measure of zeale, and roughnesse, and yet all from the selfesame spirit of godly feare. Of this latter kind are those former examples. Of the former, that of <note n="*" place="margin">It was in old time, when some Bishops, were content to bee poore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vita <hi>S.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredi.

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:7339:19"/>
But what care these miscreants for Christ, who thus persecute him in his members and Ministers? Yet this is a comfort to all such Ministers, as stand for Christ; that as they appeale, and commit their cause to him whose cause it is, so hee will certainly vindicate both his righteous cause, &amp; his faithfull servants in due time. When <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned, he saw Christ standing at the <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> right hand of God, as ready to revenge his cause, which not long after he did, upon all the obstinate and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Iewes in Ierusalem.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Now for use of this point: it first gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Christians, in these dayes of lukewarmenesse and apostacy, to make proofe of their graces, and especially of the feare of the Lord in them, whither it be such, as devoures and swalloweth downe all worldly feares.</p>
            <p>Secondly, sith this feare is so excellent and rare, wee should be the more earnest in getting it, as he in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell was to buy the goodly pearle. He gave all he had for it. And surely it was richly worth it. For as Christ saith, <hi>What shall it profit a man, if he shall win the whole world, and loose his owne soule? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soule?</hi> A man may by his discretion, or Christian Prudence (as they call it) so carry the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to secure himselfe from feare of the world; for he can give way, and conforme himselfe quietly to all humaine impositions, and can commaund his conscience to beare with them, notwithstanding it doe secretly whisper in his eare, that this ought not to be done, as being an intollerable dishonor to Christ, a disgrace to his Ministry, a forfeiture of his Christian liberty, a Scandall to Religion, and a base betraying of the cause of Christ, and of the salvation of his owne soule. But
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7339:19"/>
yet he wants not reasons for it. Thereby he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Ministry, and his credit too, in not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted refractory, hee shall thus purchase his peace, and retaine his meanes for him and his, without which he and they must begge, and the like. Alas poore soule! what's thy Ministry worth, when thou hast abased it, and inthralled it to be impious inventions and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men? or when thou injoyest it, with the losse of its vigor, power, dignity, authority? or when thou retainest it together with thy outward liberty, lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, peace, credit, with the misjudging world, and loosest thy Christ, thy peace of conscience, thy <note n="†" place="margin">Bono pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bari malo, quam multis malis. Auso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> credit with all good and wise men, yea heaven and all; what will all thy discretion and Christian pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence advantage thee? O let us rather learne to bee fooles for Christs cause, let us feare the Lord, and not men, not the world. It's Christs counsell to all his, that are his friends, saying, <hi>I say unto you my friends, Bee not affraid of them that kill the body, and after that can doe no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lu. 12. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>more: but I will forewarne you whom yee shall feare, feare him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell; yea, I say unto you; him feare.</hi> Where Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us to this feare of God, by a threefold motive 1. that hee calls us friends. And surely such as truely feare God, are the friends of Christ, from whom no feare of men can divide them; as we sayd before. 2. hee forewarnes us, that we may not bee unarmed with this feare of God, least otherwise wee bee on a suddaine surprised, and overthrown, before wee be aware, when the great red Dragon with all his terror presents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">Revel. 12. 4</note> before the woman, ready to bring forth a mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line birth, which with the mother, he threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7339:20"/>
And so much the more, when the Dragon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> powerfull, as with his tayle to draw the third part of the Starres of heaven, and to cast them to the earth: that is, when the greatest part of those, who in their heavenly Orbes and Motions are as Starry lights, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their doctrine and life, are either by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons threats, or the traines and wiles of his dog-like flattering tayle, cast from their heavenly station, to the earth, when the love or feare of earthly things swayes more with them to draw them downewards, then of heavenly, to fixe them on Christ. Thirdly, Christ in the forenamed place redoubles his premonition, <hi>Yea I say unto you feare HIM:</hi> by which hee would intimate unto us of what force the feare of man is to draw us away from our station with God, if wee bee not well rooted in the feare of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly here is an use of caution to those, that are apt to be censorious of those, to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a greater and more extraordinary measure of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian zeale and courage for Christ. For such a vertue, as it is more eminent, so it drawes upon it a great deale of envy, especially from those, which as they idolize their counterfeit discretion and Christian prudence (as they tearme it) and all because they love to sleep in a whole, skin, and are loth to hazard a haire of their head for Christ: so on the other side they clevate and slight the noble zeale and courage of those whom they see so farre to out strip them in this heroick grace, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible love to Christ: yea they are ready to tearme it rashnesse and indiscretion; especially if the successe proove an imprisonment, or other vexation from those, who with their might bearedowne the right; and then
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7339:20"/>

            <p>Fourthly and lastly, is the true feare of God such a rare and excellent vertue, and so invincible, overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming all other feares? Then this makes for exceeding conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Church of God, especially in declining times of Apostacy, and when the truth is openly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and oppressed, and Idolatry and Superstition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded insteed thereof: when notwithstanding wee see, many Ministers of Iesus Christ (though but few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, in respect of the whole multitude) to stand stoutly to their tacklings, and rather then they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray any part of Gods truth, and of a good conscience, they will part with their Ministry, liberty, livelyhood, and life too, if need were. This is that which keepes Christs cause in life. This gives Gods people cause of rejoycing, that they see their Captaines to keepe their ground, and not to fly the field, or forsake their colours, or basely yeeld themselves to the enemy. Here is hope, that the cause will prevaile at length. But if all should yeeld or fly, then the field were lost without recovery. Yet how many doe like <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who seeing his party beginne to bee put to the worst, takes his heeles, and being asked why hee fled so fast: Oh, saith he, that I may preserve my selfe to fight another time? Then sure hee would doe great feats. But in the meane time the enemy is master of the field, and now there is no more place of fighting. So, prudent Souldiers, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7339:21"/>
captaines among us, seeing <hi>Christs</hi> side (in mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to be distressed by the enemies prevailing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thinke it good discretion rather to yeeld to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent extremity; and so to reserve themselves for better times; when in the meane time the cause is by them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and themselves soled captive, that their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Christ</hi> will never trust to such captaines againe, as to commit the leading of his people under the false co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their empty pretences. Yea and the people too are willing and perswade their Ministers to yeeld in those smaller matters, as they conceive, rather then to forgoe their Ministry; not waighing either the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of such beginnings, or the worthlesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such Ministers, as shall doe such certaine evill, that a supposed (and but supposed onely) good may come thereof. <hi>Whose damnation is just,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh. For <hi>Rome was not build in one day.</hi> And <hi>Rome</hi> being about <note place="margin">Rom.</note> to bee rebuilt in this land, cannot bee done all at once, but it must bee by degrees; although the builders doe every day get ground, and their building goes on a maine, with an incredible celerity. But I trust they make more hast, then good speed. And me thinkes I see the issue of their building in that of the Tower of <hi>Babell:</hi> of which the Lord said, <hi>Behold the people is one,</hi>

               <hi>and they have all one language, and this they begin to doe, and now nothing will bee restrained from them, which they have imagined to doe.</hi> Even so our new Babel-builders upon a strong combination and faction against <hi>Christ</hi> and his Kingdome, have begun to build a Tower reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven in their high imagination, as if they would (as the Giants of old) pull <hi>Christ</hi> out of his Throne: and all outward likelyhoods conspire unto

Satan and Antichrist, from the which the Lord had so mightily and mercifully delivered us?</p>
            <p>Thus much of the feare of the Lord. Come we now to the next point, which is the feare of the King. In which we are to observe. 1. The kind of this feare: 2. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, next to the feare of the Lord: 3. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of it with the feare of the Lord: being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, that the one cannot stand without the other.</p>
            <p>First then for the kind of this feare, I told you in the opening of the text, that it is a Civill feare, differing from the feare of the Lord, which is a religious feare, and so a part of his worship, and consequently incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any creature. Yet so (as I told you) there
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7339:23"/>
is a similitude betweene this Civill feare to the King, and that religious feare of the Lord. As, 1. as the true feare of the Lord comprehends in it all duties and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices due from us to God: so the feare of the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes all duties due from Subject, to their King. 2. as the feare of the Lord is a filiall feare: so the feare of the King. 3. As the feare of the Lord is a feare of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency: so the feare of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of these in order: and of the points of instruction thence arising.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every true Subject, and every true servant of God, <note place="margin">Point. 1.</note> ought to feare his King, that is, performe all duties and offices whatsoever due from a subject to his Prince. For the opening hereof, wee must know, that the feare of the King containes all duties of a Christian Subject to his King. For that which is sayd here, <hi>Feare the Lord, and feare the King,</hi> is expressed by <hi>Peter</hi> thus: <hi>Feare God, Honour the King.</hi> As in the fifth Commandement, <note place="margin">Pet. 2. 17</note> 
               <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Here, as by Father and Mother all Superiors, that stand in a bond of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to inferiours, as Parents, Masters, Magistrates, Ministers, and above all the chiefe Magistrate, the Prince, is meant: so under this word honor, all kindes of duty and service due from all inferiours to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours respectively, are comprized. This is expressed also by  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 3.</note> Peter, <hi>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whither it be to the King, as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or unto Governours, as unto them that are sent by him, for the punishment of evill do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, and for the prayse of them that doe well. </hi> This is yet more fully and amply set
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7339:23"/>
downe by the Apostle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. Where this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not only prooved, but pressed and confirmed by many strong reasons. First, the doctrine is propounded, in the duty injoyned, vers. 1. <hi>Let every soule bee subject to the higher powers.</hi> The Precept is universall to every creature; not <note n="*" place="margin">Popes of old were subject to Emperours, when they withdrew their necks, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters necks, and they held the stirrops, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee became Antichrist mounted on Horseback, fullfilling that of the Apostle. 2. Thess. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 4.</note> Pope nor Cardinall, nor Prelate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. All living under the Kings Dominion, must bee subject to the King.</p>
            <p>And the reasons are there rendred. 1. <hi>Because those higher Powers are of God.</hi> So as hee that resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God. Secondly, the penalty upon rebells: <hi>They that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi> Rebells shall not escape eyther the just hand of man, or of God, whose ordinance is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted, in resisting of the power. Thirdly, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent office that the Powers doe beare, which is to execute justice and judgement betweene Subjects. <hi>For Rulers are not a terrour to good works, but to the evill.</hi> And as he rewards <hi>the evill</hi> with <hi>punishment:</hi> so the <hi>good</hi> with <hi>prayse.</hi> For, <hi>wilt thou not be affrayd of the power? Doe that which is good, and thou shalt have prayse of the same. For hee is the Minister of God to thee for good: but if thou doe that which is evill, bee affrayd: for hee beareth not the sword in vaine: for hee is the Minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evill.</hi> Fourthly, there is a necessity of this subjection, vers. 3. <hi>Wherefore ye must bee subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</hi> So as, if feare of wrath be not a bond strong enough: yet conscience is, which will dispense with no man. For Gods ordinance bindes the Conscience. Fifthly, from the end of paying tribute. vers. 6. <hi>For, for this cause pay yee tribute also.</hi> For what cause? That is, for they are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7339:24"/>
Gods Ministers attending continually upon this very thing. That is, for the execution of justice, in punishing the evill, in praysing and countenancing the good. And hereupon the Apostle reinforceth his exhortation, as an use of the point; <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custome to whom custome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, to the former reasons expressed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, wee may adde one more, answerable and corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to that fore-alledged, of our obedience unto God: (for as I said, in all things the feare of the King holds a resemblance with the feare of the Lord, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most exact and perfect patterne of it, even as God is the best patterne for a King, and the rule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God doth governe, the best patterne of a Kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) and the reason is this: Wee are to bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our King, in the performance of all due services by that bond or tye, which not onely Gods Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but also the Kings Law doth put upon us. You may remember I showed you before, how Gods Law is the rule of our feare and service, which wee performe unto his Majesty, and to goe beside, or transgresse this rule, brings us under the guilt and penalty of rebellion. I showed you also, how wee are bound to serve God as our King, by vertue of mutuall stipulation which God makes with us, and we with him. Semblably, our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto the King, is to be regulated, as by Gods Law, the rule of universall obedience to God and man: so by the good Lawes of the King. And note the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletenesse of this correspondence. It stayes not here, but holds also in that mutuall stipulation or Covenant which the King and his Subjects make at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7339:24"/>
Where the King taking an explicit solemne oath to maintaine the ancient Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdome, and so to rule and governe all his people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those Lawes established: So consequently, and implicitly, all the people of the Land doe sweare fealty, allegiance, subjection and obedience to their King, and that according to his just Lawes. To this purpose it is, that his excellent Majesty in the Petition of Right, which he subscribed with his owne royall hand, hath these words, worthy to be written in gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den characters. The King willeth, that right be done, according to the Lawes and Customes of the Realme: and that the Statutes be put in due execution, and His Subjects may have no cause to complaine of any wrong, or oppressions, contrary to their just Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: To the preservation whereof hee holds himselfe in Conscience as well obliged, as of his Prerogative. And after that, in full Parliament he concluded with these words, Soit droit fait come est desire: <hi>Let right be done</hi>

                  </gap> Speech at Whithall to the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Parliament there assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. 1609. Which Speech is printed with his Royall Workes, in aeternam rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoriam.</note> 
               <hi>as is desired.</hi> And then in his Majesties speech follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And I assure you my Maxime is, that the Peoples Libertie strengthens the Kings Prerogative, that the Kings Prerogative, is to defend the Peoples Liberties. O blessed King, ever may'st Thou live crowned with all blessings in Thy Royall selfe and Posterity, being knit unto Thy people in this indissoluble bond! And herein His Sacred Majestie shewed himselfe a Peereles Sonne to His Peerelesse Father, who in his speech to the Parliament, 1609. besides sundry other rare passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the same purpose, hath these words: The King bindes himselfe, by a double oath to the observation of the fundamentall Lawes of the Kingdome: Tacitly, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7339:25"/>
being a King, and so bound as well to protect the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the Lawes of his Kingdome: and expresly, by his Oath at His Coronation: So as every Just King in a setled Kingdome is bound to observe that paction made to his people by his Lawes, in framing his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with <hi>Noah</hi> after the deluge, &amp;c. And therefore a King governing in a setled Kingdome, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, as soone as hee leaves off to rule according to his lawes. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after: Therefore all Kings that are not Tyrants, or perjured, will be glad to bound themselves within the limits of their Lawes: and they that perswade them the contrary, are Vipers and Pests, both against them, and the Common Wealth. Which words beseeming a just King, I have heere set downe as an honourable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of such a Father, of such a Sonne: and all to be for the stronger reason to all subjects to performe all due obedience to their Soveraigne. For if your Gracious King doe so solemnly by Sacred oath, ratified againe in Parliament under His Royall hand, bind himselfe to maintaine the Lawes of his Kingdome, and therein the Rights and Liberties of His Subjects: then how much are the people bound to yeeld all subjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King according to his just Laws? So much of the proofe of the point.</p>
            <p>Now to the Uses. Here, 1. Not onely Papists, but the religion of Popery it selfe, come under the guilt and condemnation of Rebellion; forasmuch as the maine Principle of Popery, is to exalt and acknowledge the Pope as supreme over all Powers, as Emperors, Kings, Princes, States, &amp;c. And therefore not unworthily is

               <hi>Religion</hi> branded for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and their <hi>faith</hi> for <hi>Faction,</hi> and their practise murdering of soules and bodies. And though some Papists will take the Oath of Allegiance, as subjects to their King, yet they refuse the Oath of Supremacy, as acknowledging their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the King upon no other termes, but as subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the Pope, as Supreme. And so the Pope, and not the King, is the Papists King and Soveraigne. And yet how is their rebellious religion, nay which is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion it selfe, fostered and fomented in our Land; to the infinite dishonour, not onely of God, but of the King, and His Supremacy, and danger of the Kingdom, if God in mercy doe not prevent it.

            <p n="2">2. For Exhortation. Heere let all good Christians, and royall subjects learne to yeeld all feare, honour, obedience to their Soveraigne, following the direction and exhortation of the Apostle; Let every soule be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher powers. And render to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custome to whom Custome, Feare to whom feare, Honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And for the better stirring up of all those duties, which subjects owe to their Soveraigne, Let us often meditate of these reasons, and motives fore-mentioned by the Apostle; and especially considering, That the King is Gods Minister, to doe Iustice, to punish the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and to countenance and reward the good: as also because hee attends continually upon this great office. And lastly considering in speciall, how our Gracious
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7339:26"/>
Soveraigne hath entered into Solemne and sacred Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with all his people, to bee their King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and to governe them according to his good and just lawes, and to maintaine all their just Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and according to the Patterne of God himselfe, whose vicegerent hee is, to demaund of them no other obedience, but what the good lawes of the Kingdome prescribe, and require. With what alacrity then and readinesse, ought all Subjects to expresse their loyalty to their Prince, and with all adde their dayly and fervent prayers and supplications for the life of our gracious King, that under the shadow of his righteous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 2.</note> government, wee may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlinesse and honesty.</p>
            <p>It followeth: Feare the King, that is, with a filiall feare, as the feare of the Lord is, only keeping the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the one is a religious filiall feare, the other a Civill filiall feare. The point in briefe is: True Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects beare to their King such a feare, as children to <note place="margin">Point.</note> their parents. Not a feare with terror; as the Apostle sayth to Parents, <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 6. 4. Col. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Provoke not your children to wrath.</hi> The name of a Father, is a name of love, and hath in it the bowels of a naturall affection, which is above all other kinds of humaine affections.

Hee is the great Lord Steward, whom God hath set over his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide for them, and to protect them. He is the Shepherd of the people, to feed them, &amp; rule them as <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 78. 71. 72. Now the sheep are affrayd of the wolfe, not of the Shepherd. Therefore saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7339:26"/>
               <hi>If thou doest evill, be affrayd.</hi> So as a good Subject so feareth, as hee is not affrayd, because he lives in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God and his King.</p>
            <p>Againe this filiall feare in a Subject towards his Prince, doth necessarily imply an excellent and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent love towards the King: yea greater love, then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Children beare unto their Parents, namely as they are members of the great politicke body, united to the King as the Head. There being a neerer tye of affection betweene the Head and the members; then betweene a Father and his child. And therefore it is worthily sayd by that faithfull servant of God M. Perkins, <hi>A good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This may condemne those that would perswade Kings to rule in a terrible and formidable manner, as over a sort of slaves. Contrary to the Apostle, <hi>Rulers are not a terror to the good:</hi> Rom. 13. 3. Such are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous persons, that would turne filiall feare in Subjects to servile.

               <hi>Againe, hereunto wee may fitly joyne the next Point; which is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the true feare of a King, as it is a filiall feare, so <note place="margin">Poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

it is a feare of adherency, a feare full of loyalty and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which makes a true Subject to sticke so close to his Prince at all times, and in all conditions, as nothing can make a separation.</p>
            <p>The King and his Subjects are united with strong ligaments, as the head and body. And this feare of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency, is a speciall gift of God: as we reade, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. <hi>There went with Saul a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</hi> But such as cleave not unto the King are branded for <hi>children of Belial,</hi> who <hi>despis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So wee read also of <hi>David,</hi> when hee was in great distresse and straits, by reason of his unnaturall and traiterous Sonne <hi>Absalom,</hi> and those many tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> that had revolted to him from their King, yet some cleave unto him; as 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>The Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants said unto the King: Behold thy servants are ready to doe whatsoever my Lord the King shall appoint.</hi> And vers. 21. <hi>Ittai said to the King,</hi> (when hee went about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to goe back, and to take care for his safety, as verse 19. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this they labour to doe two wayes: either by incensing the King with a hard opinion of his best Subjects, those especially that are most religious and pious, humble and peaceable in his Kingdome: or else on the other side by incensing the people with a sinister opinion of their Soveraigne, thus playing lack of both sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ambidexters, and know to make advantage every way.</p>

Nor are they content, to abuse our pious Princes eares in the Pulpit, but also on the Stage. O pyous, holy, reverend, grave, gracious Prelates, whose Academicall Entertainment of pious and religious Kings and Princes (in stead of learned and Scholasticall disputations, or exercises intable to the condition of a learned Academy) is a scurrilous Enterlude, and this in disgrace of that, which is the greatest beauty of our religion, to wit, true piety and vertue!

And was that a time of Enterludes? Why did you not feare some Plague to grow in such a mighty assembly? When notwithstanding Preaching is made dangerous by you, for feare of the plague; which should be a meanes (as it hath beene formerly) to drive away the plague, by bringing the people to true humiliation and reformation. Whereas your guelded Fast-book (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Proclamation) I am sure brought us for a hansell, a double increase of the Plague that weeke, to any weeke since the Plague began: and most terrible weather withall, to the Kings great losse, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheants, the angry countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of heaven ever since pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods wrath upon this your hypocritical Mockfast.

Secondly, as Iesuites and their Faction, the Popes Factors doe, labour to divide the King from his good Subjects, by poysoning his gentle eares with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine breath, in their malicious detractions: So on the other side, they so carry the matter with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as to cause disunion of affection betwene them and their Soveraigne.

Though (I blesse God) I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intertaine such a thought of my King, that he should utter such a word, as to deny his old Servant the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell-benefit of his gratious hand, wherewith but a little before he had signed the Petition of Right, for the maintenance, not onely of myne, but of every good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects just and honest cause.</p>
            <p>Take yet another instance, and that also at the high
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7339:32"/>
Commission Court, where I was attending as a poore Client, or rather an Innocent at the barre, waiting for my Censure. There a Rule for a Prohibition for Master <hi>Prinne</hi> being cendered in Court according to the course of the Kings Lawes in that behalfe, presently my Lord of London, then President of the Court, stands vp and flyes in the face of <hi>Master Prinne</hi> and his Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition with great heat of passion, even almost unto fury, and after many threatnings to him, hee uttered these words, that <note n="*" place="margin">A most audacious &amp; presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous speech of a Prelate, setting his prowde foote upon the Kings Lawes, as the Pope did once on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours neck an Emblem of perpetuall servitude. p.</note> 
               <hi>whosoever should dare to bring the next Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, hee would set him fast by the heeles.</hi> This was spoken alowd in open Court. Now, as I conceive, this did not a little reflect and trench upon the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the Lawes of the Land, and the Liberty of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. What? for any man to dare with open mouth, and that in open Court, to out-dare the Kings just go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of his Subjects according to his good Lawes? Or upon what ground did hee thus boldly beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Vpon the King? His Majesty had not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Petition of Right. Also his Majesties Declaration to all his loving Subjects of the causes which mooved him to dissolve the last Parliament, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by his Majesties speciall commaund, 1628. Speaking in his name, that for the Parliaments full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and security; Hee did by an answer, framed in the forme by themselves desired, to their Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Petition, confirme their ancient and just Liberties and Rights, which (saith his Majesty) Wee resolve with all constancy and justice to maintaine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon then did this man dare to utter such an insolent speech? Not from the King, I am sure. Wee have his Royall Word, and Hand to the contrary. And yet some
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7339:32"/>
perhaps might surmise, that hee durst not speake thus in open Court, had hee not some better ground for it, than his owne desperate boldnesse. Or the best Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy hee can make, is, that his tongue did runne before his wit, and that in the flames of his passion he sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his best reason, and loyalty.</p>
            <p>To these Instances, wee will adde two or three more, very remarkable, and whereof wee all at this very time are eye-witnesses; for they are still in acting. The first is, That most outragious practise of the Prelates in making havocke of the Church, and of Religion, by suspending, excommunicating, outing of Ministers from their freehold, and the like, because they cannot, dare not read the booke for sports on the Lords day. Now the Prelates and their officers, herein most inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, and with a high hand proceeding, neither accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law, nor Canon, upon what authority doe they goe? Surely they lay all the load upon the King. Why upon the King? Doth the King commaund that Ministers shall read it in their Congregations? No such thing. The Booke Orders that it bee published in Churches: but expresseth not that it bee read by the Ministers. Indeed it saith, <hi>Wee further wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this our Commaund bee made by order from the Bishops, &amp;c.</hi> Now the publication of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund differs from the reading of the Booke. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement may be published, and yet not the Booke read. Well: but it pleaseth their Lordships so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their order. Ministers must read it. But they dare not doe it, as being against their Consciences. If not, what then? They must bee suspended, and are. By what Law, or Canon? That matters not, their will is so. But
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7339:33"/>
if they alledge the Kings authority, as they doe, where show they the King hath given them this authority to proceed so illegally and incanonically? The Booke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders no such severe and wicked Censures to be inflicted upon any in that behalfe. No, nor yet gives the Bishops any expresse order, or power at all to punish any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in this case. And will no lesse Censure then serve the turne, then suspension, excommunication, depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like? but they are rebells against the King. If so, then there is a Law to punish them. But how are they rebells? They resist not, they doe no violence to authority. All disobedience is not rebellion. For then <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the three children had beene rebells, <note place="margin">Dan. 3, 6.</note> for not obeying the Kings Commandement. But the Ministers (I say) that refuse to read the Booke, doe not therein directly disobey the King. For first, the Booke expresseth no such Commaundement, that Ministers shall read the Booke; as before. Secondly, no wife and honest man, can ever imagine, that the King should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intend to commaund that, which mainly tends to the publicke dishonour of God, and his Word, to the violation and annihilation of the holy commandement touching the Sabbath, to the alteration of the Doctrine of the Church of England, which in the <note n="*" place="margin">Homily of the Place and time of Prayer. Part. 1.</note> Homily clearly &amp; fully grounds the sanctification of the Lords day (which it calls our Christian Sabbath-day upon the fourth commaundement; and conseqnently to the destruction of the peoples soules. For this were against all those solemne royall Protestations of the King, as where he sayth: <note n="*" place="margin">See before the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7339:33"/>
unity of Doctrine, &amp;c. But the reading of this Booke by the Ministers is to bring in (and that not creepingly and by stealth, but by the head and shoulders, as it were by a flood gate set open) a mighty innovation of the unity or Doctrine concerning the Sabbath, which hath beene ever since the Reformation, and so from the Raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, universally and unanimously maintayned in the Church of England, untill this late faction of Anti-Sabbatarians started up, to cry downe all Sanctification, all power and purity of Religion. And indeed the innovation of the Doctrine of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath bring in with it an universall innovation of all Religion, as experience is an eye-witnesse. Therefore for certaine, the King never gave authority to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of this Booke in case it should any way tend to any innovation, or violation of the unity of Doctrine professed and maintained in our Church. Againe, the profanation of the Sabbath, or Lords-day, which the Booke seemes to give allowance unto, as in sundry sports there specified, is directly against the very first Act of Parliament in the first of King <hi>Charles</hi> (an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious beginning, promising a religious and gracious Raigne) where it is expressely sayd, <hi>For as much as there is nothing more acceptable to God, then the true and sincere service and worship of Him, according to his holy will, and that the holy keeping of the Lords day is a principal part of the true service of God, and therefore all unlawfull exercises and pastimes are prohibited upon that day.</hi> Now what are unlawfull exercises and pastimes prohibited on that day? Namely, not only those there specified, but <hi>all other unlawfull pastimes,</hi> as there it is sayd. What are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7339:34"/>
those? By name, all <hi>dancing, leaping, rebelling,</hi> and such like, in termes condemned, by Imperiall Edicts, Decrees of Councells, writings of ancient Fathers, of all learned Divines both Protestants and Papists, in all <note place="margin">Basilicon Doron. Booke 2 in his Works: pag. 164. Printed, 1616.</note> ages. And King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory in his <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon Doron</hi> to his Sonne, hath these words: <hi>Certaine dayes in the yeare would be appointed for delighting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with publicke Spectacles of all honest games and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of armes: as also for conveening of neighbours, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining friendship and heartlinesse, by honest feasting and merrinesse: as in making playes, and lawfull games in May, &amp;c. So that alwayes the Sabbaths be kept holy, &amp; no unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pastimes be used.</hi> By which words it is evident, that all Sports on the Sabbaths, or Lords dayes, are condemned as unlawfull, which yet are by King Iames allowed on other dayes: Now will any say, that our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, the Peerelesse Sonne of so Peerelesse a Father, doth herein disobey his Royall Fathers instruction, as to allow May-games, and the like, as lawfull on the Sabbath, which Hee expressely and by name forbids to bee used on that day?</p>
            <p>Object. But the Booke for Sports was first published in Print in K. Iames his name, and therein May-games, and other Sports are alowed on the Sabbath dayes.</p>
            <p>Answ. Its too true. But if wee consider the maner of putting forth of that booke at first, we shall finde how light it is, to hold waight, or to preponderate that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious Booke, honorably, Stiled <hi>Basilicon Doron.</hi> First it was procured, compiled, and published in time of his Majesties Progresse into Scotland, when he was more then ordinarily merily disposed. They that were the compilers of it (for we must not thinke
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7339:34"/>
the Kings leasure served him to doe it) for their offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse <hi>(Populo ut placerent)</hi> God rewarded them, the one not long after injoying his life, the other surviving &amp; out-living both his favour &amp; place in Court. Againe it was never read, nor yet pressed upon any Minister to be read, during King <hi>Iames</hi> his raigne, which lasted six yeares after the publishing of the said Booke in Print. Thirdly, it was not ratified under the Kings broad Seale, as publick royall Acts use to be, to make them authenticall. Fourthly, this booke was not inserted in his royall works sent to Oxford, as not sutable to be ranked among so many learned and pious workes. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was never in his raigne used as a snare, and engine, to outt good Ministers out of their Ministry and living, as it is now used by the Prelates.</p>
            <p>Quest. But how came it to be revived, &amp; republished, K. <hi>Iames</hi> being dead, and this book also, having no place in his royall Workes to preserve the memory of it?</p>
            <p>Answer. By whose meanes it was raked out of the Ashes, I know not, but this I am sure of, that the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of it with some addition, was the first remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable worke, which was done presently after the Lord of Canterbury tooke possession of his Grace-ship. Which done, his Grace was very zealous for the pressing of it to be read in all the Churches of his Province, so as the vnwary and hasty reading of it hath caused the dignity of some to kisse the dust, and the not reading of it hath cast some out of their livings by suspension, yea, and out of the Church too by Excommunication: though (blessed be God) their dignity shineth the more gloriously. So as the violent and furious pressing of it by the Prelates and their instruments, hath proved
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7339:35"/>
a most pernicious snare to all the Ministers in England. And though the Prelates, with their Learned Doctors, and heires apparent, have pulled their wits, broken their braines and sleep, spent many precious howers, and dayes, and moneths in compiling and setting forth Treatises, Histories, Sermons, and such like, and all to ouerturne the fourth Commanndement, with the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Sabbath day, and so bring in Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme and all profanesse into the Church, thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing our Religion to the reproch and scorne of the Papists themselves, the <note n="*" place="margin">Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in his Sermons, in many plates, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clameth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gladly would they restraine them, but they may not, dare not, for feare of being brought before the Assises, there to bee punished for their Sons or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants offences. And what's the issue of this? Doth it not ingender in youthes mindes (too prone to run riot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a spurre) contempt of their Parents, or Masters, being freed by the booke to follow their pastimes on the Lords-dayes after evening prayer, so as they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon no private family dutie, either requisit for their soules, or necessary about the house? And though this liberty be dispensed only upon the Lords-dayes, and their holy dayes: yet it is sufficient to breed in them, and traine them up to such a habit of contempt and so of a rebellious humour toward their Parents and Masters, as they wilbe ready to fly out upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, &amp; they wilbe contained within no bounds of their obedience. Of this how many Masters do complaine, but the Iustice that should bright them, must for sooth punish those Masters if their servants complaine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7339:36"/>
upon the occasion of the Ministers reading of the said booke in the Congregation, I will alledge one related to me in a letter, by a reverend Minister of good credit, so as no doubt is to be made of the truth of it: In Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber last, 1636. the said booke for Sports being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly read by the minister (one Master <hi>Hubberd</hi> of S. Stephens Parish) upon the Lords day, three Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentises being present at the reading of it, were so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed at the Liberty dispensed in it, as that they spent six shillings that same day at the Taverne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to run from their Masters, hired horses on the Lords daye 3. weekes ensuing, executed their plot, rode away towards London, were pursued, overtaken, and two of them brought home, made this Confession. O co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider this al ye my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that have read the booke, how many soules you have indangered, if not destroyed hereby! So as this is a trenching, or rather a violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roade upon the fifth Commandement, which saith, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor thy Father and thy Mother &amp;c. Thus the reading of this booke to the Congregation, teacheth them at once to breake two great Commandements in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue; the last of the first Table, and the first of the Second, and so cutting in sunder the very sinewes, not only of Religion, but of all Civill Society at one blow. And by this occasion, what Ministers instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Exhortations, reprofes of youth in this kind will be of any authority with them, when they teach them, how to sanctify the Lords day according to his word, how to feare God, and to honour and obey their owne Parents, and masters in the Lord, as well upon the Lords dayes, as upon other dayes? Who then seeth not here a most dangerous overthrow of those two great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7339:36"/>
in the Law, which are the very pillars both of Religion, and of Civill Society, and which be ing pulled downe, the whole house must needs become a ruinous heape of all confusion? And doth not this tend to the inuring and training up of all unbridled, untaught, and unseasoned youth, by degrees to such a height of insolency, as that, upon some discontents, or other occasions, as Iesuites baites and seducements, they are easily drawne to advance their rebellious lusts against those that bee higher in authority, then their Masters, and Parents, which the Lord prevent? Yet <note place="margin">N.

Our Homily against wilfull Rebellion noteth, how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Sabbath-breakers goe hand in hand together.

And therefore if the Prelates had any regard either to the honour of God, and of his Word, or to the setled peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as they have but little, as appeareth too palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by their practises, in disturbing and disordering of

all they would have been so faire from procuring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publishing, and from pressing and oppressing Ministers about the said booke, as they would rather have become humble suiters to his Majesty to have set forth some severe Edict for the better Sanctification of the Lords day, that so the people might be kept in better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience both to God, and to his Majestey.

Neither I thinke can it be shewed, that in all Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time there was so great havocke made in so short a time of the faithfull <hi>Ministers</hi> of God, in any part of, yea, or in the whole Land. And now doe those Counties and Countries groane under this intolerable burthen, remedilesse, if God and the King doe not relieve them. And our neigbours house being thus on fire, doth it not concerne us all to looke to it? For they say that this shall be a precedent for all England.</p>
            <p>But upon what ground is all this? What authority doe they shew for these outrages? The King? That is answered before by his solemne Protestations to the contrary. But they plead the Act of Parliament for V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity before the Communion Booke, wherein is reserved a power <hi>to the Queene with advise of her Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners, or of the Metropolitan to ordayne and publish such further Ceremonies or Rites, as may bee most for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glory, the edifying of his Church, and the due reverence of Christs holy Mysteries and Sacraments.</hi> Hereupon they ground all their Innovations. But for this: First obserue, that this clause of the Act is lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7339:38"/>
to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and not extended to her Successors of the Crowne, they are still expressed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, admit it was intended to the Successors: yet it is with that qualification, <hi>as may bee most for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods glory, the edefying of his Church, and the due reverence of Christs holy Misteries and Sacraments.</hi> Well. To bring our new Rites to this Rule. First, doe they make to the <hi>Advancement of Gods glory?</hi> What? Superstitious, Idolatrous worship, of wooden Aultars? What? a complementall Crouch to Iesus, when they Crucifie Christ? What? to bow before a Crucifix? Againe, for the edifying of his Church. What? by the Preaching and not praying in the Pulpit before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sermon? What? by the expounding of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme? What? by reading a second Service at the Altar, where the people cannot heare it? And for due reverence to Christs Sacraments. What? by posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the people with an opinion of a Popish reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? What? by offering <hi>Christ</hi> in sacrifice upon a Wooden Altar; By a Priest of mans making? What? by drawing the people to a new adoration, by bringing them up close to the new Altar?</p>
            <p>But they will say, all makes for them. And who shall bee judges, but themselves who are the Church? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Lastly I answer for all that no humane rationall creature can bring the least shadow of colour, that this Act did giue the Queene or her succssors any power to set up Popery againe. This is out of all question. But now our New Reformers are tooth and nayle for setting up Popery againe: witnesse their hoysing up Altars in most places, as also of Images, Crucifixes with adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, putting downe of the meanes of knowledge, as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7339:38"/>
Preaching, and bringing in of Ignorance, also preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sundry points of Popery, as Auricular Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, praying to Saints, yea printing of such Sermons, prayer for the dead, and many other. All which while they set up with a high hand, and so as if the King gaue them authority so to doe (of which all his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne protestations (I say) doe sufficiently resolve us the contrary) they must needs mightily shake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle the peace of the State by these their dangerous and desperate attempts, and sill the peoples minds with musings what the issue will bee, and how the King will digest these things at the Prealates hands, which tend to the most dangerous dividing and renting of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome asunder.</p>
            <p>The next instance, is their arrogating of their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall title and office of Superiority from Christ and his Apostles. This they did lately in the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission Court, and that upon occasion of Doctor Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks cause then before them. Where hee was accused and severely censured, for writting a Booke intituled <hi>Flagellum Potificis, &amp; Episcoporum Latialium:</hi> in which booke bee whipped that usurped authority of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Hierarchy; through whose sides, by reason of their neere affinity or rather consanguinity, they being sensible of the smart of his whip, tooke it all upon themselves, and so, as Iudges in their owne cause, passed their Episcopall censure upon him; yea although he not only in his booke, but openly before the whole Court professed and protested, that hee medled not with those Prelates, who received and acknowledged their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Iurisdiction from Kings and Princes; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he alleadged and read in the audience of the Courts

But he must have it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the King; and confirmed by Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents under the great Seale of England. This Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction annexed to the Crowne of England Doctor <hi>Bast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke</hi> alledged in Court against that usurped Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Hierarchy of Rome, which they challenge from Christ. Notwithstanding they alledged for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they had their Episcopall authority from Christ, and if they could not proove it, they would cast away their Rochets. So they may cast their caps too, for any such proofe they can bring for it. But stopping the Doctors mouth, that he might not plead his cause, they proceeded to a most grievous censure of him, in 1000. pound fine to the King (for maintaining the Royalty of His Crowne against the Prelates usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, who would plucke away that gemme from, it) Imprisonment, Excommunication, suspension from his practise in Prison, and the many miseries depending thereupon, and devolving upon his Wife and children.

Their censuring of Doctor <hi>Bastwick</hi> for this very cause, that hee impugned all Episcopall Iurisdiction over Gods Ministers, claimed from <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Scripture. So as they make it their owne cause with the Pope, and his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7339:39"/>
Prelates, as all holding by that title, and not from the authority of Kings and Princes: And this is according to that in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Pock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ngtons</hi> Sunday, no Sabbath, where hee saith, <hi>pag. 48.</hi> Hereby wee may by Gods mercy, make good the trueth of our <hi>Church.</hi> For wee are able line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to set downe the succession of our Bishops from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and from him to our first Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops St. <hi>Austin,</hi> our English Apostle, downward to his Grace, that now fits in his Chaire, Primate of all England, and Metropolitane. So hee. Thus wee see how our Prelates have no other claime for their Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, then the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have and doe make, which all our Divines fince the Reformation, till but yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, have disclaimed, and our Prelates cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise assume, but by making themselues the very limbes of the Pope, and so our <hi>Church</hi> a member of that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, the constant practise of our Prelates proveth this: for they neither have at any time, nor have sought to have any the Kings Letters Parents, under the great Seale of <hi>England</hi> for their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Courts and Visitations, &amp;c. But doe all in their owne names, and under their owne Seales, contrary to the Law in that behalfe. Thirdly, in that they labour by all meanes possible to maintaine this their absolute and independed Iurisdiction, as no way depending on the King; and namely, by stopping the ordinary course of Law, that the Kings people may bee cut off from all benefit of the Kings good Lawes, and of their native ancient Liberties; so as it is become very geason, and a rare matter to obtaine a Prohibition against their il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall practises, invexing &amp; oppressing the Kings good Subjects; nay they are growne so formidable of late
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7339:40"/>
(as if they were some new generation of Giants) that the very motion of a Prohibition against a Prelate, or their Proceedings in the High Commission, makes the Courts of Instice startle; So as good causes are lost, and Innocents condemned because none dare pleade, and judge their cause according to the Kings Lawes, whereby wee ought all to be governed. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: the Ministers of <hi>Surry,</hi> who are suspended from their Ministery, and outed of their meanes and freeholds against all Law, or Conscience: yet are so disheartned and overawed, that they dare not contend in Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prelate, for feare of further vexations: and they are out of hope of any fayre hearing in an ordinary Legall way. Nay when Doctor <hi>Bastwicke</hi> had procured a <hi>Hab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus wee see they have gotten such a power into their hands, as doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top and countermaund the Kings Lawes, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Liberties, Now this power they have not from the Imperiall Crowne, according to the Lawes of the Land, but it is a meere usurpation. So as being a power not derived from the King, as the immediate fountaine of it, it proves to bee at least a branch of that forraigne power altogether excluded in the Statute of 1. <hi>Elis. cap.</hi> 1. And it is flatly against the Oath of Supremacy in the same Statute, which all Prelates take, wherein they professe and promise faith and true allegiance to the Queenes Highnesse, her Heires and lawfull Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7339:40"/>
and to their power to defend all Iurisdictions, Priviledges, &amp;c. granted or belonging to the Queenes Highnesse, her Heires &amp;c. Now all Ecclesiasticall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, which the Prelates have authority to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, being annexed to the Crowne (as is cleere by the foresayd statute) either they must not claime it by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other title, or if they doe, they are all in a <hi>Tramunire,</hi> and under the guilt of perjury. And whither they bee not also in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for practising their Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as keeping of Courts, visitations, &amp;c. in their owne names, not having the Kings Letters Patents under the Great Seale of England, I leave to the learned in the Law to judge.</p>
            <p>But some will say, that they defend and maintaine all Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to bee from the King, For in the visitation Articles for <hi>Norwich,</hi> by <hi>Mathew</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anno 1636. Chap. 1. a 2.</note> their Lord Bishop, this is one, <hi>Be there any in your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, that have denyed, or perswaded any other to deny, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, or impugne the Kings Majesties Authority, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in causes Ecclesiasticall within this Realme?</hi> First, I answer, this is a faire colour and pretence, as if it were against Papists. Secondly it is against their ordinary practise, as in the former examples. And thirdly admit they doe sincerely professe, that they have or hold no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iurisdiction but from the King; yet the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whither they will say, that all those outrageous courses they how hold, and the pranks that they play in many places of the Kingdome, are by speciall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the King: or whither the King by some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall warrant dormant hath given them this unlimited power, which they at their pleasure doe exercise? For instance: Will <hi>Mathew</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> say,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7339:41"/>
that hee hath any warrant from the King, speciall or generall, for making such havocks and hurliburlies in those two great Counties of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> to the intollerable dishonour of God, injury to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and people, and tending to most dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences? If hee have not any warrant, but doth it of his owne head, or by the instigation of any other Arch-Prelate, then let him looke to it, least he come to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as an usurper, a bringer in of a forraigne power, an Innovator, Oppressor, Persecutor and troubler of the peace of the Church and Kingdome. If he say he hath warrant for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it. But I hope hee will not father his desperate courses upon the King. What? will hee say, that the King gives him a power to exercise such unheard of tyranny and injustice upon the Kings peaceable Subjects, and Christs faithfull Ministers, and that against the Kings Lawes, and peoples Rights, all which the King hath sworne againe and againe, and solemnly protested to maintaine inviolable, as his owne Crowne? Never therefore let any man dare to pretend any such thing, so dishonourable to his Majesty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine suppose which yet is not to bee supposed) that the Prelates should so farre prevaile, as to procure a grant from the King to doe all those things, which of late they have done, tending to the utter overthrow of the Religion by Law established. Yet, whatsoever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, pretext, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow could they make for this, the King (to speake with all humble reverence) cannot give that power to others, which hee hath not himselfe. For the Power that is in the King is given unto him by God, and confirmed by the Lawes of the Kingdome. Now neither God in his Law, nor the Lawes of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7339:41"/>
Land, doe allow the King a power to alter the State of Religion, or to oppresse and Suppresse the faithfull Ministers of the Gospell, against both Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. For Kings are the Ministers of God for the good of his people, as wee shewed before. But what doe I speake of this? If all the Prelates in England did never so boldly affirme, that what they doe in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant courses of theirs, it is by warrant from the King I would be so fat from giving any credit unto them herein that I should be the first that should addresse my humble complaint to his Majesty of such dishonour done unto him, and humbly petition his Majesty to vindicate his honour from the least suspition of his giving way to, or countenancing the Prelates in such their practises, as cry up to heaven for vengeance upon their heads.</p>
            <p>This I have urged the more, both in reverence to his Sacred Majesty whose honour I cannot indure should receive the least blemish; and also in reference to the point in hand, because such usurpation of the Prelates cendeth directly to make a division betweene the King and his subjects, cantrary to that which we teach here, that good Subjects must cleave to their God and King without separation and defection, which is by the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good Lawes, which being broken, they are as the resolution of the nerves in the naturall body, or the cutting in sunder of the sinewes, whereby the head and members are united and compacted in one intire body. And therefore this claime, which the Prelates make, of their Prelation and Iurisdiction over Christs Ministers <hi>jure divino,</hi> being repugnant not only to the cleare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, forbidding all such domination as they practise (as <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 25. &amp;c. <hi>Marke</hi> 10. 42. &amp;c. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. i.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7339:42"/>
&amp;c.) for which they have neither the example of Christ, nor of his Apostles, nor of any ancient Bishops, but principally of <hi>Diotrephes 3 Iohn.</hi> 10. whom they imitate in affecting of preeminence, in opposing <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, in exommunicating the Preachers, in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against them with malicious words and the like; but also to the Kings Crowne, to the Lawes of the Land, and consequently to the Liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: I know not with what warrant or Conscience any Minister of Christ can submit to the Practises of these men, tending to the ruine of the Kingdome of Christ in this Land, and consequently of the whole Kingdome and State.</p>
            <p>Now all these instances alledged are so notorious, (some of them fresh in memory, and many witnesses of them yet living, being done but the other day, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet present before our eyes) that they cannot bee denyed, and their notoriousnesse makes them the more pernicious, as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to corrupt the Kings good peoples hearts, by casting into them feares, and jealousies, with sinister affections towards their King, as if hee were the prime cause of all those grievances, which the Prelates in his name doe oppresse the Kings good Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. But Trust in the Lord (as it is my dayly prayer) that hee will preserve the hearts and affections of his people closse and intire to their King, and that he will discover both to the King and his people these treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practises of the usurping Prelates, that so neither the King may thinke evill of his good people, nor they have the least jealousy, that his Maiesty approveth and countenanceth, much lesse willeth and commaundeth his Prelates to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit these their intollerable outrages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7339:42"/>
Well, come weenow to a second use, which is of Exhortation and admonition to all good Subjects, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to beware of those, that cunningly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate themselves betweene the barke and the tree, that labour to divide the head from the body, and the body from the head, by casting bones betweene the King and his good Subjects. And here (Beloued) let me in the name of the Lord admonish you, that whatsoever pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, or outrages you see to bee done by the Prelates, although they doe never so boldly pretend the Kings name for it, yee believe them not. Let never any Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster opinion concerning his Sacred Majesty creepe into the closset of your brests, and as a Snake either sting or poyson your true &amp; loyal hearts towards him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beware of all those Factors for Antichrist, whose practise is to divide Kings fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Subjects &amp; subjects from their King, that so betweene both they may faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erect Antichrists throne againe, where it had beene in a good measure throwne downe, and cast out, yea by this time utterly rooted out of this Land, if he had not had such strong Sticklers as his Iesuites and Priests, yea the Prelates themselves (as their practises plainly show) to keep him in life, and to set him upon his feet againe. But yee Beloved, abhorre these Factors. And if ever they should so farre prevaile as to open a wide breach to let in a forraigne enemy (which these their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and proceedings pretend, and tend unto) then shew your selues like those faithfull servants of <hi>David,</hi> sticke close to your King, and if any danger come neere his sacred Person, step betweene, and let the losse of your owne precious life, rescue and secure his, who is worth ten thousand of us. And so much for this point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7339:43"/>
The next point ariseth from the order of these words, <hi>Feare thou the Lord, and the King:</hi> That is, First, <hi>Feare the Lord,</hi> and then <hi>the King.</hi> It imports thus much: That all our obedience to Kings and Princes, and other <note place="margin">Point.</note> Superiors, must be regulated by our obedience to God. Wee must so obey men, as wee doe not there in trench or dash upon Gods Commandement. God must first be served. Therefore in all Commandements of man, wee must consult with Gods Commandements or Law, that it be not repugnant unto it. This is also intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the order of the two Tables, the First concerning our duty to God, and the Second to our Neighbour. <note place="margin">Exod 20. Math. 22. 38.</note> And Christ tell that Questionist in the Gospel, <hi>This is the first and great Commandement,</hi> to wit, <hi>to Loue God with all our heart, and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt loue thy Neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> And the like orders it set downe, 1. Pet. 2. <hi>Feare God: Honour the King.</hi> First <hi>feare God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this stands with good reason. For, First, the King is Gods Minister and Vicegerent, and commands as for God, so from God, and in God. So as it is his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to command nothing against God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If Princes shall commaund any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and his Law, then we must remember, that we are Gods servants too, and therefore must obey man in nothing, that stands not with our obedience, first to God. For this cause the same word of God is a rule both for the King, how to cary himselfe in governing, and for every Subject, how to cary himselfe to the King, and first unto God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, otherwise to obey, or feare man before God, and so above or against God, is to make an Idol of man,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7339:43"/>
in placing him in a throne above God. This is that feare of man, which bringeth a snare (Pro. 29: 25.) but <hi>who so putteth his trust in the Lord, shalbe safe.</hi> So as the feare of man which brings a snare, argues, a failing of faith in God. And this is a plaine defection and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from God, when man is obeyed against, and above God.</p>

            <p>Well, the second use is for instruction, concerning the duty of a Christian in this point, and the rather, in regard of the snares; which Satan layeth to intrap soules this way in these dayes, by the new Iesuiticall doctrine of blind obedience. As therefore the Apostle Iohn saith, <hi>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Spirits, Whither they be of God, because many false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world:</hi> So I may say here: <hi>Many false Prophets are now abroad,</hi> being possessed with the spirit of the Beast, which so magnifie the power of man, and his authority in commaunding, that <hi>ipso facto</hi> all must yeeld obedience thereunto, without further adoe. Now this spirit is knowne by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to God and his word. It setteth man above God, above his word: and therefore we must beware of it. We must therefore So obey God in the first place, by guiding our selves in all things according to his word, as no commaund of man prevaile with us to crosse that. It is for beasts without reason, to yeeld a blind obedience to their Masters: but men, are of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

            <p>The last use is for Consolation to all those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this rule. For howsoever obedience to God, and the not obeying of mans unjust commaunds fares ill in the world oftentimes, and never more, then in these dayes of ours, wherein though wicked Imposers are not able to give any other reason of their impious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, but <hi>Volumus</hi> and <hi>Iubemus, Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas,</hi> so as if present obedience be not yeelded, they cry out, Rebells, they suspend, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, sequester, undoe, threatening moreover halter and hatchet, as was noted before: yet a faithfull, honest, godly Minister, or Christian, being constant to his God and to his Word, as <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were, shall find it more happy and comfortable to <note place="margin">Iustum &amp; tenacem Propositi virum, Non Civ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Come wee now to the last point in the exhortation, which is the connexion of these two, the feare of the Lord, and of the King. Whence we learne.</p>
            <p>That the feare of the Lord, and of the King, (their <note place="margin">Point.</note> order duely observed) ought not to bee separated. No more, then the two Tables of the Decalogue. For God must so be honoured, as we doe also in the second place honour our Superiours: And our Superiours must so be honoured, as in the first place wee honour God; as was said before. Separated they must not bee. For they

are like the two pillars in the Porch of <hi>Salomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the one Strength, the other Stability, which beare up the most beautifull Fabricke of the Church and State well compacted together, and established in the true feare of God, and of the King.</p>
            <p>Here then are condemned sundry dividers in this kind. As first, the Anabaptist, who deny lawfull Magistracy. They pretend to feare God, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to honour the King with their obedience. And therefore they doe not truly feare God.</p>

In that they allow by their good will, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, feare, or obedience to Kings from their Subjects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they will kisse the Popes toe, that is, acknowledge the Popes Supremacy, as well in Temporalties as in Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For the Pope challengeth a power over all Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, comparing himselfe to the Sunne, and the Imperor, and so Kings &amp; Princes to the Moone, which is 47 times lesse then the Sunne, and must borrow their light and lustre from the Pope, as from the Sunne. As <hi>Cupers</hi> one of their Canonists saith,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7339:48"/>
The Pope conferring the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire upon Caesar, doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Priviledges thereof from himselfe, seeing hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres onely the exercise of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Seeing the direct domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Empire is resident in God, and consequently in the Pope.

Thus wee see this great Antichrist ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts himselfe <hi>above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or that is worshipped.</hi> Thus hee intercepts from the King that feare and obedience which is due vnto him from the Subjects, and takes it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And thus hee not onely separates the feare of God, and of the King, but destroyes them both, in assuming and usurping them both to himselfe, as being both God and the King. Secondly, They separate Gods feare from the King in this, that they altogether free all their Votaries, and infinit Orders from the terrene power of Kings and Princes.

Lord and the King, not to meddle with them that are given to change, that is, not to have fellowship, or partnership with them, as before was opened.</p>
            <p>The point we learne hence, is, That the true servants of the Lord, &amp; subjects of the King, ought not to joyne with those, that are given to change, whither it bee in the State of Religion, or of the Common-weale. This is confirmed, first, with sundry places of Scripture. As Prov. 22. 28. <hi>Remove not the ancient Land-marke, which thy Fathers have Set.</hi> This alludes, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lavater in bunc locum.

            <p>
               <hi>Now with Innovators, such as feare the Lord, and the King, must not meddle nor pertake, and that for sundry waighty reasons.</hi>

So when wee see wicked men goe about by their Innovation, to undermine and overthrow the State of Religion, and of the Common-weale, if wee be silent, and doe not detect them, nor labour to defeate them, but out of a base feare, hold our peace, when the State of things cal upon us to speak: we shal be found guilty before God, (though the State take no notice of it) of the same Sinne with them, and so pertake of the like punishment.</p>

               <hi>a City may stand without walls, but without Lawes it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.

               <hi>Aristotle</hi> compares changes in a State, which at first seeme but small and insensible, to the expenses of a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7339:52"/>
howse, and the wasting of a mans substance by little and little, which in a short time consumes all. And in his Third Booke <hi>ibid.</hi> Shewing the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a King, and a Tyrant, hee saith, The Citizens defend with Armes their King, but Strangers a Tyrant. For Kings doe rule according to Law, and over willing Subjects: But Tyrants against their wills. So as Kings have a Guard of their people, but Tyrants against them. So hee. Whereby we see the usefulnesse of good Lawes, as combining King and peoples, as the head and members. Secondly, in point of Religion. A notable example hereof we have in Deut. 13. Where <hi>if Sonnes of Belial have drawne a City of</hi> Israel <hi>to Idolatry, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of the Truth, all</hi> Israel <hi>is to smite the Inhabitants of that Citie, with the sword, destroying utterly all therein, both man and beast with the edge of the sword, and the whole City with all the spoile therein shall be consumed with Fire, and made a heape for ever, that so Israel may be guiltlesse, and blessed of God.</hi> So for all <hi>Ieroboams</hi> policy, which yet to carnall judgement seemed very subtily, and safe for his Kingdome, the erecting of his Calues proved the bane of his House, and Kingdome for ever. And the like ruine fell upon <hi>Ierusalem</hi> afterward, with the <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi> Captivity for 70. yeeres. And the cause was partly changing of the Lawes (whereof before) and partly and especially changing of Religion, as these two changes goe commonly hand in hand together. So <hi>Iere. 2. 36. Why gaddest thou about so much, to change thy way? So vers. 11. Hath a Nation changed their Gods? which yet are no Gods. But my people have changed their glory, for that which doeth not profit.</hi> And <hi>Esay,</hi> puts all together Saying, <hi>The earth is befiled under the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7339:52"/>
thereof, because they have transgressed the Lawes, changed the ordinance, broken the Everlasting Covenant: Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein, &amp;c.</hi> Innovation in Religion breeds oftentimes troubles and distractions, especially after a long settling. And for this cause the first Reformers of our Religion were very tender of settling such an exact reformation in all things, as perhaps they desired. As the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> having set forth the Psalter in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, with omission of the Letany: there was such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content about it, as hee was forced to put it in againe.

            <p>And the calamity and ruine of these innovators is described in the 22. verse: first, by the suddainenesse &amp; unexpectednesse of it: for their calamity shall rise sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly: 2.

            <p>A fourth reason, why good Christians and subjects should not meddle with them that be given to change, is, because they feare not God, but are enemies unto him. For here wee see how these are set in opposition to those that feare God. <hi>My sonne, feare thou the Lord, and meddle not with them that are given to change:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that they <hi>which are given to change,</hi> doe not <hi>feare the Lord.</hi> And yet who make fairer pretence (in their kind of way) of Religion, devotion, and the feare of God? How holy would they seeme to bee in their new guise of devotion, and in a curious formality, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall observance of their holy rites: as in a lowly bowing at the name Iesus, in an humble adoration to the Altar, in standing bolt upright at the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> and at the Gospel, and the like? Would not the world believe these men to be very regular, very religious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, holy? Surely, if true religion and holinesse stood in outward rites of mans devising, and in false showes, and will-worship, in a kind of Courtship, in a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a Congee, in making of a legge, in bowing of the body, or the like: these were very religious men. And ignorant persons, who are not able to judge of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, take them to bee so, and have them in great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. But bring these counterfeit coynes to the touch, and by and by they are discovered. And the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7339:54"/>
touch is Gods Word which saith: <hi>In vaine they worship</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 15. 9 Col. 2, 20. 21. 22. 23.</note> 
               <hi>me, teaching for doctrines the Commaundements of men.</hi> Yea if we compare their showes of devotion, to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practised, there need no other triall to discover them. They pretend great love and reuerence to Iesus, while they are so zealous and devout for bowing to his Name, and so to their Altar, as who so refuseth to doe it, Minister or people, must bee excommunicated. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men sure. But while they pretend such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary respect to Iesus, and persecute and crucify Christ in his Ministers, and members; also in his Word, and the Ministry of it, by labouring tooth and nayle to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and overthrow it; and in the power of religion, by crying downe all true piety; and in the worship of God, by corrupting it with their Superstitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous rites, and so trampling under their feet Christs Kingdome, that they may set up Antichrists throne againe: If this bee piety, if this holinesse, then is Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry piety, and Superstition holinesse; as they would faine make it, as wee shall see anone. But all their holinesse is but Pope-holinesse.</p>
            <p>The last reason, why we may not meddle, or partake with these men, is, because they are also enemies to the King; for they feare not the King, they honour him not, they love him not, they obey him not. How? Doe not these novellers honour, love, feare the King? Who seeme more? True. Yet (as was shewed before) these are the most dangerous enemies of the King, who under a pretence of honor and love, doe machinate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his Kingdome and State, as by altering the State of religion, and by that meanes alienating and unsettling the hearts of his Subjects, by filling them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7339:55"/>
with feares and suspicions, as if the King gave these novellers authority so to doe; which farre bee it from every good Subjects heart once to imagine. For the King and Novellers here doe stand in opposition one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other. Can those be the Kings friends, that goe about to divide betweene him and his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? Or to expose his Kingdome to Gods displeasure, by corrupting his worship, and oppressing his truth? Its impossible. Therefore to joyne with such, is to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with the Kings false friends, and fawning ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Now for the close of all, with application to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, in the thankefull memory of this dayes deliverance from the Gunpowder plot (a deliverance never to bee cancelled out of the Calender, but to bee written in every mans heart for ever) this serveth first for caution to all, to take heed, how they any way par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with those that bee given to change. And to the end wee may the better take heed, I will propose onely two examples, which it concernes us most at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to take notice of. The first, of the Gun-powder Plotters, who, if their plot had taken effect, had prooved notorious Changers. For as Popery it selfe is a religion of Changes, as from antiquity of truth to novelty of error (though they falsely pretend the contrary, like the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> with their old shooes, and mouldy bread, as if they had come from farre, when they dwelt hard by, so it can rest no where, but is a Mother pregnant in plotting, and producing of changes in States, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Common-weales, only unchangeable in this, that she makes her selfe Supreme and Sole Mistresse, where ever the cometh. Accordingly, those her Sons,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7339:55"/>
whom she had fostered, as fit sparkes for such a combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, were set on worke to produce the most monstrous Change, that ever the world saw on such a suddaine, <note n="*" place="margin">Quis tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But our God though he winked at them, and suffered them to come to the very upshot of their hope, strikes in on a suddaine, and in the very nick puts a divine sentence in the lippes of the King, who by a strange interpretation of a word in one of their own Letters to a Popish Noble-man, not according to the Grammaticall sense of the Letter, smelling, a sent of fire, from the mention of <hi>burning the Letter, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is past,</hi> thereupon sent the Lord Chamberlaine to search about the Parliament-house, and under it. Where entring into the Sellar underneath the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, hee found a great many Billets and Faggots hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, not yet suspecting what lurked underneath. But the last search was made, for more privacy, by Sr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Knevet</hi> who first met with <hi>Faux</hi> and his Lanthorne, with his Matches about him, ready against the next morning to blow up King, Queene, Prince, Peeres, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Knights, Burgesses, assembled then and there in Parliament: and making him sure, first entred the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and found no lesse then 36. Barrells of <hi>Gun-powder,</hi> lying Couchant under Billets, and Barres of Yron. Thus through Gods mercy, the change was prevented: the change of a Noble Kingdome into an Anarchy, and Babilonian tyranny: a change of Christs Religion into Antichrists: of Tables into Altars: of Preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel, into sacrifising Masse-Priests: of light into darkenesse: of Christ into <hi>Belial:</hi> of the Temple of God, into a temple of Idolls: of fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall just lawes of a Kingdome, into Papall Canons: of

Thus (I say) as of old, the Mistery of iniquity could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in one day, but (as the Elephants broode) was many yeeres a hatching, before it came to any perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7339:57"/>
So our new refounders of Popery could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their worke in one day, but it requireth some longer time, although a man would wonder to see in so short a space such a monstrous and suddaine alteration, notwithstanding the long establishment, and cleare light of the Gospell, and the strong sence of good Lawes, whereby it is hedged about. So if ours would set up the Masse-God in our Churches, they cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it all at once. They must first downe with Tables, and up with Altars. For that cause all Seats must downe at the end of the Chancell, that the Altar may stand closse to the wall, because (as their <note n="*" place="margin">Arch-Prelate of Canterbury.</note> Oracle saith) <hi>none must sit above God-Almighty.</hi> And if Ministers bee so stiffe as not to yeeld to this innovation, at least the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble must be rayled about, that none touch it, as being more Sacred, then Pulpit, Pew, or Font. Then some adoration as lowly bowing, must bee given to it. Then the second Service, as dainties, must bee said there, as being more holy; than the Readers Pew. And what then? Surely a Priest is not farre off. But where is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? Stay a while: that service comes last, and all these are preparations unto it: as the trimming of a <hi>Rome,</hi> and spreading of the table, bodes the banquet to come anone. So as all these preambles doe at length usher in the great God of the Host, so soone as it is well baked, and the peoples stomacks sitted to digest so hard a bit.</p>
            <p>But what bee those Changes, and how came they? What they be, wee shall shew by and by: but how they come, it cannot be imputed to any other cause, than to that Spirit, which rules in the ayre, and which doth usually haunt the Pallaces of Prelates. And such a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7339:58"/>
poyson hath this spirit infused into the Chaire of the Hierarchy, as that man, who fits in it, had need to bee strongly fortified with preservatives and antidotes of true Reall Grace, (not nominall and titular) that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome the infection of it.

            </p>
            <p>Is it not to bee admired, that Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> should bee so stiffe against holy and learned <hi>Hooper,</hi> who being by the King chosen Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and having obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Kings favour not to weare the Rochet, &amp; square Cap, as being offensive to his Conscience, yet they would not yeeld unto it, although both the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and a great Harle in the Kings name, did earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly write unto them for the same? Mr <hi>Foxes</hi> words are: <hi>But I can not tell what Sinister and vnlacky contention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ordering and Consecration of Bishops, and of their apparrell, with such otherlike trisles began to disturbe the good and lucky beginning of this goldly bishop.

            </p>
            <p>But (I say) the Bishops would not. Yet at the length the fire reconciled them all, when they laid aside their Pontificall robes, and offered up their lives in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the Truth.</p>
            <p>Now if such a spirit did cleave to the very Chaire, then, when those pious men sate in it, who were Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of Religion for the Substance of it, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were persecuted, and suffered Martyrdome for the faith of Christ: What may wee expect in those Prelates, that shew themselves such enemies of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for which those suffered, and persecute the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers thereof, and are not content with those ceremonies limmited by the Lawes of the Land, but bring in a number of other Superstitious and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Ceremonies of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the intollerable burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mens consciences, and insnaring of their Soules, Bodies and estates, both against the Law of God, and the Liberty which <hi>Christ</hi> hath purchased for us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Lawes of the Land? Nor let our present Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates glory, that they can shew us such Predecessors, Prelates, who were Martyrs, unlesse they themselues will therein be their Successors. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> makes it one note of their holy Mother Church, namely the Sanctity of the life of the authors, and prime Fathers of their Religion.</p>
            <p>But as the heathen <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Qui genus jactat suum, aliena jactat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> were never a whit the more holy, for <note n="*" place="margin">Successores omnes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt esse, imitatores pauci: Saith Bern.</note> calling <hi>Abraham</hi> Father. But alasse our new

And yet this I confesse, if such bee the affinity, or rather consanguinity between our Prelates, and those of <hi>Rome,</hi> that neither Gods Law, nor mans Law, nor Religion, nor Conscience, can containe them within those lists, which humane Lawes have confined them unto, but according to that Principle which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from their originall, and that Spirit of <hi>Rome</hi> which breatheth in them, they are so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly biassed to wheele about to their Roman mistresse, (as every element hath a naturall effection and inclination to its proper place, and resteth not out of it) and if it bee not possible for them to governe as Fathers (as the Law intended) but that they must needs tyrannize as Lawlesse Lords, and lift themselves up in a transcendent degree above the Kings Lawes, so comming betweene Him and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they intercept from the people that gratious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of protection, which properly and by right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines unto euery good Subject from his naturall Prince against all such usurping Tyrants: and if they can doe no other, but show what kind they come of, in labouring to overthrow the true Religion, to corrupt the

worship of God with Superstition and Idolatry, to trouble the peace of the Church, to captivate mens consciences with their humane invention, and their bodies with their vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in persecuting God faithfull Ministers lawlessely, in stopping the course of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by all the wiles and wayes, which eyther the pollicy or power of man can take: and if they cannot choose but hate the power of Religion, and the very name of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and cry against it, and downe with it with might and maine, because it crosseth the course of their lives: and if they cannot but seeke the ruine of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being altogether Spirituall, and a Kingdome of righteousnesse, and not of this world, because their owne is of this world, a Kingdome of pride, and pompe, a Kingdome of outward riches and glory; no way sutable to the Kingdome of grace, and so they cannot stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but the one must fall: and in a word, if they cannot content themselves with that title of Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the King by his Lawes hath conferred upon them, but they must needs pretend to hold it from Christ and his Apostles, than which nothing is more derogatory to the honor of Christ, nothing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Word, nothing more opposite to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Christ and his Apostles, while under pretence of their jurisdiction from Christ, they exercise such Lordly tyranny, as the Gentiles did, which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to his Apostles; So as such a claime from Christ is blasphemous, as making Christ the author of their Antichristian usurpations: All these things, and many more well considered; I confesse, were it a Law in England, as it was once amongst the <hi>Locrians,</hi> that whosoever would propound a new Law, should come

            <p>
               <hi>And these innovations or changes wee may reduce to eight generall heads.</hi>

This (I say) must needs bee of the Prelates procuring, it being no part of that noble Kings meaning, that Schollers should bee debarred from the reading of those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and orthodox authors, whom himselfe so much approoved and magnified, both for their great learning, sound judgement, and religious lives. For did not that excellent King give the right hand of fellowship to those reformed Churches, which those authors had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther planted, or watered with their famous labours, when hee sayd, <hi>Hee would exhort all those reformed

And what shall become of the little brooks, if their fountaine bee corrupted? So the King. And wee know, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoole-men, being commended, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to young men in the habits of venerable antiquity, are apt to beget in them the greater reverence and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to their writings, in comparison of those that are moderne, and as it were but of yesterday. And therefore young Students had need rather to bee admonished not to meddle with Fathers and Schoole-men, till they come to riper yeeres, and bee well seasoned with the pure liquor of Trueth, both immediately drunke in from the fountaines of the Scriptures, and derived by those uncorrupt Conduit-pipes, the Divines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. An unexpert Sea-man, must not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture his vessell on the Seas, without an experienced Pilot, that knowes the Shelues, or shallowes, and Rocks, least he commit ship-wrack before he be aware.</p>
            <p>Againe, wee know what a learned Champion King <hi>Iames</hi> was against Popery. Now an injudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not being well grounded aforehand, comming to read some Fathers and Schoole-men, may in some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages (perhaps foysted in by the false fingering of the Monks; as many of the writings in the volumes of the Ancients, are factious and spurious) bee infected with the poyson of Popish error and Superstition, before hee be aware. Therefore how can wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that any such Order was the Kings, but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7339:62"/>
rather that it proceeded from some of the Prelates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, thereby the more easily to make way for the accomplishing of their plot, so long a hammering for the reinducing of Popery.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose they procure another order in King <hi>Iames</hi> his name, for the inhibiting of young Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to preach of the Doctrines of Election and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, and that none but Bishops &amp; Deanes shall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle those points. And after that, there is set forth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration before the Articles of Religion in King <hi>Charles</hi> his name, which (though as wee noted before) it was farre from his Majesties pious intention to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit any part of Gods truth to bee preached, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary heresies, yet the Prelates perverted and extended it to an universall silencing, and suppressing of all those saving Doctrines, of Election, Predestination, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vocation by grace, assurance, perseverance in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the contrary Arminian heresies; so as neither Prelates nor Presbyters must meddle with them. Thus the Doctrines of the Gospell must be for ever husht, &amp; layd a sleep. Thus our Articles of Religion, to which all our Ministers subscribe, are hanged up upon the wal, and cashered, as the heathen Oracles of old. Thus the Ministry of the Gospell is at once overthrowne, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but orations of morality must be taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <hi>and being the Patrons of great mens vices; therefore, those errors being opposed by the Orthodox, they labour to compose all Controversies with an Amnestia, or silencing of all disputes, and by that meanes they wickedly presume to reconcile Christ with Belial, Truth with Errour, a believer with an infidell. So as the Emperor Anastasius, being a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Arrian heresy, was mooved by such counsels, to bury the Controversies of the principall heads of Doctrine under an Amnestia. But in vaine: This counsell is not of God, but of men. Vnder this cloake and patronage of Amne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia, doe corruptions, and other plagues of the Church of God increase. Let therefore all Potentates of this world learne, that the most waighty Controversies of the Articles of faith cannot be abolished, or quieted by Amnesties: but rather let them be determined by the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> So they. The like did the Arrian Bishops in a Councell, at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> called by <hi>Constantius</hi> an Arrian Emperor, who did therein suppresse by a perpetuall <hi>Amnestia</hi> the mention of <hi>homousios</hi> and <hi>homotousios,</hi> that so they might coyne a new faith, and utterly extinguish that of the Councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> Thus wee see the antiquity of this practise. But wee have before sufficiently cleared our gratious Soveraigne from having the least intention of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7339:63"/>
Suppressing any part of Gods truth by that his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary errors, although the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes do pervert &amp; presse it upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ministers for the Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of those very truthes or doctrines of our Church, clearly, though briefly expressed in the 39 Articles, and especially that of Election &amp; Predestination; as before wee noted. Now will any man Say, that the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is prefixed to the Articles, that they should bee void and of none effect, or that they should bee as a nose of wax, or a <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in the meane time a fearefull innovation of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is by this very meanes broken in upon us. Now the doctrines of Gods free grace and mans salvation, are husht, and banished out of Citty and Countrey. For where is there a Minister almost among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, that dare cleerly and plainly according to the Word of God, and the Articles of our Church, preach of these most comfortable Doctrines to Gods people, and so soundly and roundly confute the Arminian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, <note place="margin">Acts. 20. 26. 27: 28.

So as the matter of our preaching must bee but morality at the best. The mistery of God touching his Grace may not be opened, as it ought.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose <hi>Mountagues</hi> Appeale (the first part allowing altogether of Arminianisme, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Popery) was published, and that by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall approbation and allowance of the Prelates.

the Historicall Narration, being a notorious packe and plot of knavery, for the conclùding of the Arminian Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents to be the doctrins of the Church of England, was by them published, being allowed in London house. <note place="margin">Dr. George Abbot.</note> Although the Archbishop that then was, called it in.

as being the principall Fundamentall, wherein consists the unity of all Churches under one Head, the Pope. And all this according to the sence of Trent. Now let any man but of common sence judge. The Pope being cast out of this Kingdome, with all his false doctrines, can any man imagine, that the Articles of our Religion could beare any such sence, as to bring us backe againe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring our King under the Popes girdle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to conspire with all those blasphemous doctrines and decrees of that most Antichristian Councell of Trent? What man in the world, were he not a Iesuited Divell incarnate, but would have blushed and beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to have undertaken such a monstrous Task as this, to reconcile the Articles of our Religion with the Councell of Trent? How comes it then to passe, that till now of late, all our grave and learned Divines, yea Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and others, have maintained an immortall warre, and which can never admit of a Truce, against the Pope and all his Antichristian heresies packed up in that Diabolicall Councell of <hi>Trent?</hi> And their learned workes doe still live, and that with triumphant Lawrells upon their heads, standing to this day unanswered and unanswerable?

But hee hath gotten a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from the Father of lies, and from the Pope, to coyne brutish lies at his pleasure. Adde wee a second instance, which is that of the 24.

Then what hope hath he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to Rome, or to re-erect his Masse in England? yes he hath one hope. What is that? By calling here a nationall Synod. Of whom?

               <hi>invocation apart) the more gracious wee appeare in his sight.</hi> And hee concludes it thus: <hi>I will onely adde this
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7339:68"/>
that since the finishing of this Story, I have read a booke of the now Bishop of Chicester, intituled Apparatus, &amp;c. and I am glad to find that I have not digressed from him in any one particular.</hi> So hee. Loe therefore what a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis of our Religion is here. Here is a new goddesse brought in amongst us. The author glorieth, <hi>that hee is the first who hath written</hi> (as hee saith) <hi>in our vulgar tongue, on this our Blessed Virgin.</hi> And God grant he be the last. But he beares himself in al this upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where, I pray you? At last I perceive this Church of <hi>England</hi> is the now Bishop of <hi>Chicester</hi> in his <hi>Apparatus, &amp;c.</hi> From whom <hi>he hath not digressed in any particular.</hi> And surely it were strange that such a mystery of iniquity could bee found, but in a Prelate, and in this one by name for a tryed Champion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so a devout votary to his Queene of heaven.</p>
            <p>Againe, they have laboured to make a change in the doctrine of obedience to Superiours (of which wee spake before) setting man so in Gods Throne, as all obedience to man must bee absolute, without regard to God, and conscience, whose only rule is the Word of God. But wee spake of this sufficiently before.</p>
            <p>We will conclude with one instance more touching change in doctrine, and that is, concerning the doctrine of the Sabbath, or Lords-day, wherein our novell Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have gone about to remoove the institution of it from off the foundation of divine authority, and so to settle it upon the Ecclesiasticall or humaine power. For maintenance hereof they have strained the vaines of their Conscience, no lesse then of their braines. And they are so mad upon it, that no shame will stay them, till confusion stop their mouthes. It is reported, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7339:68"/>
Doctor <hi>White</hi> hath sent an answer to <hi>A. B.</hi> which is now at the presse. Surely, hee will sacrifice all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his reason (if any be left in him) upon it. Sure I am, he can never answer it, except with rayling and perverting, wherein lyeth his principall faculty, in fighting against the truth, which (be hee well assured) is too hard for him, and all his confederates. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee hath great advantage, that hee may print what hee will at hand: But the contrary side with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and delay. Otherwise hee had had his hand full before now, when he should have beene put to the taske to answer the full answer at large, to his tedious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, of which <hi>A. B.</hi> was but a tast. Well, thus much of the first and grand change, to wit, in doctrine, which our Prelates, especially of late dayes have beene a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, and now almost (except the Lord Christ strike in, and prevent them) brought to perfection. We shall bee much shorter in the rest, and dispatch them in a Word; because they have beene touched before.</p>
            <p>The next change is, innovation in Discipline, which in a word is this, that whereas of old, the Censures of the Church were to bee inflicted upon disordered and vitious persons, notorious livers, as drunkards, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, hereticks, Apostates, false teachers, and the like: now the sharpe edge thereof is turned mainly against Gods people and Ministers, even for their vertue, and piety, and because they will not conforme to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious <note place="margin">Dat veniam Corvis, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xat censura Columba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They abuse this power at their owne pleasure, as well in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the godly with Bell, Booke, and Candle, as also in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving the reprobate, which are knowne to be unworthy of any Christian society.</hi> And what can the Prelates and their Court say for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, why that of <hi>Bernard</hi> may not be applied to them, which hee spake of the Prelates in his time? <hi>Quem dabis mihi de numero Episcoporum, qui non plus invigilet subditorum evacuendis, marsupijs, qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 3. Change is in the worship of God; which they goe about to turne inside outward, placing the true worship, which is in Spirit and Trueth, in a Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of mans devising, consisting in some externall complements, and gesticulations, as cringing &amp; crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, bowing, or standing upright at some Scriptures,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7339:69"/>
more than at others; also a punctuall observance in these formalities, as in bowing to the name of Iesus, to the Communion table, or rather Altar, as to the Mercy-seat, as <note n="*" place="margin">Reve. Schelford. Morton. Dr. White Dr. Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington.</note> they teach in their books, praying with their faces towards the East, thus tying God to a fixed place, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at reading of the Gospell, and the like. Also reading their second service at their Altar, as we touched before, &amp; many the like. And who so wil not worship after their new fashion, their new discipline is to excommunicate them, or to bring them into the High-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, a place which they make worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Purgatory it selfe. Al which oppression, being an innovation, is directly contrary to the Act of Conformity before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion Booke, bringing the Prelats into little lesse, then a <hi>Praemunire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 4. change is in the civill goverme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to reduce &amp; transferre to Ecclesiasticall, while they seeke to trample upon the Lawes of the Land, &amp; step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King &amp; his people, exercising such a lawlesse tyranny over their bodies &amp; goods (as also over their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cum duplicantur Lateres, tunc venit Moses</note> Prelates power over-swaying the subjects right in the free use and benefit of the Lawes) the people of the Land are used, rather as vassals &amp; slaves to the Prelates, then as the free subjects of the King. And this is the case of all <hi>England</hi> at this day, the people every where groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; sighing for this their bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, &amp; their miserable vexations in the Ecclesiasticall Courts.

And so much the more should they bee sensible
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7339:70"/>
of this evill, by how much the glory of the Kings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement over a free people, according to his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lawes, is lamentably eclipsed, his power infringed, and his regall Prerogative undermined.</p>
            <p>The fifth innovation, is in the altering of Prayer-Bookes, set foorth by publicke authority. And first in the Communion Booke, set forth by Parliament, and commaunded to bee read, without any alteration, and none other, they have altered Sundry things: as in the Collect for the Queene, and the Royall Progeny, they have put out <hi>Father of thine elect, and of their Seed,</hi> as it <note place="margin">In the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions since 1619.</note> were excluding the King, Queene, and Seed Royall, out of the number of Gods Elect. Also in the Epistle for Sunday before Easter, <hi>That in the name of Iesus,</hi> they <note place="margin">Altered since 1619.</note> haue turned into, <hi>At the name of Iesus;</hi> that so it may make the fairer colour for their forced bowing to the name of Iesus: for which there is neither Scripture, nor ancient Father.</p>
            <p>The second Booke, is the Prayers set forth by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament, for Solemne thankesgiving for our deliverance from the Gun-powder Treason, of the Papists, on every Fifth of November: where in stead of this passage, <hi>Root out that Babilonish and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sect, which say of Ierusalem, &amp;c.</hi> They in the last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, 1635. set it downe thus, <hi>Root out that Babilonish and Antichristian Sect OF THEM, which say of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> &amp;c. Now whereas the words of the Originall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py doe plainely meane, That all Iesuites, Seminary Priests, and their confederates, are that <hi>Babilonish and Antichristian Sect, which say of Ierusalem,</hi> &amp;c. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Booke either restraines it to some few, that are of that mind, or else mentally transferres it to those Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7339:70"/>
that cry, Downe with Babilon, that is, Popery, which these men call Ierusalem, and the true Catholike Religion. Againe, in the same Prayer, the old copy hath these words, <hi>And to that end, strengthen the hands of our gracious King, the Nobles and Magistrates of the Land with Iudgement &amp; Iustice, to cut off these workers of iniquity (whose religion is rebellion, whose faith is faction, whose pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is murdering of soules and bodies) and to root them out of the confines of this Kingdome, &amp;c.</hi> But the new Booke hath it thus, <hi>And to that end strengthen the hands of our Gratious King, the Nobles and Magistrates of the Land, with Iudgement and Iustice, to cut off these workers of iniquity, WHO TVRNE RELIGION INTO RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLION, AND FAITH INTO FACTION.</hi> Thus these Innovators would not have the Popish <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to be termed <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and their <hi>faith Faction,</hi> as the ancient copy plainly shewes it to bee: but turne it off from the religion, to some persons, which turne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into rebellion, and faith into faction. So as by this turning, they plainly imply, that the religion of Papists is the true religion, and no rebellion, and their faith the true faith, and no faction. Thus with altering of a word, they have quite perverted the sence, and so turned the Cat in the Pan, so as the blame is quite taken off from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and laid upon a few (who ever they bee) <hi>who turne Religion into Rebellion, and Faith into Faction.</hi> Thus what dare not these men doe, that are not afraid to alter those things, which are by authority of Parliament (which it seemes they make but light account of) published as <hi>Authentick Acts,</hi> not to bee altered by private spirits. But who they bee, it's hard for me to divine; it pertaines to those to find
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7339:71"/>
them out, of whom <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, It is the honour of Kings to search out a matter.</p>
            <p>Now having fallen upon this so important a passage, wherein the Innovators would not have the Romish <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> to be called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or their <hi>faith Faction,</hi> &amp; the like, but labour all they can to wash this Blackamore white, while by their <hi>index expurgatorius,</hi> they purge out of all our authentick records, all monuments and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of this Strumpets Staines, painting her haggs face with the counterfeit colours of Christs Spowse: I will crave leave in this place briefely to show, how truly (according to the judgement of our Church, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon manifest and undeniable proofes) the Romish or Popish <hi>Religion</hi> is here in this Booke (set foorth by the Parliament) called <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and their faith Faction.</p>
            <p>First, that the Popish religion is rebellion, is prooved by the universall practise of Papists, both Iesuites, Priests and other Recusants. For whereas in 3. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> cap. 4. the Oath of Supremacy is injoyned to all Papists: all Iesuites and Seminary Priests, refuse it, and all Iesuited Papists: and if any Papist doe take it, hee is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated for it. And their reason is, Because they hold and adhere to the Pope, as the onely Supreme head and Soveraigne over all powers on earth; this being the prime and fundamentall Article of their Creed: and so consequently, they hold and teach those doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popes usurped power over Kings &amp; Princes, in deposing them, and disposing of their Kingdomes, in Excommunicating them, and so exposing them to the rebellion of their people, as being now freed from their allegiance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Popish religion is rebellion, is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7339:71"/>
by their writings, positions and doctrines, which they professe and teach concerning the Popes usurped power and Soveraignty over all Kings and Kingdomes of the earth. Here of the Reader may take a briefe and full view both in Doctor <hi>Iohn White,</hi> his Defence of the way, chap. 6. and in Doctor <hi>Crakenthorpe,</hi> his Treatise of the Popes temporall Monarchy, Cap. 1. First, Dr. <hi>Iohn White,</hi> in answere to the Iesuites bold challenge, hath in the said place, collected no lesse then 40. instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Popish Authors, who exalt the Popes power over Kings, in deposing them, and exposing their Persons to the danger of Rebells, Traytors, and Murderers, commending, and highly magnifying, as a meritorious act, the killing of Kings, as of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, of <hi>France,</hi> as there is to bee seene. Therefore (saith hee) I say still, and heere write it in capitall Letters, that <hi>THE CHVRCH OF ROME TEACHETH DISLOYALTY AND REBELLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON AGAINST KINGS, AND LEADES HER PEOPLE INTO ALL CONSPIRACIES, AND TREASONS AGAINST STATES AND KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOMES.</hi> This I shew by the Doctrine and Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the chiefest Divines therein. So hee. Let the Reader peruse the whole chapter at large; where among other remarkable things, is this Passage out of <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranus:</hi> that <hi>so soone as any one</hi> (King) <hi>for Apostacy from the faith, by judgement is denounced Excommunicate,</hi> IP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SO FACTO, HIS SVBIECTS ARE ABSOLVED FROM HIS GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, AND FROM THE OATH OF ALLEGIANCE. So there.</p>

The second Learned <hi>Author</hi> of ours, is Dr. <hi>Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,</hi> who in the fore-named place, hath collected the Sentences of many Poopi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Some of them saying, <hi>That Christian Kings are Dogges, which must be ready at the Sheepheards hand (to wit, the Pope) or else the Sheepheard must presently remooue them from their office.

               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7339:72"/>
more, it plainly appeareth, that the Popish <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and that Papists are an Antichristian Sect, as is expressed in the sayd Prayer.</p>
            <p>Againe, as their <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Rebellion,</hi> so their <hi>faith</hi> is <hi>faction;</hi> as there is added. For proofe hereof, I referre the Reader to Doctor <hi>Crakenthorpe,</hi> Of the fifth generall Councell, Chapter 13. where hee learnedly prooveth, that [the Church of Rome holdeth no doctrine by faith. <hi>And this</hi> from the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> 10. wherein they layd another foundation, then Christ; the Popes words, in steed of Gods, and Antichrists in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of Christs. For before that Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> though they believed the same heresies and errours, yet it was because they thought the Scripture to bee the maine ground thereof: but in this Councell, they must believe all these things, because the Pope hath so resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and defined. So as though the Materialls of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were the same, yet the formality and foundation of their faith and Church was quite altered. So as from hence Papists are so truly called, from the Pope, as the prime Head, Rocke and foundation of their faith. For as wee make Christ and his Word, so they on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, make the Pope, that is to say, Antichrist and his word, the ground and foundation of faith. In regard whereof, as the faith and religion is from Christ, truely called Christian, and they truely Christians: So the faith and religion of the other is from the Pope, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, truely and properly called Papisme, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianisme, and the Professors of it Papists, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians. And the ground of all this is, because they hold the Popes judgement to bee Supreme and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and so build their faith on him, as on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7339:73"/>
thereof, which their owne Church never did, till the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth. It is not then the Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, but the Lyon of the Lateran Synod, who is the foundation of the faith of Papists, and from whom therefore they justly tooke their name of Papists, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them from true Christians, which from that time they have held to this day. And thus all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the present Roman Church, doe both erre, and are hereticks, and, which is the worst degree of heresy; are Papists, that is, Antichristian hereticks, not only holding, and that in the highest degree of pertinacy, those heresies which are contrary to the faith, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them upon that foundation, which quite overthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the faith.] thus and much more, this learned Dr. of our Church. So as here is a cleare demonstration, that the faith of all Papists at this day, is a Popish fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And our Homilies doe affirme So much. For in the Second part of the Homily for Whit-Sunday, we read thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THe true Church is, an universall congregation or fellowship of Gods faithfull and Elect people, built upon the foundation of the Apostles &amp; Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe Corner-Stone. And it hath alwayes three notes or markes whereby it is knowne: Pure and Sound Doctrine: the Sacraments ministred according to Christs holy institution: and the right use of Ecclesiasticall Discipline. Now if ye well compare this with the Church of Rome, not as it was in the beginning, but as it is presently, and hath been for the space of nine hundred yeares and odd: you shall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7339:73"/>
well preceive the state thereof to be so far wide from the nature of the true Church, that nothing can bee more. For neither are they built upon the foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Prophets, retaining the sound and pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ Iesus, neither yet doe they order the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or else the Ecclesiasticall Keyes in such sort, as he did first institute &amp; ordaine them. To be short, look what our Saviour Christ pronounced of the Scribes and Pharisees in the Gospell, the same may bee boldly, and with safe conscience pronounced of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> namely that they have forsaken and daily doe forsake the Commandements of God, to erect and set up their owne constitutions. Which thing being most true, as all they which have any light of Gods Word must needs confesse, wee may well conclude, according to the rule of <hi>Augustine,</hi> That the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, <note place="margin">Aug. contra Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>liani Donat. epist. cap. 4.</note> are not the true Church of Christ, much lesse then to be taken as chiefe heads and rulers of the same. Whosoever (saith hee) doe dissent from the Scriptures concerning the Head, although they be found in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the Church is appointed, yet are they not in the Church: a plaine place concluding against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Where is now the Holy Ghost, which they so stoutly doe claime to themselves? Where is now the Spirit of truth, that will not suffer them in any wise to erre: If it bee possible to bee there, where the true Church is not, then is it at <hi>Rome:</hi> otherwise it is but a vaine bragge and nothing else. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, the same is not his. And by turning the words, it may bee truly said: if any man bee not of Christ, the same hath not the Spirit. Now to discerne who are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7339:74"/>
truely his, and who not, wee haue this rule given us, that his sheepe doe alwayes heare his voice. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: Hee that is of God, heareth Gods voice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth, that the Popes in not hearing Christs voice, as they ought to doe, but preferring their owne Decrees before the expresse Word of God, doe plainly argue to the world, that they are not of Christ, not yet possessed with his Spirit. Also their intollerable pride sheweth the same, &amp;c.] So and much more the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherein, as it is plainely prooved, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no true Church of Christ, as being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another foundation, then the <hi>Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their owne Decrees before the Word of God, and so consequently, the Popish <hi>Faith</hi> is a meere <hi>Fiction:</hi> So let our Innovators well consider, whether they bee any members of the true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> that thus pleade for, and take part with the church of Antichrist, labouring by all meanes to bring her into favour againe with us, while they audaciously presume to alter the authentick Booke set forth, and commanded by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for publike and solemne Thankesgiving of our great deliverance on the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> from the Popish Powder-plot, as if neither their <hi>Religion</hi> were <hi>Rebellion,</hi> nor their <hi>faith Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Homily concludes thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>TO conclude,</hi> [Yee shall briefely take this short lesson, wheresoever ye find the spirit of arrogancy, &amp; pride, the spirit of envie, hatred, contention, cruelty, murder, extortion, witchcraft, necromancy, &amp;c. assure your selues, that there is the spirit of the Devill, and not of God, albeit they prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d outwardly to the world, never so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7339:74"/>
much holinesse. For as the Gospel teacheth us, the Spirit of Iesus is a good Spirit; an holy spirit, a sweet Spirit, a lowly Spirit, a mercifull Spirit, full of charity and love, full of forgivenesse and pity, &amp;c. The Rule that wee must follow, is this, to judge them by their fruits: which if they be wicked and naught, then is it vnpossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the tree of whom they proceed, should be good: Such were all the Popes and Prelates of Rome, for the most part, as doth well appeare in the Story of their lives, and therefore they are worthily, accounted among the number of false Prophets, and false Christs, which deceived the world a long while. The Lord of heaven and earth defend us from their tyranny and pride, that they never enter into his Vinyard againe, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of his seely poore flock: but that they may, be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly confounded and put to flight in all parts of the world: and he of his great mercy so worke in all mens hearts, by the mighty power of the holy Ghost, that the comfortable Gospell of his Sonne Christ may be truely preached, and truely followed in all places, to the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of sinne, death, the Pope, the Devill, and all the Kingdome of Antichrist, that like scattered &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed sheep, being at length gathered into one fold, we may in the end rest together in the bosome of Abraham, Isaak, and Iacob, there to be partakers of eternall and everlasting life through the merits and death of Iesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.] And of the like effect is that Prayer, which some of Romes factors have so alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, [Be thou still our mighty protector, and scatter our cruell enemies, which delight in blood: infatuate their Counsell, and root out that Babilonish and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sect, which say of Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Downe with it, Downe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7339:75"/>
with it, even to the ground. And to that end strengthen the hands of our gracious King, the Nobles and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the land with judgement and justice, to cutt off these workers of iniquity, whose religion is rebellion, whose faith is faction, whose practise is murthering of soules &amp; bodies, and to root them out of the confines &amp; limits of this Kingdome, that they may never prevaile against us, and triumph in the ruine of thy Church, and give us grace to avert these and the like judgements from us. This Lord wee earnestly crave at thy merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hands, together with the continuance of thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull protection over our dread Soveraigne, the whole Church, and these Realmes, and the conversion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of all implacable enemies, and that for thy deare Sons sake, our onely Mediator and Advocate.]</p>
            <p>Thus the conclusion &amp; prayer of the Homily, &amp; this Prayer of the 5. of <hi>Novem.</hi> being well weighed together, we see (unlesse in so praying we play the most notorious hypocrites &amp; dissemblers before God and men) in what a sacred bond all the Magistrates in the Land, from the highest to the lowest, do ingage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues unto the great God of heaven &amp; earth, to roote out the whole Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Sect of Iesuites and Seminary Priests, out of these confines &amp; limits of these Kingdomes, and not to suffer them to roost here, to the great dishonour of God, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of our Religion, danger to the State, &amp; destruction of the soules of Gods people, and of the Kings.

advancing of that Babilonish &amp; antichristian sect, which say of <hi>Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, down with it, down with it even to the ground:</hi> while they labour by all wayes and wiles, yea by an open Lawlesse force to beat downe the Kingdome of Christ in the Ministery of the word (as too lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience can witnesse) and to destroy all true religion, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, &amp; piety: then how doth it concerne our <hi>Gracious King, our Nobles and Magistrates of the Land, to strengthen their hands with judgement &amp; justice, to cut off these workers of iniquity, &amp; to root them out of the confines &amp; limits of this Kingdome, that they may never prevaile against us, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the ruine of the Church, by reducing vs under the Babylonian</hi> and Antichristian yoake againe, which they labour with might and maine to effect, as their notorious practises plainly tell us? And how should all the Kings good people in the Land make this their dayly prayer, which is publickly used once in the yeare, &amp; teach it to their children, that so at the least wise it may be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated intire to all posterity, &amp; so vindicated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, of time, which our Innovators would bring upon it: and never give over thus praying, till it shall please God to returne a gracious answere in the fulfilling of it?</p>
            <p>Yet are they not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent herewith, but (like themselves) they practise the like in the last Fast-booke, &amp; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings expresse Proclamation, which orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the booke for the former Fast to be reprinted and published, as it followeth.</p>
            <p>The third Prayer Booke, which they have pitifully mangled, is that, which was set forth by the King for that Publick Fast, in the first of his Raigne, for the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the great Plague of Pestilence, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> devoured many thousands in this City, &amp; elswhere in our Land: &amp;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7339:76"/>
which his late Proclamation commaundeth to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed and published, and so read in Churches every Wednesday. But doe they, or durst they alter that Booke, which the Kings Proclamation hath so lately commaunded to be reprinted and published? Yes, even that, and that in such wise, as I see not with what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant any Minister may read it, as being not according to the Proclamation. Now the Alterations in the new Booke bee these. In the first collect is left out this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable pious Sentence intirely, <note n="*" place="margin">This is one of those things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to me in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. O boldnes, to defend it.</note> 
               <hi>Thou hast delivered us from Superstition and Idolatry, wherein wee were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly drowned, and hast brought us into the most cleere and comfortable light of thy blessed Word, by the which wee are taught how to serve and honour thee, and how to live orderly with our neighbours, in truth and vertty.</hi> Lo, here, these men would not have Popery to bee called <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor would they have the Word of God to commended, as that cleare and comfortable light, which teacheth us all duties to God and man. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that collect which begins thus, <hi>It had beene the best for us, &amp;c.</hi> is wholly left out in the new Booke. And wot yee, why? Alas therein is commended the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table use of continuall preaching the Word of God; So as this collect would not have suited well with such a Fast, wherein all preaching is prohibited in all places infected. And in the very last page, <hi>Order for the Fast,</hi> these words are left out in the new Booke, <hi>To avoid the inconvenience that may grow by Fasting; Some esteeming it a meritorious worke: others a good worke, and of it selfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, without due regard of the end, &amp;c.</hi> What? Doe they <hi>esteeme</hi> their <hi>Fast a meritorious worke?</hi> Must the condemnation hereof bee expunged? And doe they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7339:76"/>
account their Fast a good worke, and of it selfe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, without due regard of the end? It seemes so too. For the end of a true Fast, is reformation of our evill wayes, as the King of <hi>Nineveb</hi> proclaimed, and which hee and his people performed. But these men (it <note place="margin">Ionah.</note> seemeth) have no such purpose, propound no such end to themselves, as the reformation of all their violent oppressions, and outragious tyrannizing over Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and people, to the utter overthrow of Religion; and setting up of Idolatry and Superstition in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; which one sinne alone is enough to bring the Pestilence, and all other plagues upon a Land.</p>
            <p>Beside these, they have guelded the Booke in sundry <note place="margin">These pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages also objected to me in their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> other particulars: as in the Collects, and Prayers for the Royall Progeny, they have left out the mention of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her children, expressed in the former booke. They have left out the collect for the Kings Navy, and for seasonable weather: whereas there was never more need to pray for seasonable weather, than since this fast beganne, when so many tempestuous stormes, and immoderate raines have beene, as have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered Ships in the very harbour, Shipwrackt some of great price, and caused great Floods, threatning a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, by drowning the Seed under the clods. Also sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Psalmes and Collects besides are omitted, and a whole passage in the Exhortation, applyable enough to the present occasion.</p>
            <p>Now whither it bee for these alterations, wherein both the Kings Order in his Proclamation is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and God is dishonoured, by leaving out such our humble acknowledgements, both of his mercies, in delivering us from <hi>Superstition and Idolatry, and bringing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7339:77"/>
us into the cleare and comfortable light of his blessed Word, and</hi> of our sinnes, in not hearkning to His Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>Preached</hi> unto us, and the like; and Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and people are abused, by having such Bookes thrust upon them, which they cannot with a safe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and good conscience use: or whether it bee, that in the Fast-day, all preaching is prohibited in all places whatsoever infected: Sure wee are, that God hath given us sad signes of the little pleasure hee takes by such a Fast. For the very first weeke of the Fast (whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sicknesse had a weekely decrease, and was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through Gods mercy, more and more to decline) what a sudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> terrible increase was there, of no lesse than 377. which was double to any weekes increase, since this Sicknesse began? Was there nothing in it, trow yee? was there not something in this Fast, wherewith God was so much displeased? Surely wee should be very bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and worse than heathenish, not to lay it to heart.</p>
            <p>But here the Prelates will perhaps quarrell mee, for <note place="margin">Without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> imputing any thing to the Fast, as being appointed by the King. I answer, God forbid, that I should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the least Sinister opinion of my gratious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, that hee had the least meaning by his Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to debarre and forbid Preaching of Gods Word in any place. And my reasons are these.</p>
            <p>First, because the Proclamation saith, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty <hi>propounds the example of pious Kings, in former ages, for his precedent in this Fast,</hi> who ever in all former ages not onely not restrained, but likewise allowed, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and commended Preaching, as a principall and necessary part of a publicke Fast, yea as the very life and soule of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:7339:77"/>
Secondly, because his Majesties Proclamation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds this <hi>so religious an exercise to be performed with all decency, and uniformity,</hi> which I humbly conceive cannot bee, when preaching is restrained in some, and those the most eminent and necessary places (as this great City in speciall) in respect whereof (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) this Fast was specially commaunded, and yet in other places allowed and prescribed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because the Proclamation relates, that his Majesty <hi>resolved upon a grave and Religious forme of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing thereof, straitly charging and commanding that this Fast bee religiously and solemnely observed, and celebrated weekly upon every Wednesday, throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> and therefore never intended (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) to restraine Preaching in any place, without which a publicke Fast cannot be <hi>gravely, religiously and solemnely observed, and celebrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because the Proclamation both directs and commaunds, <hi>that the booke of prayers for the Fast, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set forth by Authority, should be reprinted and published, and likewise used in all Churches and places at the publicke meetings of this Fast:</hi> now the booke formerly published by his Majesties authority in the first yeare of his Raigne, upon the like occasion, alloweth &amp; prescribeth two Sermons every Fast-day, as well in the City and suburbs of London, as in other places, whither infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or not; yea notwithstanding the infection was then far greater, and the Sommer season far more dangerous.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, because in all publicke and generall Fasts, both in his Majesties owne Raigne, his late Royall Fathers, <hi>Q. Elizabeths,</hi> and other his Royall Progenitors, upon this, or any other the like occasion, Preaching in all
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7339:78"/>
places without restraint, both fore-nooue and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, hath beene approved, and never prohibited, but injoyned and commaunded: now his Majesty hath often solne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly protested in his publicke Declarations (as before is mentioned) to all his Loving Subjects, that he will never give way to the licensing or authorizing of any thing, whereby ANY INNOVATION in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree might creepe into our Church: and therefore I humbly conceive, that his Majesty never intended to authorise to give way to such an innovation as this, to inhibit Preaching, and that in the time of a publicke Fast, contrary to all former Precedents.</p>
            <p>Therefore I verily believe, that this was a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise of the Prelates, by whose advise the Proclamation saith, his <hi>Maiesty resolved upon a grave and religious forme</hi> of <hi>Solemnizing a Fast.</hi> So as this of prohibiting Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was rather added by them than admitted by his Majesty, seeing it is (as I humbly conceive) neither a grave, nor religious forme of Solemnizing a Fast; and I had rather dye, than conceive such an opinion of my King, that he should be the author of such an inhibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the Season served, to have accesse unto his Majesty, I should in all humility, addresse my selfe humbly to petition his Majesty to take off this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint: And that for these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, because not only it is contrary to all Precedents in former ages, and such an innovation, as (I believe) the like was never heard, nor read of in the world: but also because it much dampes and deadens the hearts and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Kings loving and faithfull subjects within the City, who much lament and grieve, that in the Fast-day they are restrained of the spirituall Food of their soules,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7339:78"/>
when they desire and need it most, when as Preaching is likely to worke most good upon their soules, which stand in more need of spirituall Phisicke &amp; Phisicians, to cure the plague of their soules which hath brought the pestilence upon their bodies, than their bodies doe of corporall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because this restraint of Preaching (the chiefe meanes to humble men for and turne them from their sins, without which God will not turne from his wrath) will in all likelyhood procure the continuance of the plague, as the beginning of it brought in with it a lamentable increase that very week, as is before noted. Yea forbidding of the Word to be preached, brings the wrath of God upon a people to the uttermost, as 1. <hi>thes.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, because Preaching is no more dangerous on the Fast-day, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the Lords day, to increase infection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because upon prayer &amp; preaching the last great Fast, a greater plague than this was suddainly and miraculously remooved; yea though the preaching was continued in the heat of Summer.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, because this restraint, together with the sayd alterations of the Fast-booke, &amp; other innovatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the land foreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, doe fill the peoples minds with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies &amp; feares of an universall alteration of Religion.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, because (as the Prelates doe extend the letter of the Proclamation, if but one Parish in London, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs thereof, or but one house in that parish be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the pestilence thus continuing but in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and the Fast not ceasing, all Wednesday sermons in the whole City, must be suppressed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, because the restraint of preaching on the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7339:79"/>
Fast day, is (as we find by experience) a great prejudice and impediment to the free and liberall Collection for the poore, which is recommended in the Fast, in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous &amp; necessitous time, wherein the Plague brings with it a Sore famine upon many thousand families, which before this Sicknesse lived in good fashion, and were able to give reliefe to the poore. For no where, and at no time, are mens hearts more inlarged, and hands extended in bounty to the poore, than where Gods word hath bene &amp; is most powerfully &amp; plentifully preached, as this our City may serve for a precedent and proofe. And for this very cause (were there no more) Preaching was never more necessary in this City, than at this time, which doth so swarme with multitudes of poore, who without some present competent reliefe must needs perish, &amp; so would heape upon this City yet greater Sins, which is ready to sinck under the heavie burthens both of Sins and Plagues.</p>
            <p>I might note againe, as an 8. reason, that great &amp; extraordinary increase the very first weeke of the Fast, together with most hideous stormes, fearfull and foule weather, immoderate raine, ever since it began, God testifying by his reviving and renewing of the Plague, &amp; by the sad and black countenance of the skies, and those many great losses both by Sea &amp; Land, that he abhorres such a Fast, as of which his very judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Speak, <hi>Call you this a Fast?</hi> Yea also a 9. reason, because according to the Prelates practise, this Fast is made a meere <note n="*" place="margin">This also objected to me in the Article of High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</note> mock Fast, wherein God is mocked to the face. For doe the Prelates propose this, as the principall end of their Fast, to breake off their violent and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall proceedings against Gods Ministers, and so
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7339:79"/>
against the State of Religion? I feare it. And so long let us never look for any good issue of this Fast, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther further judgements to be powred upon the Land.</p>
            <p>For these reasons (I say) I could wish with all my heart to be an humble Petitioner to the King, who I am perswaded would speedily hearken to such a request, and would certainly answere, that it was never his mynd, that Preaching should be in this Fast prohibited. The king prohibit Preaching? Noe, noe; we all see who they be that prohibit Preaching, even those that labour tooth and nayle to Suppresse Preaching, and lay snares to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap all painfull Preachers, as the pressing of the booke for Sports for instance; they being not content, that the booke be read by the Curate, but the <note n="*" place="margin">As in the case of Mr. Valentine.</note> Incumbent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe must read it, or els abide extremity, as Suspension from his Ministry, Excommunicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the Church, Sequestration from his living, and Ecclesiasticall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the great crying Sinne of this Land at this day.</p>
            <p>But I will add no more. So as the <hi>Ninivites</hi> shall rise in judgement against this generation: for they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion of <hi>Ionas</hi> preaching, proclaimed a Fast, and reformed their lives, and their violent dealing: but these men under pretence of a Fast (as <hi>Iezebel</hi> did to devoure <hi>Naboths</hi> vinyard) would devoure Christs Vinyard, while they Suppresse the Preaching of the Word, whereby men should be convinced of their Sinnes, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, and bring forth good fruits of the Vine; and thereby harden their necks against the Lord, and strengthen their hands in violence to fill up their sinnes allway.</p>
            <p>The sixt Innovation, is about the meanes of the knowledge of God, and of the Mistery of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7339:80"/>
That may be verified of many Prelates in these dayes, which Christ charged the Pharisees with all, <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, for yee shut vp the Kingdome of heaven against men; for yee neither goe in your selues, neither suffer yee them that were entring to goe in:</hi> Matth. 23. 13. Which in Luke 11. 52. is expressed thus, <hi>Ye take away the Key of Knowledge.</hi> And doe not our Prelates thus, when they hush and silence all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in whole Diocesse? When they suppresse, and cut short Preaching all they can? When they lay snares to muzzle Gods Ministers, that they may not Preach? When they disgrace and traduce Preaching, calling it in scorne, Sermonizing? When they forbid Ministers to use any prayer before their Sermons, but that bare and barren forme of words in the Canon, wrapping all <note place="margin">* Treatise of the Sabbath See Bispop Wrens Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. All these particulars objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mee in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> up in the Lords Prayer? When they must use no Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all after the Sermon, but come downe, and read a second or third Service at the Altar, where in great Churches halfe the people cannot heare a word? When they must not preach at all in the Afternoone upon the Lords dayes? When they must onely Catechise for halfe an hower, and that, not by expounding the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion (which may well be called the Key of Knowledge, which they take away) but onely by the bare questions &amp; answeres in the booke, teach the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren like Parats, so as they can never come to give a reason of their fayth with understanding?

Thus they labour tooth and nayle to cry downe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.

            <p>The Seventh innovation, is in the rule of faith: for whereas the sole and complete rule of faith, is the Holy Scripture, as. 2. Tim. 3. Our new Doctors cry up the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Church, to wit, of the Prelates, to be our only guides in Divinity; as in <hi>Reeves</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion booke

            <p>And here I cannot forget a speech of the chiefest Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of <hi>England,</hi> in the High Commission, who at the censure of Doctor <hi>Bastwicke,</hi> for oppugning the Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Bishops <hi>jure divino,</hi> as being no where found in the Scripture, but the contrary, sayd openly, that in matters of divinity wee are not tyed to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to the Vniversall Catholicke Church in all ages; for how, (said hee) shall wee know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but by the Church. And therefore not without some reason doth that Iesuite (in his Pamphlet printed in English, 1636, intituled <hi>A Direction to bee observed by N.

Behold here now, Protestant Reader, what testimony a Iesuite can give of the present state of our Church, and that out of his owne reading and observation, and which we our selves cannot deny; all which hee ascribeth to the Prelates, as those whom hee indigitates for men of <hi>greatest worth, learning, &amp; authority,</hi> who declare their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations; as <hi>Sodome</hi> her sinnes, and hide them not, even our enemies, now their friends being witnesses, who gladly feed their infants with the pappe of our new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisme.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our particular point of Innovation concerning the rule of faith, which our Prelats have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off from the holy Scripture, to the authority of the Church: this is the maine upshot in Dr. <hi>Whites</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Sabbath day, wherein he tyes the observation of the Lord, day to that limitation, which the Prelates of the Church doe, or shall prescribe; &amp; so also all other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7339:83"/>
matters of Religion. And doe they not also overthrow the Scriptures, as the rule of faith, in that they restraine the preaching of them to their illiberall allowance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting such and such points to be medled with; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is shewed? &amp; doe they not place the Communion booke as a rule of faith in all matters of Religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Arch-Bishops definitive sentence must deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, as <hi>Recv.</hi> ibid. p. 206.</p>
            <p>The 8th innovation or Change, is in the rule of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: which rule, must not be any more the word of Christ, and the writings and examples of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, wherein they followed Christ; for that is counted too precise and puritanicall: but our Prelates have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed a new rule of Christian manners, to wit, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their owne lives, and the dictates of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; the Summe whereof is, to make a mixed Religion &amp; conversation of Christians, which is partly holy in an external forme of godlinesse, without the power thereof &amp; partly in admitting, allowing, approving, applauding countenancing, and dispensing by Episcopall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of a heathenish kinde of life, and that especially in most Sacred times, as the Lords day; which though dedicated wholly to the worship and service of God, yet the rule of the Sanctification hereof; which is the 4th Commaundement, and the example of Christs and his Apostles, these novellers do altogether reject, as abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, &amp; instead thereof advance their new Traditions, which is to allow one part of the Day for God, and the rest to mans carnall Lusts, Sin, the world, the Devil, as our Homily Saith. So as the due observation and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Lords day, being a platforme and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of a Christian Conversation, a Christian being
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7339:83"/>
that in his whole life, in a proportion, which he is on the Lords day; and this platforme being defaced and broken by our Anti-Sabbatarians: it followeth that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their impions crying downe of the 4th Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and so accordingly the due Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day intire, without mixture of heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enish. Sports and Pastimes, they deface and destroy the very face, beauty &amp; power of all religion, &amp; so do set up a new Forme of it, never allowed of (as by a Law) in the world, before. And herein doe our Apostates out strip the very Pontificians themselves who did never yet mak a Law, nor take upon them to allow any other rule of Christian life, than the Scriptures; although they have (with our innovators) denyed the Scripture to be the onely and absolute rule of faith, independent upon any humain power.

Edw. 6. his raigne alledged by the adverse Advocates, &amp; it passed for Currant, none gain-saying it. But as for those Rites &amp; Ceremonies to be used in our Church, they are by an Act of Parliament (prefixed to the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke) restrained to those only, which are expressed in the same booke; and if any, by private authority, shall presume to introduce into practise any other besides these, he is to suffer imprisonment for a time, and if he persist, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall imprisonment, and losse of all his spirituall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions during his life.</p>
            <p>But besides all this, these men have one speciall San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturary
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7339:84"/>
to fly unto, &amp; that is, their Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where they may lay hold upon the hornes of their Altars. These be their old high places not remooved. These, as they are commonly used, bee the ancient dennes of these old Foxes to which they flie, being this pursued; of whom the Scripture saith, <hi>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that spoile the Vines:</hi> These bee those nests and nurceries of Superstition and Idolatry, wherein the old Beldame of Rome hath nuzzled up her brood of Popelings, and so preserved her <hi>usum Sarum</hi> in life to this very day. And now these are be come impregnable bulworkers to patronize our Re-builders of <hi>Babell,</hi> in all their innovations. Innovations, Say they? Wee bring in no innovations, no new rites, but what hath beene in use ever since the Reformation, and that in the most eminent Places, even the Mother <hi>Churches</hi> of the Land. Now all that wee goe about, is to reduce inferiot chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to an unity, and conformity to their Mother <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> So as thus bringing all to unity, wee shall take off that reproach, which the adversaries cast upon us in this kinde; and which wee shall then retort upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for their diffentions betweene their Regulars and Seculars. Thus doe our Master-builders plead, and so by their cunning insinnuations, under a pretence of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace, of unity, and uniformity, preaching peace, peace, when nothing but warre is in their heart &amp; hand, (as Psal. 55. 21. and 59. 7.) doe so farre prevaile, that before wee bee aware, they will by this meanes pretrily reduce us to a perfect peace and unity with old Mother Rome againe.</p>
            <p>For these Mother <hi>Churches,</hi> to which all Danghter. <hi>Churches</hi> must conforme, are they not the naturall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7339:85"/>
daughters of <hi>Rome?</hi> Doe they not from top to toe exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resemble her? Her pompous Service, her Altars, Palls, Copes, Crucifixes, Images, superstitious gestures, and Postures, all instruments of musicke (as at the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of Babylons Image) Long Babylonish Service, so bellowed and warbled out, as the heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are but little the wiser. Are not these high Places also the receptacles and nurceries of a number of idle bellies, to say no worse? Doe not the fat Prebends So cramme their Residenciaries, that the while their starveling Flocks in the countrey doe famish for want of spirituall Food? But as <hi>Erasnius</hi> said of <hi>Luther,</hi> how his fault was, that he meddled with the Popes Miter, and the Monkes bellies. But this I note by the way, to show how all those, that are maintained by Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls, are ingaged to helpe forward those Innovations that are now on foot, because they make much for the supporting of their Papall Pompe.</p>
            <p>But let us a little examine what force there is in this Argument: Cathedralls are so and so: therefore all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches must conforme to them. I deny the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>Legibus vivendum est, non exemplis.</hi> We must live by lawes, not by examples. The rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of all our Churches are prescribed, and precisely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the Lawes of the Land, by Act of Parliament, and are not left at large to the Example of Cathedralls. Nay, how comes it about, that Cathedralls have usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that Lawlesse and boundlesse Liberty of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themselves to <hi>Rome</hi> in all those their ceremonies?

To what end then shall men send their Sons to the Universities, if there they must be trained up to the Superstition, and Idolatrie, of Popery.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how unlike our Cathedrals be to that they were formerly, being newly set out with a Romish dresse, according to those Spirits which rule in the ayre: so as their examples ought to be no Lawes to bring in an universall conformity to these yesterday innovations, in Mother-Cathedrals.</p>
            <p>Againe, by what title doe Cathedrals came to be Mothers to other Churches? what Mothers? Except Step-Mothers.

            <p>And besides all this, in the last place, being pulled away from the hornes of their Cathedrall Altars, as not able to shelter them from their pursuers, they fly (as to their last refuge, and most impregnable Fort, as they conceive) to the Kings Chappell.

So our Innovators getting closse to the King, as unto the rock, assimiling themselves to the manners of the Court, when the fishes think to fynd shelter and protection, under the Rocke, they are ready with their fangs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and devour them. Well, what say they of the Kings Chappell? They plead the whole equipage, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and fashion thereof, as a patterne for all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. There (say they) is an Altar, there bowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, there Crucifixes, there Images, &amp; other guises. And why should Subject, be wiser then the King? <hi>Totus componitur orbis Regis ad exemplum.</hi>

            <p>To this I answere: 1. Why should subjects think to compare with the King in the State of his royall Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Chappell? 2ly there be many things in the Kings Chappell which were presumption to have in ordinary Churches, and some things cannot be had or maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, as a quire of Gentlemen, Singing men, &amp; other Choristers, which dayly sing Service in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; and sundry, other. 3ly. The worship and service of God, and of Christ, is not to be regulated by humaine examples, but by the Divine rule of the Scriptures. In

vaine they worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandements of men. The three children would not bow to the Kings goodly golden Image. The old Christians would not so much, as offer incense in the presence of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperors Altar, and at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, though he propounded, golden rewards to the doers, and menaced fiery punishments to the denyers. 4ly, The externall rites and ceremonies in the Church are limited by Act of Parliament, prefixed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke, and no more to be added or used in Churches. Lastly, Suppose (which we trust never to see, &amp; which our hearts abhorre once to imagine) Masse were set up in the Kings Cappell; is this a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: why it should be admitted in all the Churches throughout the Realme of England. But enough of this. And here an end for this time; and thus farre of this text, which as I began, so I will conclude with all, My Son, feare thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change. For their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity shall rise suddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</p>
