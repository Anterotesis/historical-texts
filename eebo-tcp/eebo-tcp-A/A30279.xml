            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Foot of the foregoing
Chapter, is the Head of this.
The ſame Precepts which
there conclude, do here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
Being of extraordinary moment,
they are reſumed and farther preſſed.
Few Words may ſuffice for Mint and
Aniſe; but the weightier Things of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:30770:5"/>
Religion, as they are more oppoſed,
muſt be more urged.</p>
            <p>Weighty indeed are theſe Precepts;
great be the <hi>Duties</hi> required, and great
the <hi>Sins</hi> forbidden.</p>
            <p>The Duties, are Imitation of God
in our Love unto Offending Men.
And, Conformity to our Redeemer
in the Kindneſs of our Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. The Heavenly Father
multiplies to pardon; and ſo muſt
we, if we will be his Children. It
is ſaid of him, <hi>Who is a God like unto
thee that pardoneth Iniquity?</hi> And it
ſhould be ſaid of us, <hi>What People are
like unto you that forgive one another,
as God forgiveth you?</hi> Our bleſſed
Redeemer laid down his Life for
us; and looks that, at his Call, we
give our Lives for each other, I <hi>John</hi>
3. 16. <hi>His Love paſſeth all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi>
and ours is not right, till
<hi>it</hi> ſet the World marvelling at it.
<hi>This is the Goſpel, where-ever be the
Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:30770:5"/>
The Sins forbidden, are the mighty
ones following; <hi>Fornication and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs;</hi>
the Hecticks than conſume,
and carry apace from the deep Ditch
into the bottomleſs Pit. <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
the Wen and Wolf in the Heart,
more painful and mortal than any
in the Fleſh. <hi>Filthineſs,</hi> or <hi>filthy
Speaking;</hi> the <hi>Ileos,</hi> the <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi>
the Diſeaſe which brings up the
worſt of Excrements through the
Mouth; which vomits. the Ordure
of Ribaldry. <hi>Fooliſh Talking;</hi> the
Rupture of Speech from Reaſon:
Language, like to that of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs,
without Reaſon; and much worſe,
becauſe againſt it alſo, Laſtly, <hi>Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Jeſting;</hi> the falling Sickneſs of
Wit; it's Phrenzy, and Sportiveneſs
in Games of pernicious Folly. Theſe,
all, are of the ſame baſe Blood; all,
with the ſame rare Emphaſis, and
ſelf-ſame Arguments prohibited.</p>
            <p>Theſe we are commanded, <hi>Not
once to name;</hi> that is, to abhor unto
extremity; utterly to deteſt. So the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30770:6"/>
Royal Pſalmiſt, and ſo our Apoſtle
elſewhere, is known to have uſed this
pungent Phraſe of <hi>Not naming,</hi> Pſal.
16. 4. 1 Cor. 5. 1. Of theſe we are
told, <hi>They become not Saints;</hi> that is,
they are not only in themſelves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Things; but are, in all
Eyes, as unſeemly ones for Saints, as
Feeding on Carrion and Lodging in
Kennels would be for Kings Children.
It is added, They are <hi>Inconvenient;</hi>
that is, Intolerable; though the Men
of <hi>Athens</hi> ſaw nothing very culpable
in ſome of them, and fancied there
was a Spirit very commendable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
In ſhort, They are peſtilent
Vices, and inconſiſtent with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Graces. Indeed Pagan Moraliſts
made ſome of them to be egregious
Vertues, and the reſt to be but very
ſmall Faults. But the Goſpel of Chriſt
makes them ſuch Vices, as not only
ſtrip us of every Ornament, but of
our very Raiment. And leave us
nothing but Shame and Nakedneſs of
our unſanctified Natures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:30770:6"/>
Hugely do Men differ from Swine
in their Natures and Dignities; but
no leſs do Saints differ from unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Men in their Qualities and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
A Saint hath paſſed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Birth. After Redemption by
infinite Price, he is regenerated by
infinite Power: Made Partaker of the
Divine Nature, and adopted into the
Favour and Family of Heaven. In
a word; He is one dearly cleanſed,
and richly adorned. More than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth is worth, hath been
laid out to Juſtify and Sanctify him.
Wherefore, if he be ſick to ſee, what
ſenſual Creatures are ſick of Luſt
to enjoy; if he be aſhamed of their
Glory; if their Meat be his Poiſon;
it is no more matter of wonder, than
that Doves will die rather than fetch
Meat from the Dung and Filth, in
which unclean Birds delight.</p>
            <p>It is the Filth of the two laſt
named Vices, <hi>Fooliſh Talking and
Jeſting,</hi> that I eſſay to diſcover. The
Snakes which lay in the Dunghils
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30770:7"/>
of the other, are more in ſight;
and are of leſs ſpecious Colours.
Inſomuch, that until they do get
them Cloven-feet, Men attain not
unto obſcene Tongues. Much leſs
do they further violate the Seventh
Commandment. But, ſadly it muſt
be ſaid; the Sins which I ſet me
to detect and ſhame, are gotten into
univerſal Uſe, and almoſt Catholick
Credit alſo. Their Dunghil is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with the Snow, which I ſhall
labour to remove. Their Serpents
paſs for Fiſh, even in Religious Mens
Markets.</p>
            <p>To give the worſt its due; Our
Age it ſelf doth not, by a general
Vote, abrogate all the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
It runs not down every
Divine Teſtimony, with a <hi>Nemine
Contradicente.</hi> There are Laws made
void by many looſe Profeſſors, which
are valiantly (that is, practically)
propugnated by their Betters. But
the Law againſt Fooliſh Talking and
Jeſting, ſeems utterly repealed among
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30770:7"/>
us. <hi>No Man ſtands by it; All Men
forſake it.</hi> It is one, <hi>Every where
ſpoken againſt.</hi> One that ſuffers in
the Houſe of its Friends; yea, by
the Tongue of Men and Angels. I
mean, by many conſecrated Tongues
of the Angels of the Churches.
Tongues, commiſſioned and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

well deſerves to be every Chriſtian's
Obſervation:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fooliſh Talking and Jeſting muſt be
deteſted as things ungodly, unſeemly,
and intolerable in Saints.</hi> As truly
ſo, as Fornication arid Uncleanneſs, as
Covetouſneſs and Filthineſs; of whoſe

not be able to gainſay, or reſiſt! <hi>In
Faith and Hope, I proceed.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>§. 1. What is Fooliſh Talk?</head>
               <p>The <hi>Nature</hi> of it, is not far to
ſeek. All the World will grant,
Folly is Sin; and Sin is Inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Precept and Example of
our Soveraign Prince and Pattern.
Unto us, Chriſt Jeſus is both; and
the Speech which he hath required
and exemplified, is ſuch as honoureth
God and profiteth Men. Thereby
anſwering the unqueſtionable Ends
of ſo rare a Gift unto our Mature.
Thereby ſerving the Uſes for which
Speech was framed, and to which it
is fitted. So that Fooliſh Talk is all,
and only that, which is not deſigned
and adapted unto the foreſaid Ends
and Uſes. But thwarts the ſame;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30770:8"/>
contradicts our Saviour's Example, and
tranſgreſſeth his Law. Of ſuch Talk,
<hi>Nabal is the Name,</hi> in Chriſt's School:
That <hi>Folly is with it,</hi> his Diſciples
will atteſt. Unthinking Creatures do
fancy it to be harmleſs; but none of
theſe can hold it guiltleſs. <hi>This
Tranſgreſſion of Talkative Men ſaith
within their Hearts, that there is not
a juſt Fear of God before their Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Kinds</hi> of this Fooliſh Talk,
are numerous and various: Even as
the Follies of Thought and Action,
whereto they run parallel. A Sermon
is too ſmall a Map to hold their
wide World. But theſe Particulars
will ſet in view the moſt principal.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Profane Talk is fooliſh.</hi> It is
Profane, whatever mentioneth Things
ſacred, <hi>without Veneration expreſſed.</hi>
Whatever makes not its Honours, and
its higheſt ones, unto their Majeſty.
Who, but a Fool, will either not bow
to the King; or, no lower than unto
one of his Pages? It is a ſenſeleſs
Babler, that talks of holy Perſons,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30770:9"/>
Things or Actions, without hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Names: Without paying
them their due Obſervance, by ſome
or other Emphaſis. If I ſpeak of
them as a <hi>Gallio,</hi> I do make my ſelf
an <hi>Eſau!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Profaneneſs more groſs, when
<hi>Scurrility is added to Sacrilege.</hi> When
Veneration is ſacrilegiouſly withheld,
and Injury and Indignity is offered.
Indignity, of wretched Tendence to
ſubvert the Faith of Hearers; and to
impair their Reverence. When un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed
Lips drop no Praiſes, but
pour out Slights, upon Religion or
its Votaries. He is a more grown
<hi>Eſau,</hi> that dares thus to do. A <hi>Gallio</hi>
is a younger Brother to ſuch a Scorner.
And if ſuch Talkers muſt paſs for
wiſe Men, <hi>Senacherib</hi> muſt be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
for a <hi>Saint;</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> be
no more called <hi>Mad. Plato,</hi> like as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
adjudged to Death ſuch Fools.
And the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtick not to kill the
Man, that preſumes to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> or the <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30770:9"/>
The words of Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> are very
Sun-beams; <hi>A Devout Heathen is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a Profane Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed there is a Pitch of Profaneneſs
to which not one <hi>Eſau</hi> of many hath
uſed to grow. One which I was
minded therefore in ſilence to paſs
over. But ſecond thoughts allow it
not; the numbers of thoſe profane
<hi>Anakims</hi> and <hi>Giants,</hi> being as we ſee
in this day of ours.</p>
               <p>Profane to the uttermoſt is that <hi>Talk,
which throws Stones as well as Dirt.</hi>
Venteth Wrath as well as Contempt,
upon that which is Holy. Breathes
forth Threatnings againſt Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
with Scoffs at Divine Attributes,
and Statutes. Words turned indeed
into Swords; and ſent out for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
not for the ſingle Diſgrace,
of God's Servants and Service. He
who thus Talks, is the <hi>Goliah</hi> of the
Profane Hoſt; the Prince of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
of Devils in Fleſh, the <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub.</hi>
A more Profane Riot, no Tongue
can run. Here it muſt ſtand, having
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30770:10"/>
no further to go. Unleſs it be in
Glorying in this Shame; in Boaſting,
that the Conſpiracy of Stupidity and
Malice have carried it ſo far. And,
left nothing ſave Hell more profoundly
Deviliſh, or bloodily fighting againſt
Heaven! <hi>Thou lovest all devouring
words, O thou Profane Tongue! God
ſhall likewiſe deſtroy thee for ever; he
ſhall take thee away, and pluck thee out
of thy Dwelling place, and root thee out
of the Land of the Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Hypocritical Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> A
Hypocrite, is a Liar, in a Cloud, by
his Ambition raiſed. It is Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Talk, that deſignedly miſreports
the Speaker's Heart. That ſpeaks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than he thinks, of his State, his
Diſpoſitions, his Aims, his Actions,
or any thing that is his. If this be
not Folly, then Darkneſs excelleth
Light; the Sun is an annoyance to
the World; and Owls and Thieves
are Wiſe, for hating the Light of
it. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30770:10"/>
                  <hi>Truth is Light, Falſehood is Darkneſs.</hi>
The Fountain of Truth hath taken
the Name of Light; and the Father
of Lies is called the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And is he a wiſe Speaker, who
is likeſt to the Devil, and moſt unlike
to God, in his Words? Likeſt to the
Devil, that hath no Truth in him;
and Unlikeſt to God that cannot lie,
and whoſe Word is the Word of
Truth. Were it a matter of choice;
who would not rather be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into the uglieſt Serpent in <hi>Africa</hi>
than into ſuch a Monſter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drunkenneſs corrupts not Reaſon,
more than Falſeneſs corrupteth Speech;</hi>
both deſtroy God's Work, as to its
proper Uſe. And where is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the one or other Confuſion?
Tiplers, make Beaſts of Men; Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers,
do of Men make Devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In ſpeaking unto our Maker, Feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Words are the worſt Indignities and
Affronts</hi> we can offer. To bely our
ſelves in Prayer, is to blaſpheme him
to his Face. With open Mouth to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30770:11"/>
tell him, our Hearts be not naked and
open to him. Now Men that are
themſelves, uſe to beware of their
Words unto earthly Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for Humane Converſe, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Talk is its Bane and Death.</hi> Much
it deſtroyeth, all it corrupteth. Who
will converſe with one whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
credit? or who will believe a
Liar, even when he ſpeaks Truth?
The Mute and Dumb are more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable
Company, than Men falſe
and deceitful. Which, as other Snakes,
under their faireſt Skins, all People
do hate; even thoſe whom they reach
not to hurt. And juſtly; for it is the
<hi>Nature</hi> of both to miſchieve us, if it
be not in their <hi>Power.</hi> What is Life,
without Converſe? and what is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
without Sincerity? He that
conſiders both, ſhall think it to be
wiſely and kindly that God baniſheth
diſſembling Lips. And as cruelly
and fooliſhly, that any Man recals
and uſes them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30770:11"/>
                  <hi>Where dwells the Man that deſires
not in his heart, to have all the Town
take his Word?</hi> Hypocrites, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
when they are Unbelieved;
and yet no Man that knows them
can Believe them. Wiſe Men, are
they not? to Deſire perfect Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities;
<hi>i. e.</hi> the Eternal concealment
of Lies, or inward belief of revealed
ones. It is not the way of the Wiſe,
to ſail Eaſt, when they would land
in the Weſt. To directly-oppoſe their
own Deſires; as they notoriouſly do,
whoſe Tongues run in Diſſimulation,
while their Hearts luſt after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of Veracity.</p>
               <p>In ſhort; <hi>Men of the falſeſt Tongues
would have nothing but very Truth put
into their own ears.</hi> But, doth Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
either reject ought but Evil,
or embrace the practice of ought but
Good? Hypocritical Talk is Innocent,
or Harmful; if Innocent, why Angry
with other Men for it? if Injurious,
what makes the uſe of it Yours?
Every Man that uſes it, is Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:30770:12"/>
No doubt but <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo, when
he preſſed <hi>David</hi> to fight the Lord's
Battels; to the end that he might
be ſlain by one or other of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Sons</hi> were ſo, when
they expreſſed Zeal for Religion;
vaunted, that none but Men of their
Faith, ſhould be taken into their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
but deſigned only to make
way for the Swords, wherewith they
cut the knot of the Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their Siſter's Marriage. <hi>Jezabel</hi>
was ſo, when ſhe called for a Faſt,
for an After-meal of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Eſtate
and Life. <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo; and ſo was
his Succeſſor, <hi>Julian,</hi> when he Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
(what the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
calls) his <hi>Play of
Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. l. 3.</note> Plainly; ſo
are we all, as oft as
our Speech is with Diſſimulation. As
oft as our Tongues deliver falſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of our Minds. Yea, though they
truly enough do repreſent the Things
we ſpeak of. As oft as we ſpeak
for God deceitfully; and contend for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30770:12"/>
our holy Faith, unfaithfully. Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to win but the Praiſe of Men,
or the Peace of our own Minds;
which are madly got, when ſtollen by
Lies. Briefly,</p>
               <p>A Lie is the utmoſt Corruption of
Speech; Deviation from its principal
Service; Violation of the Original
and principal Law laid upon it. The
Tongue's part being not ſo much to
deliver what things really are, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is no Judg; as to declare what
the Speaker verily thinks of them in
his Mind, whereof it is a Witneſs.
And the moſt perfect Truth is a Lie
in a Hypocrite's Mouth; when, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Believing it himſelf, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to have others Believe it, he
ſets it forth with a falſe Profeſſion
of both. Which Falſity, his own
Heart tells him, is of ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity:
So great, that it turneth
Words of Hony into Gall, of Wine
into Poiſon, of Holineſs into Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
An aweful Thought, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30770:13"/>
thy to be conſidered! Naturaliſts
reckon Elephants and Camels among
Wild Beaſts, though they do the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Tame ones; becauſe their
Nature is Wild. Caſuiſts determine
Hypocrites to be Liars, though they
fill their Mouths with choiceſt Truths;
becauſe there is no Truth in their
Inward-Parts. <hi>Remove from me the
way of Lying, and grant me thy Law
graciouſly,</hi> is Wiſe Mens Common
Prayer.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Raſh Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> That is
Raſh, wherein, the Tongue out-runs
the Wit. Or, if Wit doth indeed Sail,
yet Judgment doth not Steer. Though,
of our whole Man, except but only
the Heart, it is the Tongue that
moſt of all wants Government. So
vaſt are the Benefits or Miſchiefs that
it is apt to Produce. With ſo much
greater Eaſe and Speed, than our
Hands and Feet, it doth haſten to
produce them; and ſo much more
Indefatigably. So very difficultly is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30770:13"/>
it brought to Good-Behaviour; and ſo
palpable a miſtake is our Proverb,
that <hi>Good words coſt nothing.</hi> Lions
being as ſoon made to draw Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
quietly, as our Tongues to ſpeak
inoffenſively. So very difficultly alſo
are they reſtrained from Evil; no
Bears or Tygers more needing to be
kept within Rails, and in Chains.
Perpetually is the Tongue preſented
with Temptations, which ſute its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Propenſions; All <hi>Perſons</hi> are
Tempters. If High, to Flatter them;
if Low, to Inſult over them; if Kind,
to Idolize them; if Croſs, to Rage
againſt them. And all <hi>Things</hi> are
Temptations; Proſperity, to Boaſt;
Adverſity, to Murmur; Grateful things,
to be Laviſh in their Praiſes; Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ones, to be as Prodigal of harſh
Cenſures. And, what! are they the
Wiſe in Heart, that let ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
go without a Guard? The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, if any of the Subjects
of God's Kingdom, needeth his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream,
and our Subordinate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30770:14"/>
Unnatural it is; the Natural Uſe
is changed, when the Tongue leaps
before the Mind looks. Brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
will not ſo rebel againſt their
Natures; they open their Eyes e're
they ſtir their Feet or Wings. Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
than we are, whoſe Tongues
gallop with the Eye-lids of our Minds
ſhut. Unleſs Wiſdom it be, and
Reaſon, to put off Nature.</p>
               <p>If it be any, it's one full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety;
and contrary to the Author
and Lord of Nature. He that Speaks
as he Spits, what comes next,
and Talks without the uſe of his
Underſtanding, he Talks without the
Fear of his God: And as truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Law, as Nature. Nor is any
Thank owing unto his Care, if all
the Commands of the firſt Table be
not broken by his haſte. The Raſh
Talker puts it to the adventure;
and interpretatively ſays, He will
loſe his God rather than his Word.
How mad a Choice? But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:30770:14"/>
Neither is Unadviſed Talk more
againſt Piety, than againſt Juſtice
and Charity. An ever-flowing Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Iniquity it is. For ſeldom
is it other than Injurious; as either
<hi>Falſe,</hi> robbing Auditors of Truth;
or <hi>Contumelious,</hi> robbing them of
the Honour due to them; or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Felonious,</hi> robbing them of
Money; or <hi>Slanderous,</hi> robbing them
of their good Name; or ſomeway
<hi>Tedious,</hi> robbing them of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
at the leaſt, <hi>Vain,</hi> and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
them of invaluable Time. A
wretched Folly, thus to Plunder and
Devour Men raſhly, without any
End; or, if any, the worſt that
can be propoſed! It would be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſidered alſo, That,</p>
               <p>The Raſh Talker is not any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Felon more than <hi>de ſe.</hi> His
Sin doth, moſt mercileſly of all, rob
himſelf. While it Scratches other
Men, it Stabs him. Much from them
it Steals, but himſelf out-right it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:30770:15"/>
Kills. His Raſh Licentious Talk,
murders all Wiſe Mens reſpect unto
his Name. Deſtroys their Credit to
his very Deliberate Words. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounds the Peace of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Cuts the very Throat of all
his juſt Comfort. Perfectly ſlays his
Friendſhip with Men of Worth and
Repute. Makes his Tongue worſe
than none; in the Apoſtle's Phraſe,
<hi>Dead while it Lives.</hi> Gives Death to
his Underſtanding, the Guide of Life;
which no longer lives in us than it
leads us. finally, It is a Mortal
Self-Pollution of his blind Will and
Affections; which take an infamous
Rot, when Judgment ceaſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
and regulate them: as, in
Talk that is Raſh, it perpetually
doth. Surely, this is <hi>no Wiſdom that
can be Juſtified of her Children.</hi> If it
be any, it is moſt <hi>Earthly;</hi> yea, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi>
and <hi>Deviliſh.</hi> They that do
make it their Cuſtom, do firſt make
their Conſciences take abundance of
Opium. <hi>I have Purpoſed that my
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30770:15"/>
Mouth ſhall not Offend,</hi> Pſal. 17. 3. <hi>Set
a Watch, O Lord, before my Mouth;
Keep thou the door of my Lips,</hi> Pſal.
141. 3.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſutable Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> What
is not aptly tempered for them to
whom it is miniſtred. Talk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
proper Argument, Language, and
Method, are not ſelected. Wherein
the Talker becometh not all things
unto all Men. Wherein he treats
New-born Babes with Strong Meat;
and Strong Men with ABC, and Milk.
Paints the Glaſs of his Language, to the
loſt of Light, among the Unlearned
that do need brighteſt Sunſhine: and
neglects Decency it ſelf, in his Speech
unto the Judicious. Talk, wherein
Superiors are not entertained with
condecent Reverence; Equals, with
Affability; Inferiors, with Courteſy;
all Men, with Diſcretion, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Modeſty. Proſperous Men,
with Congratulation; Afflicted ones
with Compaſſion; and every Man,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30770:16"/>
with the beſt in out Store for his
true Benefit, and innocent Delight.</p>
               <p>This, I name Unſutable. This,
that is not <hi>ſeaſoned with the Salt,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the Holy Ghoſt. With
Prudence ſeaſoning it as may be
beſt for our Deſigns that are good.
He that is neither Profane, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical,
or Raſh, muſt neceſſarily be
Wiſe. And he that is Wiſe, muſt
neceſſarily ſee that all ſuch Talk is
Fooliſh. That the Beginning of it is
Fooliſh, and the End as Miſchievous.</p>
               <p>That, from hence it is; very much
from hence, that our Tongues are
Servants ſo Unprofitable; and our
Diſcourſes do ſo little mend each
others Minds, Hearts, and Lives.
That Speech, though made for an
Engine to turn about all the Human
World, maketh no more Converſion
unto Good in the very Chriſtian
Church. Though ſet by God as the
Rudder, to Steer all our Affairs; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30770:16"/>
the Spring, to ſet going all Wheels
of Action; to ſtir up Thoughts, to
kindle Affections, put to work our
Hands, and to walk our Feet; yet,
doeth none of theſe mighty Works
in the way of Wiſdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
or extremely few.</p>
               <p>Unto the Unſutableneſs of it we
muſt aſcribe, the loſt Labor of very
much Preaching the Sacred Word.
And the general Fruitleſneſs of all
Conference. By the means thereof
it is, that Exhortations, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might be taken in and welcomed,
are with Contempt and Choler diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Reproofs, which otherwiſe might
Heal, (being received as Salt, though
not as Sugar) do Exaſperate, and
turn Men from Bad to Worſe, and
from Worſe to worſt of all! And,
in ſhort, all Converſes, wherewith
the Lips of the Wiſe might otherwiſe
Feed their Companions, do but, at
beſt, Divert them. The Fruit of
the Lips, becoming as the Artificial
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30770:17"/>
Fruits made of Wax; on which
moſt People will Gaze, but none do
ever Feed.</p>
               <p>Yet the Folly of this condemned
Talk would be ſomewhat more Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
were it capable of being hatched
of any but a Cockatrice's Egg. Of
proceeding from any Cauſes, but the
very Worſt. And ſuch as the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable
Talker will not dare own.
He is not eaſily brought to confeſs
<hi>Ignorance;</hi> and plead that he knows
not how to Speak properly, or Keep
ſilence and hear thoſe that can. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitance</hi>
and Forgetfulneſs, are thin
Excuſes; and if often put on, will
ſoon be worn out. <hi>Sloth,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs
to go to the pains of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and pertinent Speech, is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of Ink; and will make a Negro
more Black. The Plea of <hi>Pride,</hi> and
a Luſt to ſhow his own Knowledge
without encreaſing other Mens, is
a Man's pleading that it pleaſes him
to be a Devil <hi>Cowardice</hi> and fear of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30770:17"/>
being barked at by Dogs, if he ſhould
frame his Diſcourſe for the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Men, is a flat renunciation
of Holy Baptiſm; nor will it be
pleaded, till a Creature is deſtitute
and at his laſt ſhift. To ſay, it is
my <hi>Cuſtom</hi> thus to tranſgreſs with
my Mouth; and I cannot break an
ill Way, being become my own; is
to plead a Neceſſity of Perſeverance
to Damnation. <hi>Covetouſneſs and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi>
are equally groſs Pleas; and till
they have the Grace to Repent,
few have the Impudence to Boaſt;
and none have the Modeſty to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
that their Talk is to Honor
themſelves Sacrilegiouſly, and Enrich
themſelves Feloniouſly, That is, by
robbing their Maker to exalt their
Names, and by robbing their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to advance their Eſtates. Will
any urge the <hi>Example</hi> of ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<hi>Sophi?</hi> and argue, that, let it
do ever ſo little good, or none at all,
yet it is this <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Argument,
Way, and Style. He is ſtrait-way
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30770:18"/>

thoſe wherein he can be told, That
<hi>unto us Chriſtians there is but one God,

Not any that is more a Chriſtian,
than a Statue of Stone is a Man; or
the Paint on a Sign-Poſt, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the Iniquity, and heal the Diſeaſe of
this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nexcuſable Talk. Let the words

               <p>5. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonable Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> That
which is ever ſo well ſuted to Mens
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30770:18"/>
Capacity, Taſte and Need, ought
as well to be ſuted to their Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
Vacancy, and Seaſons of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
receiving it. Are there
ſome things, which are never out of
Seaſon? Surely, Talking is none of
them? But is of thoſe, which Divine
Wiſdom pronounceth to be beautiful
only in their Seaſon. Times there
are, wherein we muſt be, every one,
apart; and our Cloſet-door ſhut. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man being, there, both the
Speaker and Hearer; and the whole
Congregation there preſented before
God. Times there are, wherein du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Contemplation and Action brook
not Talking and Hearing. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Beſt of them are by no means
Good, but the Wiſeſt monſtrouſly
Fooliſh. In Nature ſo it is, that
things moſt Beautiful and Beneficent,
out of their Seaſon are Ghaſtly and
Malignant. Roſes and Lillies, in the
depth of Winter, would be Prodigies;
and Sun-ſhine, at Midnight, would
make fearful Outcries among us. It
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30770:19"/>
is no otherwiſe in Morality; what is
Pious and Vertuous at one time, is
Profaneneſs and Vice at another.
Prayer, in the Seaſon of other Duty,
is not God's Delight; and Giving of
Alms, when in want wherewith to
pay our Debts, is not Bounty but
Felony.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt it be ſaid, the unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Calves, of our Lips are the
Sacrifice of Fools. And all their
Fruits, not brought forth in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
are the Cluſters of <hi>Sodom. Words</hi>
have been elegantly named the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of our Minds;</hi> but, when they
come before their time, they are as
properly called their <hi>foul Miſcarriages.</hi>
And the greateſt Charity that holds
Wiſdom company, muſt think Evil
of them; and ever doth ſo. For,
whatever their Figure is, or their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it's certain they are Lepers.
Becauſe, ſo it is; and the Guilty
know it is ſo, that</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:30770:19"/>
                  <hi>God hath no pleaſure in Fools;</hi> Fools
that will go unto <hi>Tarſus,</hi> when ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Nineve.</hi> Will be about one thing,
when ſet about another. And neglect
the Time, if not the Manner and
very Matter of his Commands. Who
doubts but unſeaſonable Talk is the
<hi>Apolluon,</hi> and Deſtroyer of Family
and Cloſet-duty? A more bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor
than any <hi>Nero;</hi> making
worſe Havock of Chriſtian Churches.
A wretched <hi>Herod,</hi> that eſpecially
falls foul upon Children; who are
left uncatechiz'd, and have their Souls
ſtarved, by means of this Sin of their
Parents. Who as they incenſe God,
do not always pleaſe Men. Men,
that are wiſe and good, draw the
Sword of the Spirit, the Word of
God, upon them. Eſteeming them,
as Enemies of Righteouſneſs; and as
worthy to be ſo ſlain as the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
and Profane. Unto Men of but
unregenerate Morality, they are an
Offence very frequently; and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to none but the Froth and Skum
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30770:20"/>
of a Neighbourhood. To the moſt
vile, or, at beſt, the moſt ſilly and
vain Creatures. Who are ſeldom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pleaſed, but they are poiſoned
alſo; and corrupted, in ſome kind
or other, by the unſeaſonable Talker.
Whoſe very <hi>Hellebore maketh mad</hi>
thoſe whom it finds not ſo. Whoſe
beſt Diſcourſes raiſe good Mens Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and are unlikely Means to lay
ill Mens. In ſhort,</p>
               <p>There is no Man, be he Carnal,
Moral, or Spiritual; that can or ought
to like the <hi>Gnats,</hi> that ſing about
him when he needs Sleep. Or the
<hi>Pillories,</hi> that hold his Ears when he
ſhould be at work. The <hi>Turks</hi> that
take away his Clothes in cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherein he moſt needs them.
Or the <hi>Vinegar</hi> that falls on his Nitre,
and makes it uſeleſs, as the Royal
Preacher expreſſes himſelf. The Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
we are mentioning are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theſe things; and as unworthy
of our good Eſteem and Affections.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30770:20"/>
Conſequently, none of Wiſdom's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
being not accepted of God, or
approved of Men. Being alſo, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them are, ſo very near to the
Good which they riſe not up unto.
Having it ſo eaſy to them to pleaſe
God and profit Men, and doing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them. For,</p>
               <p>Valuable Gifts and Graces many of
them do poſſeſs; and the Church and
World might be greatly ſerv'd with
their diſcreet Uſe, and ſeaſonable.
The Diſeaſes of neither are ſo incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but that if Time and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were diſcerned, both might be
reformed. Yea, and the <hi>Reformation</hi>
(whoſe Name is of ſo frightful Sound
among us) might be wrought with
Eaſe and Pleaſure. Very Idiots are
not ignorant, how the Seaſon of
Things doth facilitate and ſweeten
them. All know, the Labour is not
great to ſail with the Tide; though
out of that time, a Boat is a Gally,
and a Rower is a Slave. None
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30770:21"/>
queſtion, but that in Hungry-hours,
every Meal is a Feaſt; and, without
any Miracle, Water is turned to
Wine, and every bitter Thing is ſweet.
Although otherwhiles, Wine is Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
Bread is Stone, Fiſh Serpent,
and it is an unmerciful thing to make
a Man eat and drink.</p>
               <p>With ſweet Eaſe, and with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Pleaſure, do their Lips feed and
feaſt many, whoſe Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
takes the fit Opportunity:
Whoſe Lips bring forth their Fruit
in due Seaſon. And of them it may
be ſaid, <hi>Their Leaf doth not wither,
and what they ſay doth proſper. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Jeſus, give thy Servants the Learned
Tongue to ſpeak our Words in ſeaſon.
So ſhall they be like the beſt Wine for
thee, our Beloved; going down ſweetly,
and cauſing the Lips of them that are
aſleep to ſpeak,</hi> Cant. 7. 9.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Exceſſive Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> That
is viciouſly Exceſſive, which exceeds
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30770:21"/>
the Limit ſet by Law. It is the
End that gives Law unto Means.
The End of Speech is God's Glory,
and Man's Good; and the due Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it, therefore, is that which
appears moſt ſerviceable and beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
thereto. Whatſoever is more,
cometh of Evil. A ſinful Defect it
is, when we ſpeak leſs than theſe
require; as though good Words coſt
more than we owed to God and our
Neighbour. Nor is it other than a
ſinful Exceſs, when we ſpeak more
than makes for theſe, (and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
muſt make againſt them;)
as though our Tongues were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and not Servants; or Servants
left to themſelves by God and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
to make as much unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Noiſe as we liſt. I will not
determine, which Spirit is the more
unclean, the <hi>Dumb</hi> Devil or the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kative.</hi>
Both come from Hell, and
both ſerve the Kingdom thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:30770:22"/>
This latter is ſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the memorable Divine
Proverbs; <hi>In the multitude of Words,
there wanteth not Sin; but he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraineth
his Lips is wiſe. He that hath
Knowledg ſpareth his Words. But he
that openeth wide his Lips, ſhall have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
Prov. 10. 19. &amp; 17. 27. &amp; 13. 3.
Nature alſo, as well as Scripture,
condemns this Exceſs of Speech. This
Exceſs, againſt which it hath made
very obſervable Proviſions: Giving
us but one Inſtrument of Speech,
though two of Hearing, and two of
Sight. Not giving us the uſe of our
one Tongue, neither, till we arrive
unto the uſe of Reaſon in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Alſo then ſetting Bounds to it,
when we come to the Uſe of it;
hedging it in with Rowes of Teeth.
So that, we are plainly taught, if we
will learn it, that we are to hear
twice as much as we ſpeak in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes:
Are to ſpeak no more than
we underſtand good Reaſon for;
And when we do otherwiſe, we do
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30770:22"/>
break Nature's Bounds, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
Hom. Iliad.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>All the World agrees, 'tis no Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Tongue that keeps not Time.
Nor are Men found to love any Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity
beſide their own; or their
own it ſelf, under the Name of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
It's a common Obſervation,
that the moſt Tedious Tongues have
the leaſt Patient Ears; and the moſt
Incontinent Talkers do not own their
Love to hear themſelves talk. By
which they betray their Self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and ſhew how much their
Judgment is againſt their Practice.
And who thinks the Man wiſe, who
condemns himſelf in a thing that he
allows?</p>
               <p>Be it further asked; who ever knew
a Galloping Tongue, but it often
Stumbled? One that running very
much, fell not into Sin very oft? The
Scripture foreſaid, is in every guilty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30770:23"/>
Company verified. The nimbleſt
Wits are out-run by Tongues of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Motion. Much leſs can the
ſtrongeſt Judgments keep pace with
reſtleſs Ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Mountains will
be always in travail, Mice will be
the inglorious Birth. The moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Oracles of Eloquence, muſt
ſpeak Traſh if they ſpeak to exceſs!</p>
               <p>It is eaſily divined, how very ill
this may be applied by corrupt Minds.
By the <hi>Impure, to whom all things are
impure.</hi> Thoſe who take not the
Law againſt the Exceſs of any other
Talk, are ſtill commencing vexatious
Suits againſt that of Religious Talk.
Againſt which, Scorners in their Chair,
ſhaking with Laughter, will wreſt
what is ſaid. Wherefore let Chriſtian
Readers attend what follows.</p>
               <p>Very poſſible indeed it is, that
Religious Talk may be drawn forth
to a ſinful Length. What is moſt
laudable for the Matter, may be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30770:23"/>
for the Meaſure; and is ſo, and
is not for Edification, but againſt
it, when Religious Prudence doth not
gage it: When no Care is taken
that Company be not Glutted, as well
as that they be not Starved. But,
alas! in our day, real Defects are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Exceſſes, generally. All Talk-of-another-World,
Men would have
confined to holy Days and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Places. Yea, and to Church-men
and Bed-ridden ones. Thoſe that are
one jot wiſer, and can reliſh a little
when they can tend for it; do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that what exceedeth <hi>Laodicean</hi>'s
Uſe, is Long; and what is Long, is
Tedious; and what is Tedious to
their Luſts, may be juſtly enough
Odious to their Hearts. But, every
Man is not a Thief, at whom Dogs
do bark; or whom the Children in
the Street call ſo. Nor is every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Talker a Sinful Oppreſſor of
his Hearers, though he be named ſo
by the Weak and the Wicked among
them. Nor is all that they will call
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30770:24"/>
ſo, Cant and Nonſenſe. Nor is it
ſure that 'tis Vain-Glory, and not
Godly-Zeal, doth act him, becauſe
it's audaciouſly ſaid ſo by them. Or,
that it is not his Duty to exceed
their Deſires; and his Wiſdom and
Kindneſs to do it, becauſe they do
think otherwiſe. In ſhort; They
that Fear God, will Speak often of
him one to another; and very much.
Even to an Exceſs of Carnal Mens
Patience. Wittingly they will not
extend their Talk of him, beyond
what they believe to be for his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and their Good. And, if, through
inadvertence, they ſometimes do ſlip
and fall into a peccant Prolixity, they
will truly, upon Reflection, Humble
their Souls: And beſeech their God
to <hi>take away that Iniquity,</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
of <hi>their holy things.</hi> Nor is it
to be doubted, but his rich Grace will
Pardon their Failings, Accept their
Services, Vindicate their Names, and
in due time, Abaſe and Shame their
Reproachers. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:30770:24"/>
Upon the whole, it appears that
we are Fooliſh when we make not
Conſcience of Keeping Silence, as well
as of Breaking it. And that it's our
Duty to Pray the Holy Spirit to teach
us alway, both to <hi>Open our Mouths,
and to Shut them, with Diſcretion!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable Talk is Fooliſh.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
is what Poſitively or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively
violates the Royal Law of
Love: Love of Men for the Sake of
God; true Love of all Men, and beſt
Love of good Men, exemplified and
required by the God of Love. He
talketh Uncharitably, whoſe Talk
flows not from Love, and tends not
unto Kindneſs. Who either ſpeaks
Evil of his Neighbour when no juſt
occaſion is offered, or ſpeaks not well
of him when opportunity is given!</p>
               <p>A Folly moſt manifeſt, a Sin moſt
mighty. For, a Practice it is, moſt
Oppoſite to the Nature, and Inconſiſtent
with the Tenor of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30770:25"/>
Contrary to the principal Laws,
and Deſtructive of the precious Fruits
of its Spirit, and Grace. Inſomuch,
that, if this Talk be not Fooliſh, to
Renounce the Goſpel and our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
muſt be to be Wiſe. The Holy
Ghoſt, expreſly and frequently, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this Talk the Property of the
Wicked, and the Character of the
Damned. Yea, and charges thoſe that
hope for Heaven, <hi>not to Eat with a
Man of ſuch a Tongue,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11.
Declaring thereby, that as ſuch are
excluded from Heaven, they are to
be Excommunicated from the Church
on Earth. That they are Dogs, to
be Kept out of God's Lower Houſe
and Upper one.</p>
               <p>Nor need we lift up our Hands
with any Wonder, if we open our
Eyes with any Care; and look into
the filth of an Uncharitable Mouth.
It's a Superfluity of Naughtineſs, that
maketh Silent of the Good, and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of the Evil of our Neighbours.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30770:25"/>
It's no leſs than Contempt and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of God and Men, that is the
true Cauſe and Spring. And, like
Cauſe like Effects! This Talk fights
againſt God, and murders Men; and
of all Men, the Talkers themſelves.
<hi>It is a World of Iniquity;</hi> full of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as the World of things Viſible
and Inviſible. <hi>It Defiles the Body;</hi>
turns all the Members into Weapons
of Unrighteouſneſs; makes Hands and
Feet Swords and Spears. <hi>Sets on fire
the Courſe of Nature;</hi> horribly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
the whole Courſe of our Lives;
takes away the Wheel of Humane
Converſation: Quenches every relick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpark
of Love, Infuſes more Hatred,
Kindles more Malice, Inflames Wrath,
Founds a Hell of Revenge; and <hi>Makes
the very Heaven and Earth of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to paſs away.</hi> Hence is it, that
Earth, as Hell, is full of Weeping,
Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth. Of
Strife and Clamor, of Tumult and

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30770:26"/>
No Peace to them that are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
ſpoken of, no Peace in them

               <p>In them, who turn the ſweeteſt
Inſtrument of Kindneſs into the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Weapon of Bitterneſs. Who by
that excellent faculty of Speech, which
diſtinguiſheth them from Bruits, do
make themſelves far more Noxious
Creatures. By that, which, next to
God's Glory, was given us for our
Neighbour's Good, do, to God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
do them all manner of Evil;
By that which God gave us to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and Comfort them, do Defame and
Diſquiet them. Turning the great
Gift of Tongues into the worſt of
Curſes! A Folly, which we call A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical,
by Scripture-Authority!
<hi>Swords are in their Lips,</hi> i. e. They
Talk Uncharitably. <hi>Who ſay they ſhall
hear us?</hi> i. e. They deny the Deity,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 7. And vain are the Fig-Leaves,
wherewith fond Fools would
cover their Shame; <hi>e. gr. We ſpeak ill of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30770:26"/>
none but of ill Men.</hi> No? But, a higher
than the Kings of the Earth faith,
Speak Evil of no Man. <hi>They ſpeak ill
of us, of whom we ſpeak ill.</hi> It may be
ſo; but your Saviour, when he was
Reviled, reviled not again. And his
Sheep do not bark at Dogs when Dogs
bark at them. <hi>We ſpeak no more ill than
we know of Men.</hi> So much the leſs is
your Sin; but it's a very great one, when
your Charity covers not a Multitude
of your Neighbours Sins! <hi>We cannot
but ſpeak ill when we are Angry.</hi> No?
It is the Unregenerate Tongue that
no Man, can tame. Where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord is, there is Liberty
and Power; and there is putting away
of Evil Speaking and of Anger: Of
both the ill Child and Mother, of
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> and of <hi>Hagar. We ſpeak but
ſuch ill words as bleak no Bones.</hi> How
know you that? but it's too much
if you break your Neighbour's Peace
in his Mind, and your own Peace
in the higheſt King's Court. <hi>We
mean no hurt in the Ill we ſpeak.</hi> Pity
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30770:27"/>
but you ſpake well, if you meant ſo.
You conſtrue others ill Words in ill
Senſes; and ſo will others conſtrue
yours. Men that are Good, do ſhun
the very Appearance of Evil. <hi>They be
our Inferiours of whom we ſpeak ill;
and if we wrong them, we recompence
them.</hi> A Rare Reſtraint, and moſt
Unfrequent Reſtitution! But, what
if made, both of 'em? It is he that
is void of Underſtanding that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
any Neighbour. He only who
dares deſpiſe his Maker, dares to
mock the Poor. Nor can any Hands
heal ſome Wounds that are given by
Tongues. <hi>We ſpeak ill of ſome Men,
as conſtrained to it by the Love of God.</hi>
How good is it to be ſure that we
are not in an Errour, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
that we do well? It is poſſible
to ſpeak wickedly for God. And it's
ſure, though you do ſpeak for him,
it is wickedly, if you ſpeak without
his Call, and ſpeak not according to
his Rule. You diſhonour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
him your King, if without his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30770:27"/>
Warrant, you inflict a deſerved Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

Nor will he take ſuch an Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of undue Power, for a token of
your Love. And, ſuppoſing that you
have indeed his Commiſion, and
thereby a juſt right to Sentence your
Neighbour; making him that has done
ill to hear ill; alike Criminal you
will be found, if you tranſgreſs his
Laws of Equity, Humanity, and Pity.
If you ſay more than you Know; if

all the Guilty would ſtrait-way find
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30770:29"/>
themſelves to be Uncharitable; could
they but bring their Minds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
better upon their Principles and
Ends. To conſider what it really
is, that makes Evil-ſpeaking the far
greateſt part of their Talk; (as Talk
is, out of queſtion, the much biggeſt
Imployment of their Life.) They would
find, that either an in-rooted Ill-will,
or a raſh Anger; an old Spite or a
newly raiſed Spleen, brought their
Neighbours Faults into their Mouths.
That either Contempt of Men, as
thought hugely below them; or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
at them, as ſuppoſed ſomeway
above themſelves, was the common
Parent of their diſparaging Talk.
That ever and anon Coveting hath
brought them to Slandering; and
they have for no other reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
others, but that they might
enrich themſelves. That, not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
Wantonneſs hath given the
riſe to their Calumny; nor have
they for any thing but Sport mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Men in their Credit. Yea, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30770:29"/>
that, ſometimes, there has certainly
been a much more abſtruſe cauſe;
pure Malignity and Love of Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
without any formed Reaſon:
which has made them bite their
Neighbours, meerly to gratify their
curriſh Humours, juſt as other Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogs
do. A Diſpoſition that is more
common, than is well thought of or

<hi>Speech framed and intended for Mirth.</hi>
Talk, is the Buſineſs of the Lips; Jeſts,

Trade; Jeſting, is their Game. In
That, they do but make a Noiſe; in
This, they make Muſick. That, is
the Employment; This, the Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

is ſome innocent Expreſſion, apt to

All that can be ſaid for Melancholy-Chriſtians

                  <hi>Jeſting,</hi> is originally of no
ill Signification; the Abuſe
hath brought it into diſrepute, as the
anciently honorable Name of <hi>Tyrant;</hi>
and very many others. Our Wiſdom
will be, neither to be Frighted with
the harſh ſound of its Name, among
our ſelves; nor be Charmed with its
Magnificent Titles, found in Pagan

are Fooliſh Jeſts; ſuch as are Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30770:31"/>
And if Eating and Drinking without
aiming at God's Glory, be fooliſh;
Jeſting, without that Deſign, cannot
be Wiſe. Holy Intention, is eſſential
to all Moral Good, and is the ſavour
of it. <hi>If the Salt of Jeſts be without
that ſavour, they be good for nothing,
but to be caſt out.</hi> But we will be
more particular;</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Profane Jeſting is Fooliſh.</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
looſely about things that are
Holy. Trifling with the Names,
whereat Heaven and Earth trembles.
Making Sport with the aweful Word,
by which we muſt be judged. A
certain Effect of worſt Cauſes, and
as ſure a Cauſe of worſt Effects.
For, nothing leſs than a Reign of Sin,
can make a Play of Religion. Nor
can it be, but Playing with Religion,
muſt needs heighten Sins Dominion.
Only Contempt of Sacred Things, can
breed jocular Familiarity: and that

that there is a God, they are blinder
than Heathens. If they do believe
there is one, they are, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
more mad than Devils. And
who, ſave mad and blind Men, can
think it valuable Wit, to make God

which makes merry with the Sins,
and ſporteth with the Miſeries of
Men. That plays upon their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds;
and taunts at their Parts, their
infirm Bodies, or mean Conditions,
and particular Diſaſters. A Practice
ſo horrid, that it would be as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
as Unrighteous; did not Men
together put off the Humane, and put
on Diabolical Nature. For Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
will Compaſſionate, not Patra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragediate,
on a Stray or a Faln-beaſt,
and it cannot draw mirth from the
Miſery of a Man. There is a Beaſt,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30770:33"/>
and none of the gentleſt neither,
which they ſay ſheddeth Tears over
them whom it Devours. But a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
one it is, and a moſt merciful
Creature, compared to this Kind of
Jeſter. For, there is a Clemency in
thoſe that wound us Modeſtly; nor
is he near ſo much the Tyrant that
doth us our wrongs, as he who Mocks
at us for them. The firſt gives the
Wound; but it's this Second that
makes it Smart, and Kill. In ſhort;
he is rather a Stock than a Man that
deplores not Evil, but more a Devil
than a Man that derides it. And his
monſtrous Mirth is ſeldom long from
a Hell above Ground.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Immoral Jeſting is Fooliſh.</hi> In
all things, the Wiſdom that is from
above requires good Manners. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſoever

Conſcience is loſt. It's Aſleep, Blind,

is without Reſtriction; 'tis not ſaid,
<hi>Honour thy Father and Mother in all

they make an unwiſe Bargain,
who ſell God and Mens Peace for the

of their Fancies, in prejudicial and
diſgraceful Gibes. For the luſcious,

to Sting others and Kill it ſelf.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable Jeſting is Fooliſh.</hi> I

nor any thing more, than the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient

A Sorry thing; and below any Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
ſave that of <hi>Children;</hi> who
<hi>prefer their Toy above the Tower of

is in them, ſhould Men uſe other
Whetſtones, without Thought or Care
whether their Inſtruments were ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

but an unaccountable Delight taken
in Grinding for nothing. A practice
which would ſoon ſo ſenſibly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
grind them to the Duſt and
Depth of Poverty, and Scorn among
Men. Awake Conſcience, and ſay
whether all Jeſters grind to fetch an

be taken for a <hi>Recreation</hi> of them;
any more, than carrying of Sacks of

ſuch.</p>
               <p>This Game, <hi>ſaith one,</hi> is not only
Lawful, but, it may be, the moſt Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

<hi>I hope, he Dreamed not, that,
the more Ingenious the more Lawful;
and the more Delightful to his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
the more undoubtedly Harmleſs

how Witty, the worſt of Creatures
is; and how Sweet, abundance of
Forbidden Fruit! Well, but, after
that, he droppeth theſe more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
words:</hi> 
                  <q>Many precious Hours
have I profuſely ſpent in this Game;
and, It is a Time-waſter. It hath
had with me a Faſcinating Property;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:30770:35"/>
I have been Bewitched by it. When
I have Begun, I have not had the
Power to Give over. I will not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe
it, till I find I can Refuſe it. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Religion ſhall order my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation.
It hath not done with me,
when I have done with it. In my
Study, in my Pulpit, when I have
been Praying or Preaching, I have,
in my Thoughts been Playing of Cheſs.
I have had as it were a Cheſs-board
before my Eyes. I have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how I might have obviated the
Stratagem of my Antagoniſt (<hi>or
Play-Mate.</hi>) I have heard of one,
who, as appeared by his Words, was
in his Thoughts playing at Cheſs, as
he lay Dying. It hath cauſed me
(this Game hath) to break many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Vows and Promiſes; and often
to Prevaricate ſinfully. It hath
wounded my Conſcience and broken my
Peace. Were I now to Die, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of this Game would great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trouble me. As it did <hi>John Huſs,</hi>
a little before his Death.</q> [<hi>One would

us all to dread this Fire; but he thus

been Scandalous and Offenſive unto
others: Godly Friends have been
Grieved. Others (I have reaſon to
fear) have been Hardned by it. My
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſing it bath occaſioned much Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Strife, Idle, if not, Lying Words;
the Neglect of many Duties to God
and Men. My <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſing it ſhows, I have
little Self-denial. It is altogether
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary to me; it hinders my
Soul's health, and furthers not my
my Body's. It hath occaſioned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence;
I ſhould think much to give
that to Relieve others, that I have
waſted this way upon my Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>
                  <hi>He concludes with excellent
words of the Maſter of Chriſtian Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
Mr.</hi> Baxter: <q>
                     <hi>I know not

Therefore there is ſomewhat in

ſome Suſpicion of. In ſuch other
Games as fit not the End of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations.

               <p>Reader; Can thy Charity reach
to believe, that this <hi>Reverend Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
deſigns his Spiritual Benefit, if
he returns to his Cheſs-Board? Or,
that other Chriſtians can eaſily think
thee to be ſincere, if thou pretendeſt
to ſeek renovation of thy Strength
for thy Duty, from a Game which
evidently Wearies, Weakens, and
Waſtes Spirits? For thy Life look
well to thy Aims, in Jeſts arid Games!
And, for Shame, acknowledge this
bright Truth; that Playing (and very
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30770:36"/>
Praying alſo) is Sinful Folly, when
Aims and Ends in them are not Wiſe!
Let the Matter be what it will;
whereinſoever, the Pleaſure of the <hi>Fleſh</hi>
is, for it ſelf, <hi>Sought,</hi> it is <hi>Served;</hi>
and in whatſoever it is Served, the
<hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> are Served alſo; for,
<hi>their Intereſts are Conjunct and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Immoderate Jeſting is Fooliſh.</hi> That
is Immoderate, which is uſed in Times
prohibited; ſpends more time than is
allowed; and is without any Serious
thing immixed.</p>
               <p>There is a time to embrace, and a
time to refrain from the Embraces, of
this ſort of Speech. The <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi>
is a <hi>Temporary-Heaven,</hi> into which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo Playful may enter. And other
times there are, which require our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt
Compoſures of Spirit, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not its relaxations. Though we
may <hi>not Faint,</hi> neither may we be
Frolic, <hi>in a Day of Adverſity.</hi> When
we addreſs unto Solemn Worſhip at
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30770:37"/>
any time, it behoves us to go with
fear and trembling. When we are
among Perſons Afflicted, and needing
Commiſeration;to Jeſt and Sport, is
to intimate that we are glad of their
Hurt; and is directly to foment their
Grief. He is a Glutton of them, who
cannot abſtain from Jeſts upon ſuch
Faſting-Days. On which, every Sally
of his Sportive Wit, is not a <hi>dead
Fly,</hi> but dead Oxe <hi>in his Ointment.</hi>
But,</p>
               <p>So is he alſo Immoderate, who at
any time whatever, ſpends more Hours
in Tuning of his Inſtrument, than
Uſing it. In Whetting his Sythe, than
in Mowing. In Baiting of his Horſe,
than in Riding. As though Paſtime
were the <hi>Chriſtian-Name</hi> of Jeſting;
and as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Six days
ſhalt thou, not Labour, but Play.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is all Jeſting Sober, that is in
no Unſeaſonable time, and is but of
an Hour long? No, by no means.
He is no Temperate and Wiſe Man,
that, for half an Hour together, eats
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:30770:37"/>
nothing but Sawce, or Speaks nothing
but Jeſts. Salts and Sawces are not
to be ate by themſelves; Recreative
Jeſts are ſuch fare. Unwholſome ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without ſomewhat more Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
taken with it. Some grave Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
among the light Kickſhaws.
Somewhat that may ſhow the Jeſter to
be no ſuch <hi>Ape,</hi> as is not <hi>Man</hi> and
<hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and his Language, when
moſt Merry, to be bridled by a Heart
that is Wiſe. Somewhat that may
both work and witneſs this rare Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
that in the Recreation of our
Minds, the Buſineſs of our Lives doth
not go ſo far from them, as to be long
out of them. In ſhort; he who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgeth
Fancy any more Jeſting than
this, his Jeſting as truly ſets his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to Sleep as his Fancy to Play.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Oſtentatious Jeſting is Fooliſh.</hi> Of
all Sins, Pride is the moſt Sinful; and
therefore the moſt Silly. And of all
Pride, there is ſcarcely a more fooliſh,
than Pride of Skill to play this Game.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30770:38"/>
True, our Age wonders after it; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
nothing ſo much. Men value
themſelves upon it; and therefore luſt
to be ſhowing it. But,</p>
               <p>For this appears no more Reaſon,
than the poor Ruſtick had, for his
Perſwaſion; that being Condemned
to Die, his King would never let him
be Executed, becauſe he had ſo Rare
a Knack of Whiſtling. No more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
than Children have to admire
themſelves for being Artiſts at Puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.
Arts, both of them, which have
leſs corrupted the World and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Mankind, than Jeſting hath done.
Worthy therefore, if not of more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
yet of leſs Diſgrace. In a word,
I ask;</p>
               <p>Were they not born among the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of the Field; at leaſt, diſclaim
they not the Privilege of a Nobler
Birth, who look upon Reaſon as of leſs
worth? Reaſon, their Likeneſs to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
of leſs worth than Jeſting, their
Similitude to Apes and Sportive Brutes.
Reaſon, that in Conjunction with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:30770:38"/>
Grace, doth all that is Good and Great
for both Worlds; of leſs Worth than
Freakiſh Wit, which doth its utmoſt,
when it Unknits a Brow, Shakes a
Spleen, and lets fall a drop of Oil on
Reaſon's Wheel. Such Men, if they
may be ſtyled Men, do want little more
than Hair and Horns to make them
Beaſts. For the ſame Wiſdom it is,
to break Jeſts for the praiſe of great
Parts, and to bring forth Counters for
the praiſe of great Eſtates. This is
Self-evident, and no more ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but this; My need of Medicines
can prove me to be but an <hi>Infirm</hi> Man;
my Pride of taking them would prove
me a <hi>Mad</hi> one. No Jeſting is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
but what is Medicinal, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of Spirits for nobler Thoughts.
My Need hereof, is but my common
Infirmity; my Pride of it would be
my perfect Phrenzy.</p>

the Talks which they cannot leave.
No, but addict themſelves to, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

lives. His Soul hateth their Fooliſh
Talks, and their Souls loath this Text
and all its Parallels. Who then can
pleaſe Men, and be the Servant of

Chriſt? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. Without becoming

3. 18. Holy Lips, are a <hi>Thread of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi>

World's Eye, it's only fit for a Fool's
Coat. In ſhort, we cannot have God's
Approbation, but we muſt bear the
World's Blame. The World thinks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

For, ſo much is demonſtrated by the

Cautioned in the Text and Context, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the deteſtable Sins of the Tongue.

               <p>T. 7. <hi>Wiſdom is a valuable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</hi>
For, it ſeems that there is not a
word that can be ſafely ſpoke without
it. Fooliſh ones, be Treaſon and Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30770:48"/>
and without a Stock of Wiſdom
in our Hearts, all we ſpeak muſt be
Fooliſh. That is, traiterous againſt
God, and poiſonous to our Selves and
our Neighbours. Silence, we would not
be willingly condemned to; there are
few but would rather be deprived of
the Motion of their Hands and Feet,
than of their Tongues. Nor indeed can
a holy Manor Angel, chuſe to be Dumb.
All the Creatures beſide, are Mutes;
and but tuned inſtruments. They are
Angles and Men, that are to make the
Muſick. They are the Orators of the
Univerſity of the Creation. Miſerable
are they, whoſe Mouths muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſpeak, and yet their Hearts cannot
prudently indite!</p>
               <p>T. 8. <hi>Thoughts be not free.</hi> For if the
Words of the Mouth are not, why
ſhould the Words of the Heart be ſo?
If Fooliſh Talk with Men be deteſtable
Sin, why not Fooliſh Talk with our
ſelves, alſo? Thoughts be nothing but
unfledged Words; Words, not yet
taking wing? and flying forth. What
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:30770:48"/>
we commonly name a Word, is a
Thought flown abroad; a Spark aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the fire of the Heart's Coal.
True; Fooliſh Oral-Talks and Jeſts
do ſin againſt our Neighbours, which
mental ones do not. But, the Fox is
an unclean Beaſt while it hides in its
Hole, as well as when it cometh forth
for its Prey. And ſecret Sins, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sins as any. The old Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the Swan Unclean, though
Feathers of Snow hid its black Skin.
The Viper is not more deteſtable than
the Cockatrices-Egg. Evil Thoughts
grieved God to his Heart; Evil
Thoughts made him repent that he
had made Man!</p>
               <p>T. 9. <hi>Fooliſh Actions be groſs Shames.</hi>
For, if Fooliſh Words be Deteſtable,
Works much more; Becauſe in them,
Sin is obeyed and ſerved by the whole
Man. And, if I may ſo ſpeak, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is denied nothing you can grant him.
Alſo, in them is the moſt Wilful of all
Sin; for, as our Words are much more
eaſily reſtrained than our Thoughts, ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30770:49"/>
our Actions are much more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
than our Words. Beſides, in
them is the moſt Laborious Sin; In
wicked Thoughts and Words, Men
offer Satan what coſts them next to
nothing. Minds being volatile as Air,
and Tongues as active as Fire. But the
Work of the Hands ordinarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſome Sweat of the Brows. Again,
in Sins of Action, is commonly a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Contagion; no Language is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive
to Good or Evil as the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Practice. Evil Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
much corrupteth good Manners;
but, I think, not more than Evil Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
corrupt good Communication!</p>
               <p>T. 10. <hi>It's little Wonder that Peace
is grown ſo ſcarce.</hi> For, if Fooliſh Talks
and Jeſts be what hath been ſaid, the
wonder is, that any Peace at all is left
among us. Becauſe, every where, theſe
are eaten as Men eat Bread; no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is made of them. And, it were
a Marvel if ſuch Poiſons made no ſtirs
in our Souls; if ſuch Enemies of all
righteouſneſs raiſed no Wars in our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30770:49"/>
Conſciences; and no Variances with
one another. Surely, we muſt leſs
grieve the holy Comforter, before he
very much comfort us with Peace in
our ſelves, and with each other.</p>
               <p>T. 11. <hi>It is not True that All Men ſay.</hi>
For, generally, All do ſay, that this
Talk, which God pronounces Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
is very Innocent and Uſeful:
And its daily Practice is very conſiſtent
with true Godlineſs. God declares it to
be a Plague of Leproſy; and he is a
rare and ſingular Man, that will not
take it for very Comelineſs and Beauty.
If any Spot, a Beauty-Spot.</p>
               <p>T. 12. <hi>Rods are for the back of Fools.</hi>
Severe Reproofs are due to Fooliſh Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
For, it ſeems, their Sin is dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
as well as Drunkards and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers.
And it ſhould be conſidered
by Miniſters and Parents, that neither
of them ought to Whiſper and but
Mutter, againſt that which God doth
Thunder: Or to tempt their Pupils to
believe, that Folly of Words is None,
or but Small, by making their Reproofs
of it Such.</p>

T. 13. <hi>Hony may be Poiſoned.</hi> For,
what more grateful than Jeſting? yet,
what more Mortal than Fooliſh Jeſts?
The Natural Hiſtorian tells us of an
Hony in <hi>Africa,</hi> luſciouſly ſweet, but
perpetually diſtracting all that eat of
it; being by the Bees gathered from
poiſonous Flowers. Juſt like it is the
Fooliſh Jocularity ſo much admired in
our day; the Haut-gouſt of all Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Comedy of every Playful Chat.
So valued, that it's proverbially ſaid,
They will rather loſe their Friend, and
Soul alſo, than their Jeſt. Moſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
are the Weeds whence this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Wherein is nothing to feed, but much

to turn the Stomach of a good Man.
For, ſooner are the Men of it to be

ought to be of pure Gold.</hi> Who ever
would effectually Reprove and Reform
others ill Ways, muſt Keep a good
Tongue in his Head. For if Fooliſh
Talks and Jeſts be ſo deteſtable, as we
have heard; he that ſhall uſe them will
have too ill a Name, to do any good
Service. Becauſe, the beſt Meat is

and Wiſdom, all our Hope and
