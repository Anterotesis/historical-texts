         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Midnight Touch
At an Unlicenſ'd Pamphlet,
CALLED,
<hi>A Vindication of the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and ſeveral other
<hi>Biſhops.</hi>
               </hi>
            </head>
            <p>VVE do juſtly term and eſteem him, who Abdicated the Throne,
no other than <hi>the late King;</hi> yet we find in the Paper, this day
publiſhed; <hi>Five Clergy-men,</hi> in defiance of an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
calling themſelves, <hi>W. Cant. W. Norwich, F. Ely, Tho. Bath and Wells, Tho. Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
It would have given great offence, if there had been added, <hi>Richard Baxter Rector of Kederminſter;</hi> yet a good Lawyer affirmed in a Coffe-houſe but two hours
ſince, that he hath as good a title to <hi>Kederminſter</hi> as the other five have to the
Names which they aſſume to themſelves, and preſume to write, and that they ought
only to have ſubſcribed <hi>William Sancroft, William Loyd, Francis Turner, Tho. Ken.</hi> and
<hi>Thomas VVhite,</hi> late <hi>Biſhops</hi> (if they pleaſed.)</p>
            <p>It is as certain that there is a third Plot, as that there is a New Liturgy; and that
there is a <hi>Lambeth</hi> Club, the Paper now publiſhed confeſſes; but whether Holy or
not, I know not; and for ought I know the inſerting that Epethete (holy) both to
theirs and the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> or Devil-Tavern-Club, may be a good reaſon for ſaying 'tis
Abuſive.</p>
            <p>It ſeems by their Paper, that they are put under a neceſſity of holding
<hi>Meetings</hi> (or <hi>Conventicles)</hi> at <hi>Lambeth, in their preſent difficulties;</hi> to adviſe how to keep
good Conſciences; which looks as tho 'twere no eaſie thing to them to do it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, They tell us; <hi>that they</hi> heartly and inceſſantly <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>Peace,
Proſperity and Glory of England,</hi> (which is well, tho' as to the words we find them
not in their Liturgy) and Methinks we want the Addition of theſe words <hi>under
the Auſpetious Government of our dread Soveraign Lord and Lady, King VVilliam and Queen
Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not to ſeek for their meaning, when they talk of <hi>bearing their Croſs;</hi>
but their prating of ſeeking the <hi>good of their Native Country;</hi> is ſo ambignous and
uncertain, that for ought I know, ſhould <hi>Mareſchal D. Humiers</hi> come, <hi>(which God
forbid) VV. C.</hi> would call for the Keys, which he delivered to <hi>my L. L.</hi> and put them
into his Hands; and then conclude that he had done the <hi>Church</hi> and his Country a
great piece of ſervice.</p>
            <p>I do think that 'twas not ſo much for the ſake of Wit or Honeſty, as for the well
<hi>underſtood word</hi> (as they call it) <hi>de Wuting;</hi> that their Vindication was publiſhed;
and therefore, <hi>I</hi> declare, that, rather than ſee the Throne of our <hi>rightful and Lawful
King and Queen</hi> (who now poſſeſs it) overthrown; <hi>I</hi> ſhall rejoyce to ſee all who
refuſe to Pray and Fight for its ſupport, <hi>de VVitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their late Reverences declare themſelves ready to ſacrifie their All to prevent
Popery <hi>and the Arbitrary</hi> Power of France <hi>from prevailing over them;</hi> for they have the
Perſecution of the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> freſh in their Memories.</p>
            <p>'Twere to be wiſht, that theſe <hi>Non-Reſiſting</hi> and <hi>Non-Aſſiſting Gentlemen;</hi> would
now (in their difficulties, and whileſt <hi>under the Croſs)</hi> when they tell us that they
remember the Perſecution of the <hi>French Proteſtants, acknowledge the Error and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Perſecuting thoſe of</hi> England; for till they do ſo, there are a Cenſorious
ſort of People amongſt us. who will conclude, that tho' ſome of our <hi>Clergy-men, would
not have the Arbitrary Power of France to prevail over them;</hi> yet that they do wiſh and
hope, <hi>by that Power,</hi> to prevail over, and yet again to trample upon <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Mr Randal Taylor</hi> emits his next Paper, which is to declare the <hi>Abſent
Brother</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter</hi>'s concurrence, <hi>I</hi> ſhall endeavour to read it at a more ſeaſonable
hour, and to find a little more leiſure than <hi>I</hi> now have, to ſpeak to this Point.</p>
