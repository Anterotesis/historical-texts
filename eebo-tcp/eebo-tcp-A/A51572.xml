            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Paul Isaiah,</hi> a converted Jew, wisheth all happinesse of body and soule, both in this life and the next, through Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord.
<salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE many favours which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, as to the refreshing of body, with the outward
<pb facs="tcp:109666:3"/>
things of this life, and to the comforting of my soul, with your most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an instructions, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consolations, have emboldened me thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne you my thanks, and to make publick Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unto the world, how much I am obliged to you; and I hope I shall not doe injury to your goodnesse, by openly publishing my gratitude, as also by cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your further counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards me and my poor endeavours, that this
<pb facs="tcp:109666:3"/>
discourse between a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and a Jew, written by the greatly learned <hi>Sebasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Munster,</hi> may goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad under your name.</p>
            <p>The discourse was first written by him in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, wherein I know you had rather read it, then in my Englsh. But since my dear and blessed Savior, has been gratiously pleased to cal me into his Vineyard, I have resolved by his grace, not to be idle in it, but shall most gladly set my selfe to
<pb facs="tcp:109666:4"/>
any worke, whereby I may advantage the Christian cause, though it bee but by knocking a pinne into the Building, or by bringing a little <hi>Goats</hi> haire to furnish the Ark. They that could not offer a Lamb, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted if they brought only a Pigeon. And I read in the Holy Gospell, where Christ commended the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that gave into the Treasury, but two Mites.</p>
            <p>And as for my selfe, I hope I shal not be rejected, though my present worke
<pb facs="tcp:109666:4"/>
bee onely a Translation; wherein yet I would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gladly emploied, might I be so happy, as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by your learned selfe or some others, with what books are written in Hebrew, which would bee most usefull in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, by being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into English.</p>
            <p>For as in former times the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> lived among my Countrie men the Jewes, as hewers of wood, and drawers of water; so I that am a Jew by birth,
<pb facs="tcp:109666:5"/>
though now by God's grace a Christian, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live and be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Christian Church, though it bee by performing the meanest offices, since King <hi>David</hi> himself thought it would no way disparage him, to be a dore-keeper in God's house.</p>
            <p>The Lord of his great mercie preserve the whole Church, and add dailie unto it (even from among my native Countrie men, the Jewes) such as shall bee
<pb facs="tcp:109666:5"/>
saved; which is the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie praier of him who Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours you, and begs your favourable interpretation of this his presumption.</p>

            <p>And (blessed bee the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath made that consanguinity between us, through the bloud of his Sonne) that I can now say, My deare Christian brother;</p>
            <p>AFter that it had pleased God, who separated mee from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveale his Sonne in me, that I might obey that Gospell, which once I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed; and that I began an openly to make profession of the Christian faith, I met with continuall opposition from those of my Countrymen, who have yet their minds blinded, and the vaile remaining upon their hearts untaken away; having experimentally found the words of our Saviour true, <hi>If any man will come
<pb facs="tcp:109666:7"/>
after me, let him deny himselfe, and take up his crosse, and follow mee,</hi> St Mat. <hi>16.24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I lived among my Countrymen, the Iewes, and did communicate with them in the Iewish Religion, it was my great sinne and unhappinesse (as it was likewise theirs) to be eager against the Truth of the Gospell. And though wee daily read the Prophets, in the reading whereof, I have learned this excellent Lesson, since I became a Christian, viz. <hi>That we do then understand the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets aright, when we find Christ in them.</hi> But when I read them formerly in the Synagogues, there was such a thick mist before our eies, and our fore-fathers wooll had so stopt our eares, that wee would neither see nor heare any thing concerning Christ; much lesse would wee endure to heare that any of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had prophecied against us, as such who rejected the true Messias, &amp; (in him) our salvation. So that we might be truly compared to a blind man, holding a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glasse before him; wherein, though the blinde man cannot see his owne face,
<pb facs="tcp:109666:7"/>
yet the standers by can easily discerne whose face it is, which is represented in the glasse.</p>
            <p>And here I could wish, it were no more with my Country men, than a mist before their eies, and wooll in their eares; but there is likewise a stone, a flint stone in their hearts; which if the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates among whom they live, did not keep a strict watch over them, would soon be in their hands, to stone Christ to death, were he againe in their reach, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to stone all such who professe his name, and expect salvation in his blood.</p>
            <p>And though perhaps there may not be now in <hi>England,</hi> any great numbers of professed Iewes (some to my owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there are, who have their syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and there exercise Iudaisme) Yet, they who live here, as often as they are bound to use their office of Prayer (which is twice a day) so often are they bound to blaspheme Christ, and to curse him, and all true Christians which beleeve in him. To make evident proof whereof, I have now by mee, the very forms of Prayer in
<pb facs="tcp:109666:8"/>
Hebrew, which are injoined them to make use of: And which I should have translated into English, but that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such horrid blasphemies will doe best being concealed in a language that is here knowne only to the Learned, then if they should bee made common by being translated for every vulgar eye.</p>
            <p>Meane while, I have here adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee a Translator of a safer worke, and upon better Termes. It is a discourse, as thou seest, between a Iew and a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, written at first in Hebrew by a greatly learned Author, the Learned <hi>Munster,</hi> who was himselfe a Translator, but of the best worke in the world, the Holy Bible.</p>
            <p>In this discourse thou wilt meet with many strange fancies and conceits of my Country men, the Iewes, concerning that Messiah of theirs, whose comming they still expect, and expect that when hee comes, hee should have Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (see page <hi>191</hi>) And that he should have a sonne to succeed after him in the Kingdome page <hi>195.</hi> And that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should then swim in an Ocean of sensuall delights. For the Paradise which
<pb facs="tcp:109666:8"/>
they look for then, is only of a Tempora<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Messias purchasing, and for carnall Disciples to injoy. And to say truth, these carnall Iewes (who are such as the Iew in this discourse) have very large soules, as being capable of two <hi>Canaans</hi> (could they get them) and thinking they can never flow in milke and honey enough.</p>
            <p>But the answers which the other spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in this Dialogue, to wit, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, gives to the absurd conceites of his obstinate opposer, and especially towards the latter end of this book, in the solid close (page <hi>225</hi>) scourging the Iewes with a rod of their owne making, stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them with their own sword, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their stiffe necks with the rasor of the Gospell. I hope these answers will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this discourse not only delightfull, but beneficiall unto the Reader, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uprofitable to the Translator, who though he be poor, as to the outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of this life, yet he blesseth God that has made him rich through his Sonne, in the promises of the next.</p>
            <p>And however, that he may not eate the bread of idlenesse, or live like a drone
<pb facs="tcp:109666:9"/>
in the hive of Christs Church; he here hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly desires the Christian Reader to take notice, that hee is ready to offer himselfe willing for any honest imploiment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may preserve himselfe and family, from scandalous want; but especially whereby I may be an instrument (though never so mean an one) to do service to the Church of Christ, by putting my shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders under to beare his Crosse.</p>
            <p>I will keep thee no longer from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the house, then while at the threshold of it, I have begged thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the conversion of the Iewes, and that my Country men may be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that light of the Gospell, which by Gods blessings, I my selfe doe now enjoy, Who am</p>

               <p>Nay, seeing we are the elect people of God, and his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we are more comely than all the Nations of the earth; as it is written in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

               <p>The Scripture saith thus, which the Lord created that he might make; and not thus, which the Lord created and made, to signifie that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted al things by a certain word, and was not tired nor weary, for he did not make, but created all things by a certaine vvord out of nothing, speaking to them as to Artificers, that they should bring forth things out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; as vvhen he said, let the earth bring forth, let the vvaters bring forth; therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, vvhich the LORD
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109666:16"/>
created that hee might make, that is, commit to others that they might make them; but hee did determine, and told how all things should bee made. After this sort is the creation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who were created in the even of the sabbath, as our wise men of good memory have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. The holy day shone upon them, and their making was not altogether finished, but were sent into the aire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, partly communicating with man, and partly with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: They eate and drinke, they increase in off-spring as men, they flie through the aire, they ascend and steale away things within a garment; and for the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109666:16"/>
most part their speeches are lies, neither dare they appeare in the sight of God, seeing it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the wicked shall not dwell with thee; and when it is said in <hi>Genesis, Gen.</hi> 36. 24. that <hi>Anas</hi> found <hi>Iemim</hi> in the desert, hee would signifie Devils, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iemim</hi> is writ without <hi>Iod,</hi> to signifie that the Devils were left imperfect after the six daies of creation, for the holy day of the Sabbath began to enter, and hence it is that they shun the Sabbath, as it is written in <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Exod.</hi> 12. 42. it is a night of observations to you, to wit, that you should beware of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious spirits; on the Sabbath no Devill, or other evill assault
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109666:17"/>
need be feared, for they all flie to the dark mountains, neither doe they appeare all the Sabbath day, because that is the holy day, and they are unclean; but when the Sabbath is ended, they returne to fall upon men and hurt them; and therefore we say; <hi>let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, Psal.</hi> 90. 17. which Psalme is against Devils, and hath that commendation, that by it we may put to flight those noxious spirits, who are called the snares of the sons of men; as it is written, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 10. evill shall not be devised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, neither shall the rod approach thy Tabernacle, and because those Devils were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109666:17"/>
made of <hi>Adam</hi> the first parent, in those hundred and thirty yeares wherein hee was seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred from his wife, being made I say of his seed, therefore they are called the snares and plagues of men, and the mentioned Psalme, and the 91 Psalme, doth conteine a hundred and thirty sayings with this verse, with length of daies thou shalt satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, &amp;c. and <hi>Adam</hi> left this calamity to his posterity, as it were by right of inheritance, that when at night they had felt the flux of nature, from thence Devils, hurtfull and malitious, to men are born: Therefore the Law saith, thou shalt beware of every evill thing, to wit, lest
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109666:18"/>
man in the day time take in any spirits, which in the night may cast him into uncleannesse, by <hi>Belial's</hi> meanes, who is called an evill eye, and he appeareth sometimes in the shape of a woman, &amp; is also called <hi>Lilith,</hi> that is a night-ghost. Moreover, wee must observe, that those faunes who are so engendred of the seed of man, when the man dies, who is their father, they all meet together, to touch and defile him; and therefore our wise men have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to make circles about the man, and remember certain words, whereby they are put to flight, and dare not enter the circle, to touch the funerall.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109666:18"/>
Moreover they have taught us to make seven circles, to drive away seven troops of hurtfull angels which there met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they gather from hence, because it is written,<note place="margin">Iob 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 5.19. <hi>in six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evill shall not touch thee.</hi> Evill, that is <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;</hi> for they flie away from those circles; wherefore those circles must bee made by the grave, that presently after the writing of them, they may put in the carkasse into the grave, and no delay at all be made in letting downe the coffin, lest any evill touch it.</p>

               <p>Thou hast done well in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that repentance is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by the diminishing of the Moone, for the story thou hast told mee is a parable, and not the truth, as many of you have falsely thought; for the Moone hath not life, soule, or spirit, whereby she might love or hate, but God hath created it from the beginning, a lesser light to rule the night, and hath not diminisht it, as you falsely assert. But heare what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith; <hi>thus saith the Lord, Ier.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>learne not according to the way of the Gentiles, and be not afraid of the signes of heaven, as the Gentiles feare them.</hi> Behold,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109666:21"/>
the Gentiles beleeved such things, who knew not the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God. Moreover it is not written that the Moon did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy the Sun, and did desire to rule in the world: why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you believe such things, which the Philosophers never thought? who affirme that the Moone hath no light of her selfe, but receives her bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse from the Sun, as doe all the stars, for the Sunne alone is light of it selfe; and hence it is, that the Moon and Starres have lesse light than the Sun, which may easily bee demonstrated from the eclipse of the Moone, when the earth hinders the beames of the Sunne from tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109666:22"/>
the body of the Moone; and if you desire to heare, I'll tell you in short the cause of the eclipse of the Moon. Forasmuch as the Moone of it selfe hath no light, but receives its splendor from the Sun; know, that these two lights alwaies in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Month, do stand one against another, and though the earth be in the middle, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the body of the Moon for the most part doth bow down either towards the north, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the south, the shadow of the earth cannot hinder the beames of the Sunne from tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching &amp; inlightning the Moon. But when the Moone in the time of the opposition is in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109666:22"/>
point of the head of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, or neer, to wit, twelve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees lower, the Moon is dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, sometimes wholly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in part, according as it is more or lesse distant from the mentioned head, which I will not here discusse in many words; therefore I will turn my selfe to another thing.

It is true, God created great Whales, but 'tis fals that he prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly slew the female, forsomuch as at this day, great Whales are found in the sea, that is, the greatest fishes that devour the lesser; therefore powerfull Kings are compared to Whales,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109666:25"/>
who afflict and oppresse the poore, but the Lord can easily slay them, although in strength they bee not inferiour to the Whales of the sea, this is the mind of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 32.2.</note> Moreover, whereas you assert, one of the Whales was slaine by God, you are constrained to say, <hi>Ionas</hi> was swallowed up by one, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was not another in the sea. But heare what the Prophet writes of himselfe, <hi>and the Lord prepared a great fish to devoure</hi> Ionah. The Lord brought not a great fish, or that Whale from the end of the world, which was left in the beginning of the world, but that Whale which by providence was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109666:25"/>
found in that sea; this the Lord did ordaine to swallow up <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ion. 1.17.</note> And if you object, a Whale or <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and a great fish, are unlike; I answer, that is not true, seeing the Rabbies do expound the word <hi>tannim</hi> for a great fish, do you think that fish was a little one, which swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up <hi>Ionah,</hi> and kept him alive three daies and three nights in his belly? What you bring out of the Psalmes,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 26.</note> I shortly avoid thus; there the singular number is taken for the plurall, which you know is frequent in the Hebrew, as, a man, oxe, sheep, &amp;c. Moreover, you deprave that place brought out of <hi>Iob,</hi> for the Lord doth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109666:26"/>
not say there, the companions shall eat the <hi>Leviathan</hi>: but he speaks after this manner; shall the companions and associates make a banquet of him, or shall the Merchants divide him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them? after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of those who buy fishes, and divide them into parts, and that place may have this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: Will the compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dig a pit to draw him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the sea by their his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and take him? doe you see how unhappily the Fathers have understood and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that place? this also is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry false, and a great errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, that the just in the world to come, shall eat tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109666:26"/>
food, and corporall bread; the flesh of beasts and fish, herbs, and corn of which bread is made, which we need in this life, where wee grow and doe beget an off-spring, and doe renew that which is appaired in our body by the adjection of meat. But in the world to come and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead, it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with us; for then man shall be by the resurrection, a new creature, and renewed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their former bones, like that vision in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 37.6</note> when the Lord God did raise up his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, saying, I will lay sinews up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and will cover

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Rabbies have said in the secrets of the Law, that there is in the neibe, a very stiffe bone, which being put in the fire, is not hurt by it, and being put into the ground, doth not putrifie, and they affirm the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the body doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease by that.

Then the just no longer shall eat corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bread, which doth not free from death, neither drink wine which the earth doth bring forth, but shall eate the bread of Angels, that is, as the just shall live in the spirit as Angels; so they shall eate food which shal not putrifie nor perish, neither shall the elect of God,<note place="margin">Isa. 60.19</note> want any longer the light of the Sun by day, neither shall the Moone give them light by night; but

another question to you, and I desire you to answer me to it. The question is this, why doe not you Iewes believe in in our Messias, seeing that in him all the prophecies are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which are written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him in the Law and the Prophets; but do make your faces more hard than a rock,<note place="margin">Ier. 5.3.</note> yea though with open eies you see there is no salvation in the earth for the people, who walk in darknesse, and see no light?</p>

You aske why wee believe not in the Messias, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive him as you doe: to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I answer you thus: In your Christ the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are not fulfilled, which they did foretell concerning the Messias, neither are the mysteries of the Law fulfilled; although wee know the time of his comming is not far off; and therefore through all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, they which are of the seed of <hi>David</hi> with great desire do expect in their daies the comming of salvation, and the time of the King Messiah.</p>

               <p>And why, I pray you, doth that your Messias so long delay his comming to deliver you out of your tribulations in which you are? or how can GOD himselfe see for this so long time, your calamity which you suffer in this captivity, and doth not deliver you out of your troubles, executing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon your enemies? why doth he suffer you so to wander through the world, as sheep which have no shepherd? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that you have not a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and constant dwelling place. I desire to know the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why God hath cast you from him so many yeares, nor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109666:30"/>
doth at any time remember you for your good: For when of old he punisht your fathers for their sins, when they were converted, and did confesse, and praied unto him in their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, he forthwith delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and sent them a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, why doth hee not the same in this time of your grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous captivity?</p>

               <p>I wonder at this your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, when you say, you know not the cause why God hath cast you out of his presence, &amp; surely it must needs be for some great sin, such as you never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the beginning of the world, you, or your fathers, whatsoever it is. Furthermore, when you say the comming of the Messias is nigh, tell me I pray, what that is, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the <hi>Talmud.</hi> When <hi>Rabbi Ioshua</hi> the son of <hi>Levi</hi> did aske <hi>Elias</hi> when the Messias would come, and where is he? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109666:31"/>
at <hi>Rome</hi> amongst the weake; and going thither hee found him. If hee was then at <hi>Rome,</hi> doubtlesse he is come and borne already, and yee expect him in vaine.</p>

               <p>The Messias is not yet come, but he was borne in the time of the destruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the book <hi>Haggadoth,</hi> that is, the book of insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or denuntiations doth shew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christian.</speaker>
               <p>If hee was borne in the time of the desolation, from which time almost a thousand and five hundred yeares are now past, and at this day hee is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109666:32"/>
not yet come, when I pray you, or how will hee come, seeing that it is not allowed in nature, for any man to live a thousand and five hundred yeares.</p>

               <speaker>Iew.</speaker>
               <p>You know the first men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a long time, and that to the flood, as some came almost to the thousandth yeare;<note place="margin">Gen. 5.27</note> but <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> did live much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whom God kept alive, and who live to this very day; so the Messias being borne along time before, is yet preserved in life.</p>

               <p>It may easily bee demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from scripture, where he is. Consider, the first <hi>Adam</hi> in his first estate was in the earthly paradice, but because of his sin, he was cast forth from thence, as saith the Scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.24</note> God sent him out of the garden of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. It followes therefore, that he who was free from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of <hi>Adam</hi> should bee in Paradice; so our wise men have said, in the book of denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations.</p>

               <p>Know therefore, with us are three kinds of books, one kind of books we call the 24. which commonly are called the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and on these wee beleeve firmely, and with a perfect faith, because they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets, and other godly men, to whom the Lord made known his will, and did reveal mysteries. Another kind is called the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and is an Exposition or explanation o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the precepts of the Law; fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there are in the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> 613 precepts, and all these are explained in the <hi>Talmud</hi>; i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> which booke we also beleeve
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109666:33"/>
as in an exposition of precepts, which are in the hands of our Rabbies, who received it from their Fathers, and their Fathers received it from the Prophets, and they received it from God. Thirdly, wee have a kinde of books, which is called <hi>Medras,</hi> which signifies an inquisition or discussion of matters, and we commonly interpret it, a common opinion; for there what every man thought, and what seemed right to him, hee wrote down; wherefore they which believe these writings, do well, and he that doth not believe them, wrongs not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Some wise men say, and have also left it in writing to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109666:34"/>
us, that the Messias shall not be borne, untill the time of our deliverance is come, or shall draw nigh, that he may bring us out of that captivity; and I rather assent to this opinion, than their judgement, who say the Messias is borne long agoe, namely, in the time of the of the desolation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and we call the mentioned inquisition by another name, <hi>Haggada,</hi> that is, a denunciation; for it is nothing else but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine denunciation, whereby one man signifies any thing to another.</p>

               <p>Is the Messias alwaies at <hi>Rome,</hi> according to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <p>Hee is not alwaies at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at that time hee was seene there; for <hi>Elias</hi> said to <hi>Rabbi Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> the son of <hi>Levi,</hi> that at that time he should find him there, and he might be seen for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cause which is signified in <hi>Haggadoth,</hi> but which I meane not to reveale to you, nor to any other Christian, forasmuch as I know, our words are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in your eyes, and therefore we write such myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Tables of our heart.</p>

he will do thete, and why he will rather goe thither than to another place; and do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it from me.</p>

               <p>Because you have so earnestly intreated me, I will tell you, but see you disclose it not to others, for you know how they are wont to deride us, when they have heard our secrets. <hi>Haggada</hi> saith, the Messias remaines at <hi>Rome,</hi> untill he destroy it, as we read concerning <hi>Moses</hi> our Law-giver who was bred up in the house of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> untill at length he took vengeance of him,<note place="margin">Exo. 14. 28.</note> and drowned all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the sea and he came not presently after hee was borne,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109666:35"/>
and delivered <hi>Israel,</hi> but after many yeares, when the Lord God gave him command, then hee came and said to <hi>Pharaoh; Thus saith the Lord, let my people goe that they may serve me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 7:16</note> So the Messias when the fulnesse of time is come, shall come to the <hi>Pope</hi> by the command of God, and shall say to him, <hi>let my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go that they may serve me,</hi> then I say the Messias shall be said to have come, and till that time, he is not said to be come: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Messias called, as <hi>David</hi> the King was not King, or anointed the same day wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was borne, but after that <hi>Samuel</hi> had anointed him by the commandement of God,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109666:36"/>
then was hee anointed King,<note place="margin">1 Sa. 16.13</note> So when <hi>Elias</hi> hath anointed the Messias by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, then shal he be the Messias, and shall come; these things are out of <hi>Haggada.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christian.</speaker>
               <p>You tell me strange things, but all your words seem to be more like a lie than truth, for the Prophets of the Lord have taught far otherwaies; neither are the words of <hi>Haggada,</hi> true in this, when it will compare <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ, and the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an captivity, to the captivity of this time. For the Israelites in Egypt, did serve onely <hi>Pharoah</hi>; for it is thus written; <hi>Moses</hi> said to <hi>Pharaoh, let my people goe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exo. 7.16.</note> &amp;c.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109666:36"/>
for he alone, without another King, had the government over <hi>Israel,</hi> and when he would not let them go, God with a strong hand, and a stretcht out arme, and with great judgement, brought them forth.<note place="margin">Exo. 13.9.</note> But in the present captivity, the Iewes are not only under the power of the Pope, but are disperst and scattered into the foure parts of the world; seeing it is so, how can the Pope by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority let them goe, who are not at all found under his dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Furthermore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> delaid not after his nativity, but fourscore years, after which he delivered Israel;<note place="margin">Exod. 7.7</note> and when I turne my selfe to the words of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109666:37"/>
the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> which saith, the Messias is born, but hitherto hath delaid his comming, now a thousand and five hundred yeares; I easily conclude, that the words of the <hi>Thalmud</hi> are false, or the first comparison foolish. I would have you at least to take this to heart, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long captivity, which hath no end or bound, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, all which your fathers had in the captivity of <hi>Babel,</hi> yea after that they offended God by their manifold abominations, worshipping Idols, and profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sabbath, and other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, and turning away from all the commandements of God, proclaimed by <hi>Moses</hi>;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109666:37"/>
&amp; when they did these things, God sent the Prophets to them, to dehort them, and he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them by manifold rebukes, the Prophets telling them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they did breake off, they should bee carried out of their owne land,<note place="margin">Ier. 16.13.</note> and should fall into the hands of their enemies. Loe,<note place="margin">Ier. 12.7.</note> you see, that even in the worst times, they had Prophets who did threaten them, and againe gave them words of comfort, speaking to their hearts, even in that houre when they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the evill; likewise in the houre wherein they went into banishment out of their owne land, the Prophets came to them and comforted them, and

near to come, and my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to be revealed? blessed is the man that doth this, and the son of man that laieth hold on it, keeping the Sabbath from polluting it. From this we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Israelits do keep the Sabbath, and make repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they are not banisht from their own land. But in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern captivity the Iewes keepe the Sabbath, and other precepts of God, they make repentance, they pray, and give almes, why therefore doth not the Messias come? see how often they have made a great and solemn repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with their whole heart, and whole soule, and all their strength, that the end of their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109666:39"/>
captivity might bee revealed to them, but their prayer was not heard, they did that, especially in the 5262 yeare of the world, which was the 1502 yeare of Christ, when all the Iewes made a publick repentance through all their habitations, in all the earth, and through the whole captivity, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most for a whole yeare, both young men and old men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, such a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as was never heard of in the foregoing ages, and they did it for the comming of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, but all in vaine; for there was nothing revealed to them, neither token, or any signe; not to speake of any greater thing,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109666:40"/>
and truly that thing is a great wonder, a hissing, and clapping of hands to all who heare it, that nothing doth help them, not law, nor repentance, not prayer, neither any almes, all which they doe daily; is not this a manifest signe, that the Messias is already come? but because you refuse to believe this word, the keeping of the Law, and the works of your hands are nothing. Hence we may conclude thus; if for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance your freedome shall come, and the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your scattering, ye shall never be redeemed, forsomuch as you have alwaies been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people, and of a stiffe

Moreover, you see and know, how vaine the words of Rabbi are, who are here doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and perplext, and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst themselves: One hath said, the Messias shall not come, but in a generation which is wholly righteous, or in a generation which is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, and so thought <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Iohanan</hi> the son of <hi>Lacae,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it thus: In a generation which is wholly guilty, because it is thus written,<note place="margin">Isa. 59.16.</note> and hee saw there was no man, and he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that there was no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, therefore his arme brought salvation unto him, and his righteousnesse it sustained him. Also in a generation which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109666:41"/>
is wholly cleane, because it is thus written,<note place="margin">Isa. 60.21</note> and all thy people shall be just, they shall possesse the earth for ever. Also <hi>Rabbi Eleeser</hi> saith, if the Israelites shall make repentance, they shall immediately bee redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, seeing it is written,<note place="margin">Ier. 3.14.</note> turne or make repentance, O backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding children, to which <hi>Rabbi Ioshua</hi> answers thus, was it not said,<note place="margin">Isa. 5213.</note> you have sold your selves for nought in your idolatry, and shall bee redeemed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out monie, namely, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and good works? Hence wee gather, that the Rabbies themselves were doubtfull, whether the congregation of the captivity should bee made
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109666:41"/>
by repentance or not, and wee now already see, repentance hath profited you nothing; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the words of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies which they speak concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the modern captivity, are mere lies and errours, and that verse cited out of <hi>Isa.</hi> hee saw there was no man,<note place="margin">Isa. 59.16</note> &amp;c. doth justly agree with Iesus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the houre of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who saw none to repent; and for this cause it is rightly said, repent ye backsliding chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as if he should say, if they shall repent over this thing, and yet receive him, they shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately bee delivered: and this is the true repentance, and the good workes which yee

should do, to remove the stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block out of your hearts, and believe in the living God, and in the Messias, who is sent for salvation both to you and to us; then shall be fulfilled this saying of Scripture,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.31</note> they that wait upon the Lord, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their strength; they shall mount up with wings as Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, they shall run and not bee weary, &amp;c. for in the time when the Iewes shall receive unto themselves the Messias of the Lord, they shall be called the waiters upon the Lord, and he shall give them power and strength, and every good thing as from the beginning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is added, then they shal

Messias did appeare in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, doing there signs and wonders, such as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done in the whole world; he also taught the people, and shewed them the way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>

               <p>This answer is empty and foolish; for not for so little time the second could bee said to bee greater, since that in all other
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109666:44"/>
things, it was lesse than the first house: For as it is said,<note place="margin">Ezr. 3.12</note> 
                  <hi>many of the Priests and Levites, of the chiefe fathers and Elders of the people, who saw the first house, when the foundations of the second house were laid, and they standing by, saw it, they wept with a great voice, because that second house was as nothing in respect of the first, because the vessels of the first house were of gold, but of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond they were of brasse.</hi> And moreover, in the second house were wanting ten signs, which were done in the first sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Fathers, as the Rabbies write. 1. A woman did not make an aborsement, by reason of the smell of the sanctified
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109666:44"/>
flesh: 2. The holy flesh did not stink or was corrupt. 3. A flye was never seene where the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were slain. 4. The High Priest had no nightly unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the time of the solemne sacrifice. 5. The raine did not quench the fire by the holy place, burning continually in the pile of wood. 6. The wind did not scatter the pillar of smoak, ascending straight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven. 7. Mouldines or corruption was not found in the pot of Manna, in the two loaves, and in the shew bread. 8. They stood upright in the Temple, and when they bowed downe to worship, they had roome enough. 9. A Serpent, or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109666:45"/>
a scorpion did never hurt in the city Ierusalem. 10. Neither did ever any man say to his fellow, my place is so straight, that I cannot remaine in Ierusalem. Moreover, five other things were in the first Temple, which were not in the second; namely these; the arke, with the propitiatory, and the cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, fire sent from heaven, the holy spirit, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> that is, certaine holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries on the brest-plate of the chiefe Priest.<note place="margin">1 King. 8. 7.</note> You see now, that the second house was not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the first, because of the 10 yeares. I will also add this, that your Rabbies speak not the truth, when they say, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109666:45"/>
they shall build a third Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Land of Israel, and then the Messias shall come, seeing the Prophet doth speake plainly here, this is the last house, shewing as it were by his finger, the house which was then built, and was then standing; that house I say shall be in greater glory than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. But I desire to know from whence you Iewes have it, that there shall be a third Temple.</p>

               <p>What you write concerning the first and second house, is this; if the Israelites had not sinned, they should not have had but the first Temple, and it should have been worthy to be builded by the hand of God, according to that, <hi>Thy hands have establisht the sanctuary of the Lord</hi>;<note place="margin">Ex. 15.17</note> but because they sinned, they were the cause why that

Temple was built by the hands of men, as also the second; and hence it is that they had no firmnesse, according to that, they labour in vain who build it,<note place="margin">Ps. 127.1.</note> and the Lord himselfe shall by himselfe build <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and fulfill that Scripture, <hi>thy hands have established the sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord:</hi> and that, <hi>I will be to thee a fiery wal round about thee, and for a glory in the midst of thee.</hi>

                  <hi>and many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake,</hi> that is, the resurrection of the dead to life, shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the just, and the wicked shall also receive their bodies, but to be punished in them, and in their soules, and dye perpetually.

And is it not written in the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> in the Treatise <hi>Nisa,</hi> that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias shall not come, till the soules bee perfected from the body, that is, brought out of that closet, from whence the soules shall come which are created, for they so call the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Know therfore, their words are empty and foolish, when they frame expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of things

to come, for they doe it to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and obstinately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their errour, lest if they repented, and stood off from their purpose, they should lie under shame and disgrace; but they themselves confesse, they dare not for the people, sing a recantation, for otherwise they should be killed, because they have so blinded the eyes of the common people, with their false consolations. But I know you Iewes doe object to us Christians, that this gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to your so tedious banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because Iesus being born of the seed of <hi>David</hi> of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.30</note> made himselfe God, and drew many of the people to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109666:63"/>
him, who beleeved in him: which neverthelesse is a very bad errour with you, and your ancestors. Did they not kill him for it, and hang him upon a tree? if they had done well, God ought rather to hasten their redemption for that fact, even before the end of their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment were come, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing they had fulfilled that command,<note place="margin">Deu. 13.5</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt root out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill from the midst of thee;</hi> and did hee not promise this very thing to them by <hi>Moses</hi>? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if the words of Christ were lies, why did not God send some Prophet or vision, as he did in the daies of the Kings when they worshipped <hi>Baal,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:109666:63"/>
and other Idols, admonishing them to abstaine from that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and did reprove them? But forasmuch as this hath not been done, we may conclude, that his words and deeds were true and just. <hi>Blessed therefore is the man, who puts his trust in the Lord, and in his Christ, and whose confidence the Lord is</hi>; for the time wherein he hopes in him, and in the Messias sent in the second house.

               <p>The mentioned <hi>Haggada,</hi> saith also this of the Messias, that he praies for Israel, that the Lord would remit our sins; and he takes upon him chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and saith before him: I will take upon me sufferings, so that thou wilt quicken our dead, and not these dead onely, but they who have been slaine by men to this present, and not these onely who have died, but these who have been cast into
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109666:64"/>
the sea, and drowned, and who have been devoured by wolves, leopards, and other beasts. But this prayer shews him to be a man and not God; neither is it in his power to raise the dead. Moreover, those passions are nothing else but his sorrow, whereby he is grieved, that he delaies so long, seeing his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in captivity, and not being able to save them; hee sees that they worship a strange god, and deny the true God, making to themselves another Messias, and honouring him. Thou shalt also observe this, when the Israelites shall come out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, many and great miracles shall come to passe, and no
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109666:65"/>
power shall be in the great ones of this world to hinder them, and God shal bring forth many fountaines in the desert, in the mountaines, and in the middle of the vallies; neither shall hee doe that onely, but shall cause trees to grow in the deserts, to give shelter to the passers by, that the heat and the Sun smite them not. As it is written,<note place="margin">Isa. 41. 18</note> 
                  <hi>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, I will make the wildernesse a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.

for ever; and the men of this world shall say when they passe by them</hi>: these things the Lord did for the honour of Israel, and they shall confesse to the name of the Lord for this miracle for ever. Moreover it is written, <hi>they which waite upon the Lord, shall renew their strength,</hi>

Moreover, they shal be fed, because they shall finde every where so much as shall satisfie them, untill they shall come forth out of captivity, even in the high places, where at another time, no pasture is found for cattell, because of the desert of water, and in places, where other travellers can get nothing, they shall find all suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, v. 10. they shall no where suffer hunger or thirst, the Lord providing necessaries for them; who shall open in the deserts, fountains for them, and shall make fruit-bearing trees to grow for their profit; and all these things shall happen to

               <p>The first answer out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala is, our wise men have said thus: That in the daies of the Messias, they shall burne wood gathered up in the army of Gog and Magog seven yeares, so that in those seven yeares, they shall not need other wood, seeing it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109666:93"/>
is thus written,<note place="margin">Eze. 39.9.</note> 
                  <hi>They shall make or maintaine a fire with weapons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> said not, that seven yeares they should burne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of war,<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> so that they should not want other wood, and therefore the words of your wise men are false, and not true. Moreover, wee must say, that prophecy is a certaine obscure figure, whose interpretation is not sufficiently manifest to you, nor to us.</p>

               <p>The second is, the Prophets say in the time of the Messias, <hi>Nilus</hi> a river of <hi>Egypt</hi> shall bee dried up in one place, and the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109666:94"/>
river Euphrates in seven places, that there may be a passage for the redeemed Israelites; for it is thus written,<note place="margin">Isa. 11.15</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord shall dry up the tongue of the sea of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, that the remnant of my people may have a way.</hi> The third; The Prophets say that in the daies of the Messias, the mountaine of Olives shall bee rent through the middle, toward the North part, namely to be divided into two halfes, one halfe shall bend towards the North, and another towards the South; but through the gap or breach, a great river shall run, for it is written,<note place="margin">Zec. 14.4.</note> 
                  <hi>And the mountaine of Olives shall bee rent through the middle, to the East and to the West,</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:109666:94"/>
&amp;c. And it followes, <hi>in that day living waters shall goe forth out of Ierusalem.</hi> The fourth is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> namely, that the Temple shall be rebuilt according to its first forme and similitude. The fifth is explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the same place,<note place="margin">Eze. 47.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters shall goe forth of the Sanctuary, on each bank whereof, fruit-bearing trees fit for food shal grow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> &amp;c. But in the daies of the second Temple, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, none of these things are yet come to passe.</p>

               <p>The five answers which are gathered from clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, are taken out of the Prophets, who say that all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall beleeve in the Lord, for it is written,<note place="margin">Zec. 14.9.</note> 
                  <hi>God shall bee King over all the earth: in that day there shal be one God, and his name one</hi>: But now the Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and have many faiths, and they doe as they did at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

               <p>Although there bee divers and many faiths, neverthelesse, all Nations and people doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in one God, who created heaven and earth, some few

               <p>The second clear demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is also had from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who say that all the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites shall be in quiet and peace, safe from all annoiance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Kings, as it is said in <hi>Isa.

                  <note place="margin">Isa. 62.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not give thy corne any more for food to thine enemies</hi>: but hitherto wee have been in bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people. The third; The Prophets say, war shall bee no more in the world; for it is thus written, <hi>I will break the bow and the sword from the earth.</hi> And
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:109666:96"/>
againe, it is said,<note place="margin">Isa. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Nation shall not lift up sword against Nation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall they learne war any more.</hi> But to this time they make war, that people against this, and a man kils his neighbour, they quarrell among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, people with people, Prince with Prince, and all the earth is full of robbery, and plundering, as in antient daies.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:109666:96"/>
shall no more be called</hi> Iacob,<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>but Israel shall be thy name,</hi> and yet a little after, in the same place, he is thrice called <hi>Iacob.</hi> So in the book of <hi>Samuell,</hi> it is said,<note place="margin">1 Sa. 7.13</note> 
                  <hi>the Philistines came no more into the bounds of Israel,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse came into the land of Israel after the death of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sa. 28.4</note> So it is said here,<note place="margin">Isa. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>there shall be war no more,</hi> that is, there shall not be war at that time, when the Messias shall come, and shal be born; as it was in the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour, when our Christ was born in great peace, that men then might have broke, and turned their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning hooks
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109666:97"/>
if they would, for that manner of speaking is used by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>

               <p>The fourth is also expressed by the Prophets,<note place="margin">Isa. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>That the wolfe and the lamb shall feed together, and the lyon shall eat straw like the oxe, and the suckling child shall play upon the whole of the aspe</hi>; but these creatures are now hurtfull from the daies of old.</p>

               <p>The fifth is this, the land of Sodome shall bee rebuilt as it was from the beginning, seeing it is thus written,<note place="margin">Eze. 16. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>And I will
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:109666:97"/>
bring back the captivity of Edom, and his villages.</hi> For from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the waters of <hi>Sodom</hi> were sweet, and watering the Land, as it is written,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>And</hi> Lot <hi>lifted up his eies, and saw all the plaine of Iordan, which was water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where:</hi> But now to this day those waters are dryed up, and salt.

               <p>We have far digrest from our first discourse, when we began to speak of the war of Gog and Magog. Now therefore tell me what shall bee after that war.</p>

               <p>In those daies all men shall bee busied in wisedome, to know the Lord, as it is written,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.14</note> 
                  <hi>The earth shall bee filled with the knowledge of the Lord.</hi> Then that which <hi>Ieremie</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ier. 33.11</note> shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>A voice of joy and a voice of gladnesse shall be, and all shall say; confesse to the Lord of Hosts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord is good, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever, and they shall bring an oblation for thanksgiving into the house of the Lord.</hi> He doth not say, they shall bring an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for sinne and for iniquity, because in that time, wicked men and sinners shall not bee among them, but all shal know the Lord. Hence it is that our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109666:98"/>
Rabbies have said; all oblations shall be made void in the last times, except the oblation of thanksgiving. Moreover, in those daies they shall say no more,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 2,3.</note> 
                  <hi>the fathers have eaten sowre grapes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31.29</note> 
                  <hi>and the childrens teeth are set on edge,</hi> because then sinners shall bee cut off, neither those that sin at that time shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any great sin; then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall know that GOD is King over all, neither is there another besides him, and they shall come to Ierusalem, to learn the judgements of God and his lawes, even as he saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>come and let us goe up to the mount of the Lord, to the house of the God of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and he will teach us his waies,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109666:99"/>
and we will walke in his paths, for the Law shall goe forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. He shall judge among the Nations, and shall rebuke many people, and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their speares into pruning hooks.</hi> The Prophet speaks here of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias; for if war shall be raised among the Gentiles, or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons arise, they shall come to judgement before the King Messias, who shall be Lord of all the people, and hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and shall say to him who shall be found guilty, amend those faults which thou hast done against him who hath called thee to judgement.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109666:99"/>
And for this cause there shall not be war against people and people, because the King Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as shall pacifie them; neither shall they need instruments of warre, but shall break them,<note place="margin">Mic. 4.3.</note> to make of them instruments of husbandry. In that day the Lord shall bee exalted alone, who shall cast out Idols uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally: And although Idols have ceased already among some people, yet some are found in the East, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idols; likewise they are truly counted among worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Idols, who bend their knees, and make images.

               <p>At this day, and from many yeares there are not, neither have been idols in the world, as I said above, but all Nations worship one God, neither do we Christians adore and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship images, as you Iewes think, neither doe we beleeve that any power is in images, that they can bring us any help; but some among us, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselves to bee Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, doe adore and worship our Christ before images, as your fathers also formerly in the first house did adore and worship God before the Arke of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.<note place="margin">Ps. 138.2.</note> But let us leave these things, or reserve them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Concerning beasts you have it thus written,<note place="margin">Isa. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The wolfe shall dwell with the lamb, and the leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard shall lie down with the kid; and the calfe and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle child shall lead them, and the cow and the beare shall feed, their young ones shall lie downe together, and the lyon shall eat straw like the oxe, and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the aspes, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109666:101"/>
mountaine; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.</hi> Here are some sayings, that in the daies of the Messias, the natures of living creatures and beasts shall be changed, and they shall be as they were at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the creation, and as in the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi>: For if in the beginning of the creation, a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had devoured a sheep, one kinde of the creation had peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christian.</speaker>
               <p>What therefore did the lyon, and other devouring creatures eat then, who now eat flesh?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Iew.</speaker>
               <p>I say, if the lyon had eat the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109666:101"/>
flesh of any beast, the world had been deprived of that creature, forsomuch as all creatures first were created in each sex, male and female, and no more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the devouring crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures sustain hunger until cattel which might be devoured, had brought forth other individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, for the preservation of their kind; therefore it was necessary, that in the meane while they should eat the grass of the field, untill devourable cattell were bred and brought forth, then, and after that their nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee fed with flesh. Wee must think the same of them, for the time when they were in the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 6.19.</note> for if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109666:102"/>
creatures had destroi'd the devourable creatures, one kind had been wanting in the world, forasmuch as onely two and two were carried into the Ark,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.16</note> and no more in one kind; unlesse you would rather say, seven and seven of cleane beasts were carried in, for the necessity of the devouring. Some like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expound these words fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively, because the wolfe and the leopard, the beare and the lyon, doe signifie wicked men, tyrants, and violent extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, who fal upon the weak and poor, as devouring crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fall upon the weak cattell. For the sheep, the cow, the calf, and kid, do signifie the poor of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109666:102"/>
the earth. But there shall be so great a peace in the earth, in the daies of the Messias, that no man shall wrong his neighbor. I allow not this exposition; for the Prophet saith, they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountaine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christian.</speaker>
               <p>But I thinke this exposition true, seeing that <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> the Egyptian, write in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings upon the book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> after this manner: Let it not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy heart, that in the daies of the Messias, any thing is diminished of the course of this world, or any thing then renued of the workes of the six daies; but the world shall have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109666:103"/>
then its succession like the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of this time. So likewise of that place,<note place="margin">Isa. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>the wolf shal dwel w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the lamb,</hi> &amp;c. This is the sence, that Israel shall dwell in safety with the wicked of the world, who are compared to lions, wolfes and leopards. Finally, in the time of the Messias it shall be knowne to all, for what cause those similitudes were spoken, and what is signified by them. Thus much the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Rabbi Moses</hi> saith; and after this manner <hi>Iacob</hi> called <hi>Iuda</hi> a lyons whelpe, and <hi>Isachar</hi> he called a strong asse,<note place="margin">Ge. 49.27</note> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> a wolfe, &amp;c.

               <p>Our great Doctor, <hi>Moses</hi> the son of <hi>Maimon,</hi> saith, the Messias shall dye, and his son shall reign after him, and the son of his son shall succeed after his son in the Kingdome, neverthelesse the Messias shall live many daies, and at length hee shall die in great glory, and his son shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Empire, and after him his Nephew, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Neither you nor the son of <hi>Maimon</hi> understand the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and the mystery of the holy Scriptures. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Messias was to die, yet he was to die for our sins, <hi>for he was stricken, smitten of God,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109666:107"/>
and he was afflicted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and hee was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, yet he opened not his mouth: hee is brought as a lambe to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and from judgement, and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: for the transgression of my people was he smitten; and he made
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109666:107"/>
his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him, hee hath put him to griefe: when thou shalt make his soule an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his daies, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands. He shall see of the travell of his soule, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant justifie many, for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoile with the strong; because hee hath poured out his soule unto death; and hee was numbred with the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109666:108"/>
and hee bare the sinne of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</hi> You see here, what <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet hath said concerning the death of the Messias, how he should die for our sins, that he might save our soules, and might lead us into the Kingdome of heaven, and that he should see his seed, and should prolong his daies; and truly the pleasure of the Lord hath had a prosperous successe in his hand: Forasmuch as his name hath been magnified in the whole earth; and you who slew him, are disperst through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the nations; your house is desolate, and you are become of the people of God, not the

people of God, and of Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar inheritance, an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the eies of God, and of the sons of God, the sons of <hi>Belial.</hi> But on the contrary, they who beleeve in God, and in his Christ, these are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the possession, and the sons of God, and they shall never see death, because after this world, sin shall not bee, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, neither death which is the punishment of sin.</p>

                  <hi>Behold, a virgin shall conceive and beare a son, and shall call his name Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi> And in another place hee saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed, &amp;c.</hi> Doe you see how wonderfull things the Prophet hath spoke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Messias, and all these things are fulfilled in our Christ? Againe heare what the same Prophet saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>In that day the branch of the Lord shall bee beautifull and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent

and comely for them that are esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of Israel.</hi> Where <hi>Ionathan</hi> hath interpreted in Chaldee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner. In that time the Messias of the Lord shall be for joy and honour. Behold, the Messias is called the branch of the Lord, that is, the sonne of God, as also in <hi>Ieremiah</hi> he is called the branch of <hi>David,</hi> for he saith thus,<note place="margin">Ier. 33.15</note>

off, and hath blinded their eies, as it is written, <hi>Goe and tell this people, heare ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, and see yee indeed, but perceive not.

               <p>If your Christ is God and the true Messias, why did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale himselfe in the flesh? and why did hee not come openly, by renewing his law, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it publikely? for so the men of his age had not erred, neither should they stumble who come into this world af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; he should have done his works in publick, that all might beleeve on him, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that great multitude which he destroied, and deprived of redemption by his concealing himselfe; for because of that concealing, they were separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, and beleeved not in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:109666:121"/>Thou knowest not what thou saiest; hath he not shown in words and deeds, such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as no other did, that hee was the Messias and redeemer of the world, and yet your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers said, that by Beelzebub, and by the power of devils, that is, by magick art, he did all those things, lying against their own lives? Loe, God hath sent his own son, his onely son into the most pure womb of a virgin, as <hi>Isaias</hi> did foretell, and hee was made man within her, and born of her, without her pangs and griefe, and that by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, farre otherwise than other women bring forth, and that was not impossible, forasmuch as all things which doe far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109666:122"/>
the power of man, are possible to GOD, and by his power, a body might be created within a body, and be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the spirit. Also he could and he would send his glorious word within a pure virgin, that hee might bee incarnated within her, and be born of her, without any griefe or paine, and as he entred into her, so he went out of her; and she remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a virgin before and after the birth. But that child, who also is the glorious God, did walke upon the earth thirty three yeares that he might save man, for he was sent to the sons of Israel to redeem them, but because they were a people of a stiffe neck, and would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109666:122"/>
him, neither observe all the signes, such as no man ever did; the Gentiles come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with love, and the blessed God chose them for his peculiar people in stead of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and they were made the sons of <hi>Abraham</hi> for their faith, because <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of the faithfull, and beleevers in God are the sons of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He therefore was that Messias, of whom the Prophets did prophecy, and he walked thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares before hee became known to these who were in the world. But presently after that time, he manifested himself to the Israelites, that hee was the Christ of the LORD, and wrought signes and miracles,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:109666:123"/>
such as none of the Prophets ever did, shewing to the whole world, that he came to redeem man for sin, as it is written, <hi>He was wounded for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; and hee made a new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us, according to that which is said in <hi>Ieremy, Behold, the daies come saith the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 31.31</note> 
                  <hi>and I will make with Israel and with Iudah a new covenant, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the covenant which I made with their fathers, for I will put my Law in their inward parts,</hi> &amp;c. therefore it is manifest from these sayings, that the Lord would make with the Israelites a new covenant, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that covenant which he made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he made a covenant with him
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:109666:123"/>
                  <hi>that every male child should be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ge. 17.12</note> but this covenant was another covenant, namely, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, in which by the power of Christs sufferings, all mans sin is remitted, and that signe or Sacrament is common to male and female. Moreover, he gave them a new law after that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was fulfilled; for the Law was given to Moses onely for a time, as you have it written in the <hi>Thalmud,</hi> in the Treatise of Idolatry, where it is said, that the law was given but for 2000 yeares; for the Fathers of good memory say thus; That the world must endure 6000 yeares, that it should bee 2000 yeares void and without form, that after two thousand yeares,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:109666:124"/>
the Mosaicall Law should bee given; that it should stand 2000 years under the Law, and 2000 yeares under the Messias, then it should returne to its owne rudenesse. But now the 2000 yeares of the Law, and besides many above a thousand are past, and your Messias is not yet come, as ye Iewes say. There is also another sign, that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was given for a time, because the Prophet saith, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the law of Moses my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 4.</note> hee doth not say, doe the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as if hee should say: In the time of the Messias remember the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then all things which are written in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the Messias, shall be
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:109666:124"/>
fulfilled: for the offerings and sacrifices of oxen and sheep, did foreshew the sacrifice of the Messias, when he was led forth for a sacrifice, <hi>and as a sheep which before the shearers is dumb, so ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he not his mouth,</hi> but with his blood hee hath washt us from our sins, and hath cleansed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our iniquities. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore O Iewes, I turne my selfe to you. Behold, yee pray mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening in all your prayers, that the Messias and the Redeemer may bee sent to you, and ye stand in the feast of propitiation from the evening to the morning, crying and praying with your whole heart, and your whole strength to the Lord, that hee would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109666:125"/>
heare you, and send you the Messias, but there is no change of your state, there is none who understands your prayers, or who opens the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and takes you out of this life, and much lesse, who sends your Messias; yea, to speake somewhat more, nothing is seen, nothing is heard, there is no voice or vision which may tell you the comming of the Messias. And behold, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the blessed God is, to heare the prayers of the just,<note place="margin">Pro. 15.8, 29.</note> and it is impossible according to your assertion, who say your faith is true, that there hath not been some just in all these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations which have been from the daies of the desolation
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109666:125"/>
of the Temple to this present, that the blessed God hath not heard their praier, and hath sent them the Messias for their merits, or that some signe hath not been revealed to them, or vision shewed, or voice heard, whence they might have a sign of his comming. Furthermore, for what cause doe you thinke the Messias doth so long defer his comming, that he doth not redeem you? How can hee in this so long time, see your tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations which yee suffer in this banishment, and doth not deliver you out of your tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, neither executes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against your enemies? why doth hee suffer you so to wander through the deserts,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109666:126"/>
as sheep without a pastour, and have not any certain dwelling? why hath he cast you from him now so many yeares, and doth not remember you with God? Truly when formerly hee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised your fathers for their sin, presently after they confest, and praied, and humbled themselves before him in their captivity, presently I say hee delivered them, although they had even committed Idolatry, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> had polluted the sabbath and solemnities, had broke the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham</hi>; yet I say, notwithstanding these, when they repented, and did confess their sins, forthwith he heard their prayers, he repented of the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109666:126"/>
evil inflicted upon them, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, and every day sent them the Prophets to comfort them in their banishment, yea, when before they were certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the end of their captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Ier. 29.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
