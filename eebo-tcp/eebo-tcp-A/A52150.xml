            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(since thou must needs <hi>Transprose</hi>) hast had the fortune to light upon the <hi>Rehearsal</hi>; for, since people will be so idle as (<hi>at first dash</hi> you see) to ask, what <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify</hi>'s <hi>Impudent Modesty?</hi> Thou may'st <hi>there</hi> find an <hi>Answer</hi> which no <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> but <hi>Bayes</hi> ever light upon, and, may'st tell them, <hi>Nay pray Sirs, have a little patience: Godsookers you'l spoil all my Transprosal. Why 'tis impossible to answer every impertinent Question you ask.</hi> But, for all this, I know his <hi>Majesty</hi> does not <hi>intend</hi> his <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> shall extend to <hi>Nonconformity</hi> in <hi>Sense</hi> also: and therefore, for this time I will <hi>tie</hi> you to that <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as to <hi>Speak it.</hi>

            <p>But, to proceed: you <hi>hoped</hi> (ay,

and I dare say would have lost your <hi>ten pound wager</hi> on the Condition) <hi>that He,</hi> nor <hi>nobody</hi> else would have written any more in behalf of the <hi>King of Englands Rights</hi> (for all your being sure you had the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprosing</hi>;) but he hath, that there are <hi>Grounds for Fears &amp; jealousies of Popery.</hi> And pray, are there not? Since the <hi>Popish Interest</hi> (as your self make anon appear) is <hi>founded</hi> chiefly upon Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people in <hi>Ignorance</hi>; and some of the <hi>wisest</hi> of them are so <hi>Ignorant</hi> already as to talk of <hi>Impudent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi>; yet if such kind of <hi>Terms</hi> seem <hi>necessary</hi> for the <hi>Ends</hi> you <hi>use</hi> them, then <hi>Oh too frail Reason that contradicts Transprosal</hi>! But let's see; what is the <hi>mischief</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> is going to do? <hi>To trick up Bishop Bramhal in a yellow Coif, and a Bulls Head?</hi> What sense the Author can be said to <hi>trick him up in a Bull's Head</hi> in, I confess, I do not understand. But, your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits</hi> are all so <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> that I am confident you <hi>mean something</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But you say, <hi>'Twas happy when all Learning was in Manuscript, &amp; some little Officer like the Author kept the Keys of the Library</hi>: I doubt you'l find him a great Officer by and by, and the <hi>Door</hi> of his <hi>Preface</hi> so well kept, that it will be past your Skill to <hi>pick</hi> the

            <p>You say next, the <hi>Mischief of Printing is, that, now if a man write a Book presently he is answered:</hi> Here you must give us leave to <hi>distinguish</hi> betwixt <hi>Transprosing</hi> and <hi>Answering.</hi> 'Tis plain some Persons are presently <hi>Transprosed,</hi> but we can't perceive that any of the <hi>Principal</hi> things they say are <hi>Answered.</hi>

            <p>But to your Arguments, and first to the <hi>latter:</hi> Your Author Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> divides his Discourse of <hi>Schism</hi> (you say) into two main Branches; The <hi>Cause</hi> of it, and the <hi>Occasion</hi> of it. The <hi>Occasion</hi> he again subdivides, but upon the whole upon this Head he asks, <hi>Who shall be Iudge?</hi> Now say we) Let that question be asked
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60440:44"/>
not onely of who gives the occasion of <hi>Schism,</hi> but of who gives the <hi>Cause</hi> also; or (if you please) of whether it be a <hi>Cause</hi> or no. You will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find no body but the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is proper Judge of either. Now (to do you a Courtesie <hi>Trans</hi>) if you think this very same answer be not a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason to warrant our <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> also, (Reserving still like you, that I know what I know) at this time for shortness sake I will trouble you with no other. And if you had thought good, I might have had your mind in as <hi>short</hi> a compass as I have told you mine. And so you have indeed (in less then seven leaves) proved (as you say) that <hi>Schism rimes to Ism,</hi> and just <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> else.</p>
            <p>Now, for <hi>having undergone this grateful Penance</hi> (He means done the <hi>meritorious</hi> Act) of transcribing these Citations, He exults and Cackles like any Hen, that were just come off

            </p>
            <p>Here follows a fond Expression, which it is easie to apprehend the <hi>Prefacer</hi> used as repeating words of the Persons whom he answered: Yet <hi>Trans</hi> could not make less then a whole side of it; but I shall.

            <p>How simply do you next sneer at such things for <hi>Flowers</hi> as are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Books in distinct Characters? Is not your own Book full of them? A man is put to a hard shift for a conceit, if for having it He must Jeer himself: Then you pursue, (for you alwaies run on upon any <hi>scent</hi>) and bring in, telling us the <hi>advantages</hi> Booksellers may set out Books with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as <hi>fine paper, large fair Letter, Calves Leather Covers,</hi> &amp;c. Though this (as it happens) is the onely useful thing

your Book teaches; being very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Information for us <hi>young Authors,</hi> and so truly I thank you Lovingly, and I'le take a <hi>Copy</hi> of this. But the word he now finds thus marked in the Preface is <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricalness. Ism</hi> (it seems) is lost, but there's another Rattle for the Child like <hi>Sheerness, Dongioness, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerness,</hi> and <hi>Cathness</hi>: So he falls a Playing with <hi>Ness.</hi> Now for all your witty Conceit, this does but come from the <hi>Nesses, Tudes and Ty's</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury (Odi Imitatores)</hi> which have this difference: That they were first <hi>His own,</hi> secondly <hi>New,</hi> thirdly <hi>Brief.</hi> But your's are —<hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation of Tartarians,</hi> as you may see in my <hi>Cutter of Colemanstreet Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spros'd</hi> Pag. the 84th. just at this place.</p>
            <p>But in pursuance: <hi>Bayes</hi> having translated <hi>Peace,</hi> Gal. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into <hi>Peaceableness,</hi> &amp;c. He asks which of the <hi>Systematical, German, Geneva, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox

Divines</hi> (Do you understand him beloved, you that are his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> You see he distinguishes you all from the <hi>Orthodox</hi>) <hi>nay of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> (here I'm sure he held his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief before his face to hide his laughing) <hi>Intelligent, Episcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> could not (how simple soever you are all) have taught him better then such <hi>Forgery</hi> or <hi>Ignorance</hi> as this? The reason is plain, for we shall but be laid by the heels if we don't keep the <hi>Peace</hi>; but to require <hi>Peaceableness</hi> of us, is to exact our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing really good and worthy men; and that's worse then a <hi>Penal</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>Here he takes an occasion from the Day of <hi>Iudgment's</hi> having been mentioned betwixt <hi>I. O.</hi> and the <hi>Prefacer,</hi> (in which was no occasion to do thus) to talk himself very lightly of it: <hi>Ironically</hi> cites Proofs of it out of what he calls the <hi>Fanatical</hi> Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the <hi>Scotch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</hi> This Discourse takes up two
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60440:47"/>
leaves in him; but I shall prosecute it no further.</p>
            <p>Then he comes to Point of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and treats nicely (taking no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice whom he imitates) of the <hi>Lu</hi>: More Quotations out of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsal</hi>;

            <p>Next we come to <hi>Symbolicalness</hi>; which you tax the Author for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving describ'd in several extravagant fashions: I know not with what Fidelitie you have either collected, or do present them to us. I confess I am no Approver of <hi>swelling</hi> nor <hi>harsh</hi> expressions: But whereas you say this <hi>Symbolicalness</hi> is a <hi>flower,</hi> nay a <hi>flower of the Sun,</hi> made at the <hi>Cock</hi> or <hi>Nags-head</hi>; I say 'tis pity neither of

            <p>But Mr. <hi>Bayes,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Thunder,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>; why Mr. <hi>Trans,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Toleration,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Guy Faux,</hi> he is not ashamed to be call'd <hi>Player</hi> by him that calls <hi>Preaching Playing his part</hi>: and if you call him as many Names as <hi>Philippus, Aureolus, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus, Paracelsus, Bombast of Hohen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> he will be still ready to make an answer to <hi>Satan, Lucifer, Belzebub, Leviathan, Abaddon.</hi>

in binding up this <hi>Sampson</hi> with his own words, <hi>as fast</hi> (you say) <hi>as such a Proteus could be pinion'd.</hi> It seems then you begin to perceive he's loose again already. He is so; but the reason (you Goose) is, not because he is <hi>Proteus,</hi> but because your Cords were slight ones, and the Knots <hi>slipt.</hi> You should have <hi>cut off his Beard,</hi> and have made a <hi>Simarr</hi> of it, and then you had had him <hi>sure.</hi> Well, but <hi>Trans</hi> fain would do something though; and <hi>let Bayes make more or less of it if he can.</hi> Why you have been defying him all this while, have you not?

            <p>Well, I have lookt to the End, &amp; see it's in vain to spur, for thou art quite tired, and settest (in a kind of a hard <hi>Trot</hi>) to give us solemnly the <hi>Reasons</hi> that occasioned thy Writing. Why <hi>Trans</hi> you must know that we take our selves to have very good reason to suspect that you writ this Book, but one <hi>Reason,</hi> and that is, for a Reason that was <hi>Given</hi> you. For it seems to me (thou goest on so lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly every where) that thou wer't meerly dragg'd to't, after a much wiser man (as I am inform'd) had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the Imployment.

your <hi>private Fortune and Education,</hi> and <hi>Your Thoughts</hi> (as well as <hi>Bayes</hi> his) resolved <hi>which way to work themselves,</hi> when you saw Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments produced for it. That were not meerly <hi>symbolical.</hi>

            <p>But le'ts see, what are thy <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?</hi> First, you were <hi>offended</hi> at Bayes's <hi>Arrogant Style; since there is nothing</hi> (you say) <hi>in it worth his own taking notice of.</hi> Why, <hi>Trans,</hi> this is the strangest Reason that ever I heard, that it should be pity that a man that writes simply should be so fond as to <hi>like</hi> his work: I should think rather 'twere pity but he should be condemn'd for his pains to the <hi>stupidity</hi> of never knowing what an <hi>Ass</hi> he had made himself. So that you and I differ clearly (though we are both (I see) <hi>Tender-hearted</hi>) in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our Charity: For in your case now I am content you should think you have done very well still.</p>
