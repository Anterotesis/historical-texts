            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Howard.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Challenge the Performance of your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<q>That you will not take it ill, if any Man shall offer Reasons unclogg'd with Passion against any thing you have writ; and that if you cannot clearly answer them you will submit, and acknowledge your Error.</q>
Amongst some Papers enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>Polemica Christiana,</hi> publish'd before I saw the Book entitled, <hi>A Twofold Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. there are some Reflections on your <hi>History of Religion,</hi> which, if I had known to have been yours, perhaps I might not have us'd some of the <hi>Expressions</hi> which you will find in those Reflections: But whatever they are, GOD is my Witness, no <hi>Inordinate Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but a <hi>Fervent Love</hi> of the Truth, you oppose, prompted me to those Conceptions, which I design'd to declare by them. That prodigious <hi>Huff</hi> of your Friend shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58803:3"/>
me from publishing some more of my Amimadversions upon your Book.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The History of Religion is a Test upon all its Readers: No Man can declare his Dislike of that Book, but at the same time he proclaims that he esteems the Substance of Religion to consist in that, which is least to be understood, that he is all for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</q>
GOD knows I am not for any other <hi>Discipline</hi> but what may conduce to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD, and the Good of Men. Yet I must declare to all the World that I dislike your Book: In which, p. 43. I find these Words:
<q>I wish that among the most <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Christians these Methods of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft were not so much, and violently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued; the Impositions to believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess unnecessary, and even extravagant things, where neither Reason will justifie it, nor does Religion require it.</q>
Here you come out of your <hi>Hole,</hi> and plainly enough acknowledge that you charge <hi>the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>with</hi> PRIESTCRAFT, as well as <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome. Does not Religion require that the <hi>Profession</hi> of believing that JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Saviour of the World,</hi> is the true and eternal GOD, should be the <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Term of Christian Communion?</hi> If you shall be pleas'd to let us know what you mean by <hi>unnecessary, and even extravagant things,</hi> I trust in GOD I shall be able to give you an Answer. I have formerly animadverted on thesé Words, p. 63.
<q>A Man must be his own Expositor, Minister, Bishop, and <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58803:3"/>
Council.</q>
I shall now give you some of my Thoughts upon the Words following,
<q>for these will not <hi>bear</hi> his Punishment, he must <hi>bear</hi> it himself.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Therefore a Man ought not to be his own Expositor, Minister, Bishop, and Council, because if he be so, he shall bear the Punishment of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to them, whom our blessed LORD, by his <hi>Apostle,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to obey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that must give Account.</hi>
               <q>Those Powers and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, say you, given to others, was the Cause of making and multiplying Creeds, and Rules of Faith, which ever were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell'd according to the present Interests and Animosities of prevailing Parties.</q>
Here you revile <hi>all Councils,</hi> and consequently cut off your self from the Body of the <hi>visible Church</hi> of CHRIST. 'Tis evident that he cannot be a true Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that contemns the <hi>four first general Councils,</hi> or any one of them. To say that the <hi>Creeds,</hi> or <hi>Forms of sound Words,</hi> which were made by the Councils of <hi>NICE</hi> and <hi>CONSTANTINOPLE</hi> (the two other Councils, <hi>viz. Eph.</hi> and <hi>Chalc.</hi> made none) were not Modelled <hi>according to Godliness</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) but <hi>according to the present In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and Animosities of prevailing Parties,</hi> is, I think, the greatest <hi>Slander,</hi> that any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man professing himself to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was ever guilty of,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58803:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
however provok'd by any <hi>Interest</hi> or <hi>Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> I pray GOD to give you true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. P. 96.
<q>'Tis not reasonable, say you, to believe that GOD who knows our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, will punish <hi>Error</hi>; which is no Sin, because it comes not from the Will and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: One Man may be weaker than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and <hi>both</hi> may mistake more or less, according to the difference of their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but neither of them is thereby guilty, because the Mistakes and Opinions proceed from their Innocence, which is to say their Weakness and Ignorance.</q>
This Conceit of yours is grosly <hi>erroneous,</hi> that <hi>Error</hi> comes not from the <hi>Will.</hi> I grant that <hi>Nescience,</hi> or the <hi>not knowing</hi> of any thing, which comes not from the <hi>Will</hi> is no Sin: But I assert that all <hi>Error</hi> comes from the <hi>Will,</hi> being a <hi>false</hi> or <hi>irregular Judgment,</hi> an <hi>Assent to that which is false,</hi> or a <hi>Dissent from that which is true.</hi> 'Tis not only possible, but our absolute Duty to SUSPEND <hi>our Judgment,</hi> where we have no Evidence of the Truth or Falsehood of any <hi>Proposition.</hi> 'Tis wisely observ'd by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> that
<q>'tis agreeable to Nature, that is, to right Reason, that we should suspend our Judgment concerning any thing, of which we have no Evidence.</q>

<q>Every (rational) Soul acting according to her Nature assents to that which is true, dissents from that which is false, suspends her Judgment in Matters of which she has no Evidence or <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58803:4"/>
Certainty.</q>
All false Judgments are <hi>self-Conceits,</hi> which always proceed from <hi>self-will,</hi> which is the <hi>Head Spring</hi> or <hi>Fountain</hi> of all Iniquity.
<q>I did not think to have taken the Libeller to task, says your Friend, for any other of his wild Talk about Mystery, because all the common Mistakes on that Topick are so manifestly discover'd by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Master, that I do not expect a Man of Reputation will in hast venture a Defence against him.</q>
I do not pretend much to <hi>Reputation</hi>: I am willing to be <hi>made as the Filth of the World, and the Off-scouring of all things.</hi> But I solemnly profess, by the Grace of GOD, to <hi>hold the</hi> MYSTERY <hi>of the Faith in a pure Conscience:</hi> And I should defile my Conscience with a very soul <hi>Sin of Omission,</hi> if I should not publish my <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions</hi> upon that very wicked Book entitled <hi>Christianity not mysterious.</hi> I Beseech <hi>the only wise GOD</hi> to convince you of all your <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and to lead you by his holy Spirit into all <hi>Truth,</hi> and to give you all things which he knows to be best for you,</p>

               <q>REason, says this Author, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, that Faculty of the Soul, which discovers the Certainty of any thing dubious or obscure, by comparing it with something evidently known.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is no Definition of <hi>Reason,</hi> but an inadequate Description of the <hi>Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect or Understanding.</hi> ESSENTIAL REASON IS INFINITE WISDOM or KNOWLEDGE absolutely perfect of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absolutely infinite. Being absolutely IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FINITE communicating it self to <hi>the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Understanding,</hi> produces that <hi>Conception</hi> which we call the IDEA OF GOD. This is REASON PARTICIPATED by all <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Creatures. The Humane Intellect or Understanding is that Power or Faculty of the Soul of Man, by which he is capable of apprehending or perceiving that there is <hi>a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58803:5"/>
Being absolutely infinite,</hi> that is, GOD; and that all Finite Beings, Natures, or Essences, and all <hi>natural</hi> Motions or Operations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from him. The <hi>Intellect</hi> is commonly call'd <hi>Reason.</hi> The Ground of which Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is this, that every Act of the <hi>Intellect</hi> or <hi>Understanding,</hi> so far as it is not deprav'd or perverted by the <hi>Will,</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Perception</hi> of ESSENTIAL REASON in it self, or in its Effects.</p>
            <p>P. 23, 24.
<q>No <hi>Christian</hi> I know of now expresly says <hi>Reason</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one another: But, which returns to the same, very many affirm, that tho the Doctrines of the latter cannot in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be contradictory to the Principles of the former, as proceeding both from GOD, yet that according to our Conceptions of them, they may seem directly to clash: And that tho we cannot reconcile them by reason of our corrupt and limited Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; yet that from the Authority of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> we are bound to believe and acquiesce in them; or, as the Fathers taught 'em to speak, to <hi>adore what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We do not say that <hi>Reason</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> do ever seem to clash, or to contradict one another, but only to those Men, who by the Perverseness of their <hi>Will,</hi> averting it self from the <hi>Divine Goodness,</hi> avert their <hi>Understanding</hi> from the <hi>Truth</hi> of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is destructive to all their <hi>Lusts</hi> or Inclinations arising from the <hi>false Appearance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58803:6"/>
of Good.</hi> We say indeed that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have taught us, according to the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> that we must <hi>adore</hi> what we cannot <hi>comprehend.</hi> He that performs any true and acceptable Worship to Almighty GOD, does most humbly and heartily acknowledge that the Object of his Worship has all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Perfection that he can apprehend or conceive, as signified by these Words, <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c. And that it is infinitely more excellent and glorious than can ever be any way apprehended or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels.</hi> 'Tis evident that though we know GOD in some measure, he infinitely transcends the Comprehension of our <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Understanding.</hi> But says our Adversary, p. 78.
<q>to comprehend in all correct Authors, is nothing else but to know.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Comprehension is Knowledge, but
all Knowledge is not Comprehension: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
is that Knowledge which extends
to all that can be known of the <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P: 88.
<q>As for GOD, we Comprehend nothing better than his Attributes. We know not, tis true the Nature of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Subject,</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> wherein Infinite Goodness, Love, Knowledge, Power and Wisdom coexist; but we are not better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>real Essence</hi> of any of his Creatures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here 'tis manifest that this Man's most prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Self-conceit</hi> and Affectation of SINGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARITY averts his <hi>Understanding</hi> from a

due Reflexion upon the true IDEA OF GOD in his own Soul, and in the Souls of all Men, in the Contemplation whereof we may easily discern this Truth, that the several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attributes are several Significations or Manifestations of the one Being absolutely Infinite and incomprehensible. They are not in GOD, or the <hi>Divine Essence,</hi> as <hi>Accidents</hi> in a <hi>Subject.</hi> To talk of the <hi>Nature of an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> is an Absurdity, which, I think, no <hi>Scholar</hi> was ever guilty of, but the Author of this most impious <hi>Libel</hi> against the <hi>Holy Catholick Church.</hi> There cannot be a more Notorious Contradiction than to say we COMPREHEND INFINITE <hi>Goodness, Love,</hi> &amp;c. We grant that every Pious Man is better acquainted with the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi> than with the Properties of any Creature: But we know 'tis absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any Man or Angel to <hi>Comprehend</hi> the Divine Essence; and we know 'tis not so impossible to comprehend the Nature or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of any Creature. Therefore I think it my Duty to proclaim to all the World my just Abhorrence and Detestation of the blind Boldness of this <hi>insolent</hi> Writer.
<q>I think, says he, I may now warrantably conclude that nothing is a Mystery because we know not its Essence, since it appears that it is neither knowable in it self, nor ever thought of by us: So that the divine Being himself cannot, with more Reason, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>mysterious</hi> in this respect than the most contemptible of his Creatures.</q>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the <hi>divine Being</hi> be truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally INFINITE, then there is infinite more Reason that this <hi>Being</hi> should be accounted <hi>mysterious</hi> in this respect, that it <hi>passeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or the utmost Capacity of our intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Faculty, than the most glorious of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>P. 91.
<q>Such Revelations of God in the New Testament are call'd Mysteries not from any present Inconceivableness or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, but with respect to what they were before this Revelation, as that is called our Task, which we long since perform'd.</q>

If <hi>Jesus Christ, the everlasting Son of the Father,</hi> were not <hi>Reveal'd,</hi> he could not be the Object of <hi>Our Faith:</hi> But the clearest Revelation we have of him does not make him cease to be a MYSTERY. <hi>Great is the</hi> MYSTERY <hi>of Godliness.

            <p>The holy Apostle calls the <hi>principal Subject</hi> of all his preaching (<hi>viz.</hi>) that JESUS CHRIST <hi>is the Propitiation for the Sins of the whole World</hi>) a MYSTERY both with respect to its having been <hi>kept secret,</hi> and with respect to its present <hi>Manifestation.</hi> If the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> signified nothing else, but a Matter <hi>kept secret, viz.</hi> wholly secret or undiscover'd, then indeed the Matter being <hi>Reveal'd,</hi> there would be no <hi>Mystery.</hi> But certainly if the word had no other Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of a Matter <hi>kept secret,</hi> the Apostle would never have us'd this <hi>Expression, the Revelation of the Mystery that was kept secret.</hi> But says our Adversary, Yes: Even "<hi>As that may be call'd our Task which we have long since perform'd.</hi>
