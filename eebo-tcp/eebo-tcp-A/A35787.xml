         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Noble LADY,

Lady of Tabarriere, and Baroneſs
of St. Hermine, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now almoſt four Years ſince that your
Son, the late Baron of <hi>St. Hermine,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
me with what manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
He was ordinarily entertained at
Court, by thoſe who laboured to advance
the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, the rather to make him
diſguſt the <hi>Reformed,</hi> told me, That the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Argument which they urged againſt him,
was, <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the <hi>General Conſent</hi> of all
the Fathers of the Firſt Ages of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
And although of himſelf He underſtood well
enough the Vanity of this Argument of theirs;
yet notwithſtanding, for his own fuller ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
He deſired me that I would diſcover unto
Him the very Bottom and Depth of this Buſineſs.
This therefore I did, as Exactly as poſſibly I
could, and gave Him my Judgment at Large in
this Particular: Which Diſcourſe of mine He
was pleaſed to like ſo well, that conceiving
ſome hopes from thence, that it might happily be
of uſe to others alſo, I ſhortly after put Pen to
Paper, and digeſted it into this Treatiſe You
<pb facs="tcp:98310:3"/>
now ſee. It having therefore been Compoſed at
firſt for His Service, I had reſolved alſo with
my ſelf to have Dedicated it to His Name; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
by this ſmall Piece of Service, to teſtifie
to the World the Continuation of the Affection
I bare to His Progreſs in Piety. But that deadly
Blow which ſnatched Him from us in the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of His Age, about two Years ſince, at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Siege of <hi>Boſledue,</hi> having left us nothing
of Him now, ſave onely the Spoils of His Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
and the Memory of His Vertue, together
with our Great Sorrow for having enjoyed Him
here ſo ſhort a time; I am conſtrained, Madam,
to change my former Reſolution. For, to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my Book to Him, in the State wherein He
now is, in Heaven; following the Example of
many, both Ancients, and Modern Writers, who
have not ſtuck to direct their Diſcourſes from
hence below, to thoſe whom God hath taken up
into Heaven; I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that
the Practiſe is either Lawful, or Fit. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Vanity of the Thing, ſhould we hold
Diſcourſe with one, who, being at ſo great, and
almoſt infinite a Diſtance from us, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
hear what we ſay; I ſhould account it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
if ſo be He could hear us, a Point of extreme
Inhumanity, I had almoſt ſaid, Impiety, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
that Perfect Reſt His Bleſſed Soul now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth;
which hath now no more to do with our
Debates or Diſcourſes here below, but ſees the
Truth now in a moſt pure Light, and enjoys
that Everlaſting Bliſs wherewith our Saviour
<pb facs="tcp:98310:3"/>
hath out of his Mercy crowned His Faith, and
Perſeverance in the Fear of His Name. I ſhall
therefore content my ſelf with cheriſhing, and
preſerving, whilſt I live, the precious Memory of
His Worth, the Excellency of His Wit, the Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of His Judgment, the Sweetneſs of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Fairneſs of His Carriage, and thoſe
other Choice Parts, wherewith He was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed;
but above all His ſingular Piety, which
clearly ſhone forth in His Words, and Actions,
till the hour of His Death.</p>
            <p>And Madam, as for this ſmall Treatiſe, which
was at firſt conceived and compoſed for Him, I
thought I could not, without being guilty of a
piece of Injuſtice, preſent it to any other, but
Your Self: ſeeing it hath pleaſed God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Common Order of Nature, to make
You Heir to Him, to whom it belonged. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
only hath emboldned me to preſent it
to Your Hands; knowing that the Nature of this
Diſcourſe is not ſo ſuitable to that Sorrow which
hath of late caſt a Cloud over Your Houſe; it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pleaſed God, after the death of the Son, to
deprive You of the Father; and to the Loſs of
Your Children, to add that alſo of Your Noble
Husband. But, my deſire of avoiding the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, hath forced Me to be thus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivilly
Troubleſome: ſeeing I accounted it a kind of
Theft, ſhould I have any longer withheld from
You that which was Your Right, by this Sad
Title of Inheritance. Be pleaſed therefore,
Madam, to receive this Book, as a part of the
<pb facs="tcp:98310:4"/>
Goods of your Deceaſed Son; which I now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
reſtore, in the view of the whole World,
after ſome times Concealment of it in my Study.
This Name, I know, will oblige You to afford it
ſome place in Your Cloſet, which is all that I
can at preſent deſire. For, as for the reading
of it, beſides that Your Exquiſite Piety (which
is built upon Infinitely much Firmer Grounds,
than theſe Diſputes,) hath no need at all of it;
I know alſo, that Your preſent Condition is ſuch,
as that it would be very Troubleſome unto You.
And if You ſhall chance to deſire to ſpend ſome
hours in the Peruſal of it; it muſt be hereafter,
when the Lord, by the Efficacy of His Spirit,
ſhall have comforted Yours, and ſhall have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
the Violence of Your Grief: to whom I
pour out my moſt earneſt Prayers, that He would
vouchſafe Powerfully to effect the ſame, and to
ſhed forth His moſt holy Grace upon You, and
Yours; and that He would by His great Mercy
preſerve, Long, and Happily, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
of that Goodly, and Bleſſed Family,
which He hath beſtowed upon You. This,
Madam, is one of the moſt Hearty Prayers of</p>

               <signed>Your moſt Humble, and
Obedient Servant,
DAILLE.</signed>

            <p>THE Fathers cannot be the Judges of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
in Religion at this day betwixt the Papiſt
and the Proteſtant. 1. Becauſe it is, if not an
impoſſible, yet at leaſt a very difficult thing to find out, what
their ſenſe hath been touching the ſame. 2. Becauſe that
their Senſe and Judgment of theſe things, (ſuppoſing it to
be certainly, and clearly underſtood.) not being Infallible,
and without all danger of Errour, cannot carry with it a
ſufficient Authority for the ſatisfying the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;
which neither can, nor indeed ought to believe any thing,
in point of Religion, but what it knows to be certainly
True.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Reaſons is proved by theſe <hi>Mediums</hi>

                  <hi>I.</hi> We have very little of the Writings of the Fathers,
eſpecially of the Firſt, Second, and Third Centuries, <hi>pag.</hi> 1.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> Thoſe Writings which we have of the Fathers of thoſe
times, treat of matters very far different from the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
now in hand. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>III.</hi> The Writings, which go under the names of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
are not all truly ſuch, but are, a great part of them,
Suppoſititious and Forged, either long ſince, or of later
times. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> Thoſe of the Writings of the Fathers, which are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
have been in many places corrupted, by Time,
Ignorance, and Fraud, both Pious and Malitious, both in
the Former, and Later Ages. <hi>p.</hi> 34.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>V.</hi> The Writings of the Fathers are hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
by reaſon of the Languages, and <hi>Idioms</hi> they wrote
in; the Manner of their Writing, which is for the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:98310:5"/>
part incumbred with Figures, and Rhetorical Flouriſhes,
and nice Logical Subtilties, and the like; and alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Termes which they for the moſt part uſed-in a far
different ſenſe, from what they now bear. <hi>p.</hi> 69.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VI.</hi> When we meet with an Opinion clearly delivered, in
the Writings of any of the Fathers, we muſt not from hence
conclude, that the ſaid Father held that Opinion: ſeeing
that we often find them ſpeaking thoſe things, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have not believed; whether it be, when they report
the opinion of ſome other, without naming the perſons; (as
they frequently do in their <hi>Commentaries:</hi>) or in diſputing
againſt an Adverſary; in which kind of Writing they take
liberty to ſay one thing, and believe another: or whether it
be that they concealed their own private Opinion purpoſely,
as they have done in their <hi>Homilies,</hi> meerly in compliance
to ſuch a part of their Auditory. <hi>p.</hi> 100.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VII.</hi> Suppoſing that we are well aſſured, that a Father
hath clearly delivered his Opinion in any Point, we ought
notwithſtanding to enquire into the time wherein he wrote
that Opinion of his, whether it were before, or after he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to Ripeneſs of Judgment. For we ſee, that they have
ſometimes retracted in their old age, what they had written
when they were young. <hi>p.</hi> 117.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>VIII.</hi> But ſuppoſe that a Father hath conſtantly held one
Opinion; it will nevertheleſs concern us to inquire, How he
held it, and in what degree of Belief, whether as Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
or Probable only: and then again, in what degree of
Neceſſity, or of Probability he placed it: Beliefs being not
all equally either Neceſſary, or Probable. <hi>p.</hi> 123.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>IX.</hi> After all this we are to examine, whether or no he
deliver this, as his own particular Opinion only, (for this
cannot neceſſarily bind our faith;) or whether he deliver it,
as the Opinion of the Church in his time. <hi>p.</hi> 136.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>X.</hi> In the next place it will concern us to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he deliver it for the Judgment of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
or of ſome particular Church only: thoſe things which
have been received by the Major Part, having not always

oppoſe againſt them the Reſolutions of their Popes, or of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ALl the Difference in Religion, which is at this day
betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
lies in ſome certain Points which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaineth as important, and
neceſſary Articles of the Chriſtian Faith: Whereas the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi>
on the contrary, neither believe, nor will receive
them for ſuch. For, as for thoſe things which the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
believe, for their part; and which they conceive to
be the Fundamentals of Religion; they are ſo evidently,
and undeniably ſuch, as that even their Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do alſo allow of, and receive them, as well as they:
for as much as they are both clearly delivered in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and expreſly ſet down by the Ancient Councils and
Fathers; and are indeed unanimouſly received by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in all Ages, and Parts of the World.
Such, for example, are theſe Maxims following: Namely,
That there is a God, who is Supreme over all, and who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Heavens and the Earth. That having created Man
after his own Image, this Man, revolting from his Obedience,
is faln, together with his whole Poſterity, into moſt extreme
and eternal miſery, and become infected with Sin, as with
a mortal Leproſie, and is therefore obnoxious to the Wrath of
God, and liable to his Curſe. That the Merciful Creator, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
Mans Eſtate, graciouſly ſent his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into
the World: That his Son is God Eternal with him, and that
having taken Fleſh upon himſelf in the Womb of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and become Man; He hath done and ſuffered, in this
Fleſh, all things neceſſary for our Salvation, having by this
means ſufficiently expiated for our Sins, by his Blood: and
that having finiſhed all this, he is aſcended again into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb facs="tcp:98310:8"/>
and ſitteth at the right hand of the Father; from whence
He ſhall one day come, to judge all Mankind, rendering to
every one according to their Works. That to enable us to
communicate of his Salvation, by His Merits, He ſendeth us
down His Holy Spirit, proceeding both from the Father and
the Son, and who is alſo one and the ſame God with Them;
in ſuch ſort, as that theſe Three Perſons are notwithſtanding
but One GOD, who is Bleſſed for ever. That this Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens
our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and begets Faith in us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are juſtified. That after all this, the LORD ſent his
Apoſtles, to Preach this Doctrine of Salvation throughout the
whole World. That Theſe have planted Churches, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in each of them Paſtors, and Teachers; whom we are to
hear with all reverence, and to receive from them Baptiſm,
the Sacrament of our Regeneration; and the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
or Lords Supper, which is the Sacrament of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That we are likewiſe all of us
bound to love GOD, and our Neighbour, very fervently; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
diligently that Holy Doctrine which is laid down
unto us in the Books of the New Teſtament, which have been
inſpired by His Spirit of Truth; as alſo thoſe other of the
Old; there being nothing, either in the one, or in the other,
but what is moſt true. Theſe Articles, and ſome other few
the like, which there perhaps may be, are the ſubſtance of the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> whole Belief: and if all other Chriſtians would
but content themſelves with theſe, there would never be any
Schiſm in the Church. But now their Adverſaries add to
theſe, many other Points, which they preſs, and command
Men to believe, as neceſſary ones, and ſuch, as without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
of which, there is no poſſible hope of Salvation. As
for example: That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Head, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Monarch of the whole Chriſtian Church throughout
the World. That He, or at leaſt the Church which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
a true one, cannot poſſibly erre in matter of
Faith. That the Sacrament of the Euchariſt is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as being really <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not a piece of Bread.
That the Maſs is a Sacrifice, that really expiates the Sins
<pb facs="tcp:98310:8"/>
of the Faithful. That Chriſtians may, and ought to have in
their Churches the Images of God, and of Saints, to which
they are to uſe Religious Worſhip, bowing down before them.
That it is lawful, and alſo very uſeful, to pray to Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and to Angels. That our Souls after death, before
they enter into Heaven, are to paſs through a certain Fire,
and there to endure grievous Torments; thus ſatisfying for
their Sins. That one neither may, nor ought to receive the
holy Euchariſt, without having firſt confeſſed himſelf in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
to a Prieſt. That none, but the Prieſt himſelf that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
the Euchariſt, is bound by right to receive it in both
kinds: And a great number of other Opinions, which their
Adverſaries proteſt plainly, That they cannot with a ſafe
conſcience believe. And theſe Points are the ground of the
whole Difference betwixt them; the one Party pretending,
That they have been believed, and received by the Church of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in all Ages, as revealed by him: and the other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the contrary. Now ſeeing that, none of theſe Tenets
having any ground from any Paſſage in the New Teſtament
(which is the moſt Ancient and Authentick Rule of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity)
the Maintainers are fain to fly to the Writings of
the Doctors of the Church, which lived within the four or
five firſt Centuries after the Apoſtles, who are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Fathers;</hi> my purpoſe is in this Treatiſe to examine,
whether or no this be a good and ſufficient means, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of theſe Differences. And for this purpoſe, I muſt firſt
preſuppoſe two things, which any reaſonable Perſon will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
grant me. The firſt is, That the Queſtion being here
about laying a Foundation for certain Articles of Faith,
upon the Teſtimonies or Opinions of the Fathers, it is very
neceſſary that the Paſſages which are produced out of them,
be clear, and not to be doubted of; that is to ſay, ſuch as
we cannot reaſonably ſcruple at, either touching the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
out of whom they are alledged, or the Senſe of the
Place, whether it ſignifie what is pretended to. For a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of a Witneſs, and the Sentence of a Judge, being of
no value at all, ſave onely for the reputation of the Witneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:98310:9"/>
or Judge; it is moſt evident, that if either proceed from
Perſons unknown, or ſuſpected, they are invalid, and prove
nothing at all. In like manner, if the Depoſition of a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or Sentence of a Judge be obſcure, and in doubtful
Terms, it is clear, that in this caſe the Buſineſs muſt reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided,
there being another Doubt firſt to be cleared,
namely, What the meaning of either of them was. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Point that I ſhall here lay down for a Foundation to
the enſuing Diſcourſe, is no leſs evident than the former;
namely, That to allow a ſufficiency to the Writings of the
Fathers, for the deciding of theſe Controverſies, we muſt
neceſſarily attribute to their Perſons very great Authority,
and ſuch as may oblige us to follow their Judgment in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion. For, if this Authority be wanting, how
clear and expreſs ſoever their Opinions be, in the Articles
now controverted, it will do nothing at all toward their
Deciſion. We have therefore here two things to examine in
this Buſineſs: The firſt is, Whether or not we may be able
now certainly and clearly to know, what the Opinion of the
Fathers hath been touching the Differences now in hand.
The ſecond, Whether their Authority be ſuch, as that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
faithful Perſon ſhall clearly and certainly know what
their Opinion hath been in any one Article of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
he is thereby bound to receive that Article for True.
For, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be but able to prove both theſe
Points, it is then without all diſpute, that their Proceeding
is good, and agreeable to the End propoſed, there being ſo
many of the Ancient Fathers Writings alledged at this day
by them. But if, on the contrary ſide, either of theſe Two
things, or both of them, be indeed found to be doubtful, I
ſhould think that any Man of a very mean Judgment,
ſhould be able to conclude of himſelf, That this way of
Proof, which they have hitherto made uſe of, is very inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
and that therefore they of neceſſity ought to have
recourſe to ſome other more proper and ſolid way in the
Proof of the Truth of the ſaid Opinions, which the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
will not by any means receive.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>REASON I. Touching the Difficulty of
knowing the Senſe of the Fathers, in reference
to the preſent Controverſies in Religion;
drawn from hence: Namely, Becauſe there
is very little extant of Their Writings, for
the Three Firſt Centuries.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF we ſhould in this particular take the ſame courſe,
which ſome Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> make
uſe of againſt the Holy Scriptures, it would be a
very eaſie matter to bring in queſtion, and render
very doubtful, and ſuſpected, all the Writings of the
Fathers. For, when any one alledgeth the Old or New
Teſtament, theſe Gentlemen preſently demand, How, or
by what means they know, that any ſuch Books were
truly written by thoſe Prophets, and Apoſtles, under
whoſe Names they go. If therefore, in like manner,
when theſe Men urge <hi>Juſtin, Irenaeus, Ambroſe, Auguſtine,</hi>
and the like, one ſhould take them ſhort, and demand of
them, How, and by what means they are aſſured, that
theſe Fathers were the Authors of thoſe Writings, which
at this day go under their Names, it is very much to be
doubted but that they would find a harder Task of it,
than their Adverſaries, in juſtifying the Inſcriptions of
the Books of Holy Writ; the Truth whereof is much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98310:10"/>
more eaſie to be demonſtrated, than of any Humane
Writings whatſoever. But I paſs by this too-artificial
way of Proceeding, and onely ſay, That it is no very
eaſie matter to find out, by the Writings of the Fathers,
what hath really beeen their Opinion, in any of thoſe
Controverſies which are now in debate, betwixt the
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which render the knowledge of this ſo difficult,
are many: I ſhall therefore in this Firſt Part handle
ſome of them onely, referring the reſt to the Later, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
them one after another.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reaſon, therefore, which I ſhall lay down for
the proving of this Difficulty, is, The little we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, eſpecially
of the Firſt, Second, and Third Centuries; which are
thoſe we are moſt eſpecially to regard. For, ſeeing that
one of the principal Reaſons that moveth the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> to alledge the Writings of the Fathers, is to ſhew
the Truth of their Tenets, by the Antiquity, which they
reckon as a Mark of it; it is moſt evident, that the moſt
Ancient ought to be the moſt taken notice of. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there is no queſtion to be made, but that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion was more pure, and without mixture, in
its beginnings and Infancy, than it was afterwards, in its
Growth and Progreſs: it being the ordinary courſe of
Things, to contract Corruptions, more or leſs, according
as they are more or leſs removed from their firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
As we ſee by experience in States, Laws, Arts, and
Languages; the Natural Propriety of all which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
declining, after they have once paſſed the Point
of their Vigour, and, as it were, the Flower and Prime
of their Strength and Perfection. Now I cannot believe,
that any faithful Chriſtian will deny, but that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was in its Height and Perfection in the time of the
Bleſſed Apoſtles: And indeed it would be the greateſt
injury that could be offered them, to ſay, that any of their
Succeſſors have either had a greater deſire, or more Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98310:10"/>
to advance Chriſtianity, than they had. It will
hence follow then, That thoſe Times which were neareſt
to the Apoſtles, were neceſſarily the pureſt, and leſs
ſubject to ſuſpicion of Corruptions, either in Doctrine,
or in Manners, and Chriſtian Diſcipline: it being but
reaſonable to believe, that if there be any Corruptions
crept into the Church, they came in by little and little,
and by degrees; as it happens in all other things. If any
one ſhall here object, That even the very next Age im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the times of the Apoſtles was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its Errours, if we may believe <hi>Hegeſippus;</hi> who, as
he is cited by <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ lib. 3. cap. 29. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> witneſſeth, that
the Church continued a Virgin till the
Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time; but, that after
the death of the Apoſtles, the Conſpiracy
of Errour began to diſcover it ſelf with
open fce. I ſhall not oppoſe any thing
againſt this teſtimony; but ſhall only ſay,
that if the Enemy, immediately upon the
ſetting of theſe Stars of the Church, their
Preſence and Light being ſcarcely ſhut in,
had yet the boldneſs preſently to fall to
ſowing his evil ſeed; how much more
had he opportunity to do this in thoſe.
Ages which were further removed from
their Times; when as the Sanctity and
Simplicity of theſe great Teachers of the World having
now by little and little vaniſhed out of the memories of
Men, Humane Inventions, and new Fancies began to
take place. So that we may however conclude, That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that Chriſtianity, even in the Firſt Ages, hath not
been altogether exempt from alteration in Doctrine; yet
are they much more free from it, than the ſucceeding
Ages can pretend to be; and are therefore conſequently
to be preferred before them in all reſpects: it being here
ſomething like what the Poets have fancied of the Four
Ages of the World, where the ſucceeding Age always
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98310:11"/>
came ſhort of the former.<note place="margin">Caſſand. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Ferdinan. <hi>p</hi> 894. Perron. <hi>Epiſt. to</hi> Caſaub.</note> For, as for the Opinion of
thoſe Men, who think the beſt way to find out the
true Senſe of the Ancient Church, will be, to ſearch the
Writings of thoſe of the Fathers chiefly who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, till Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> or
till Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time; that is to ſay, from the end of
the Third Century, till the beginning of the Seventh: I
take this as a Confeſſion onely of the ſmall number of
Books that are left us of thoſe Ages before <hi>Conſtantine;</hi>
and not that theſe Men allow, that the Authority of
theſe Three later Ages, ought to be preferred to that of
the Three former. If we had but as much Light, and as
clear Evidences of the Belief of the one, as we have of
the other, I make no queſtion but they would prefer the
Former. But if they mean otherwiſe, and are indeed of
a perſwaſion, that the Church was really more pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, than before; they muſt excuſe me,
if I think that they by this means confeſs the diſtruſt
they have of their own Cauſe, ſeeing they endeavour to
get off as far as they can from the Light of the Primitive
times; retreating back to thoſe Ages wherein it is moſt
evident there was both leſs Perfection, and Light, than
before: running clean contrary to that excellent Rule
which S.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cypr.</hi> ep. 74. p. 195.</note> 
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath given us; That we ſhould have
recourſe to the Fountain, whenever the Channel and
Stream of Doctrine, and Eccleſiaſtical Tradition is found
to be any whit corrupted. But however, let their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be what it will, their Words, in my judgment, do
not a little advantage the Proteſtants Cauſe; it being a
very clear confeſſion, That thoſe Opinions about which
they conteſt with them, do not at all appear clearly in
any of the Books that were written during the Three
Firſt Centuries. For, if they were found clearly in the
ſame, what Policy were it then in them to appeal to the
Writers of the Three following Centuries, to which
they very well know, that their Adverſaries attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
leſs, than to the Former? But beſides this tacite
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98310:11"/>
Confeſſion of theirs, the thing is evident; namely, That
there is left us at this day very little of the Writings of
the Fathers of the Three Firſt Centuries of Chriſtianity,
for the deciding of our Differences. The bleſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of thoſe times contented themſelves, for the greateſt
part of them, with writing the Chriſtian Faith in the
hearts of Men, by the beams of their Sanctity, and holy
Life, and by their Blood ſhed in Martyrdom, without
much troubling themſelves with the writing of Books:
Whether it were,<note place="margin">Orig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Praef Operis contra Celſ. p. 1, 2.</note> becauſe, as Learned <hi>Origen</hi> elegantly
gives the Reaſon, they were of opinion that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion was to be defended by the Innocency of Life,
and honeſty of Converſation, rather than by Sophiſtry,
and the Artifice of Words: or whether, becauſe their
continual Sufferings gave them not leiſure to take Pen
in hand, and to write Books; or elſe, whether it were
for ſome other Reaſon perhaps, which we know not.
But this we are very well aſſured of, that except the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Apoſtles, there was very little written by
others in theſe Primitive times: which was the cauſe of
ſo much trouble to <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the beginning of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,<note place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. l. 1. c. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

having little or no light to guide him in his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and treading, as himſelf ſaith, <hi>in a new path, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten

part of thoſe few Books which were written by the
Chriſtians of thoſe Times, have not come down to our
hands, but were loſt, either through the injury of Time,
that conſumeth all things, or elſe have been made away
by the malice of Men, who have made bold to ſuppreſs
and ſmother whatſoever they met with, that was not
wholly to their guſt. Of this ſort were thoſe five Books
of <hi>Papias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> the Apology of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus
Athenienſis,</hi> and that other of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98310:12"/>
                  <hi>Pinytus Cretenſis,</hi> the Writings of <hi>Philippus, Muſanus,

us of theſe Times, which is certainly known to be theirs,
and that no Man doubts of, is, ſome certain Diſcourſes
of S. <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Philoſopher and Martyr, who wrote his
ſecond Apology a hundred and fifty years after the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Five Books of S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi>
who wrote not long after him; Three excellent
and learned Pieces of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived
toward the end of the ſecond Century; divers Books
of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who was famous about the ſame time:
the Epiſtles and other Treatiſes of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom about the year of
our Saviour CCLXI, the Writings of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and of
<hi>Lactantius</hi> his Scholar, and ſome few others. For, as for
<hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Contemporary, who alone, had we
but all his Writings entire, would be able perhaps to
give us more light and ſatisfaction in the Buſineſs we
are now upon, than all the reſt; we have but very little of
him left us, and the greateſt part of that too moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
abuſed, and corrupted; the moſt learned, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
innumerable Writings of this great and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Perſon, not being able to withſtand the violence of
Time, nor the envy and malice of Men, who have dealt
much worſe with him, than ſo many Ages, and Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Years that have paſſed, from his time down to us.
And thus have I given you an account of well-nigh all
that we have left us, which is certainly known to have
been written by the Fathers of the Three Firſt Centuries.
For, as for thoſe other Pieces which are pretended to
have been written in the ſame times, but are indeed either
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98310:12"/>
confeſſed to be ſuppoſititious by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves,
or are rejected by their Adverſaries, and that upon very
good and probable grounds; theſe are not to have any
place at all, or account here, in clearing the Controverſie
we have now in hand.</p>
               <p>The Writings of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries have,
I confeſs, out-gone the Former for number, and good
fortune too; the greateſt part of them having come
down ſafe to our Hands: but they come much ſhort of
the other in Weight and Authority; eſpecially in the
Judgment of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who maintain, and that
upon very probable Grounds too, That the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath from the beginning had its declinings by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little, loſing in every Age ſome certain degree of
its Primitive and Native Purity. And beſides, we have
good cauſe perhaps to fear, leſt the multitude of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of theſe two Ages trouble us as much, as the pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them in the three preceding; and that, as before
we ſuffered under ſcarcity, we now be overwhelmed
with their multitude. For, the multitude of Words, and
of Books, ſerves as much ſometimes to the ſuppreſſing of
the Senſe and Opinion of any Publick Body, as Silence it
ſelf; our Minds being then extremely confounded, and
perplexed, while it labours to apprehend what is the
True and Common Opinion of the Whole, amidſt ſo
many differently-biaſſed Particulars, whereof each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to expreſs the ſame: it being moſt certain, that
amongſt ſo great and almoſt infinite variety of Spirits,
and Tongues, you ſhall very hardly meet with two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
that ſhall deliver to you one and the ſame Opinion,
(eſpecially in Matters of ſo high a nature, as the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
in Religion are) after the ſame form and way of
repreſentation, how unanimous ſoever their Conſent

them in the Three following, ſhould bring along with it
theſe inconveniences; it will however be very hard to
diſcover out of them, what the Opinion of their Authors
hath been, touching thoſe Points of Chriſtian Religion
now controverted. For the Matters whereof They treat,
are of a very different nature; theſe Authors, according
as the neceſſity of their times required, employing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
either in juſtifying the Chriſtian Religion, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
it from the aſperſion of ſuch Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was moſt falſly and injuriouſly charged; or
elſe in laying open to the World the Abſurdity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
of Paganiſm; or in convincing the hard-hearted
Jews; or in confuting the prodigious Fooleries of the
Hereticks of thoſe times; or in exhortations to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Patience and Martyrdom; or in expounding ſome
certain Paſſages and Portions of the Holy Scripture: all
which things have very little to do with the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of theſe times, of which they never ſpeak Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
unleſs they accidentally or by chance let a Word
drop from them, toward this ſide, or that ſide, yet
without the leaſt thought of us, or of our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies;
although both the one and the other Party ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lights upon Paſſages, wherein they conceive they
have diſcovered their own Opinions clearly delivered,

the Perſons of the Father and the Son. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Diſcipline and the Vertues of the Chriſtian
Church. <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Eunomius, Photinus, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
and afterwards <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> made work
for the Fathers of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries. The
Blaſphemies of theſe Men againſt the Perſon or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or againſt the Holy Ghoſt
and its Grace, which have now of a long time lay buried,
and forgotten, were the Matters debated in thoſe times,
and the ſubject of the greateſt part of the Books then
written, that have come to our Hands. What relation
hath any thing of all this to the Buſineſs of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
and the Adoration of the Euchariſt, or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
of the Pope, or the Neceſſity of Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
or the Worſhipping of Images, and the like
Points, which are the Buſineſs of the preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and which none of the Ancients hath handled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
and of ſet purpoſe; and perhaps too never ſo
much as thought of? It is very true indeed, that the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of theſe Fathers in theſe Points, which ſome ſet ſo
much by, is not wholly mute; and perhaps alſo it may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98310:14"/>
paſs for a very clear Teſtimony: but certainly not on
their ſide who maintain them affirmatively. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
this is a moſt certain truth, That throughout the
whole Body of the genuine Writings of theſe Fathers,
you ſhall not meet with any thing expreſly urged, either
for or againſt the greateſt part of theſe Opinions. I ſhall
moſt willingly confeſs, That the belief of every Wiſe
man makes up but One entire Body, the Parts whereof
have a certain correſpondence and relation to each other;
in ſuch ſort, as that a Man may be able, by thoſe things
which he delivers expreſly, to give a gueſs what his
Opinion is touching other things, which he declares
himſelf not at all in: it being a thing utterly improbable
that he maintains any one Poſition which ſhall manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claſh with his other Tenets, or that he rejects any
thing that neceſſarily followeth upon them. But beſides
that this manner of Diſputation preſuppoſeth, that the
Belief of the Ancient Fathers hangs all cloſe together, no
one Poſition contradicting another, but having all its
Parts united, and depending one upon another; which
notwithſtanding is not altogether unqueſtionable, as
we ſhall ſhew elſewhere: Beſides all this, I ſay, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
alſo a ſharp piercing Wit, which readily and
clearly apprehends the Connexions of each ſeveral Point;
an excellent Memory, to retain faithfully whatever Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
the Ancients have maintained; and a ſolid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
free from all pre-occupation, to compare them
with the Tenets maintained at this day: And what Man
ſoever is endued with all theſe Qualities, I ſhall account
him the fitteſt Man to make profitable Uſe of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Fathers, and the likelieſt of any to ſearch
into the bottom of them. But the miſchief of it is, that
Men ſo qualified, are very rare, and hard to be found. I
ſhall add here,<note place="margin">Gontery, Veron, <hi>and others.</hi>
                  </note> That if you will believe ſome certain
Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this whole Method is
vain and uſeleſs; as is alſo that which makes uſe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
and Reaſon; means which are inſufficient,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98310:14"/>
and unable (in the judgment of theſe Doctors) to bring
us to any certainty, eſpecially in Matters of Religion,
wherein, their Opinion is, we are to rely upon clear
and expreſs Texts onely. So that, according to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
we will not, if we be wife, believe that the Fathers
held any of the aforenamed Points, unleſs we can find
them in expreſs terms delivered in their Writings; that
is to ſay, in the very ſame terms that we read them in
the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> Seeing
then that according to the Opinion of theſe Men, thoſe
Teſtimonies onely are to be received, which are expreſs,
and likewiſe, that of theſe Points now controverted,
there is ſearcely any thing found expreſly delivered by
the Fathers: we may, in my Opinion, very Logically
and reaſonably conclude, that it is, if not an impoſſible,
yet at leaſt a very difficult thing (according to theſe
Men) to come to the certain knowledge of the Opinion
of the Ancients, touching the greateſt part of the Tenets
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are at this day rejected by
the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

                  <p>Reaſon III. That thoſe Writings which go
under the Names of the Ancient Fathers,
are not all truly ſuch; but a great part of
them ſuppoſitions, and forged, either long
ſince, or of later Times.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to more important Conſiderations; theſe
two former, though they are not in themſelves to
be deſpiſed, or neglected, being yet but trivial ones in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of thoſe which follow. For there is ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
in the moſt part of theſe Books whereof we ſpeak,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98310:15"/>
that it is a very hard thing truly to find out who were
their Authors, and what the Meaning and Senſe of them
is. The firſt Difficulty proceeds from the infinite number
of Forged Books, which are falſly attributed to the
Ancient Fathers: The like having hapned alſo in all
ſorts of Learning and Sciences; inſomuch that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
at this day are ſufficiently troubled in diſcovering,
both in Philoſophy, and Humanity, which are forged and
ſuppoſititious Pieces, and which are true and legitimate.
But this Abuſe hath not reigned any where more groſly,
and taken to it ſelf more liberty, than toward the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Writers. All Men complain on this, both on the
one ſide, and on the other, and labour all they can to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us from theſe Confuſions, though oftentimes with
little ſucceſs, by reaſon of the eagerneſs of their Paſſion,
by which they are carried away, ordinarily judging of
Books according to their own Intereſt, rather than the
Truth, and rejecting all thoſe that any whit contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
them; but defending thoſe which ſpeak of their
ſide, how good or bad ſoever they otherwiſe chance to
be. So that, to ſay the truth, they judge not of their
own Opinions by the Writings of the Fathers, but of
the Writings of the Fathers by their own Opinions. If
they ſpeak with Us, it is then <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi>
if not, it is ſome Ignorant Modern Fellow, or elſe ſome
Malicious Perſon, who would fain cover his own filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
under the rich Garment of theſe excellent Perſons.
Now if it were Paſſion onely that rendered the Buſineſs
obſcure, we ſhould be able eaſily to quit our hands of it,
by ſtripping it, and laying it open to the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all
moderate Men would find enough to reſt ſatisfied with.
But the worſt of it is, that this Obſcurity oftentimes falls
out to be in the things themſelves; ſo that it is a very
hard, and ſometimes an impoſſible thing, to clear them;
whether it be by reaſon of the Antiquity of the Errour,
or elſe by reaſon of the near reſemblance of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the Abuſe hath been on foot above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

own Dreams the greater Authority,<note place="margin">Hegeſippus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Euſeb. l. 4. c. 22.</note> vented them under

But this Impoſture was diſcovered, and convinced
in the VI Council: for otherwiſe, who would not have
been deceived by it, ſeeing theſe falſe Pieces in ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
a Copy? I bring but theſe few Examples, to
give the Reader but a taſte onely of what the Hereticks
not onely dared, but were able alſo to do, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
and all theſe things were done before the end of
the Seventh Century, that is to ſay, above nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years ago. Since which time, in all the Diſputes
about the Images in Churches,<note place="margin">Concil. 7. Act. 6. Refut. Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſt. Tom. 5.</note> and in the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches, and indeed in the
moſt part of all other Eccleſiaſtical Conteſtations, you
ſhall find nothing more frequent, than the mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
that the ſeveral Parties caſt at each other,<note place="margin">Concil. Florent. Seſſ. 20. T. 4.</note> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
each other of forging the Pieces of Authors which
they produced each of them in defence of their own
Cauſe. Judge you therefore, whether or not the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
uſing the ſame Artifice, and the ſame Diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now for the ſpace of ſo many Centuries ſince, though in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98310:16"/>
different Cauſes, may not in all probability have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us with a ſufficient ſtock of ſpurious Pieces, ſent
abroad under the Names of the Ancient Fathers, by their
profeſſed Enemies? And do but think whether or no we
may not chance to converſe with an Heretick ſometimes,
when we think we have a Father before us; and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
Enemy, diſguiſed under the mask of a Friend? So
that it will hence follow, That it may juſtly be feared,
that we ſometimes receive and deliver for Maxims and
Opinions of the Ancient Church, no better than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dreams of the Ancient Hereticks. For we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that they were not ſo fooliſh, as to diſcover their
Venom at the firſt daſh, in the height of their Heretical
Poſitions; but rather, that they onely cunningly caſt in
here and there ſome ſprinklings of it, laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of their Hereſie as it were afar off onely; which
makes the Knavery the more hard to be diſcovered, and
ſo conſequently the more dangerous. But ſuppoſing
that this Jugling Trick of the Hereticks may have very
much corrupted the Old Books; yet notwithſtanding,
had we no other ſpurious Pieces than what had been
forged by them, it would be no very hard matter to
diſtinguiſh the True from the Falſe. But that which
renders the Evil almoſt uncurable, is, that even in the
Church it ſelf this kind of Forgery hath been both very
Ordinary, and very Ancient. I impute a great part of
the cauſe of this Miſchief to thoſe Men, who before the
Invention of Printing, were the Tranſcribers and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers
out of Manuſcripts: of whoſe negligence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in corrupting of Books, S. <hi>Hierome</hi> very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
even in his time:<note place="margin">Hier. Ep. 28. ad Lucin. Tom. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Scribunt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>non quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniunt,
ſed quod intelligunt; &amp; dum alienos errores emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare
nituntur, oſtendunt ſuos:</hi> That is, <hi>They write, not what
they find, but what they underſtand; and whilſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to correct other Mens Errors, they ſhew their own.</hi>
We may very well preſume, that what liberty theſe Men
took in corrupting, they took the ſame in forging Books
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98310:17"/>
too: eſpecially ſince this laſt courſe was beneficial to
them, which the other was not. For by altering or
corrupting the Books they wrote, they could not make
any advantage to themſelves: whereas in forging new
Books, and venting them under great and eminent
Names, they put them off both faſter and dearer. So
likewiſe if there came to their hands any Book, that had
either no Authors Name; or having any, it was but an
obſcure, or a tainted one: to the end that theſe evil
Marks might not prejudice the venting of it, they would
raſe it out without any more ado, and inſcribe it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with ſome one of the moſt Eminent and Venerable
Names that was in the Church; that ſo the Reputation
and Favour that That Name had found in the World,
might be a means of the better putting off their falſe
Wares. As for example: The Name of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> who
was the Head of a Schiſm againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
became juſtly to be odious to Chriſtian ears; as that of
<hi>Tertullian</hi> was the more eſteemed, both for the Age,
Wit, and Learning of the Perſon. Now the Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
conſidering this with himſelf, without any other
deſign, or end, than onely of his own private Gain,
hath, in my judgment, made an exchange, attributing
to <hi>Tertullian</hi> that Book of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is indeed
<hi>Novatianus</hi> his; as we are given to underſtand alſo by
S.<note place="margin">Hier. Apol. 2. contr. Ruff.</note> 
                  <hi>Hierome.</hi> And I am of opinion, that both the birth
and fortune of that other Piece <hi>De Poenitentia</hi> hath been,
if not the very ſame, yet at leaſt not much unlike that of
the other. So likewiſe that Book which beareth Title,
<hi>De Operibus Cardinalibus Chriſti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auctor operis, De Operibus Card. Chriſti, inter Cyprian. oper. p. 444.</note> which was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſent by the Author of it to one of the Popes,
without ſetting down his Name, as himſelf there te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies,
hath been vented abroad under the Name of
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> onely becauſe by this means it is the more
profitable to the Manuſcript-monger; and it hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
always paſſed, and doth ſtill paſs for his; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that, in my judgment, it is clear enough,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98310:17"/>
that it cannot be his, as is ingenuouſly confeſſed by<note n="a" place="margin">Eraſmus in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. Cypr. ſuâ Sixtus Senenſ. Biblioth. lib. 4.

many of the Learned, both of the one, and of the other
ſide. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had ſome Name in the Church; though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
near ſo great a one as <hi>Cyprian</hi> had: and this is the
reaſon why the afore-named Merchants have inſcribed
with S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Name that Treatiſe upon the Apoſtles
<hi>Creed,</hi> which was written by <hi>Ruffinus.</hi> Beſides the
Avarice of theſe <hi>Librarii,</hi> their own Ignorance, or at leaſt
of thoſe whom they conſulted, hath in like manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no ſmall number of theſe ſpurious Pieces. For
when either the likeneſs of the Name, or of the Stile, or
of the Subject treated of, or any other ſeeming Reaſon,
gave them occaſion to believe, that ſuch an Anonymous
Book was the Work of ſuch or ſuch an ancient Author,
they preſently copied it out under the ſaid Author's
Name; and thus it came from thenceforth to be received
by the World for ſuch, and by them to be delivered for
ſuch, over to Poſterity. But all the blame is not to be laid
upon the Tranſcribers onely, in this particular: the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
themſelves have contributed very much to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of this kind of Impoſture. For there have been
found in all Ages ſome that have been ſo ſottiſhly am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
and ſo deſirous, at what rate ſoever, to have
their Conceptions publiſhed to the World, as that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ſhould never be able to pleaſe, and get applauſe
abroad of themſelves, they have vented them under the
Name of ſome of the Fathers; chuſing rather to ſee them
received, and honoured, under this falſe Habit, than
diſdained, and ſlighted, under their own true one. Theſe
Men, according as their ſeveral Abilities have been, have
imitated the Stile and Fancy of the Fathers, either more
or leſs happily; and have boldly preſented theſe Iſſues
of their own Brain to the World, under their Names.
The World, the greateſt part whereof hath always been
the leaſt ſubtile, hath very readily collected, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and cheriſhed theſe falſe Births, and hath by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
filled all their Libraries with them. Others have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98310:18"/>
been moved to uſe the ſame Artifice, not out of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but ſome other irregular Fancy, as thoſe Men have
done, who, having had a particular affection either to
ſuch a Perſon, or to ſuch an Opinion, have faln to write
of the ſame, under the Name of ſome Author of good
Eſteem and Reputation with the World, to make it paſs
the more currantly abroad: Juſt as that Prieſt did, who
publiſhed a Book entituled,<note place="margin">Hier. de ſcript. Eccl. Tom. 1. p. 350. Ex Tertul. li. de Baptiſmo, cap. 17.</note>

a Prieſt of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> (whom S. <hi>Hierome</hi> juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth

although the truth of it is, he had taken it partly
out of the Firſt and Sixth Books that <hi>Euſebius</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon the ſame Subject, and partly made uſe of his
own Invention in it. Some ſuch like Fancy it was, that
moved him alſo to put forth the Life of one <hi>Sextus,</hi> a
<hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Hier. in Jerem. com. 4. tom. 4.</note> under the Name of <hi>S. Sixtus
the Martyr,</hi> to the end that the Work might be received
the more favourably. What can you ſay to this? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That in the very ſame Age there was a Perſonage of
greater Note than the former, who, diſliking that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
had tranſlated the Old Teſtament out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
framed an Epiſtle under his Name, wherein he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him repent himſelf of having done it; which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
even in S. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s Life-time, though without his
knowledge, was publiſhed by the ſaid Author, both at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Africk?</hi> Who could believe the truth of
this bold attempt,<note place="margin">Hier. l. 2. Apol. contra Ruffin. Tom. 2.</note> had not S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf related the
Story, and made complaint of the Injury done him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?
I muſt impute alſo to a Fancy of the ſame kind,
though certainly more innocent than the other, the
ſpreading abroad of ſo many Predictions of our Saviour
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98310:18"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Kingdom, under the Names of the
<hi>Sibylls;</hi> which was done by ſome of the firſt Chriſtians,
onely to prepare the Pagans to reliſh this Doctrine the
better;<note place="margin">Orig contra Celſ. lib. 7.</note> as it is objected againſt them by <hi>Celſus,</hi> in <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi>
But, that which is of greater conſequence yet, is,
that even the Fathers themſelves have ſometimes made
uſe of this Artifice, to promote the Intereſt either of
their own Opinions, or their Paſſions. We have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Example hereof, which was objected againſt the
<hi>Latins</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Flor. Seſſ. 2. p 457.</note> above two hundred years ſince, of
two Biſhops of <hi>Rome, Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface;</hi> who to
authorize the Title which they pretended to have of
being Univerſal Biſhops, and Heads of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church, and particularly of the <hi>African,</hi> forged,
about the beginning of the Fifth Century, certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and alledged them for ſuch
divers times,<note place="margin">Concil. Afric. 6. cap. 3.</note> in the Councils in <hi>Africa;</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
after a long and diligent ſearch, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

taken the pains to ſend as far as <hi>Conſtantinople, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> to get the beſt and trueſt Copies
that they could. Neither indeed have the Canons and
Acts of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> at this day, though it hath
ſince that time paſſed through ſo many ſeveral hands, any
ſuch thing in it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> no, not in the Editions of thoſe very
Men who are the moſt intereſted in the Honour of the

<hi>Latin</hi> Collection of them about the year of our Saviour
<hi>Chriſt</hi> 525. nor in any other either Ancient or Modern.
For at for that <hi>Authentick Copy</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
which one <hi>Frier John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Flor. Seſſ 20.</note> at the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have been the onely Copy that had eſcaped
the Corruptions of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and had for this cauſe
been always kept under Lock and Key at <hi>Rome,</hi> with
all the ſafety and care that might be; out of which Copy
they had tranſcribed the ſaid Canons: I confeſs, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98310:19"/>
muſt needs have been kept up very cloſe, under Locks
and Seals, ſeeing that three of their Popes, namely, <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus,
Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> could never be able to
produce it, for the juſtification of their pretended Title,
againſt the <hi>African</hi> Fathers, though in a caſe of ſo great
Importance. And it is a wonderful ſtrange thing to me,
that this Man, who came a thouſand years after, ſhould
now at laſt make uſe of it in this cauſe; whereas thoſe
very Perſons who had it in their cuſtody, never ſo much
as mentioned one Syllable of it: which is an evident Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that the Seals of this rare Book were never
opened, ſave onely in the Brains of this Doctor, where
onely it was both framed and ſealed up, brought forth
and vaniſhed, all at the ſame inſtant; the greateſt part of
thoſe Men that have come after him, having laid aſide
this Chimerical Invention, being aſhamed to make uſe
of it any longer. And to ſay truth, that which theſe
Men anſwer, by way of excuſing the ſaid Popes, is not
any whit more probable; namely, That they took the
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of <hi>Sardica,</hi> in which thoſe
Canons they alledge are really found, for one and the
ſame Council. For whom will theſe Men ever be able
to perſwade, That two Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, betwixt
which there paſſed near twenty two whole years, called
by two ſeveral Emperors, and for Matters of a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
nature; the one of them for the Explanation of the
Chriſtian Faith, and the other for the Re-eſtabliſhing of
two Biſhops in their Thrones; and in Places very far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from each other: the one at <hi>Nicaea</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the
other at <hi>Sardica,</hi> a City of <hi>Illyricum:</hi> the Canons of
which two Councils are very different, both in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
number, and authority; the one of them having
always been received generally by the whole Church;
but the other having never been acknowledged by the
Eaſtern Church; ſhould yet notwithſtanding be but one
and the ſame Council? How can they themſelves endure
this, who are ſo fierce againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for having
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98310:19"/>
offered to attribute (which they do notwithſtanding
with more appearance of truth) to the Sixth Council,
thoſe CII Canons which were agreed upon ten years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in an Aſſembly wherein one party
of the Fathers of the Sixth Council met? How came it
to paſs that they gave any credit to the Ancient Church,
ſeeing that in the <hi>Greek</hi> Collection of her Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
thoſe of the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> are quite left out;
and in the <hi>Latin</hi> Collection of <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> made
at <hi>Rome</hi> eleven hundred years ſince, they are placed, not
with thoſe of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> nor yet immediately
after them, as if they all made up but one Body betwixt
them:<note place="margin">Codex Can. Ec. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n. Dionyſ. Exig. p. 99.</note> but are put in a place a great way behind, after
the Canons of all the General Councils that had been
held till that very time he lived in? And how comes it
to paſs, that theſe Ancient Popes, who alledged theſe
Canons, if they believed theſe Councils to be both one,
did not ſay ſo? The <hi>African</hi> Biſhops had diverſe and
ſundry times declared, That theſe Canons, which were
by them alledged, were not at all to be found in their
Copies. Certainly therefore, if thoſe who had cited
them, had thought the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of
<hi>Sardica</hi> to have been both but one Council, they would
no doubt have made anſwer, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Canons were to
be found in this pretended Second Part of the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> among thoſe which had been agreed upon at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica;</hi>
eſpecially when they ſaw that theſe careful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for the clearing of the Controverſie betwixt them,
had reſolved to ſend to this purpoſe as far as <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And yet for all this, there is not
the leaſt Syllable, tending this way, ſaid by them. And
certainly if the Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> had
been in thoſe days reputed as a part of the Council of
<hi>Nice,</hi> it is a very ſtrange thing, that ſo many Learned
and Religious Prelates as there were at that time in
<hi>Africk,</hi> as namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Aurelius, Alypius,</hi> and even S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
that glorious Light, not of the <hi>African</hi> onely,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98310:20"/>
but of the whole Ancient Church, ſhould have been ſo
ignorant in this particular. But it is a wonder beyond
all belief, that three Popes, and their Legates, ſhould
leave their Party in an Ignorance ſo groſs, and ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to their own Intereſt; it being in their power to
have relieved them in two words. We may ſafely then
conclude, That theſe Popes, <hi>Zozimus,</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> had
no other Copies of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> than what we
have: and alſo, that they did not believe that the
Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi> were a part of the
Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> but that they rather purpoſely alledged
ſome of the Canons of <hi>Sardica,</hi> under the name of the
Canons of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> And this they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Maxim which was in force with thoſe of
former times, and is not utterly laid aſide even in our
own; namely, That for the advancing of a Good and
Godly Cauſe, it is lawful ſometimes to uſe a little Deceit,
and to have recourſe to your <hi>Piae Fraudes.</hi> They therefore
firmly believing as they did, That the Supremacy of their
See, over all other Churches, was a Buſineſs of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and would be very profitable to all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
we are not to wonder, if for the eſtabliſhing this
right on themſelvs, they made uſe of a little Legerdemain,
alledging <hi>Sardica</hi> for <hi>Nice:</hi> reckoning with themſelves,
that if they brought their Deſign about, this ſmall Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theirs would in proceſs of time be abundantly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
for, by the benefit and excellency of the thing it
ſelf. Yet notwithſtanding this Oppoſition made by the
<hi>African</hi> Fathers againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo,</hi>
not many years after,<note place="margin">Leo in ep. ad Theodoſ. Imp. Tom. 2. Concil.</note> writing to the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi>
did not forbear to make uſe of the old Forgery, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one of the Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica,</hi> for a

for a certain Truth, That both all Antiquity, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98310:20"/>
of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> alſo, had aſſigned to the
Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> the Power of judging of Points of Faith;
and of the Prelates of the Church; <hi>Leo</hi> having before
poſſeſſed them, That this Canons of the Council of <hi>Sardica</hi>
was one of the Canons of <hi>Nice.</hi> And thus, by a ſtrong
perſeverance in this <hi>Pious Fraud,</hi> they have at length
ſo fully perſwaded a great part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that the
Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had eſtabliſhed this Supremacy upon the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is now generally urged by all of
them, whenever this Point is controverted. I muſt crave
pardon of the Reader, for having ſo long inſiſted on this
Particular, and perhaps longer ſomewhat than my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
required: yet, in my judgment, it may be of no
ſmall importance to the Buſineſs in hand. For (will the
Proteſtants here ſay) ſeeing that two Popes Biſhops,
and Princes, which all Chriſtians have approved, have
notwithſtanding thus foiſted in falſe Wares; what ought
we to expect from the reſt of the Biſhops and Doctors?
Since theſe Men have done this in the beginning of the
Fifth Century, an Age of ſo high repute for its Faith and
Doctrine, what have they not dared to do in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages? If they have not forborn ſo foully to abuſe
the ſacred Name of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and Venerable Monument of Chriſtianity, next to
the Holy Scriptures; what other Authors can we imagine
they would ſpare? And if in the face of ſo Renowned an
Aſſembly, and in the preſence of whatever <hi>Africk</hi> could
ſhew of Eminency, both for Sanctity and Learning; and
even under the eye of the great S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> too, they
made no conſcience at all to make uſe of ſo groſs a piece
of Forgery; what have they not ſince, in theſe later
Times, while the whole World for ſo many Ages lay
covered with ſo thick darkneſs, dared to do? But as for
my part, I ſhall neither accuſe nor excuſe at preſent theſe
Mens Proceedings; but ſhall onely conclude; That ſeeing
that the Writings of the Fathers, before they came to us,
have paſſed through the hands of thoſe who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98310:21"/>
been found to uſe theſe jugling Tricks; it is not ſo
eaſie a matter as People may imagine, to diſcover out of
thoſe Writings which now paſs under the Names of the
Fathers, what their Opinions were. The like Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
produced the very ſame Effects in the Fifth Council;<note place="margin">Concil. 5 Act. 5. Tom. 2. Concil.</note>
where a Letter forged under the Name of <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
touching the Death of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> was both read, and by a
general ſilence approved by the whole Aſſembly; which
yet notwithſtanding was ſo evidently falſe, that thoſe
very Men who cauſed the Body of the General Councils
to be Printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> have convinced it of falſhood,
and branded it as ſpurious. Such another precious Piece
is that fooliſh Story of a Miracle wrought by an Image of
our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the City <hi>Berytus,</hi> which is related
in very ample manner,<note place="margin">Concil. 7. Act. 4. Tom. 3. Concil.</note> in the VII Council, and goes
forſooth, under the Name of S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> but is indeed
ſo taſteleſs a Piece, and ſo unworthy the Gallantry and
clearneſs of that great Wit, that he muſt not be thought
to have common ſenſe, that can find in his heart to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
it to him. And therefore we ſee, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

their Stile, the Errors that you meet with every foot in
computing the Times, and in Hiſtory; the Pieces that
they are patched up of, ſtollen here and there out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Authors, whoſe Books we have at this day to ſhew:
and alſo by the general ſilence of all the Writers of the
Eight firſt Centuries, among whom there is not one word
mentioned of them. Now I ſhall not here meddle at all
with the Six or Seven laſt Centuries; where, in regard of
diverſe Articles of Faith, moſt eagerly by them preſſed
and eſtabliſhed, there hath been more need than ever of
the Aſſiſtance of the Ancients; and where, in reſpect of the
dark Ignorance of thoſe Times, and the ſcarcity of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
they had much better opportunity than before to
forge what Books they pleaſed. This Abuſe the World
was never free from, till the Times of the Light break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in the Laſt Century; at what time <hi>Eraſmus</hi> by
name, gives us an account, how he himſelf had diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one of theſe wretched Knaves, whoſe ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
it was to lay his own Eggs in another Man's Neſt,
putting his own Fooleries on S. <hi>Hierome</hi> particularly, and
on S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> And who knows what
thoſe many Books be, that are daily iſſued out of the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
Shops, that of old were wont to furniſh the World
with theſe kind of Knacks? Is it not very probable, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98310:22"/>
both the Will, and the Dexterity, in forging and venting
theſe falſe Wares, will rather in theſe days increaſe, than
abate, in the Profeſſors of this Trade? So that, if beſides
what the Malice of the Hereticks, the Avarice and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of Tranſcribers of Manuſcripts, and the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and affection of Men hath brought forth of this kind,
there have yet ſo many others bent their endeavours this
way, and that in a manner all along, for the ſpace of the
laſt Fourteen hundred years, although they had their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ends; we are not to wonder at all, if now in this
laſt Age we ſee ſuch a monſtrous number of Writings
falſly Fathered upon the Ancients: which, if they were
all put together, would make little leſs than a Fourth or
a Fifth part of the Works of the Fathers. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that the Learned have noted a great number of them,
and do ordinarily caſt them into the later Tomes of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and that ſome have written whole Books upon
this very Subject; as namely, <hi>Ant. Poſſevine's Apparatus,
Bellarmine's Catalogue, Scultetus</hi> his <hi>Medulla Patrum, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet's
Critick,</hi> and the like, both of the one and the other
Religion. But who can aſſure us that they have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
any thing they ſhould have noted? Beſides, that
it is a new Labour, and almoſt equal to the former, to read
ſo many Books of the Moderns as there are. And when
all is done, we are not preſently to ſit down upon their
Judgments neither, without a due examination had of
them. For each of them having been prepoſſeſt with
the Prejudices of the Party in which they were brought
up before they took this Work in hand, who ſhall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
us, that they have not delivered any thing in this
caſe, in favour of their own particular Intereſt, as hath
been touched before? The juſtneſs of this ſuſpicion is ſo
clear, that I preſume that no Man that is but any whit
verſed in theſe matters, will deſire me to prove my Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Neither ſhall I need to give any other reaſon of it,
than the Conflict; and Diſagreements in Judgments
which we may obſerve in theſe Men: the one of them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98310:22"/>
oftentimes letting paſs for pure Metal, what the other
perhaps will throw by for Droſs: Which Differences are
found not onely betwixt thoſe that are of quite oppoſite
Religions; but, which is more, even betwixt thoſe that
are of the ſelf ſame Perſwaſion. Thoſe whom we named
not long before, who were all of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, cry
down (as we have ſaid) the greateſt part of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of the firſt Popes. <hi>Franciſcus Turrianus,</hi> a Jeſuite,
receives them, and defends them all, in a Tract written
by him to that purpoſe.<note place="margin">Baron. Annal. Tom. 1. an. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius</hi> calls the <hi>Recognitions</hi>

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays, That this Book was written
either by <hi>Clemens,</hi> or elſe by ſome other Author as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and as Ancient as he. Some of them hold thoſe <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
publiſhed by <hi>Nicol. Faber,</hi> under the Name of
S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> for good and legitimate Pieces; and ſome
others again reject them. <hi>Eraſmus, Sixtus Senenſis, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior
Canus,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> are of opinion, That the Book
<hi>Of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary,</hi> is falſly attributed to
S. <hi>Hierome: Chriſtophorus à Caſtro,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite,
maintains the contrary. Cardinal <hi>Cajetan, Laurentius
Valla, Eraſmus,</hi> and ſome others, hold the Books of
<hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite</hi> for ſuſpected, and ſpurious: <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi>
and almoſt all the reſt of their Writers, maintain
that they are true and legitimate. <hi>Turrianus, Bovin,</hi>
and ſome others, commend unto us the <hi>Conſtitutions of
the Apoſtles,</hi> for a legitimate Piece: But <hi>Baronius, Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevine,
Petavius,</hi> and a great many others, ſpeak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of them. And a Man ſhall find in the Writings of
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> infinite variety of divided
Judgments, in ſuch Caſes as theſe. He that hath a mind
to furniſh himſelf with Examples of this Nature, may
have recourſe to their Books, and particularly to the
Writings of the late Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who differs as
much from the reſt, in this Point of Criticiſm, as he doth
for the moſt part in the Method he obſerves in his Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98310:23"/>
Now I would willingly be informed, what a,
Man ſhould do, amidſt theſe diverſities of Judgment;
and what Path he ſhould take, where he meeteth with
ſo diſagreeing Guides. But yet ſuppoſe that theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have done their utmoſt endeavour in this Deſign,
without any particular affection, or partiality; how,
notwithſtanding, ſhall we be ſatisfied concerning their
ſufficiency for the performance of their Undertaking? Is
it a light Buſineſs, think you, to bring the whole ſtock of
Antiquity to the Cruzet, and there to purifie and refine
it, and to ſeparate all the Droſs from it, which hath ſo
deeply, and for the ſpace of ſo many Ages, been not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it were tied, and faſtned on to it, but even through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mixed, united, and incorporated with it? This Work
requireth the moſt clear and refined Judgment that can
be imagined, an exquiſite Wit, a quick piercing Eye, a
perfect Ear, a moſt exact knowledge in all Hiſtory, both
Ancient and Modern, both Eccleſiaſtical and Secular; a
perfect knowledge of the Ancient Tongues, and a long
and continued Converſation with all ſorts of Writers,
both Ancient, of the middle Ages, and Modern; to be
able to judge of their Inclinations, and which way their
Pulſe beat; to underſtand rightly the manner of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
Invention, and Method in Writing; each Age,
each Nation, and each Author, having their own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
ways in all theſe. Now ſuch a Man as this, is hardly
produced in a whole age. As for thoſe Men who in our
Times have taken upon them this part of Criticiſm, who
knows not, who ſees not, that but reads them, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe forenamed Qualities are wanting in them?
But yet ſuppoſe that ſuch a Man were to be found, and
that he ſhould take in hand this Diſcovery; I do verily
believe that he would be able very eaſily to find out the
Impoſture of a bungling Fool, that had ill counterfeited
the Stamp, Colour, and Weight, in the Piece which he
would father upon ſome other Man; or that ſhould, for
example, endeavour to repreſent either S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98310:23"/>
S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> with a ſtammering Tongue, and ſhould
make them ſpeak barbarous Language, bad <hi>Latin,</hi> and
bad <hi>Greek;</hi> or elſe perhaps ſhould make uſe of ſuch
Terms, Things, or Authors, as were not known to the
World till a long time after theſe Men; or ſhould make
them treat of Matters far removed from the Age they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, and maintain Opinions which they never thought
of, or reject thoſe which they are notoriouſly known to
have held: And of this ſort, for the moſt part, are thoſe
Pieces which our Criticks have decried, and noted unto
us as ſpurious. But if a Man ſhould chance to bring him
a Piece of ſome able Maſter, that ſhould have fully and
exactly learnt both the Languages, Hiſtory, Manners,
Alliances, and Quarrels of the Family he hath boldly
thruſt himſelf into, and ſhould be able to make happy uſe
of all theſe, aſſure your ſelf, that our <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> would be
here as much puzled to diſcover this Jugler, as they were
once in <hi>France,</hi> to convince the Impoſtures of <hi>Martin
Guerre.</hi> Now how can we imagine, but that among ſo
many ſeveral Perſons, that have for their ſeveral Purpoſes
employed their utmoſt Endeavours in theſe kinds of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
there muſt needs have been, in ſo many Centuries
of years, very many able Men, who have had the skill ſo
artificially to imitate the Fancy and Stile of the Perſons
whom they act, as that it is impoſſible to diſcover them?
Eſpecially, if they made choice of ſuch a Name as was
the onely thing remaining in the World of that Author,
ſo that there is no mark left us either of his Stile, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
or Opinions, to guide us in our Examination. And
therefore, in my judgment, he was a very cunning Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and made a right choice, that undertook to write
under the Name of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite:</hi> for we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not left us any true Legitimate Piece of this Author,
by which we may examine this Cheat, the Diſcovery
muſt needs be difficult; and it would have proved ſo
much the more hard, if he had but uſed a more modeſt
and leſs ſwelling manner of Expreſſion: Whereas for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98310:24"/>
thoſe others, who in the Ages following made bold with
the Names of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and
the like; of whoſe legitimate Writings we have very
many Pieces left us: a Man may know them at the firſt
ſight, meerly by the Stile; thoſe Gothick and rude Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
being no more able to counterfeit the Graces and
Elegancies of theſe great Authors, than an Aſs is to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Warblings of the Nightingale. I confeſs, there is
another Help, which, in my judgment, may ſtand us in
more ſtead, in this Particular, than all the reſt; namely,
the Light and Direction of the Ancients themſelves, who
oftentimes make mention of other Writers of the Church
which lived either before, or in their own Times: <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
among the <hi>Latins,</hi> having taken the pains to make
a Catalogue of all thoſe whoſe Names and Writings he
knew of, down from the Apoſtles time to his own; which
was afterward continued by <hi>Gennadius.</hi> To this we
may alſo add that incomparable Work of the Patriarch
<hi>Photius,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Bibliotheca,</hi> and is now publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in this our Age; where this great Perſon hath given
us his Judgment of moſt of the Authors of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church. Now this Help we may make uſe of two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ways: The one is, in juſtifying a Book, if it be
found mentioned by theſe Authors: The other is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
it, if they ſay nothing of it. As for the firſt of theſe,
it concludes onely according to the Quality of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
who make mention of a ſuſpected Book. For, ſome
of the Fathers themſelves have made uſe of theſe kind of
Forgeries, as we have formerly ſaid; others have favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, becauſe they ſerved their turn; ſome have not
been able to diſcover them; and ſome others have not
been willing to do ſo, whatſoever their Reaſon hath
been. I ſhall not here repeat the Names of any of thoſe
that have done theſe things themſelves: And as for thoſe
that have favoured them, there are good ſtore of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theophilus,</hi> and others, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Verſes, as Oracles; which are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98310:24"/>
the greateſt part of them forged.<note place="margin">Hier. ep. 84. ad Magn. Tom. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi>
the moſt Learned, and moſt Polite of all the
Fathers, in S. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s judgment, how often doth he
make uſe of thoſe Apocryphal Pieces which go under
the Names of the Apoſtles and Diſciples, to whom they
were moſt falſly attributed; citing under the Name of
<note n="a" place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and of<note n="b" place="margin">Id. Strom. l. 1. &amp; l. 2. &amp; alibi paſſim.</note> 
                  <hi>Hermes,</hi> ſuch Writings as have been
forged under their Names? And did not the VII Council
in like manner make uſe of a ſuppoſititious Piece, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> as we have ſhewed before; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of divers others which are of the ſame ſtamp?
That even the Fathers themſelves therefore have not
been able always to make a true diſcovery of theſe falſe
Wares, no Man can doubt; conſidering that of thoſe
many neceſſary Qualifications which we reckoned up
before, as requiſite in this Particular, they may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have failed in ſome. <hi>S. Hierome</hi> himſelf, the moſt
knowing Man among all the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, eſpecially in
Matters of this nature, ſometimes lets them paſs without
examination; as there, where he ſpeaks of a certain
Tract againſt <hi>Mathematicians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. ep. 84. ad Magn. Tom. 2.</note> attributed to <hi>Minutius
Foelix, If at leaſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Inſcription repreſent unto
us the right Author of the Book.</hi> And in another place,
whatſoever his reaſon was,<note place="margin">Id. in Catal. Tom. 1.</note> he delivers to us for Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Pieces, the Epiſtles that go about under the Name
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Seneca,</hi> and of <hi>Seneca</hi> to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> which,
notwithſtanding,<note place="margin">Baron. Annal. Tom. 1. an 66.</note> Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> holds for ſuſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
and ſpurious, as doubtleſs they are. But even thoſe Men
who have been able to diſcover theſe falſe Pieces, have
not ſometimes been willing to do it; either being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to offend the Authors of them, or elſe not daring to
caſt any diſrepute upon thoſe Books, which having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good things in them, had not in their judgment any
falſe or dangerous Poſitions in them. And this is the
reaſon why they made choice to let ſuch things paſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than out of a little tenderneſs of conſcience to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them; there being, in their apprehenſion, no danger
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98310:25"/>
at all in the one, and much trouble and envy in the
other. And therefore I am of opinion, That S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
for example, would never have taken the pains, nor
have undergone the envy, in laying open the Forgeries
of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> if the miſunderſtanding that hapned to be
betwixt them, had not engaged him to it. Neither do
I believe that the <hi>African</hi> Fathers would ever have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themſelves in convincing the falſe Allegation of
<hi>Zozimus,</hi> but for their own Intereſt, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
called in queſtion. For wiſe and ſober Men never
uſe to fall at variance with any Body, till they needs
muſt; neither do they quickly take notice of any Injury
or Abuſe offered them, unleſs it be a very great one; and
ſuch as hath evident danger in it: which was not at all
perceived or taken notice of at firſt, in theſe Forgeries;
which nevertheleſs have at length, by little and little, in
a manner born down all the good and true Books. Theſe
Conſiderations, in my opinion, make it clearly appear,
That the Title of a Book is not ſufficiently juſtified by
a Paſſage or two being cited out of it by ſome of the
Ancients, and under the ſame Name. As for the other
way, which rendreth the Authority of a Book doubtful,
by the Ancients not having made any mention of it, I
confeſs it is no more demonſtrative than the other: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as it is not impoſſible, that any one, or divers of

that was then extant; or elſe perhaps that they
might omit ſome one of thoſe very Authors which they
knew. Yet notwithſtanding is this the much ſurer way
of the two; there being leſs danger, in this caſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
a True Piece, than in receiving a Forged one; the
want of the Truth of the one, being doubtleſs much leſs
prejudicial, than the receiving the oppoſite Falſhood of
the other. For as it is a leſs ſin to omit the Good, than
to commit the Evil that is oppoſite to it, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is it a leſs Errour not to believe a Truth, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Falſhood which is contrary to it. And thus we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98310:25"/>
ſee what confuſion there is in the Books of the Ancients,
and what defect in the Means which is requiſite for the
diſtinguiſhing the Falſe from the True: inſomuch that,
as it often falls out, it is much eaſier to judge what we
ought to reject, than to reſolve upon what we may ſafely
receive. Let the Reader therefore now judge, whether
or no theſe Writings having come down along through
ſo many Ages, and paſſed through ſo many Hands, which
are either known to have been notoriouſly guilty, or at
leaſt ſtrongly ſuſpected of Forgery, the Truth in the mean
time having made on its part but very weak reſiſtance
againſt theſe Impoſtures; it be not a very hard matter to
diſcover, amidſt the infinite number of Books that are
now extant, and go under the Names of the Fathers,
which are thoſe that truly belong to them; and which
again are thoſe that are falſly impoſed upon them. And
if it be ſo hard a matter to diſcover in groſs onely which
are the Writings of the Fathers; how much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a Buſineſs will it be to find out what their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are touching the ſeveral Controverſies now in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
For we are not to imagine, that it is no great
matter from which of the Fathers ſuch an Opinion hath
ſprung, ſo that it came from any one of them: for there
is altogether as much difference amongſt theſe Ancient
Doctors, both in reſpect of Authority, Learning, and
Goodneſs, as among the Modern. Beſides, that an Ages
being higher or lower; either raiſeth or leſſeneth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of theſe Writings, in the eſteem both of the one
Party, and of the other, as it were, ſo many grains, as
years: And certainly not altogether without good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
it being moſt evident to any one that hath been
but the leaſt verſed in the reading of theſe Books, That
Time hath by degrees introduced very great Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as well in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the
Ancients, as in all other things. Our Concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall be, That whoſoever ſhall deſire to know
what the Senſe and Judgment of the Primitive Church

hath been, touching our preſent Controverſies; it will
be firſt in a manner as neceſſary for him, as it is difficult,
exactly to find out both the Name and the Age of each
of theſe ſeveral Authors.</p>

Nor yet of thoſe Faults which neceſſarily have
grown up out of the very Tranſcribing; it being an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
thing, that Books which have been copied out
an infinite number of times, during the ſpace of ten or
twelve Centuries of years, by Men of ſo different Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and Hands, ſhould all this while retain exactly, and
in every Particular, the ſelf-ſame Juyce, the ſame Form
and Body that they had when they firſt came forth from
the Author's own hand. Neither ſhall I here ſay any thing
of the ſufferings of theſe Books, by Moths, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other Injuries of Time, by which they have been
corrupted; while all kind of Learning, for ſo many Ages
together, lay buried, as it were, in the Grave; the
Worms on one ſide feeding on the Books of the Learned,
and on the other the Duſt defacing them; ſo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
now to reſtore them to their firſt integrity. And
this is the ſad Fate that all ſorts of Books have lain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
whence hath ſprung up ſo great variety of Readings
as are found almoſt in all Authors. I ſhall not here make
any advantage of this; though there are ſome Doctors
in the World, that have ſhewed us the way to do it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage from this Conſideration to leſſen the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that the Holy Scriptures of themſelves ought to
have in the eſteem of all Men, under this colour, That
even in theſe Sacred Writings there are ſometimes found
varieties of Reading, which yet are of very little or no
Importance, as to the Ground-work. If we would tread
in theſe Mens ſteps, and apply to the Writings of the
Fathers, what they ſpeak and conclude of the Scriptures,
we could do it upon much better terms than they; there
being no reaſon in the Earth to imagine, but that the
Books of the Ancient Writers have ſuffered very much
more than the Scriptures have; which have always been
preſerved in the Church, with much greater care than
any other Books have been whatſoever, and which have
been learnt by all Nations, and tranſlated into all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;
which all Sects have retained, both <hi>Orthodox</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:98310:27"/>
and <hi>Hereticks, Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks, Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Latins, Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> obſerving diligently
the Eye, and the Hand, one of the other: ſo that there
could not poſſibly happen any remarkable Alteration
in them, but that preſently the whole World, as it were,
would have exclaimed againſt it, and have made their
Complaints to have reſounded throughout the Univerſe.
Whereas, on the contrary, the Writings of the Fathers
have been kept, tranſcribed, and read in as careleſs a
manner as could be; and that too but by very few, and
in few Places, being but rarely underſtood by any, ſave
thoſe of the ſame Language; which is the cauſe that ſo
many Faults have both the more eaſily crept into them,
and likewiſe are the more hard to be diſcovered. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that the particular Stile and Obſcurity of ſome of
them, renders the Errours the more important. As for
example: Take me a <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and you ſhall find, that
one little Word added, or taken away, or altered never
ſo little, or a <hi>Full-point</hi> or <hi>Comma</hi> but out of its place,
will ſo confound the Senſe, that you will not be able to
find what he would have. Whereas in Books of an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
ſmooth, clear Style, as the Scriptures for the moſt
part are, theſe Faults are much leſs prejudicial, ſeeing they
cannot in any wiſe ſo darken the Senſe, but that it will
be ſtill eaſie enough to apprehend it. But I ſhall paſs by
all theſe minute Punctilioes, as more ſuitable to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> and <hi>Academicks,</hi> whoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it is to queſtion all things; than of Chriſtians, who
onely ſeek, in ſimplicity and ſincerity of heart, whereon
to build their Faith. I ſhall onely here take notice of ſuch
alterations as have been knowingly and voluntarily made
in the Writings of the Fathers, purpoſely by our holding
our peace, to diſguiſe their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſe, or elſe to make them
ſpeak more than they meant. And this Forgery is of two
ſorts: The one hath been made uſe of with a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the other out of malice: Again, The one hath been
committed in Times long ſince paſt, the other in this laſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98310:27"/>
Age, in our own days, and the days of our Fathers. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the one is in the Additions made to Authors, to make
them ſpeak more than they meant; the other in ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
from the Author, to eclipſe and darken what he
would be underſtood to ſay. Neither ought we to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that even thoſe of the honeſt, innocent, primitive
Times alſo made uſe of theſe Deceits, ſeeing that, for a
good end, they made no great ſcruple to forge whole
Books, taking a much ſtranger and bolder courſe, in my
opinion, than the other. For without all doubt it is a
greater Crime to coin falſe Money, than to clip, or a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
alter the true. This Opinion hath always been in the
World, That to ſettle a certain and aſſured eſtimation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that which is good and true (that is to ſay, upon what
we account to be ſuch) it is neceſſary that we remove out
of the way, whatſoever may be a hinderance to it; and
that there can be no great danger either in putting in, or
at leaſt in leaving any thing in, that may yield aſſiſtance
to it, whatſoever the iſſue of either of theſe may in the
end prove to be. And hence hath it come to paſs, that we
have ſo many ancient Forgeries, and alſo ſo many ſtrange
ſtories of Miracles, and of Viſions; many taking a delight
in feigning (as S.<note place="margin">Hier. ep. 4. ad Ruſtic. Tom. 1. Daemonum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra ſe pugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, foraſmuch as they account them uſeful, for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or encreaſing either of the Faith or Devotion of the
People. What will you ſay, if at this day there are ſome,
even of thoſe Men who make profeſſion of being the
greateſt haters in the world of theſe ſubtilties, who cannot
nevertheleſs put forth any Book, but they muſt needs be
lopping off, or falſifying whatſoever doth not wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

Common People, might infect them, and poſſeſs their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98310:28"/>
Heads with new Fancies? So firmly hath this Opinion
been of old rooted in the Nature of Man. Now I will
not here diſpute, whether this proceeding of theirs be
lawful, or not: I ſhall only ſay by the way, That in my
judgment it is a very great ſhame for the Truth, to be
eſtabliſhed or defended by ſuch falſifications and ſhifts;
as if it had not ſufficient Weapons, both defenſive and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive,
of its own, but that it muſt be fain to borrow of
its Adverſary: and it is beſides a very dangerous courſe
too; becauſe that the diſcovery of any one Cheat, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
renders their Cauſe, who practiſed it, wholly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
inſomuch that, by making uſe of ſuch ſlights as
theſe in <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> either for the gaining to you,
or confirming the faith of ſome of the ſimpler People, it is
to be feared, that you may give diſtaſte to the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
ſort; and ſo by this means at length may
chance to loſe the Affections of the ſimpler ſort too. But
whatſoever this courſe of Cheating be, either in it ſelf, or
in its Conſequences; it is ſufficient for my purpoſe, that
it hath been a long time practiſed in the Church, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion; for proof whereof, I ſhall here produce
ſome Inſtances. The Hereticks have always been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of uſing this Artifice: but I ſhall not here ſet down
what Alterations have been made by the Ancienteſt of
them, even in the Scriptures themſelves. If you would
have a Taſte of this Practice of theirs, go but to <hi>Tertullian</hi>
and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and you ſhall there ſee, how <hi>Marcion</hi> had
clipped and altered the Goſpel of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he allowed to be ſuch. Neither
have thoſe other of the Ages following been any whit
more conſcientious in this Particular, as may appear by
thoſe Complaints made by <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ruffin. in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ. Symbol. &amp; lit. de adult. ſcript. Origen.</note>, in his Expoſition

the Moderns, by thoſe very Perſons alſo who have put
forth the General Councils at <hi>Rome,</hi> who inform us,
in the Preface to the Firſt Volume,<note n="b" place="margin">In Praefat. in Tom. 1. Concil. Gen.</note> That <hi>Time,</hi> and the
Fraud of the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> have been the cauſe that the Acts

entire, nor pure and ſincere, that which hath remained
of them: and before, they grievouſly bewail, that we
ſhould be thus deprived of ſo great and ſo precious a
Treaſure. Now this Teſtimony of theirs, to me, is
worth a thouſand others; ſeeing it comes from ſuch who
in my opinion are evidently intereſted to ſpeak quite
otherwiſe. For if the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Miſtreſs and Truſtee of the Faith, hath ſuffered
any part of the Councils to periſh and be loſt, which is
eſteemed by them as the <hi>Code</hi> of the Church; what then
may the reſt have ſuffered alſo? And what may not the
Hereticks and Schiſmaticks have been able to do? And
if all theſe Evidences have been altered by their Fraud,
how ſhall we be able by them to come to the knowledge
of the Senſe and Judgment of the Ancients? I confeſs
I am very much ama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed, to ſee theſe Men make ſo much
reckoning of the Acts of the Councils, and to make ſuch
grievous Complaints againſt the Hereticks, for having
ſuppreſſed ſome of them. For if theſe things are of
ſuch uſe, why then do they themſelves keep from us the
Acts of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Council, both for them, and their Party, that
hath been held in the Chriſtian Church theſe eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years? If it be a Crime in the Hereticks, to have
kept from us theſe precious Jewels; why are not they
afraid, leſt the blame which they lay on others, may
chance to return upon themſelves? But doubtleſs
there is ſomething in the Buſineſs, that renders theſe
Caſes different: and I confeſs I wonder they publiſh it
not; the ſimpler ſort; for want of being otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
thinking perhaps, (though, it may be, without
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98310:29"/>
cauſe) that the reaſon why the Acts of this laſt Council
are kept ſo cloſe from them is, becauſe they know that
the publiſhing of them would be either prejudicial, or
at leaſt unprofitable, to the Greatneſs of the Church of
<hi>Rome:</hi> And they alſo again, on the other ſide, conceive,
that in thoſe other Acts, which they ſay have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the Hereticks, there were wonderful Matters
to be found, for the greater advancing and ſupporting
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whatſoever the Reaſon be, I
cannot but commend the Ingenuity of theſe Men, who,
notwithſtanding their Intereſt, which ſeemeth to engage
them to the contrary, have yet nevertheleſs confeſſed,
That the Councils which we have at this day are neither
entire, nor uncorrupted. But let us now examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no even the Orthodox Party themſelves have not

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reports, That

Catholicks would have made no great ſcruple of blotting
out of the Writings of the Fathers any Word that they

that if he found any thing there, that was not ſo conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

<hi>De locis Hebraicis,</hi> he confeſſeth, that he had left out that
which he conceived was not worth remembring; and
that he had altered the greateſt part of it. And to make it

but compare his <hi>Latin</hi> Chronology, with the <hi>Greek</hi> Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which remain of <hi>Euſebius;</hi> where you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee what liberty theſe Ancients allowed themſelves in
the Writings of others. And what doubt is there to be
made, but that thoſe Men that came after them, following
the Authority of ſo great an Example, carefully either
took out of their Copies, or elſe left out of their Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the greateſt part of whatever they found to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant

likewiſe, that for adding the greater Authority to them,
ſome have had the boldneſs to add in ſome places what

note, That this Alteration hath taken place, even in the
moſt ſacred and Publick Pieces alſo; as namely, in the
Liturgies of the Church, and the like: and I ſhall give
you this Obſervation, to the end it may carry with it the

that in tract of time, according as the Prelates have
thought fitteſt to move the Affections of the People to Piety
and Devotion, many other things have been either added,
or altered; and (which is much worſe) many ſuperſtitious
things have been introduced alſo: in which particular, I

as to theſe Points, wherewith the Moderns ſo much
pleaſe themſelves. But to return, and to take the Times
all along as they lie, we may obſerve that this Licence
grew ſtronger daily, as the Times grew worſe; becauſe
that the greater the diſtance of time was from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
own Age, the more difficult the diſcovery of theſe
Forgeries muſt neceſſarily be: the Example alſo of ſome
of the moſt eminent Perſons among the Ancients, who
had ſometimes made uſe of theſe ſleights, adding on the
other ſide boldneſs to every one, and courage to venture
upon what they had done before them. For, I pray you,
is it not a ſtrange thing, that the Legats of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> in
the year 451. in the midſt of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi>
where were aſſembled 600 Biſhops, the very Flower
and Choice of the whole Clergy, ſhould have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

years after this Council. When I conſider, that the Legats
of ſo holy a Pope would at that time have faſtned ſuch a
Wen upon the Body of ſo Venerable a Canon, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ready to think, that we ſcarcely have any thing of
Antiquity left us, that is entire, and uncorrupt, except it
be in Matters of Indifferency, or which could not have

which is the 163. of the Greek <hi>Code</hi> of the Church
Univerſal, forbidding to read in Churches any other
Books, than thoſe which are Canonical; gives us withal
a long Catalogue of them. <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus,</hi> although
he hath indeed inſerted in his Collection <hi>Num.</hi> 162. the
beginning of the ſaid Canon, which forbiddeth to read
any other Books in the Churches, beſides the ſacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of the Old and New Teſtament; yet hath he whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
omitted the Catalogue, or Liſt of the ſaid Books: fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as I conceive, leſt the Tail of this Catalogue might
ſcandalize the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> where, many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> had,<note place="margin">Innocent. 1. ep. 3. ad Exup. Tholoſ. c. 7.</note> by an expreſs Decree to that
purpoſe, put into the Canon of the Old Teſtament, the
<hi>Maccabees,</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom of Solomon, Eccleſiaſticus, Tobit,
Judith, &amp;c.</hi> of which Books the Fathers of the Council of
<hi>Laodicea</hi> make no mention at all, naming but XXII Books
of the Old Teſtament; and in the Catalogue of the New,
utterly omitting the <hi>Apocalypſe.</hi> If any Man can ſhew me
any better reaſon of this ſuppreſſion, let him ſpeak: as for
my part I conceive this the moſt probable that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
however, we are not at all bound to divine, what
the motive ſhould be, that made <hi>Dionyſius</hi> out off that

ſerves the turn well enough, to make it appear, that at

that time they made no great conſcience to curtal, if need
were, the very Text of the Canons themſelves. So that if

how, did he, or ought he to omit, this ſo remarkable a
Canon? If all other Evidences had been loſt how ſhould

we have been able ſo much as to have gheſſed, that any
ſuch thing was ever treated of at <hi>Chalcedon?</hi> Where, or
by what means could we have learnt, what the opinion
was of the DCXXX. Fathers, which met here together,
touching this Point; which is the moſt important one,
of all thoſe that are at this day controverted betwixt us?
And it is now eleven hundred years, and upward, ſince
this Omiſſion was firſt on foot. And who will paſs his
word to us, that among ſo many other Writings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Councils, or particular Mens Works, whether
Greek or Latine, the like liberty hath not been at any time
uſed? Rather by theſe Forgeries which have come to
our knowledge, who can doubt, but that there have been
many other the like, which we are ignorant of? Thou
haſt gone along innocently perhaps, reading theſe Books
of the Ancients, and believing, thou there findeſt the
pure ſenſe of Antiquity; and yet thou ſeeſt here, that from
the beginning of the Sixth Century they have made no
ſcruple of cutting off, from the moſt Sacred Books they
had, whatſoever was not agreeable to the guſt of the
Times. And therefore, though we had no more againſt
them than this, it were, in my judgment, a ſufficient
reaſon to move us to go on here very warily, and, as they
ſay, With a ſtiff Rein, through this whole buſineſs. In
the next place, there is a very obſervable Corruption in
the Epiſtle of <hi>Adrian</hi> I.<note place="margin">Concil. VII. Act. 2. Tom. 3. Concil.</note> to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in
the time of the Second Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> For in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Collection of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> made about ſeven hundred
and fifty years ſince, <hi>Adrian</hi> is there made to ſpeak very
highly, and magnificently of the ſupremacy of his See,
and he rebukes the Greeks very ſhrewdly, for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
upon <hi>Taraſius,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
the Title of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop.</hi> And all this while, there is
not ſo much as one word of this to be found, neither in
the Greek Edition of the ſaid VII. Council, nor yet in the
common Latine ones. The Romaniſts accuſe the Greeks
of having ſuppreſſed theſe two Clauſes: and the Greeks
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98310:34"/>
again accuſe the Romaniſts, of having foiſted them in:
neither is it eaſie to determine, on which ſide the guilt
lies. However, it is ſufficient for me, that whereſoever
the fault lies, it evidently appeareth hence, that this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talling
and adding to Authors, according to the intereſt
of the preſent Times, hath now a very long time been in
practice amongſt Chriſtians. Which appears alſo very
evidently, in the next piece following in the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
namely, the Epiſtle of <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Taraſius;</hi> which is
quite another thing in the Greek, from what it is in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſius</hi>
his Latin Tranſlation; and that in Points too of
as high importance, as thoſe other before mentioned.
And ſo in the V. Act likewiſe,<note place="margin">Conc VII. Act. 5. Tom. 3. Conc.</note> where both in the Greek
Text, and alſo in the Old Latin Tranſlation, <hi>Taraſius</hi> is
called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop;</hi> this Title appears not at all in
<hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> his Tranſlation. In the ſame Act the Fathers
accuſe the <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 557.</note> of having cut out many Leaves out
of a certain Book in the Library at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and
that at a certain City called <hi>Photia,</hi> they had burned to the
number of Thirty Volumes; and that beſides all this,
they had raſed the Annotations out of a certain Book;
and all this out of the malice they bore againſt Images,
which theſe Books ſpake well and favourably of. But yet
I do not ſee, how we can excuſe the Romaniſts, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilty of corrupting <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> in thoſe paſſages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
noted; nor yet of the injury they do <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in

Whence it appears, how much credit we are to give
to theſe Men, when they alledge here and there divers
ſtrange and unheard of pieces; and on the contrary, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reject whatever their Adverſaries bring; as, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
they did a remarkable Paſſage, alledged by them
out of <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> which Paſſage they refuſed as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98310:34"/>
                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>if Epiphanius had been of

                  <hi>he would then in his</hi>

of the <hi>Iconoclaſts;</hi> for otherwiſe he would have reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their opinion among the reſt of the Hereſies by him
reckoned up? I ſhal not here ſay any thing of their refuſing
ſo boldly, and confidently, thoſe Paſſages alledged out of
<hi>The odotui Ancyranus,</hi> and others. Since that time you ſhall
find nothing more ordinary, in the Books both of the
Greeks and the Latins, than the like reproaches, that they
mutually caſt upon each other, of having corrupted the
Pieces and Evidences wherein their cauſe was the moſt
concerned: As for example, at the Council of <hi>Florence,
Mark</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> diſputing concerning the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> had nothing to anſwer to two

and ſo likewiſe of that other paſſage out of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
that <hi>Some one or other who favoured the opinion of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

had accommodated that place to their ſence:</hi> withall
<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. Act. 20.</note> proteſting, that in all <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> there was but four

by the Latins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that there was in the ſaid City above
a thouſand other copies wherein thoſe words were not to
be found at all. Then had the Latins nothing to return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them more readily, than that it had been the ordinary
practice, not of the Weſt, but of the Eaſt; to corrupt
Books<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for proof hereof, they preſently cite a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
out of S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> which we have formerly ſet down:
where notwithſtanding he ſpeaks not any thing, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Hereticks; that is to ſay, of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> who
were ſaid to have falſified the Epiſtle of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to
<hi>Epictetus;</hi> but not a word there of all the Eaſtern men,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98310:35"/>
much leſs of the whole Greek Church. The Greeks
then charged back upon the Latines the ſtory of Pope
<hi>Zozimus,</hi> mentioned in the preceeding Chapter. And thus
did they bandy ſtifly one againſt the other, each of them,
as may be eaſily perceived, having much more appearance
of reaſon and of truth, in their accuſation of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
than in excuſing or defending themſelves. I ſhall

in like manner lately quitted his hands of an objection,
taken out of the 68. Canon of the Apoſtles, againſt the
Faſting on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> which is obſerved in the Roman
Church: pretending, that the Greeks have falſified this
Canon. But whoſoever deſires to ſee how full of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
the Writings of this later Antiquity are, let him but
read the VIII. Council which is pretended by the
Weſtern Church, to be a general Council, and but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Latine and the Greek Copies together, withal
taking eſpecial notice of the Preface of <hi>Anaſtaſius Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecarius;</hi>
who after he hath very ſharply reproved the
Ambition of the Greeks, and accuſed the Canons which
they produce of the Third General Council, as Forged,
and ſuppoſititious; to make ſhort work with them, he
ſays in plain terms, that the Greeks have corrupted all
the Councils, except the Firſt. What then have we now
left us to build upon, ſeeing that this Corruption hath
prevailed even as far as on the Councils, which are the
very heart of the Ancient Monuments of the Church?
Neither yet hath the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> which hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and made ſacred in ſo many General Councils,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98310:35"/>
been able to eſcape theſe Alterations. For, not to ſpeak any
thing of theſe Expreſſions, which are of little importance;
<hi>De Coelis,</hi> from Heaven; <hi>ſecundum Scripturas,</hi> according
to the Scriptures; <hi>Deum de Deo,</hi> God of God; which

and the Son, in the Article touching the Proceſſion of the
Holy Ghoſt; the Weſtern Men as ſenſeleſly charging back
upon them again, that they have cut it off: Which is an
Alteration, though it ſeem but trivial in appearance, that
is of great importance, both to the one ſide, and to the
other, for the deciſion of that great Controverſie, which
hath hitherto cauſed a ſeparation betwixt them; namely,
<hi>Whether or no the Holy Ghoſt proceed from the Son, as well
as from the Father?</hi> Which is an evident Argument, that
either the one or the other of them, hath, out of a deſire
to do ſervice to their own Side, laid falſe hands upon this
Sacred Piece. Now whatever hath been attempted in this
kind by the Ancients, may well paſs for Innocence, if
compar'd but with what theſe Later Times have dared
to do; their Paſſion being of late years ſo much heated,
that laying all Reaſon and Honeſty aſide, they have moſt
miſerably and ſhameleſly corrupted all ſorts of Books, and

ſuppreſſed ſuch Pieces, without ſparing any, though they
were written perhaps two, three, four, or five hundred
years before, more than the others. As for example: It

for the printing of Books, as that in thoſe Countries
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98310:40"/>

ever any thing ſhould be publiſhed, that is either contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

which are too long to be inſerted here, may be ſeen
at the end of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where they are uſually
ſet down at large. And in order to theſe Rules, they have
ſince put forth their <hi>Indices Expurgatorii,</hi> (as they call
them;) namely, that of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and other places; where theſe Gallants come with their
Razor in their hand, and ſit in judgment upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Chapters, and whole Treatiſes alſo often times, and
that too in the Works of thoſe Men, who for the moſt
part were born, and bred up, and dyed alſo in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of their own Church. If the Church for eight
or nine hundred years ſince, had ſo ſharp Razors as theſe
men now have; it is then a vain thing for us, to ſearch
any higher, what the judgment of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
was, touching any particular Point: for, whatſoever
it was, it could not have eſcaped the hands of ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
And if the Ancient Church had not heretofore
any ſuch Inſtitution as this; why then do we, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

guilty of the ſame cruelty that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is among the

in the Books of the Moderns, are the cauſe of the greater
miſchief to themſelves, when they are found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

in the Ancients, as in the Moderns; and where they may
ſafely do it, they expunge them, as well out of the one, as
out of the other. But this they dare not do openly, for
fear of giving too much ſcandal to the World, which
they are unwilling to do: becauſe if they ſhould deal ſo
uncivilly, and make ſo bold with Antiquity, they would
quite take off that reſpect, which all people bear toward
it; which being a matter which very nearly concerns
themſelves, it is a ſpecial point of wiſdom in them, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to keep up the Reputation of it. But in laſhing the

(<hi>ſaith</hi> Bertram, <hi>ſpeaking of the Holy
Euchariſt,</hi>) that in this Bread is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only the Body of Chriſt, but the Body
of the People alſo, that believe in him. And
hence it is that it is made up of many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
grains of wheat, becauſe that the
whole Body of believing People is united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and made into one, by the word of
Chriſt. And therefore as it is by a Myſtery,
that we receive this Bread, for the Body of
Chriſt: in like manner it is by a Myſtery alſo,
that the Members of the People believing in
Chriſt, are here figured out unto us. And as
this Bread is called the Body of Believers,
not corporally, but ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lly; ſo is the
Body of Chriſt alſo neceſſarily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be repreſented here, not corporally,
but ſpiritually. In like manner is it in the
Wine, which is called the Blood of Chriſt;
and with which it is ordained, that water
be mixed; it being forbidden to offer the
one without the other: becauſe that as the
Head cannot ſubſiſt without the Body, nor
the Body without the Head; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
neither can the People be without
Chriſt, nor Chriſt without the People: ſo
that in this Sacrament, the Water repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth
the Image of the People. If then
the Wine, after it is conſecrated by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Miniſters, be corporally changed into
the Blood of Chriſt, of neceſſity then muſt the
Water alſo be changed corporally into the
Body of the Believing people: becauſe that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98310:42"/>
where there is but one only, and the ſame
Sanctification, there can be but one and the
ſame Operation: and where the Reaſon is
equal, the Myſtery alſo that fellows it is
equal. But now as for the Water, we ſee
that there is no ſuch corporal change
wrought in it: it therefore follows, that
neither in the Wine is there any corporal
Tranſmutation. Whatſoever then of the
Body of the People is ſignified unto us, by the
Water, is taken ſpiritually: it followeth
therefore neceſſarily, that we muſt, in like
manner take ſpiritually, whatſoever the
Wine repreſenteth unto us, of the Blood of
Chriſt. Again, thoſe things, which differ
among themſelves, are not the ſame: Now
the Body of Chriſt which died, and was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
up to life again, now dieth no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become immortal; and Death having
no more power over it, it is eternal, and
free from further ſuffering. But this, which
is Conſecrated in the Church, is Temporal,
not Eternal; corruptible, not free from
corruption; in its journey, and not in its
native country. Theſe two things therefore
are different one from the other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
cannot be one and the ſame thing. And if they be not
one and the ſame thing, how can any man ſay, that this is
the Real Body and Real Blood of Chriſt? For if it be the Body
of Chriſt; and if it may be truly ſaid, that this Body of
Chriſt is really and truly the Body of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

finding, that the language of both theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

theirs, and thoſe many other Cheats which we, to their
great grief, are now ſearching into, what an extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
they have to keep from us the Opinion, and ſenſe of
the Ancients in all thoſe Particulars, where they never ſo
little contradict their own Doctrine: and remembring
withal, how they have had, and ſtill have every day, ſuch
opportunities of doing what they pleaſe in this kind, thou

where there was cauſe: which blows of theirs, together
with the Alterations and Changes, that Time, the Malice

hard to be underſtood, by reaſon of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
and Idioms they wrote in, the Manner
of their Writing, which is for the moſt part
incumbred with Figures, and Rhetorical
Flouriſhes, and nice Logical Subtilties, and
the like; and alſo by reaſon of the Terms,
which they for the moſt part uſed in a far
different ſenſe from what they now bear.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF any Man, either by the light of his own proper Wit,
or by the aſſiſtance and direction of ſome able and
faithful hand, ſhall at length be able thereby, as by the
help of the <hi>Clew</hi> the Poets ſpeak of, to winde himſelf
happily out of theſe two Labyrinths, and to find any Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Ancients, that are not onely Legitimate, but
alſo entire, and uncorrupt; certainly that Man hath very
good reaſon to rejoyce at his own good fortune, and to
give God hearty thanks for it. For I muſt needs confeſs,
that it is no very ſmall ſatisfaction to a Man, to have the
opportunity of converſing with thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons
of the Ages paſt, and to learn of them what their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were, and to compare our own with theirs;</p>

               <p>But yet this I dare confidently pronounce, That if he
would know out of them what their Senſe and Opinion
hath: truly been, touching the Differences now in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he will find, that he is now but at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and entrance of his Buſineſs; and that there remain
behind many more Difficulties to be overcome in his
paſſage, than he hath yet grappled with. One of the two
diſagreeing Parties, refuſing the Scriptures for the Judge
of Controverſies, by reaſon of its Obſcurity, lays this

for a Ground (and indeed rationally enough) that no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure

ſay, in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> which are the Tongues that
moſt of them wrote in. For, as for thoſe of the Fathers
who have written either in <hi>Syriack,</hi> or <hi>Arabick,</hi> or <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian,</hi>
or the like Vulgar Tongues of their own; whoſe
Writings perhaps would be as uſeful to us, in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Opinions of the Ancient Church, as any others;
we have not, that I know of, any of theſe Monuments
now publickly to be ſeen abroad, but only ſome Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, in <hi>Greek,</hi> or in <hi>Latin:</hi> as namely, the Works
of S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> (if at leaſt thoſe Books which go abroad

and perhaps ſome few other the like. I know very
well, that for the moſt part Men truſt to the Tranſlations
of the Fathers, whether they be in <hi>Latin,</hi> or in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Languages; and that the World is now come to that
paſs, that People will not ſtick to take upon them to
judge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, without having (at leaſt, that
can be perceived out of their Writings) any competent
knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue:<note place="margin">Bellarmine.</note> which cannot in my
judgment, be accounted any thing leſs than a point of
the higheſt boldneſs and unadviſedneſs that can be. The
thing is clear enough of it ſelf, that to be able to reach the
Conceptions and Senſe of a Man, eſpecially in Matters of
Importance, it is moſt neceſſary that we underſtand the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98310:44"/>
Language he delivers himſelf in, his Terms, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their coherence; there being in every particular
Language a certain peculiar Force, and Power of Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
which can very hardly be ſo preſerved in a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
but that it will loſe in the paſſage ſomething of
its natural Luſtre and Vigour, how knowing, able, and
faithful ſoever the Interpreter be. But this, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſeful indeed in all other caſes, is moſt neceſſary in this
particular Buſineſs we have now in hand; by reaſon of
the little care and fidelity that we find in the Tranſlations
of the greateſt part of the Interpreters of the Fathers,
whether Ancient, or Modern. We have before ſeen how
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and even S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf too, have laid about
them, in this particular; and, long after them, <hi>Anaſtaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
alſo, in his Tranſlation of the VII Council; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
in his Preface to the VIII, gives us this
for a moſt Infallible Rule; namely, That whatſoever is
found in his Tranſlation, is True, and Legitimate; and
on the contrary, whatſoever the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ſaid, either
more or leſs, is ſuppoſitious and forged. If all the other
Interpreters of the Councils and Fathers, had been Men
of the ſame Temper that <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> here would have us
believe him to have been of, we might then indeed very
well lay by the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, and content our ſelves with
ſuch dull <hi>Latin</hi> as he hath furniſhed us with in his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation:
But the miſchief of it is, that all the World doth
not believe this Teſtimony which he hath given of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and that, although he hath ſuch a ſpecial gift in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
his own Tranſlation above the Original, yet this
will hardly ever be allowed to the reſt of Tranſlators,
eſpecially the Modern; who having been Men that have
been for the moſt part carried away with their aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to their own Party, he muſt needs be a very weak Man,
that ſhould truſt to them in this caſe, and relie upon what
they ſay. Whoſoever hath yet a mind to be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied

alſo of the Affections of Tranſlators, who
many times make their Authors ſpeak more
than they meant, in <hi>Jo. Chriſtophorſon</hi>'s Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians; as likewiſe in moſt
of the Tranſlators of theſe later Times, excepting only
ſome very few of the more moderate ſort. But we ſhall
not need to inſiſt any longer on this Particular, which hath
been ſufficiently proved already, by the ſeveral Parties of
both Sides, diſcovering the falſeneſs of their Adverſaries
Tranſlations; as every Man muſt needs know, that is any
whit converſant in theſe kind of Writings; where you
ſhall meet with nothing more frequent, than theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Reprehenſions of each other. Now in the midſt of
ſuch diſtraction, and contrariety of Judgments, how can
a Man poſſibly aſſure himſelf, that he hath the true ſenſe

I ſhall here lay down then for a moſt ſure Ground, and
undeniable Maxime, That to be able rightly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

that we firſt underſtand the Language they write in;
and that too, not ſlightly, and ſuperficially; but exactly,
and fully: there being in all Languages certain peculiar
Terms, and Idioms, familiarly uſed by the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no Man ſhall ever be able to underſtand throughly and

could he have uttered more dark and obſcure, than this
Paſſage is of his, in his Fourth Book againſt <hi>Marcion:
Chriſt having taken Bread, and diſtributed it to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
made it his Body, in ſaying, This is my Body; that is,
to ſay, The Figure of my Body?</hi> If S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> held <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi>
what can the meaning be of theſe words of
his; <hi>The Lord ſtuck not to ſay, This is my Body, when he
delivered onely the Sign of his Body?</hi> If theſe Paſſages, and
an infinite number of the like, do really and truly mean
that which Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> pretends they do, then was
there never any thing of obſcurity either in the Riddles
of the <hi>Theban Sphinx,</hi> or in the Oracles of the <hi>Sibyls.</hi> If
you look on the other ſide, you ſhall meet with ſome
other Paſſages in the Fathers, which ſeem to ſpeak point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank
againſt the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> as for example; where they
ſay expreſly, <hi>That the Bread changeth its nature;</hi> and,
<hi>That, by the Almighty Power of God, it becomes the Fleſh of
the Word:</hi> and the like. And ſo in all the Controverſies
betwixt them, they produce ſuch Paſſages as theſe, both
on the one ſide, and on the other: ſome whereof ſeem
to be irreconcileable to the Senſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and ſome other, to the Senſe of their Adverſaries. If
Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and thoſe other ſubſime Wits of both
Parties, can have the confidence to affirm, that they find
no difficulty at all in theſe Particulars, we muſt needs
think, that either they ſpeak this but out of a Bravado, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a good face upon a bad matter; or elſe, that both the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98310:47"/>
Wits; and Eye-ſight of all the reſt of the World are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
dull, and feeble, in finding nothing but Darkneſs
there, where theſe Men ſee nothing but Light. But yet
for all this, if there be not obſcurity in theſe Writings of
the Fathers, and that very much too; how comes it to
paſs that even theſe very Men find themſelves ever and
anon ſo tormented to find out the meaning of them?
How comes it to paſs, that they are fain to uſe ſo many
words, and make tryal of ſo many tricks, and devices for
the clearing of them? Whence proceeds it, that ſo often,
for fear of not being able to ſatisfie their Readers, they
are forced to cry down either the Authors, or the
Pieces, out of which their Adverſaries produce their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies?
What ſtrange Sentences, and Paſſages of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are thoſe, that require more time, and trouble in
the clearing Them, than in deciding the Controverſie it
ſelf; and which multiply Differences, rather than deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them; oftentimes ſerving as a Covert, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place
to both Parties? The ſenſe, and meaning of theſe
words is debated; <hi>This is my Body.</hi> For the explaining
of them, there is brought this Paſſage, out of <hi>Tertullian;</hi>
and that other, out of S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Now I would have
any Man ſpeak in his conſcience, what he thinks; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or not theſe words are not as clear, or clearer, than
thoſe Paſſages which they alledge out of theſe Fathers,
as they are explained by the different Parties. I deſire,
Reader, no other judge than thy ſelf, whoſoever thou
art; only provided, that thou wilt but vouchſafe to
read, and examine that which is now ſaid upon theſe
places, and withal conſider the ſtrange Turnings and
Windings-about, that they make us take, to bring us
to the right ſenſe and meaning of them. In a word, if the
moſt able Men that are, did not find themſelves extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
puzled, and perplexed, in diſtinguiſhing the Legitimate
Writings of the Fathers from the Spurious; it is not
likely, that the <hi>Cenſors</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> who are

                  </gap> contrived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and imputting ſome convenient probable ſenſe
upon them. That which hath been ſaid, I am confident is
ſufficient to convince any reaſonable Man of the Truth
of this Aſſertion of ours; namely, that it is a very hard
matter to underſtand the ſenſe and opinions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by their Books. But, that we may leave no doubt
behind us. let us briefly conſider ſome few of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Cauſes of this Difficulty. Certainly the Fathers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been Wiſe Men, all of them both ſpoke, and wrote,
to be underſtood; inſomuch that, having both the will,
and the ability to do it, it ſeemeth very ſtrange, that they
ſhould not be able to attain to the end they aimed at. But
we muſt here call to mind, what we have ſaid before;
namely, that theſe Controverſies of ours being not in
their time yet ſprung up; they had no occaſion, neither
was it any of their deſign, either to ſpeak, or write any
thing of them. For theſe Sages ſtirred up as few doubts,
in matters of Religion, as they could: Beſides that their
times furniſhed them with ſufficient matter of Diſputes,
in Points which were then in agitation; without ſo
much as thinking of Ours, now on foot. And they have
very clearly delivered their ſenſe, in all thoſe Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,
which they have handled. Even <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf,
who is the moſt obſcure amongſt them all, hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
delivered himſelf ſo clearly, in the debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and <hi>Marcion,</hi> and others, that there is no place
left for a Man to doubt, what his opinions were, in the
points debated of. I am therefore fully perſwaded, that
if they had lived in theſe times, or that the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
had been agitated in their times, they would
have delivered their judgment upon them very plainly,
and expreſly. But ſeeing they have not touched upon
them, but only by the By; and as they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me accidentally
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98310:48"/>
into their way, rather than upon any ſet purpoſe; we are
not to think it ſtrange, if we find them not to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, and given their ſenſe clearly, as to theſe Debates
of ours. For as any Man may eaſily obſerve in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courſe of things, thoſe things that happen without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
are never clear; and full, but ambiguous, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and oftentimes alſo contrary perhaps, either to the
ſenſe, or the affection of the perſon from whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
Thus before the ſpringing up of that pernicious
doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> who ſo much troubled the Ancient
Church; there wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Divine Nature of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or if the Fathers ſaid any

ſuch things, as are not very conſonant to the

<hi>Antioch</hi> had before denied this. Whether the Fathers
therefore affirm, or deny, that the Euchariſt is really the
Body of Chriſt, they will not however therein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
thy opinion, whoſoever thou art, whether Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,
or Proteſtant, any more, than the Fathers of the
Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſeem to have contradicted thoſe of
the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> We may add hereto, that as the
<hi>Arians</hi> ought not in reaſon to have alledged, in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their opinion, any ſuch Paſſages of the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as had innocently, in paſſage only, and in diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
on other ſubjects, without any thought of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of theirs, fallen from them, ſo neither to ſay truth,
is there any reaſon, that either Thou, or I, ſhould produce,
as Definitive Sentences upon our preſent Controverſies,
which have been ſtarted but of late years, any ſuch Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Fathers as were written by them, in treating
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98310:50"/>
of other matters, many Ages before the breaking forth
of our Differences, whereof they never had the leaſt,
thought; and concerning which they have confequently
delivered themſelves very diverſly, and obſcurely, and
ſometimes alſo ſeemingly contradicting themſelves. And
as we find, that ſome of the Faithful Chriſtians, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
after theſe Primitive Fathers, have endeavoured to
reconcile their ſayings to the Truth which they profeſſed;
as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath done in ſome Paſſages of <hi>Dionyſius

in like manner ought we to uſe our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make a handſome interpretation of all ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the Writings of theſe Men, and the like as ſeem to
claſh with the true Orthodox Belief, touching the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,
and the like other Points: and withal not account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it any great wonder, if we ſometimes chance to meet
with Paſſages, which ſeem to be utterly inexplicable. For
it may ſo fall out, that they may be really ſo; ſeeing it is
very poſſible, that in the Points touching the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and
the <hi>Natures</hi> of the Son of God, ſome ſuch expreſſions
may have fallen from them; as is very well known to
thoſe, who are verſed in their Writings. Poſſibly alſo
we may meet with ſome Paſſages of theirs, which though
they may be explicable in themſelves, may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appear to us to be Indiſſoluble; by reaſon perhaps of
our wanting ſome one of thoſe Circumſtances, which are
neceſſarily requiſite for the enlightning, and clearing the
ſame: as for example, when we are ignorant of the ſcope
and drift of the Author, and of the Connexion and
Dependencies of his Diſcourſe, and other the like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which are requiſite for the penetrating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

makes it plainly appear that it is not ſo; and by the
advantage of thoſe through Lights which he had in the
Subject there treated of by the Author, he demonſtrates
unto us, that this expreſſion of <hi>Dionyſtus,</hi> how ſtrange
ſoever it appear, hath notwithſtanding a good, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſenſe in that place. And that we may be able more
fully to apprehend the truth of this our Aſſertion, we ſhall
in the next place take into conſideration ſome other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the obſcurity of the Fathers: among which I ſhall
rank in the firſt place, their having ſometimes purpoſely,
and upon Deſign, endeavoured either wholly to conceal
their Conceptions from us; or at leaſt to lay them down,
not naked, and open, but as it were with a Curtain (and
that ſometimes a very thick one too) drawn over them;
to the end that none but thoſe of the quickeſt, and moſt
piercing eyes ſhould be able to penetrate into them: ſome
of their Meditations having been ſuch, as they themſelves
accounted either leſs uſeful, or elſe perhaps ſuch as it was
not ſo ſafe to commit to weak, vulgar ſpirits. Whether
this practice of theirs were raiſed upon good grounds, or
not, I ſhall not here ſtand to examine: it is ſufficient for
me to ſhew, that it was uſual with them, as may appear,

                  </note> out of <hi>Clement Alexandrinus,</hi>
about the beginning of his <hi>Stromateis,</hi> where
giving an account of the Deſign of his Book,
he ſaith that, <hi>He had paſſed over ſome things in
ſilence; fearing to write that which he made
ſome ſimple even to ſpeak of; not that he envied
his Readers any thing, but fearing rather leſt
they might happily, out of a miſunderſtanding of
them, fall into errour; and ſo he might ſeem to
have put a Sword into the hand of a Child.</hi> He
adds further, <hi>That he had handled ſomethings
clearly, and ſome other obſcurely; laying the one
open to our view, but wrapping up the other in Riddles.</hi> But
that which makes moſt to our preſent purpoſe, is, that
they are known to have taken this courſe particularly in
ſome certain of thoſe Points which are now controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongſt us; as namely, in that touching the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of the Church. For as they celebrated their holy
Myſteries in ſecret, and apart by themſelves, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
either the Pagans,<note place="margin">Caſſand. in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turg. c. 26.</note> or the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> nor yet (as
ſome aſſure us) any perſon whatſoever, ſave only the
Communicants, to the ſight of them; in like manner alſo
in their Writings, eſpecially in thoſe that were to be read
openly to the people in their publick Aſſemblies, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpake but very obſcurely, and darkly, as hath been
obſerved, in Point of the Euchariſt, by Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
and by <hi>Caſaubon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſaub. in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. exercit. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Petavius,</hi> and others, in the Points of
<hi>Baptiſm, Confirmation,</hi> and other holy Ceremonies of the
Chriſtians. Do but obſerve, how wary <hi>Theodoret, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
and other of the Ancient Writers are, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the matter of the Euchariſt, deſcribing it in general
terms only, and ſuch as they only could underſtand, who
had been formerly partakers of that holy Sacrament. I ſhall
not here take upon me to examine the end which they
propoſed to themſelves in ſo doing; which ſeems to have
been, to beget in the minds of the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> a greater
reverence, and eſteem of the Sacraments, and withal a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98310:51"/>
more earneſt and eager deſire to be admitted to partake
of them: fearing, leſt haply the laying open, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
plainly of the Matter and Manner of Celebration
of the Sacraments, might ſomething take off from one
of theſe two Affections in them. Seeing therefore that
not only in this, but in divers other Particulars alſo, they
have purpoſely, and upon deſign, concealed their Senſe
and Opinions from us; we ought not to account it ſo
ſtrange a matter, if we many times find their Expreſſions
to be obſcure, and (which is a conſequence of obſcurity)
if they ſometimes alſo ſeem to claſh, and contradict one
another. And indeed it were more to be wondred at, if
theſe Men, who were for the moſt part able, learned Men,
having a purpoſe of writing obſcurely on theſe Points,
ſhould yet have left us their Opinions clearly and plainly
delivered in their Writings. But there is more in it yet
than ſo; for ſometimes alſo, even where they had no
purpoſe of being ſo, they yet are very obſcure; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again the little Converſation they have had with
thoſe Arts which are requiſite for the poliſhing of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
was the cauſe of their not expreſſing themſelves ſo
clearly: and ſometimes perhaps their <hi>Genius,</hi> and natural
Diſpoſition might be the reaſon hereof; all their Study
and Induſtry they could take, not being able to correct
this natural defect in them. I believe we may very ſafely
reckon <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the firſt Rank of theſe kind of
Writers; who was indeed a good and holy Man, but yet
had been very little converſant in the Arts, either of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,
or Grammar; as appeareth ſufficiently out of his
Writings, where you ſhall often find him failing, not
only in the clearneſs of his Expreſſions, and the courſe
and fit contrivance of his Periods, but alſo even in the
Order and Method, which is the true Light of all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
which Defects muſt neceſſarily be the cauſe of
much obſcurity in very many Places; as indeed is much
complained of by the Interpreters of this Father. Others
perhaps there have been, who have endeavoured to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98310:52"/>
their Language by Arts, who yet have not been able
to compaſs their deſire, whether it were, becauſe they
began too late; or elſe perhaps through the dulneſs of
their Wit, and want of Capacity, as we ſee, all Natures
are not capable of receiving all Forms, what pains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
ſoever they take, for the making ſuch Impreſſions.
In this number you may reckon that <hi>Victorinus,</hi> of whom
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> gives this ſo favourable Teſtimony,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hier. ep.</hi> 84. <hi>ad Magn.</hi> Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Martyri in libris ſuis licet deſit eruditio, tamen non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eruditionis voluntas.</note> ſaying,
That <hi>though indeed he wanted Learning, he wanted not a
deſire and good will to Learning.</hi> Such another alſo was
<hi>Ruffinus,</hi> whoſe Language and Expreſſions the ſame
great <hi>Cenſor</hi> of the Ancients ſo ſharply reproveth, noting
in him very many Improprieties of Speech, and other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities:
<note n="*" place="margin">In Apol 1. in Ruff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Apol. 2. &amp; Apol. ad Ruff.</note> and yet, for all this, he would not be taken off
from his ſcribling humour; and which is more, he did
not want thoſe who admired him too: it being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved, That thoſe who wrote moſt in any Age, were
not always the ableſt Men; this Itch reigning rather in
the ignorant, than in the other. <hi>Photius</hi> in his <hi>Bibliotheca</hi>
hath noted the like defects in ſome of his <hi>Greek</hi> Writers.
But yet this Obſcurity in the Fathers hath proceeded, not
from their Ignorance, but rather from their great Learn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.
For, thoſe among them who were furniſhed with all
manner of Secular Learning, and had been trained up from
their Infancy in the Eloquence and Knowledge of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> could not but retain this Tincture, and ſometimes
alſo had their flyings out, and made ſhew of this their
Treaſury; by this means mixing with the Chriſtian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
many exotick Words, Cuſtoms, and Diſcourſes:
which Mixture, though it give indeed much delight to
the Learned, yet it muſt neceſſarily render the ſenſe of
theſe Authors the more dark and perplexed. What can
you name me more mixed, or fuller of variety, than <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Alexandrinus</hi> his <hi>Stromata,</hi> as he calls them, and
his other Works; which are throughout interlaced with
Hiſtorical Alluſions, Opinions, Sentences, and Proverbs,
out of all ſorts of Writers, both Sacred and Profane; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98310:52"/>
here heightned with rich, lightſom Colours, there
ſhaded with Darkneſs; in ſuch ſort, as that it is a vain
thing for an ignorant Perſon to hope ever to reach his
meaning? What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who, beſides
that natural harſhneſs and roughneſs which you meet with
in him throughout, and that <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Spirit and
<hi>Genius</hi> which is common to him with the reſt of the
<hi>African</hi> Writers, hath yet ſhadowed and overcaſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
with ſo much Learning, and with ſo many new
Terms and Paſſages out of the <hi>Law,</hi> and with ſuch variety
of Alluſions, Subtilties, and nice Points, as that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtock both of Learning and Attention that you can
bring with you, will be all little enough to fit you for a
perfect underſtanding of him. I ſhall not here ſpeak any
thing of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> and the loftineſs of his Fancy, and the
height of his Language, and that <hi>Cothurnus Gallicanus</hi>
which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath noted in him, and ſome other of
his Country-men. Neither ſhall I here take any notice of
the Copiouſneſs of the <hi>Africans,</hi> nor of the ſubtilty of the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> and of thoſe that had their Education among
them; the conſideration of all which Particulars would
afford matter for a juſt Tract. I ſhall only ſay in general,
That whereas the manner of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Writing and
expounding the Scriptures, was at firſt very plain, eaſie, and
brief; it in a very ſhort time came to be changed, and to
be clogg'd with Subtilties, and flouriſhes of Secular Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as <hi>Methodius</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifieth.<note n="*" place="margin">Method. apud Epiph. Haer. 64. <gap reason="foreign">

juſt as Sophiſters are wont to do,
who reckon their Labours rewarded by
their Auditors applauding their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ſelling themſelves at this ſo cheap a
rate. For as for the Ancients, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
were always very brief; their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98310:53"/>
utmoſt ambition in thoſe days being, not to pleaſe, but to
profit their Hearers. Gregory Nazianzen</hi> alſo very ſadly,
and eloquently, as his manner is, complains of this.

                  <hi>There was a time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when our
Affairs flouriſhed, and we were in a

kind of Divinity, which is every
where now in faſhion, together with all
its Artifices and Delicacies of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
was not at all admitted into the

to hearken after, or to vent any Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Curioſities in Divinity, was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
all one as to play the Jugler, and
to ſhew Tricks of Leigerdemain, with

I was then in dread of. So may I never hereafter
fall into the like danger, as this is true! I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, that I found my Shoulders to be all over
black and blue, with the ſtripes I then received,

find, that ſo many Ornaments and Embeliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
do rather diſguiſe and hide from us the bottom
and depth of their Conceptions. Who ſhall aſſure us, that
they have not made uſe of the ſame Arts in their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
touching the Euchariſt, to advance the Dignity of the
Divine Myſteries, and to increaſe the Peoples Devotion?
as likewiſe touching the Power of the Prelates, to procure

What probability is there that they would ſpare their

(for we have no need of any ſuch thing) but

Would not any man, that hears theſe words,
believe theſe three Fathers to have been <hi>Iconoclaſts?</hi> I
confeſs, I cannot ſee, what almoſt could have been ſaid
more expreſly againſt Images: and yet the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Nice</hi> pretendeth,<note place="margin">Concil VII ubi ſupra.</note> * that theſe Fathers here ſpeak
only by way of Compariſon; meaning to ſay no more,
than that the Images of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of the Saints,
are much leſs profitable than the reading their Books, or
the imitation of their Lives, or than Charity toward the
Poor. I know very well, that it is no very eaſie matter,
handſomly to apply this Anſwer to the words of theſe
Fathers: However we may make this uſe of it; that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> hath followed this Rule, it
is an evident Argument to us, that the ſayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
both may, and ought ſometimes to be taken in a
quite different ſenſe from what they ſeem to bear: ſo
that it will clearly follow from hence, that they are very
hard to be underſtood. Conſider then with your ſelf,
whether or no among the ſo many ſeveral Paſſages, as are
brought on the one ſide, and on the other, touching the
preſent Controverſies, there may not be very many of
them, which are to be underſtood, as hath formerly been
ſaid, by way of Compariſon only; that is to ſay, quite
contrary to what they ſeem to ſay. Now as the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
uſed by the Fathers hath rendred their Diſcourſes
made to the People full of obſcurity; in like manner hath
their Logick ſown a thouſand Thorns, and Difficulties,
throughout their Polemical Writings. For many times,
while they are in the heat of their Diſputations, they have
their mind ſo intent upon the preſent ſcope they drive
at, as that having regard to nothing elſe, they let fall ſuch
expreſſions, as look very ſtrangely, if they be conſidered
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98310:56"/>
in reference to ſome other Points of Chriſtian Religion.
Sometimes alſo, whilſt they uſe their utmoſt endeavour

Pope <hi>Julius</hi> his, but had been put upon him by the falſe

theſe Ancient Fathers, as it is with a Pilot of a Ship, who

that if he ſplit not his Veſſel upon it, and ſo be utterly caſt

of the Ancients, which are ſo beſet with Thorns;
and with how much judgment we are to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
what things are Principal, and what but Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
only; betwixt the Cauſe, and the Means; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Exceſs, or Defect in their Expreſſions, and their
True ſenſe, and meaning: and then tell me whether you
think it reaſonable, or not, that two or three words
only, which may perhaps accidentally have fallen from
them in their Diſputations, either againſt the <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and <hi>Marcionites,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> or <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychiſts,</hi>

touching <hi>Free-will,</hi> or the <hi>Properties of the Body of
Chriſt,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> But, before we
cloſe up this matter, we are to take notice, that the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cuſtoms, both Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical eſpecially,
and the variation of Words in their ſignification, do not
a little contribute to this Difficulty of underſtanding the
Writings of the Fathers. Who knoweth not, and indeed
who confeſſeth not, both on the one ſide, and on the
other, that the outward Face of the World, and even of
the Church it ſelf too, is in a manner wholly changed?
I ſpeak not here of the Doctrine; but only of the upper
Garment, as I may call it, and the outward part of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98310:58"/>
Church. Where is the Ancient Diſcipline? What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the rigid and ſevere Rules of thoſe Ancient
Times? Where are thoſe ſo myſterious Ceremonies in
Baptiſm, and in the Adminiſtration of the Euchariſt?
Where are thoſe Cuſtoms then uſed in the Ordination of
the Clergy? All theſe things are now quite forgotten and
buried; the Church by little and little having apparelled
it ſelf in other Colours, and in another different Garb.
The Books then of the Ancients being full of Alluſions to

of; it muſt neceſſarily follow from hence, that it
will be a hard matter for us to gueſs at their meaning in
any ſuch Paſſages. But yet there ariſeth much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
out of the words they uſed; which we have ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
though in a different ſignification. We have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
theſe words, <hi>Pope, Patriarch, Maſs Oblation, Station,
Proceſſion, Mortal Sins, Penance, Confeſſion, Satisfaction,
Merit, Indulgence,</hi> as the Ancients had, and make uſe of an
infinite number of the like Terms; but underſtand them
all in a ſenſe almoſt as far different from theirs, as our Age
is removed from theirs: Juſt in like manner as of old, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Roman Emperours, the names of Offices, and of
things, for a long time continued the ſame that had been
in uſe in the time of the old Republick, but with a ſenſe
clear different from what they had formerly born. Thus
when we light upon any Paſſage in the Ancients, where
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Papa</hi> or <hi>Pope;</hi> we preſently
begin to fancy him with all his <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> about him,
and all the Glory at this day belonging to this Name; not
bating him ſo much as his Guard of <hi>Switzens,</hi> and his
Light-Horſes: whereas they, that are but indifferently
verſed in theſe Books, know, that the name <hi>Papa</hi> or <hi>Pope,</hi>
was given to every Biſhop. So likewiſe when we meet
with the word <hi>exomologeſis</hi> or <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> we preſently fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
a man down upon his knees before his Confeſſor, ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
himſelf before him in private of all the ſins he hath
committed. The word <hi>Maſs</hi> likewiſe makes us prick up
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98310:58"/>
our ears, as if, even from thoſe Ancient Times, the whole
Liturgy, and all the Ceremonies uſed at the Celebration
of the Euchariſt, had been the very ſame that they are at
this day: whereas the Learned of both Parties acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that theſe Names have, ſince that time, loſt very
much of their old, and acquired new ſignifications. But
this, which hath been ſaid, is enough, if not more than
needed, for the clearing this Point, touching the obſcurity
in the Writings of the Fathers: ſo that we ſhall here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
what we propoſed at the beginning; namely, that
it is not ſo eaſie a matter, as people may imagine, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by their Writings, what the ſenſe of the Ancient
Church hath been, touching the Points at this day contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

               <argument>
                  <p>Reaſon VI. That the Fathers oftentimes conceal
their own Private Opinions, and ſpeak thoſe
things which themſelves believed not; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be, when they report the Opinion of
ſome others, without naming the perſons; as
they frequently do in their Commentaries; or
in diſputing againſt an Adverſary, where they
make uſe of whatſoever they can; or elſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have done ſo, in compliance to their
Auditory, as may be obſerved in their Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Writings of the Fathers are, for the moſt part, of
three ſorts; that is, they are either Commentaries
upon the Holy Scriptures; or Homilies delivered before
the People; or elſe they are Polemical Diſcourſes, and
Diſputations with the Hereticks. Now we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſeen, how much their Ornaments of Rhetorick
have darkned, and rendred their ſenſe obſcure, in their
Writings of the firſt and ſecond ſort; and what their
Heats of Diſputation, and Logical Wranglings have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
in thoſe of the later. Let us now ſee, if having
drawn the Expreſſions of the Fathers out of theſe thick
Clouds, and attained to a clear and perfect underſtanding
of the ſenſe of them; we may be able at length to reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that we have diſcovered what their opinions have
been. I confeſs, I could heartily wiſh that it were ſo:
but conſidering what they have themſelves informed us,
concerning the nature, and manner of their Writings; I
am much afraid, that we neither may, nor indeed ought,
to reckon our ſelves in any ſure condition, even then,
when we are upon theſe very Terms. For as concerning
their Commentaries, which we have often occaſion to

conſult, upon ſundry Paſſages of Scripture, touching the
meaning whereof we diſagree among our ſelves; hear

                  <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the uſual manner of
Commentaries, and the Rule that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
go by; to ſet down in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
the, ſeveral Opinions they have
met withal; and to deliver both what
their own, and what the Judgment of
others is upon the Place. And this is the
practice not only of the Interpreters of the
Scriptures, but of the Expoſitors alſo of all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98310:60"/>
kind of Secular Learning, as well in the Greek as in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Tongue.</hi> Now I muſt needs ſay, that this ſeems to be a
very ſtrange way of Commenting. For, what light, or
what certainty can a Reader be able to gather out of ſuch
a Rhapſodie of different Opinions, tumbled together in a
heap, without ſo much as intimating either which is good
or bad, or probable, or neceſſary, or to the purpoſe, or not?
But ſeeing it hath pleaſed S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to follow this courſe,
whatſoever his reaſon be, you ſee plainly, that we are not
to take as his, whatſoever he hath delivered in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.
And ſeeing alſo he ſpeaks in general terms, as
he doth, of the nature and manner of a Commentary, we
are not to doubt, but that the reſt of the Fathers have been
the greateſt part of them of the ſame Judgment, and that
conſequently they took the ſame courſe in thoſe Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which we have of theirs. So that it will hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that notwithſtanding that we ſhould chance to find
in theſe kind of Writings of theirs, an Opinion, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
clearly delivered; yet may we not from thence
preſently conclude, that this was the Authors own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for, perhaps he only delivered it as the Opinion of
ſome other Man. Now if the Fathers had been but careful
to have taken in Water out of wholeſom Fountains only,
filling up their Commentaries with no other Opinions or
Interpretations, ſave only thoſe of Perſons of known Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Faith, and Learning, this Mixture would have proved
the leſs dangerous by much. For, notwithſtanding that
we ſhould often be at a ſtand, and doubt, whether that
which we there find be the true Senſe and Opinion of the
Father whoſe Name it goes under; yet however we might
ſtill reſt aſſured, that though it ſhould not perhaps be his,
yet muſt it certainly be the Opinion of ſome other good
Author, if not of equal, yet of little leſs Authority than
he. But the miſchief of it is, that they took a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
courſe, many times ſtuffing up their Commentaries
with very ſtrange ſenſeleſs Expoſitions, and ſometimes
too with dangerous ones, and ſuch as were taken out of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98310:60"/>
very ſuſpected Authors, and which had no very good
Name neither in the Church.<note place="margin">Hier. Praefat. in Comment in ep. ad. Galat. &amp; Apol 2. adv. Ruff. &amp; ep. 89. ad August. &amp; alibi ſaepe.</note> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us often,

be found to have delivered any thing you here meet with,
you are to take notice, that it belongeth to that Author,
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in this caſe having been onely his Tranſcriber,
or at moſt but his Tranſlator. So that you may be able,
perhaps, by the reading of Books in this manner colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
to judge whether the Fathers have had the skill to
make a handſom and artificial Connexion and Digeſtion
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98310:62"/>
of thoſe things which they took out of ſo many ſeveral
Authors, or not: but whether or no they believed all that
they have ſet down in their Books, you will be no more
able to diſcover, than you can judge what Belief any
Man is of, by the Books he tranſcribeth; or can gueſs
at the Opinions of an Interpreter, by the Books he tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
Whence we may conclude, that teſtimonies brought
out of ſuch Books as theſe, are of little or no force at all,
either for or againſt us. And this ſeemeth to have been
the Opinion of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo, where, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Objection brought out of one of S. <hi>Hierome's</hi> Books,
he makes this Anſwer; <hi>That the Author in that place
ſpeaketh according to the Opinion of others; as he often doth
in his Commentaries upon the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, and
in other places.</hi> The like courſe hath Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have urged againſt the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Authority of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> touching the <hi>Canon
of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament;</hi> confidently anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
That the Notes cited out of that place of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi>
are not his, but <hi>Origen</hi>'s, in his Commentary upon the
Firſt <hi>Pſalm;</hi> part of whoſe Words he had tranſcribed, and
put into his own Prologue upon the <hi>Pſalms:</hi> and yet
S. <hi>Hilary</hi> neither ſo much as nameth <hi>Origen,</hi> nor yet
gives us any intimation at all, whether we are to receive
what is there ſpoken touching the Scriptures, as from <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
or from himſelf. And the ground of this Anſwer of
his is taken from what S. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath teſtified in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places; namely, that S. <hi>Hilary</hi> hath tranſcribed the
greateſt part of his Commentaries out of the ſaid <hi>Origen.</hi>
Now if we but rightly conſider the account which S.
<hi>Hierome</hi> hath given, as we ſhewed before, of all Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
in general, how can we have any aſſurance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that which the Fathers deliver in theſe kind of
Writings, be their own proper Opinion, or only ſome
other Man's tranſcribed? And if we can have no aſſurance
hereof, how can we then account them of any force at
all, either for or againſt us? So that it is moſt evident,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98310:62"/>
that this Method which the Fathers have obſerved in
their Expoſitions of the Scriptures, muſt needs render
the things themſelves very doubtful, how clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſoever they have delivered themſelves. But hath
it not concerned them to be more careful in their <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
or Sermons; and to deliver nothing there, ſave only
what hath been their own proper Opinion, and Belief?
May we not, at leaſt in this particular, reſt aſſured, that
they have ſpoken nothing, but from their very ſoul; and
that their Tongues have vented here their own Opinions
only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not thoſe of other Men? Certainly, in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they ſhould not have uttered any thing in this Sacred
Place, from whence they taught their People, ſave what
they conceived to have been moſt true. And yet, beſides
what we have formerly noted, as to this particular,
namely, that they did not always ſpeak out the whole
truth, but concealed ſomething of it, as not ſo fit for the
ears either of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> or of the weaker ſort of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Perron of the Euchar. l. 1. c. 10. Aut. 24. ch. 15. &amp; paſſim locis infra ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandis.</note> that great and curious Inquirer
into all the Cuſtoms of the Ancients, hath informed us,
that in regard of the aforeſaid Conſiderations, they have
ſometimes gone further yet. For, in expounding the
Scriptures to the People, where the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
if by chance they fell upon any Paſſage where the
Sacraments were ſpoken of, that they might not diſcover
theſe Myſteries, they would then make bold to wreſt the
Text a little, and inſtead of giving them the true and
real Interpretation of the Place, which they themſelves
knew to be ſuch, they would only preſent their Auditory
with an Allegorical and Symbolical, and (as this Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ſaith) an Accidental and Collateral one, only to
give them ſome kind of ſmall ſatisfaction; foraſmuch
as, if in ſuch caſes they ſhould have been utterly filent,
it would queſtionleſs have much amazed their Auditors,
and in ſome ſort alſo have ſcandalized, and given them
offence. To ſatisfie therefore their expectation, and yet
to keep theſe Myſteries ſtill concealed from them, they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98310:63"/>
waved the buſineſs handſomly, laying before them that
which they accounted not the beſt and trueſt, but the
fitteſt for their purpoſe and deſign. Thus do we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pleaſe little Children with an Apple, or ſome little
Toy, to take them off the deſire they have to ſomething
of greater value. Thoſe therefore who take all that the
Fathers deliver in the like places for good and ſolid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
and ſuch as they themſelves really believed, do
very much deceive themſelves; and believing they have
a ſolid Body in their Arms, embrace only an empty Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Now we ſhould hardly believe thoſe Holy Men to
have been guilty of any ſuch jugling dealing as this, had
we not the word of this ſo great a Cardinal for our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
upon whoſe Authority we have, for this once, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
to propoſe it to the Readers conſideration, and
ſhall withal produce ſome few Examples, taken out of the
ſame Author. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being to expound the ſixth
Chapter of the Goſpel of S. <hi>John,</hi> where, as he conceives,
our Saviour Chriſt is very copious in his Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Euchariſt; he preſently falls to overſhadow
and diſguiſe the Myſtery, with ſuch a number of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Riddles, and Ambiguities, as that, if you dare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Cardinal, throughout the whole XXVI Tract
there is not one Period but hath in it ſome Eluſion, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
or Diminution of the true and ſolid Definition of
this Article. Thus doth he interpret the Bread which
came down from Heaven, to be the Gift of the Holy
Ghoſt:<note place="margin">Perron. Tract. de S. Auguſt. c. 12. &amp; lib 2. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ch. Aut. 22. c. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Saviour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>purpoſing to ſend down the
H. Ghoſt, ſaith, That It is the Bread which deſcended from
Heaven.</hi> You may, if you pleaſe, believe, upon the faith
of this Father, that this is the true ſenſe and meaning of
the Place: But yet the Cardinal makes it appear, out of
<hi>Calvin,</hi> that it cannot be ſo. He likewiſe contradicteth
after the ſame manner, that which the ſame Father ſaith
a little after; to wit, That the purpoſe of our Saviour
was, to let us underſtand that this <hi>Meat and Drink,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he ſpeaks in S. <hi>John,</hi> is the Communion and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98310:63"/>
that is betwixt his Body, and his Members, who are
the Holy Church, in his faithful Servants, Predeſtinated,
Called, Juſtified, and Glorified. Had not the Cardinal
given us this information, who would ever have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that this Author (who was ſo Conſcientious, as
that he made it a great quarrel againſt S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> only
for having laid Diſſimulation to <hi>St. Pauls</hi> charge,) ſhould
here himſelf ſay, that our Saviour Chriſt would have us to
underſtand His Words thus, unleſs he himſelf really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
this to be the true ſenſe and meaning of them?
The Cardinal applies alſo this very conſideration, to the
greateſt part of thoſe other Paſſages, cited out of this
Father, by the Proteſtants; as namely to this: <hi>to believe
in Chriſt, is, to eat the Bread of Life:</hi> and to this other,
<hi>He that believeth in him, eateth of it; and he is inviſibly fed
by it, becauſe that he is alſo inviſibly born again:</hi> and this
other: <hi>Whoſoever eateth of this Bread, he ſhall never die:
but this is to be underſtood of him that eateth of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the vertue of the Sacrament, and not according to the
viſible Sacrament; of him that eateth of it Internally, and
not Externally; of him that eateth of it with his heart, and
not of him that cheweth it with his teeth.</hi> In all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the Cardinal pretendeth, that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſuppreſſeth
the true, full, and ſolid Definition of this Manducation,
or eating of the Fleſh, and drinking the Blood of Chriſt;
and inſtead thereof, preſenteth this Allegorical, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
Meditation to the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> only to caſt a
miſt, as it were, before their Eyes, and to elude their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.

indeed we may very well ſay, that this is his main Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
out of which he produceth the greateſt part of
thoſe ſubtile, and ſo admired Solutions that he giveth to
the Paſſages objected againſt them out of the Fathers.
Thoſe that have a mind to examine theſe places of his,
may happily find ſomething to return upon him, in ſome
of thoſe Applications which he hath there made. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for our preſent purpoſe, that he grants us, that the
Fathers in their Sermons and Diſcourſes made to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have oftentimes made uſe of this piece of Art, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
clearly from hence, that we cannot then poſſibly
have any aſſurance, that they themſelves accounted, as
ſolid and full, ſuch Expoſitions, and Opinions, as they
have delivered in theſe Writings of theirs. For, as the
Cardinal endeavoureth by this means to weaken the force
of thoſe Paſſages of S. <hi>Auguſtine, Gregory Nazianzen,
Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus;</hi> may not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,

ſeem to make ſtrongly againſt their opinions, be allowed
to have the ſame Liberty, and to anſwer; that theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſpeaking before the people, made uſe of this <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi>
ſpeaking that which they thought to be, not the
Beſt, and Trueſt, but the moſt proper for the edification
of others? and that they had an apprehenſion, that a

have taken off the Heat of the peoples Devotion?
there being apparently (ſay they) more cauſe to doubt,
that the people might di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than to fear leſt they ſhould adore it: as indeed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are much more careful in concealing the matter of
the Sacrament, the outward appearance whereof is apt
to make it di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in expreſs terms, that it is the <hi>Body of Chriſt;</hi> but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

               </p>
               <p>We come now to the third ſort of the Writings of the
Ancients, wherein the Fathers diſpute againſt the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
of their faith; namely, the <hi>Pagans, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
We have formerly touched how much obſcurity
the earneſtneſs and heat of ſpirit have cauſed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of the Fathers; and this defect proceedeth from
the weakneſs of their Paſſion only; and not from any
deſign or purpoſe that they had of ſpeaking thus, rather
than otherwiſe. For, ſeeing that all manner of paſſions do
diſturb, and in ſome ſmall meaſure, as it were, confound
the Judgment; and ſeeing it is hard for a Man, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſoever he be, to go through with a Diſputation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome alteration in his Temper, eſpecially if it be of
any Importance, as all thoſe touching Religion are: we
are not to wonder at it, if in theſe Caſes we ſometimes
find the language of the Fathers ſomething mixed, and
appearing of ſeveral colours, ſuch as Paſſion uſually dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
both the Countenance and the Words withal of ſuch
perſons, as it hath ſeiſed on. But beſides this Confuſion,
which is cauſed meerly by the Agitation of the ſpirits,
without the Fathers ſo much as thinking of it; we are
here further to take notice, that the proper deſign, and
the Law of the Method that is obſerved in diſputations,
is the cauſe of our incountring with ſo many, and ſo great
Difficulties. For their opinion was, that in this kind of
Writing it was lawful for them to ſay, and make uſe of
any thing, that might advance their Cauſe, although it
were otherwiſe but Light and Trivial, or perhaps alſo
contrary to what themſelves believed; and ſo, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, to conceal and reject whatſoever might preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
their Cauſe, though otherwiſe True, and allowable.
Now that this Obſervation may not ſeem ſtrange, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
as coming out of my mouth; let us hear what
they themſelves ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this particular. And firſt let us

more, touching the Style, Method, Natural Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,

he wrote, not ſimply, and plainly, as giving us an account

ſome other thing, lying wide of his own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either this way, or that way; being concerned ſo
to do out of ſome certain particular conſiderations. And
as we ſometimes ſee, that the Water aſcendeth; being
forced to mount up, to fill ſome ſpace, which otherwiſe
would remain void: (Now you will not, I hope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

In like manner was it with the Fathers; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

up ſome other contrary one, according to the Neceſſity of

otherwiſe, how could any one poſſibly have believed, that
they could have ſpoken ſo diverſly as they have done in

out of the reſt of the Diſcourſe: and not preſently to accuſe

                     </gap>, two contrary Opinions:</hi> I confeſs that this
is very true; but yet it doth not remove the Difficulty.
For how intelligent and diſcerning a Man ſoever the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be, it will very often be impoſſible for him, to make
a right judgment in this particular: as for example,
when thoſe other things are wanting which S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
would have a Man to make the meaſure of his judgment:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98310:67"/>
or, when one bringeth us no more of an Author, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a bare Sentence; the Chapter, and Book where theſe
words are, which have need to be explained, being quite
out of his memory. And how many ſuch are alledged
every day, in our Diſputations? What can we now do,
or which way ſhall we turn our ſelves, if meeting with a
Paſſage out of any of the Fathers, that needeth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
we can find no other place in him concerning
the ſame Point; or if there be none found, but what is as
doubtful as the other; or that is not in ſome other Book
controverted it ſelf? Who ſhall regulate us, amidſt ſuch
Contradictions as theſe? But, which is yet worſe, thoſe
things which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> preſcribeth us for a Rule, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to our judgment, are now in theſe days of ours
very unſeaſonable, as being harſh, as to the one ſide, and
pleaſing to the other; according to mens ſeveral affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and intereſt; according to which they are wont to
interpret, and judge of the Fathers; whereas we ſhould
rather ſearch in them, which way we are to direct our
judgments. And that favourableneſs which S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
requireth in us, cannot be here of any uſe at all; but may
poſſibly beſides do very much hurt. For the greater the
affection is that we bear to any Father; the greater care
and pains will we take in vindicating his words, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
them in a ſenſe as far different as we can from
what we have long ſince condemned, as Erroneous and
Unſound; though poſſibly this may have been his real
ſenſe, and opinion. As for example, in thoſe Paſſages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-cited,
out of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> the
Proteſtant accounteth that a very harſh piece of Doctrine,
which yet his Adverſary is very well pleaſed with: the
one of them ſweats, and torments himſelf much, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of ſuch a Paſſage, as appears very eaſie to the
other; the one takes that for Text, which the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
but as a Gloſs. And thus the greater affection men
bear to the name, and authority of any one of the Fathers,
the more do they labour and uſe their utmoſt endeavours,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98310:67"/>
to bring him over to ſpeak to their Opinion; that is to
ſay, in plain truth, to force him out of his own; it being
impoſſible that we ſhould hold both Opinions at once.
We ſhall here therefore conclude, That how clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
ſo ever the Words of the Fathers may be, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
will it very often ſo fall out, as that we cannot
have any aſſurance that we have their Senſe expreſſed in
them; whether it be in their Expoſitions of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
or in their Homilies and Sermons before the People,
or laſtly, in their Diſputations with their Adverſaries,
touching their Faith.</p>

S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath left us a remarkable Teſtimony, that the
Fathers profited by Age and Study in the Knowledge of
the Truth, when as in his old age, taking Pen in hand, he
reviewed and corrected all that he had ever written du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his whole Life; faithfully and ingenuouſly noting
whatſoever he thought worthy of reprehenſion, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us all thoſe his Animadverſions collected together in
the Books of his <hi>Retractations;</hi> which, in my judgment,
is the moſt glorious and moſt excellent of all thoſe many
Monuments which he hath left to Poſterity; whether you

Neither is there any doubt, but that ſome ſuch like thing
may have hapned to moſt of the other Fathers; and that
they may have ſometime diſallowed of that which they
had formerly believed, as true. Now from this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
there falls in our way a new Difficulty, which we
are to grapple with, in this our Inquiry into the true, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſenſe of the Fathers, touching our preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.
For, ſeeing that the Condition and Nature of their
Writings is ſuch, it is moſt evident, that when we would
make uſe of any of their Opinions, it will concern us to
be very well aſſured, that they have not only ſometime
either held or written the ſame; but that they have more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
perſevered in them to the end.<note place="margin">Vincent. Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſ. lib. adv. prof. Novit. ſeu Common.</note> Whence <hi>Vincentius

be bound to receive whatſoever they have ſaid, for certain
and undoubted Truth, unleſs they have aſſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
it unto us by their Perſeverance in the ſame, as he
there ſpeaketh. Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> alſo evidently ſheweth us
the ſame way, by his own practice: for, diſputing about
the Canon of the Holy Scriptures (which he pretendeth
to have been always the very ſame in the Weſtern Church,
with that which is delivered unto us by the III Council
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the <hi>Maccabees</hi> are recko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in among
the reſt;) and finding himſelf hardly preſſed by ſome
certain Paſſages alledged by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
to the contrary, he anſwereth the Objection, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
among other things,<note place="margin">Perron's <hi>Repl. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 50.</note> That this Father, when he wrote
the ſaid Paſſages, was not yet come to the ripeneſs of his
Judgment, and perfection of his Studies; whereas after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when he was now more fully inſtructed in the truth
of the Senſe of the Church, he changed his Opinion, and
retracted (as this Cardinal ſaith) both in general, and in
particular, whatſoever he had before written in thoſe three
Prologues, where he had excluded the <hi>Maccabees</hi> out of
the Canon.<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> And ſo likewiſe, to another Objection brought
to the ſame purpoſe, out of the Commentaries of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
the Great,</hi> he gives the like anſwer, ſaying, That S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
when he wrote that Piece, was not yet come to be
<hi>Pope,</hi> but was a plain <hi>Deacon</hi> only, being at that time em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
Now theſe Anſwers of his are either inſufficient; or elſe,
it will neceſſarily follow from hence, That we ought not
to reſt certainly ſatisfied in the Teſtimony of any Father,
except we firſt be aſſured, that not only he never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
retracted that Opinion of his; but that, beſides, he
wrote it in the ſtrength and ripeneſs of his Judgment.
And ſee now how we are fallen into a new Labyrinth:
For, firſt of all, from whence, and by what means may we
be able to come truly and certainly to the knowledge
of this Secret; when as we can hardly meet with any
light Conjectures, tending to the making of this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98310:69"/>
namely, Whether a Father hath in his old age
changed his Opinion, touching that Point for which it is
produced againſt us, or not? If they had all of them been
either able, or willing to have imitated the Modeſty of
S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> we ſhould then have had little left to
trouble us. But you will hardly find any, either of the
Ancients, or of thoſe of Later times, that have followed
this example; unleſs it be Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who hath
lately thought good to revive this Piece of Modeſty,
which had lain dead and buried for the ſpace of ſo many
Ages together, by writing a Book of <hi>Retractations:</hi>
which Book of his is very diverſly received by the
Learned, as well of the one, as of the other Religion.
But yet, if you will ſtand ſtiff upon it, with Cardinal
<hi>Perron,</hi> and not allow the ſaying of a Father to be of any
value, unleſs it were written by him after the Ripeneſs
of his Studies; I ſhall then deſpair of our ever making
any Progreſs, ſo much as one ſtep forward, by this means,
in the buſineſs in hand. For, (will the one and the other
Party ſay, upon every Teſtimony that ſhall be produced
againſt them) how do we know whether this Father
had yet arrived to the Ripeneſs of his Judgment, when
he wrote this Book, or not? Who can tell whether or no
thoſe days of his Life that he enjoyed after the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hereof, might not have beſtowed as well clearneſs
on his Underſtanding, as Whiteneſs on his Head; and
have changed his Judgment, as well as his Hair? We
ſuppoſe here, that no ſuch thing appeareth in any of his
other Writings. How many Authors are there who
have changed their Opinions, and yet have not retracted
what they had formerly written? But ſuppoſe now, that
we ſhould have loſt that particular Tract wherein the
Author had given Teſtimony of the changing of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
what ſhould we do in this cafe? If Time ſhould
have deprived us of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s <hi>Retractations,</hi> and
ſome other of his later Writings, as it hath of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of other Pieces, both of his, and other of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98310:69"/>
the Fathers, which would have been of as great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to us, we muſt certainly have thought, that he had
believed, that the Cauſe of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
or Foreſeeing of the Faith of Men, reading but
what he ſaith in one of the Books which he firſt wrote,
namely,<note n="a" place="margin">

Now would the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians</hi> have

and his other Books which were written after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in his later time, clearly make it appear, that this
Argument is of no force at all; foraſmuch as this Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Father, having afterwards better conſidered of this
Point, wholly altered his Opinion:<note n="b" place="margin">

not</hi> Grace, <hi>if any</hi> Merits <hi>preceded it; ſo that that
which is given, ſhould be rendred rather as due to the
Merits, than as given freely by Grace.</hi> Now who
knoweth, but that among thoſe Fathers whom we ſo
confidently alledge every day, ſome of them may have
retracted thoſe things which we at this day read in
their Works; and that Time may have devoured their
Retractations of thoſe their Opinions, and may have
left us only their Errors? Beſides, who knows, and
can truly inform us, what Date their Writings bear?
Whether they were the Fruits of their Spring, or
of their Summer, or of their Autumn? Whether they
were gathered green, or were ſuffered to ripen upon the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98310:70"/>
Tree? Doubtleſs this whole Inquiry is very dark; there
being ſcarcely any mark of their Seaſon to be found upon
the greateſt part of them. There are indeed ſome few of
them, that have ſome of theſe Marks; but yet they are ſo
doubtful and uncertain ones, as that the moſt able and
choiceſt Wits are ſometimes deceived in this their Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And when all is done, who knoweth not, that there
are ſome Trees that bear their Summer-fruit even in the
very beginning of the Summer, when as the Spring-time
is yet hardly paſt? And again, the Fruits which are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the end of the Later Seaſon, are not always the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt:
for Time, in ſtead of ripening, many times rotteth
them. In like manner is it alſo with Men, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Fathers. Sometimes their Summer yieldeth
much more, and better Fruit than their Autumn. For, as
for the Winter, that is to ſay, the laſt part of our Age, it
is evident that it uſually brings forth nothing at all, or
if it do chance to force it ſelf beyond Nature, the Fruits it
bringeth forth are yet worſe, and more crude and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
than thoſe even of the Spring. Seeing therefore it is
for the moſt part impoſſible to give any certain judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of theſe things, either by the Hiſtory of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
or by their Books themſelves; and that again on
the other ſide, without this we ought not to ſit down
upon any thing we find in their Writings, as reckoning
we have made a diſcovery what their Opinions have
been: we may ſafely conclude in this Point alſo, as we
have done in the former, That it is a very hard matter to
know truly and preciſely what the Opinions and Senſe
of the Ancients have been, touching the Differences at
this day debated amongſt us.</p>

in the Firſt Book of his <hi>Demonſtrations.</hi> And hence it
comes to paſs, that the Knowledge or Ignorance of
theſe Degrees is the more or leſs important, in thoſe
Sciences whereunto they appertain; there being ſome
of them, as namely, thoſe which they call <hi>Principles,</hi>
that are ſo Neceſſary, as that a Man cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, without overthrowing the whole Science
wherein they ought to have place: and there being
others again, on the contrary ſide, that a Man may be
ignorant of, ſo far, as to hold their <hi>Contradictories</hi> for
true, and yet nevertheleſs not run any great hazard.
As for example, Theſe here following are Philoſophical
<hi>Principles</hi> of the firſt ſort; namely, <hi>That there is Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and, <hi>That every Body occupieth ſome certain Place,</hi>
and the like. For, I beſeech you, what ſtrange Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
would it be, that ſhould either be ignorant of, or
ſhould deny theſe <hi>Principles?</hi> But theſe other following
are of the ſecond ſort; namely, <hi>That there are preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but Five Senſes in Living Creatures;</hi> and, <hi>That the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98310:71"/>
Heavens are not of an Elementary Subſtance,</hi> and the like.
For, although theſe Propoſitions are by moſt held to
be True, yet notwithſtanding are they not ſo <hi>Neceſſary,</hi>
but that a Man may paſs for a Philoſopher, and yet not
only be ignorant of theſe Poſitions; but may alſo, if he
pleaſe, maintain even thoſe things that are contradictory
to them. Now if there be any Science where this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
ought carefully to be applied, it is, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in this of <hi>Divinity.</hi> For, there is very much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt the Truths whereof it conſiſteth; ſome
of them being evidently more <hi>Neceſſary</hi> than others, as
<hi>Origen</hi> proveth plainly, in his XXVII Homily upon S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
Do but compare theſe two Propoſitions together;
<hi>Chriſt is God;</hi> and, <hi>Chriſt ſuffered death, being of the age
of thirty four or thirty five years:</hi> who ſeeth not, that
though both theſe Propoſitions are true, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is a very vaſt difference betwixt them. For,
the former of theſe is Neceſſarily True, that is to ſay, it
is True in ſuch ſort, as that it is Impoſſible but that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſhould be God; the Salvation of Mankind, which is the
End of our Religion, being otherwiſe not poſſibly to be
obtained: But as for the ſecond, notwithſtanding that
it is true, and is collected clearly enough out of the
Scriptures, yet is it not at all <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> For, <hi>Chriſt</hi>
might, if he had ſo pleaſed, have ſuffered at the Fortieth
or Fiftieth year of his age, without any prejudice at all
to our Salvation, which was the End of His Suffering.
Now according to this diverſity of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>grees, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
or Ignorance of theſe two Propoſitions are alſo of
very different importance. The firſt of them we may
not be ignorant of, and much leſs deny, without renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The ſecond we may be ignorant of,
and even deny too, as ſuppoſing it falſe, yet without any
great danger. To be able therefore to come to a clear
and perfect underſtanding, what was the Senſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
touching the Points of Religion at this day contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
amongſt Us, it is neceſſary that we ſhould know,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98310:71"/>
not only whether they believed, or not believed them;
but alſo, how they believed, or not believed them: that
is to ſay, whether they held them as Propoſitions Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily,
or Probably, either True, or Falſe; and beſides, in
what Degree either of Neceſſity, or Probability they
placed them. Now that this Inquiry is very Neceſſary,
Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> hath clearly demonſtrated in that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Epiſtle of his, written to <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> againſt K. <hi>James.</hi>
For, the King attributing to himſelf the name of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
under pretence that He believed, and held all thoſe
things, that the Fathers of the four or five firſt Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
did; the Cardinal denies his Sequel; replying, among
other things, that to be of the Communion of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
a Man ought not only to believe what they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but alſo to believe it in the ſame manner, and in the
ſame Degree, that they did: that is to ſay, to believe as
<hi>Neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, what they believed as <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to
Salvation; and to believe as <hi>profitable</hi> to Salvation, what
they held for ſuch; and for <hi>lawful,</hi> and not repugnant to
Salvation, what they held for <hi>lawful,</hi> and not repugnant to
Salvation. And thus he goes on, and gives us a long and
exact Diviſion of the different Degrees of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi>
which may, and ought to be conſidered, in all Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
touching Religion. I could heartily wiſh that this
Occaſion had carried on this Learned Prelate ſo far, as to
have made an Exact Application of this Doctrine, and to
have truly enformed us, of what the greateſt part of the
World is at this day Ignorant; namely, in what Degree
each Point of the Chriſtian Faith is held, either by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or by the Ancient Fathers; &amp; what things
are abſolutely <hi>Neceſſary</hi> in Religion; and what are thoſe
other things, that are <hi>neceſſary</hi> under ſome certain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
only: which again are <hi>neceſſary</hi> by the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the
<hi>Means;</hi> and which, by the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>Precept;</hi> (as he
there ſpeaks:) that is to ſay, which are thoſe things, that
we ought to obſerve, either by reaſon of their Profit, as
being <hi>Means</hi> which are profitable to Salvation: and which
we are to obſerve, by reaſon of the <hi>Commandment</hi> only,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98310:72"/>
being enjoined us by ſuch an Authority, as we owe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to: and after all theſe Points, Which again All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and every of the Faithful are bound to believe <hi>Expreſly;</hi>
and, which are thoſe, that it is ſufficient to believe in groſs

thoſe things that we ought actually to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, which
are thoſe, that it is ſufficient if we approve of them only,
though we do them not. So that it appeareth clearly out
of theſe Words of his, that to be able to know, what
the Belief of the Fathers hath been, eſpecially in the Points
now in debate, we ought firſt to be aſſured, in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
they believed the ſame. And that this diſtinction
was of very great Conſideration with the antient Church,
it appears ſufficiently out of the ſpecial regard which it
always had unto it; opening to, or ſhutting the door
againſt men, firſt of all, according to the things which
they believed, or not believed: Secondly, according to
the different manners, how they believed, or not believed
them. For it Excommunicated thoſe who rejected thoſe
things that it held as <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> and ſo likewiſe, thoſe,
who preſſed as things <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> ſuch as it held for things
<hi>probable</hi> only. But it received, with all the ſweetneſs
that might be, all thoſe who either were Ignorant of, or
doubted of, or indeed denied thoſe things which it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
though <hi>True,</hi> yet not <hi>Neceſſarily</hi> ſo. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth

which makes me wonder the more, is, that they ſuffer
ſuch Contradictory opinions as theſe to be held amongſt
them, in ſuch particulars, as conſidered barely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſeem yet to be of very great Importance. As for
Example, a Man may either believe that we oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to

yield to the Croſs the Adoration of <hi>Latria;</hi> or, if he
pleaſe, he may believe the contrary; without loſing,
either by reaſon of the one, or the other, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church, and Salvation. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
if you but conſider the thing in it ſelf, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be a matter of no ſuch Indifferency as people take
it for. For, if the Former of theſe Opinions be indeed
True; then muſt thoſe that are of the other Opinion,
needs ſin very grievouſly, in not worſhipping a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that is ſo worthy of Adoration. But if it be Falſe,
then are thoſe Men that maintain the ſame, guilty of a
much greater ſin, by committing ſo horrible Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
What Point is there in Religion, that ſeemeth
to be of greater Importance than that, touching the
Foundation, and Head of all Eccleſiaſtical Power, upon
the Authority whereof the whole Faith, and State
of the Church turneth? And yet, touching this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
alſo, which is of ſo great conſequence, do they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Men to maintain Contradictory Opinions; ſome attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
this Dignity to the <hi>Pope;</hi> and others, to a <hi>General
Council.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ferron. Repl. l. 4. in Praefat.</note> Now if the opinion of the Firſt of theſe be true,
then is the Faith of the Later built upon a very Erroneous
Ground: but if the opinion of the Later be true, than
doth the Faith of the Former depend upon a Cauſe, which
is not Infallible; and conſequently is Null. Now theſe
Different opinions are reconciled, by ſaying, that the
Church accounting neither of theſe Beliefs as <hi>neceſſary</hi>
to Faith; a Man is not preſently an Heretick, for
holding the Falſe opinion of the two; nor yet is he
to be counted Orthodox, meerly for holding the True
one. Seeing therefore that this Particular concerns the
Communion of the Church, and our Salvation alſo,
which dependeth thereon; it will behove us to know
certainly, in what Degree the Ancients placed thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
which are at this day ſo eagerly preſſed upon the
Proteſtants; and whether they held them in the ſame, or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98310:73"/>
in a Higher, or elſe in a Lower Degree of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> than
they are now maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For,
unleſs this be made very clear, the Proteſtants, though
they ſhould confeſs, (which yet they do not,) that the
Fathers did indeed really believe the ſame; might yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for themſelves, that notwithſtanding all this, they
are not bound to believe the ſame; for as much as all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in Religion are not preſently Obligatory, and ſuch
as all Men are bound to believe; ſeeing that there are ſome
that are indeed <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but ſome others that are not ſo.
They will anſwer likewiſe, that theſe opinions are like to
thoſe at this day controverted, betwixt the <hi>Dominicans,</hi>
and the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> or to thoſe other Points, debated
betwixt the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> and the <hi>Regulars:</hi> wherein every
one is permitted to hold what he pleaſeth. They will

the opinions of the Fathers; where having thundred out
an <hi>Anathema,</hi> againſt all thoſe that ſhould maintain, that
the Adminiſtring of the Euchariſt was neceſſary for little
Infants, they further declare, that this Thunderbolt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to thoſe Antient Fathers, who gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to little Infants; for as much as they maintained,
and practiſed this, being moved thereunto upon <hi>Probable</hi>
Reaſons only, and not accounting it <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation.
Seeing therefore that ſome Errors, which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by Councils, may be maintained in ſuch a certain
Degree, without incurring thereby the danger of their
Thunderbolts: by the ſame reaſon a Man may be ignorant
of, and even deny ſome Truths alſo, without running the
hazard of being Anathematized. Who can aſſure us, (may
the Proteſtants further add) that the Articles which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
are not of this kind? and ſuch, as that though perhaps
they may be true, it is nevertheleſs lawful for us not to
believe. My opinion therefore is, that there is no Man now
that ſeeth not, that it concerns the Doctors of the <hi>Roman
Church,</hi> if they mean to convince their Adverſaries out
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98310:74"/>
of the Fathers firſt to make it appear unto them, that the
Antients held the ſaid Points, not only as True, but as
<hi>Neceſſary</hi> alſo, and in the very ſame <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Neceſſity</hi>
that they now hold them. Now this muſt needs prove a
buſineſs of moſt extream Difficulty, and much greater
here, than in any of the other particulars before propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And I ſhall alledge no other Argument for the proof
of this, than that very <hi>Decree</hi> we cited before, where the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath declared, that the Fathers did not
Adminiſter the Communion to Infants, <hi>out

<hi>Probable,</hi> that which they evidently appear to have held
as <hi>Neceſſary:</hi> If Pope <hi>Pius</hi> VI. with his whole Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
conſiſting of ſo many Eminent, and Wiſe Men, hath
approved and confirmed this Miſtake of theirs, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it at all: what can we, or indeed what ought we
to expect from any other hands, whoſe ſoever they be, as
touching the Points now controverted betwixt us; in
compariſon of which, a Man may very well ſay, that all
the Difficulty, that this Matter now ſpoken of yieldeth,
is nothing at all, wherein notwithſtanding this whole

tell us very ſeldom, in what Degree either of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> or

they do tell us, their Expreſſions being ſuch, as we have
obſerved of them, we ought not preſently to conclude any

the Obſervation of a certain part of a Poſitive Law, and

divers Reaſons of the obſcurity of the Fathers, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
that of their Rhetorick, all which have place in
this Particular, rather than in any other. So that there
ſeemeth to be but one onely Certain way left us to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in what degree they placed the Propoſitions of
Chriſtian Doctrine; namely, their <hi>Creeds,</hi> and Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98310:76"/>
of their Faith, whether they were General or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ones; and the Determinations of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils

believe, that they held as neceſſary all ſuch Points, as
they made profeſſion of in ſuch a manner, Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
all ſuch as ſhould deny the ſame. And by this
Rule we may indeed aſſure our ſelves, that they held, as
<hi>Neceſſary,</hi> the greateſt part of all thoſe Points wherein
we at this day agree among our ſelves. And ſome of
theſe we have formerly ſet down in our Preface; for
they are moſt of them either delivered expreſly in their
<hi>Creeds,</hi> or elſe poſitively determined in their Councils;
and the Contradictors of them, there expreſly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But yet this Rule will ſcarcely be of any uſe at all
to us, in the Decilion of our preſent Controverſies: For,
ſome of them appear not at all, neither in that <hi>Rule of

controverted among us, namely, that touching Images;
which was diverſly and contrarily determined in the

ſearch more narrowly into the Buſineſs, will be apt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to conclude from this their ſilence, that theſe Points
were not at that time any part of the Belief of the
Church: and certainly this their way of Argumentation
ſeems not to want Reaſon. But as for my own particular,
it is ſufficient for me, that it confirmeth the Truth of my
Aſſertion, which is, That it is, if not an impoſſible, yet
at leaſt a very hard thing, to diſcover in what degree ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>Probability,</hi> the Ancient Fathers held
each of thoſe Points which are now debated amongſt
us; ſeeing that they appear not at all, neither in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of their Faith, nor yet in the Determinations of
their Councils; which are as it were the Catalogues of
thoſe Points which they accounted <hi>Neceſſary.</hi>

the Opinion, not of one, or more of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

               </argument>
               <p>THoſe who make moſt account of the Writings of
the Fathers, and who urge them the oftneſt in their
Diſputations, do inform us, That the weight of their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in theſe Matters proceeds from hence, that they are
as ſo many Teſtimonies of the General Senſe and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church; to which alone theſe men attribute
the Supreme Power of Judging in Controverſies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For, if we ſhould conſider them ſeverally, each by
himſelf, and as they ſtand by their own ſtrength onely,
they confeſs, that they may chance to erre. So that it will
follow hence, That to the end we may make uſe of the
Teſtimonies of the Fathers, it is not ſufficient for us to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98310:77"/>
know whether ſuch or ſuch Sayings be truly theirs; and,
if ſo, what the meaning of them is: but we ought further
alſo to be very well aſſured, that they are conformable to
the Belief of the Church in their time: in like manner as
in a Court of Judicature, the Opinion of any ſingle Perſon
of the Bench is of no weight at all, as to the paſſing of
Judgment, unleſs it be conformable to the Opinion of all
the reſt, or at leaſt of the Major Part of the Company.
And now ſee how we are fallen again into new Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
For, whence, and by what means may we learn,
whether the whole Church, in the time of <hi>Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi>
or of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> maintained the
ſame Opinions in every particular, that theſe Men ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did, or not? I confeſs, that the Charity of theſe Men
was very great; and that they very heartily and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced the Body and Subſtance of the Belief of the
Church, in all Particulars that they ſaw apparently to be
ſuch. But, where the Church did not at all deliver it ſelf,
and expreſly declare what its Senſe was; they could not
poſſibly, how great ſoever their deſire of ſo doing might
have been, follow its Authority, as the Rule of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
Whereſoever therefore they treat of Points which
were long ſince decided, believed, and received, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and poſitively, by the whole Chriſtian Church, either
of their own Age, or of any of the preceding Ages; it is
very probable that they did conform to what was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Church; ſo that, in theſe Caſes, their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may very well paſs for a Teſtimony of the Judgment
and Senſe of the Church; it being very improbable,
that they could be either ignorant what was the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Doctrine of the Church; or that knowing the
ſame, they would not follow it. As for example, when
<hi>Athanaſius,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others,
diſcourſe touching the Son of God, they ſpeak nothing
but what is conformable to the Belief of the Church
in General; becauſe that the Belief of the Church had
then been clearly and expreſly delivered upon this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98310:78"/>
Point: ſo that whatſoever they ſay, as to this Particular,
may ſafely be received, as a Teſtimony of the Churches
Belief. And the like may be done in all the other Points,
which have either been poſitively determined in any of
the General Councils, or delivered in any of the <hi>Creeds,</hi>
or that any other way appeareth to have been the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Belief of the Church. If the Fathers had but contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves within theſe Bounds, and had not taken
liberty to treat of any thing, ſave what the Church had
clearly delivered its Judgment upon; this Rule might
then have been received as a General one; and, what opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſoever we found in them, we might ſafely have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it to have been the Senſe of the Church that was
in their time. But the curioſity of Mans Nature, together
with the Impudence of the Hereticks, and the Tenderneſs
of Conſcience, whether of their own or of others, and
divers other Reaſons perhaps, having partly made them
willingly, and partly forced, and as it were conſtrained
them to go on further, and to proceed to the ſearch of the
Truth of ſeveral Points, which had not as yet been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by the univerſal and publick Conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
it could not be avoided, but that neceſſarily they
muſt in theſe Inquiries make uſe of their own proper
Light, and muſt deliver upon the ſame their own private
Opinions; which the Church, which came after them,
hath ſince either embraced, or rejected. I ſhall not here
ſtand to prove this my Aſſertion, ſince it is a thing that
is confeſſed on all hands, and whereof the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
make ſpecial uſe upon all occaſions, in anſwering ſeveral
Objections brought againſt them out of the Fathers. As,
for example,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pont. l 4. c. 14. Sect. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeo in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, &amp;c.</note> where Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> excuſeth the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII, touching the ſtate of the <hi>Departed
Souls,</hi> before the Reſurrection, by ſaying, that the
Church in his time had not as yet determined any thing
touching this Particular. And ſo likewiſe, where he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the ſame Plaiſter to that (in his Judgment) ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
Opinion of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> I, who maintained That
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98310:78"/>
Baptiſm adminiſtred in the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> onely,
without expreſſing the other Perſons of the Holy Trinity,

                  <hi>This is a Point</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>touching which we find not the Church
to have determined any thing.</hi> And, how dangerous, and

him to be, who hold, That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> may fall
into Hereſie; yet doth he permit Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to hold
the ſame, not daring to rank him among the Hereticks,
becauſe that the Church had not as yet clearly and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitively
delivered it ſelf touching this Point. The ſame
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in another Controverſie of great importance,
touching the <hi>Canonical</hi> Books of the Old Teſtament,
finding himſelf hardly put to it, by his Adverſaries urging
againſt him the Authority of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> who caſts <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
the Book of <hi>Wiſdom, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> and the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>

of this Objection, after the ſame manner. <hi>I confeſs</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>that S.</hi> Hierome <hi>held this Opinion, becauſe that no
General Council had as yet ordained any thing touching
theſe Books.</hi> Seeing therefore it is moſt clear, both from
the Confeſſion of our Adverſaries, and alſo by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the thing it ſelf, that the Fathers have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ed
in their Writings very many of their own particular
Opinions, digeſted out of their own private Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and which they had not learnt in the School of the
Church; who ſees not, that before we give any certain
credit unto their Sayings, we ought firſt to be aſſured of
what Nature they are? Whether they were their own
particular Opinions onely, or the publick Senſe of their
Age? Since it is confeſſed by all, That thoſe of the former
ſort are not always obligatory neceſſarily; but are ſuch
as oftentimes may, and ſometimes ought to be rejected,
without any ſcruple at all. You will object, perhaps, to a
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> That S. <hi>Hierome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> worſhipped the Reliques of
<hi>Departed Saints.</hi> How ſhall I know (will he reply upon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98310:79"/>
you again) whether this was his private Opinion onely,
or not? If the Authority of this Father, for want of
being grounded upon ſome Publick Declaration of the
Church, could not bind <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to receive his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
touching the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Old Teſtament; why
ſhould this Opinion of his, which is not any whit better
grounded than the other, perſwade me to the Worſhip of
<hi>Reliques?</hi> The ſame will he reply upon you, and many
times with much more appearance of Reaſon, concerning
divers other Teſtimonies produced out of the Fathers.
So that, whether you would confirm your own Faith, or
whether you would wreſt out of your Adverſaries hand
this manner of Reply, and make good all ſuch Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it will concern you to make it clear, concerning
any Paſſage whatſoever, that you ſhall urge out of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is not his own private Opinion, but was the
Opinion of the Church it ſelf wherein he lived: which,
in my Judgment, is a thing that is as hard, or harder to
be demonſtrated, than any one of all thoſe things we
have yet diſcourſed of. For, thoſe means by which we
might eaſily attain to this Knowledge, are wanting unto
us; and thoſe which we have left us, are very weak, and
very little concluding. If the Fathers themſelves had but
taken ſo much pains as to have diſtinguiſhed betwixt
theſe two ſorts of Opinions, informing us in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Caſe, which were their own private Opinions only,
and which were taught by the whole Church; or, at leaſt,
had but propoſed ſome of them as <hi>Doubtful,</hi> and others
again as <hi>Aſſured Truths,</hi> in like manner as <hi>Origen</hi> hath
ſometimes done; they would indeed have eaſed us very
much: though, to ſay the truth, they would not have
wholly cured us of our Grief: foraſmuch as ſometimes
(as we ſhall hereafter make it appear) they attribute to
the Church thoſe things,<note place="margin">Infr. l. 2. c. 1.</note> which it is moſt evident that
it never held. But they very ſeldom uſe to make any ſuch
Diſtinction, but commonly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent their own private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in the very ſame manner as they do the publick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98310:79"/>
and ſometimes alſo, by reaſon of the Paſſion, which theſe
Authors may chance naturally to have been ſubject unto,
be the thing what it will, we ſhall have them recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
unto us with more eagerneſs, that which they
have conceived, and brought forth themſelves, than that
which they have received from any other hand: ſo that
we ſhall meet with very little in them, that may give us
any light in this Particular. There would be left us yet
another help in this buſineſs, by comparing that which
they ſay here and there throughout their Writings, with
the Publick Opinions of the Church, which would be a
pretty ſafe and certain Rule to go by, had we any where
elſe beſides their Books, any clear and certain evidence,
what the Belief of the Church hath been, in each ſeveral
Age, touching all Points of Religion: and if this were ſo,
we ſhould not then need to trouble our ſelves with the
ſtudying the Writings of the Fathers; ſeeing that we
read them for no other purpoſe, but only to diſcover
out of them, what the opinion of Chriſtendom hath been,
touching thoſe Points which are at this day controverted
betwixt us. But now there is no man but knows, but
this help is wanting to us. For, ſetting aſide the <hi>Creeds,</hi>
and the Determinations of the ſix firſt <hi>General Councils,</hi>
and of ſome few of the <hi>Provincial,</hi> you will not meet
with any Piece of this nature, throughout the whole ſtock
of Antiquity. Now, (as we have already made it appear
in the preceding Chapter,) the Ancient Church hath not
any where declared, neither in its <hi>Creeds,</hi> nor in the
aforeſaid <hi>Councils,</hi> what the opinion and ſenſe of it hath
been, touching the greateſt part of thoſe Points, which
are now in diſpute amongſt us. It followeth therefore,
that by this means we ſhall never be able to diſtinguiſh,
in the Writings of the Fathers, which were their own
private opinions, and which they held in common with
the reſt of the Church. If we could indeed learn from
any creditable Author, that the preſent Controverſies had
ever been decided by the Ancient Church; we ſhould
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98310:80"/>
then readily believe, that the Fathers would have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this their Deciſion: and then, although the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
themſelves ſhould not perhaps have come down to
our hands, yet notwithſtanding ſhould we be in ſome
ſort obliged to believe, that the Fathers who had both
ſeen, and aſſented to the ſame, would alſo have delivered
over the ſenſe of them unto us in their Writings. But we
meet with no ſuch thing in any Author: but it rather
appears evidently to the contrary, through the whole
courſe of Eccleſiaſtical Story, that theſe Matters were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much as ſtarted, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity; ſo
far have they been from being then decided. So that it
manifeſtly appeareth from hence, that if the Fathers of
thoſe Primitive times have by chance ſaid any thing of
them; they fetched not what they ſaid from the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the Church, which had not as yet declared
it ſelf touching the ſame; but vented rather their own
private thoughts and opinions. Neither will it be to any
purpoſe to object here, that the Teſtimonies of many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
together do repreſent unto us the ſence of the
Church; although the voice of one or two ſingle perſons
only is not ſufficient to do the ſame. For, not to anſwer,
that that which hath hapned to one, may have hapned to
many others; and, that if ſome particular perſons chance
to have fallen upon ſome particular Opinions, poſſibly
others may either have accompanied, or elſe have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the ſame: I ſay further, that this Objection is
of no force at all in this Particular. For, ſeeing that the
Church had not as yet declared its opinion publickly,
touching the Points at this day controverted; it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that many together, that lived in the ſame time,
ſhould repreſent it unto us, as that one ſingle perſon
ſhould. How could they poſſibly have ſeen that; which
lay as yet concealed? How could they poſſibly meaſure
their Belief by ſuch a Rule, as was not yet viſible to the
World? The <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> alledge the Teſtimonies, not of
one, not of two, but of a very great number of the moſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98310:80"/>
eminent and the moſt ancient among the Fathers, who
were all of their opinion as we ſhall ſee hereafter. The
Anſwer, that is ordinarily made to the Objection, is,
That the Church having not as yet declared its ſence tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this Point, the Teſtimonies of theſe Men bind us
not to believe the ſame: which is an evident Argument,
that a great number, in this caſe, ſignifies no more than a
ſmall, in the repreſenting unto us, what the Belief of the
Church hath been; and that it is neceſſary, that either by
ſome General Council, or elſe by ſome other publick way,
it muſt have declared its judgment touching any Queſtion
in debate that ſo we may know whether the Fathers
have been of the ſame judgment, or no. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Account, we are to raiſe up again the whole
Ancient Church, and to call it to account, touching every
of theſe particular Points now debated, touching which
the Teſtimonies of the Fathers are alledged; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
otherwiſe to give any certain judgment, whether
that which they ſay be their own private, or elſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Opinion; that is to ſay, whether it be fit to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or not. So that any man, that is but of the meaneſt
judgment, may eaſily perceive how that it is not only a
difficult, but alſo almoſt an impoſſible thing, to gather out
of the Writings of the Fathers ſo much light, as is neceſſary
we ſhould have, for our ſatisfaction in matters of ſo great
importance.</p>

by ſome part of it only: which yet is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be known, before we can make uſe of any
Allegations out of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT ſuppoſe that a Father, relieving us in this difficult,
or rather impoſſible buſineſs, ſhould tell us in expreſs
terms, that what he propoſeth, is the ſenſe and opinion
of the Church in his time; yet would not this quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
us out of the doubtful condition we are in. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that their words are many times, in ſuch caſes as
theſe, liable to exception, ſuppoſe that it were certainly
and undoubtedly ſo; yet would it concern us then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
what that Church was, whereof he ſpeaketh; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were the <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> or only ſome <hi>Particular
Church,</hi> and whether it were that of the whole World,
or that of ſome City, Province, or Country only. Now
that this is a matter of no ſmall importance is evident
from hence; becauſe that the opinions of the <hi>Church
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> in Points of Faith are accounted infallible, and
neceſſarily true: whereas thoſe of Particular Churches
are not ſo, but are confeſſed to be ſubject to Errour. So
that the Queſtion being here touching the <hi>Faith,</hi> which
ought not to be grounded upon any thing, ſave what
is infallibly true; it will concern us to know, what the
judgment of the <hi>Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> hath been; ſeeing the
opinion of no Particular Church can do us any ſervice in
this caſe. And, that this diſtinction is alſo otherwiſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98310:81"/>
very neceſſary, appears evidently by this; becauſe that
the opinions and cuſtoms, which have been commonly
received by the greateſt part of Chriſtendom, have not
always preſently taken place in each Particular Church;
and again, thoſe which have been received in ſome certain
Particular Churches, have not been entertained by all the
reſt. Thus we find in ſtory, that the Churches of <hi>Aſia
minor</hi> kept the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon a different day from
all the other parts of Chriſtendom: and although the
buſineſs it ſelf ſeems to be of no very great importance,
yet did it nevertheleſs cauſe a world of ſtir in the

                  <hi>Neither let it at all trouble thee,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we have
not this Decree; ſeeing that there are ſome
others found among the Canons, whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
nevertheleſs we not admit of. For, ſome of
them are in force, and are obſerved in the Greek
Church; and others again in certain other
Provinces only. As for example, the XVI
and XVII. Canons of the Council of</hi> Laodicea
<hi>are obſerved only among the Greeks; and the
VI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the VIII Canons of the Council of</hi>
Africk, <hi>are received by none, but the Africans
only.</hi> I could here produce divers other
Examples; but theſe may ſuffice, to ſhew,
that the Opinions and Cuſtoms, which have
been received in one Part of the Church,
have not always been entertained in all the
reſt. Whence it evidently follows, that all that is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
as the opinion, or obſervation of the Church,
ought not therefore preſently to paſs for an Univerſal
Law. The Proteſtant alledgeth, for the juſtifying his
<hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures, the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> before
mentioned. Thou anſwereſt him perhaps, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was the opinion of the Churches; but it was only
of ſome particular Churches. I ſhall not here enter into
an Examination, whether this Anſwer be well grounded,
or not: it is ſufficient for me, that I can ſafely then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from hence, that according to this account, before
you can make uſe of any Opinion, or Teſtimony out of
any of the Fathers, it is neceſſary, that you firſt make it
appear, not only that it was the Opinion of the Church at
that time; but you muſt further alſo clearly demonſtrate
unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Churches opinion it was; whether of the
Church Univerſal, or elſe of ſome Particular Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is objected againſt the Proteſtants, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:98310:83"/>
teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Epiphan Haer. 59. Tom. 1.</note> that the Church admitted not into the higher
Orders of the Miniſtry, any ſave thoſe that were <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi>
or profeſſed Continency. Now to make good this
Allegation, it is neceſſary that it be firſt proved, that
the Church he there ſpeaks of, was the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.
For (will the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> reply upon you,) as <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi>
hath had, as it ſeems, a particular Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Canon</hi> of the Scriptures; poſſibly alſo <hi>Cyprus</hi> may
in like manner have had its particular Reſolutions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Ordination of the Clergy.</hi> The like may be ſaid of
the greateſt part of thoſe other Obſervations and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Ancient Church. Now how difficult a buſineſs
it will be, to clear theſe Matters, which are ſo full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity,
and to diſtinguiſh of Antiquity, at this ſo great
a diſtance of time, ſevering that which was <hi>Publick</hi> from
what was <hi>Particular,</hi> and that which was <hi>Provincial</hi>
from what was <hi>National,</hi> and what was <hi>National</hi> from
that which was <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> any Man may be able to give
ſome kind of gueſs; but none can throughly underſtand,
ſave he that hath made trial of it. Do but fancy to your
ſelves a City that hath lain ruinated a thouſand years, no
part whereof remains, ſave onely the Ruines of Houſes,
lying all along here and there confuſedly; all the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covered all over with Thorns and Buſhes. Imagine
then that you have met with one that will undertake to
ſhew you preciſely where the Publick Buildings of the
City ſtood, and where the Private; which were the
Stones that belonged to the one, and which belonged to
the other; and, in a word, who, in theſe confuſed Heaps,
where the Whole lies all together, will, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſeparate ye the one from the other. The very ſame
Task, in a manner, doth he undertake, who ever ſhall go
about truly and preciſely to diſtinguiſh the Opinions of
the Ancient Church. This <hi>Antiquity</hi> is now of Eleven or
Twelve hundred years ſtanding: and the Ruines of it are
now onely left us, in the Books of the Writers of that
Time, which alſo have met with none of the beſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98310:84"/>
in their Paſſage through the ſeveral Ages down
to our time, as we have ſhewed before. How then dare
we entertain the leaſt hope, that amidſt this ſo great
Confuſion, we ſhould be able yet to diſtinguiſh the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to tell which of them honoured the <hi>Publick
Temple,</hi> and which went to the furniſhing of <hi>Private
Chappels</hi> onely? eſpecially conſidering, that the <hi>Private</hi>
ones have each of them ambitiouſly endeavoured to
make their own paſs for <hi>Publick.</hi> For where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or the City, or the Doctor, that hath not boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
cried up his own Opinions, and Obſervations, as
<hi>Apoſtolical?</hi> and which hath not uſed his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to gain them the Repute of being <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal?

Obſervations of things which are in themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
But yet, that which he hath permitted them
in theſe Matters, they have practiſed in all other. I
ſhall not here trouble my ſelf to produce any other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to prove the Difficulty of this Inquiry, becauſe I
ſhould then be forced to repeat a great part of that which
hath been already delivered. For, if it be a very hard
matter to attain to any certain knowledge what the
Senſe of the Writings of the Fathers is, as we have
proved before; how much more difficult a thing will
it be, to diſcover whether their Opinions were the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the particular Churches wherein they lived, or
elſe were the Opinions of the Church Univerſal in their
Age: the ſame things which cauſe Obſcurity in the
one, having as much or rather more reaſon of doing
the like in the other. And if you would fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
how painful an Undertaking this is, do but read
the Diſputations of the Learned of both Parties, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Point; where you ſhall meet with ſo many
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98310:84"/>
Doubts and Contradictions, and ſuch diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,

               <argument>

any of thoſe Points which are at this day
controverted amongst us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore we paſs on to the Second Part of this Treatiſe,
it ſeemeth not impertinent to give the Reader
this Laſt Advertiſement, and to let him know, that
though all theſe Difficulties here before repreſented
were removed, yet notwithſtanding would it ſtill be
impoſſible for us to know certainly, out of the Fathers,
what the Judgment of the whole Ancient Church,
whether you mean the Church Univerſal, or but any
conſiderable Part thereof, hath been, touching the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
which are now on foot in Religion. Now that
we may be able to make the truth of this Propoſition
appear, it is neceſſary that we ſhould firſt of all explain
the Terms.</p>
               <p>We underſtand commonly by the <hi>Church,</hi> (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in theſe Diſputations) either all thoſe Perſons
in General who profeſs themſelves to be of the ſaid
Church, of what Condition or Quality ſoever they
be; or elſe, in a ſtricter ſenſe, the Collective Body of
all thoſe who are ſet over, and who are Repreſentatives
of the Church; that is to ſay, the <hi>Clergy.</hi> So that
whether you ſpeak of the Church Univerſal, or of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98310:85"/>
ſome Particular Church, as, for example, that of <hi>Spain,</hi>
or of <hi>Carthage,</hi> this Term may be taken in either of theſe
two ſenſes. For, by the Church Univerſal, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
either all thoſe Perſons in general who live in the
Communion of the Chriſtian Church, whether they be
of the <hi>Laity,</hi> or of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> or elſe, thoſe Perſons
onely who are <hi>Eccleſiaſtici,</hi> or Church-men, as we now
call them. For, in the Primitive Times, all Chriſtians
that lived in the Communion of the Catholicks, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Eccleſiaſtici.</hi> In like manner, by the Church of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
is meant either generally All the Faithful that live
in the particular Communion of the Chriſtian Church of
<hi>Carthage;</hi> or elſe particularly, and in a ſtricter ſenſe, the
Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> with his whole <hi>Clergy.</hi> Now I do
not believe that there is any Man but will eaſily grant
me, that if we take the Church in the Firſt ſenſe, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to know, by way of Teſtimony given of the
ſame, what the Senſe and Judgment of it hath been in
each ſeveral Age, touching all the Points of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
We may indeed collect, by way of Diſcourſe,
what hath been the Belief of the True Members of the
Church: For there being ſome certain Articles, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
whereof is neceſſarily requiſite for the rendring a
Man ſuch an one; whoſoever rightly underſtands which
theſe Articles be, he may certainly conclude, that the
True Church, whether Univerſal, or Particular, hath
believed the ſame. But now, in the firſt place, this doth
not extend to all the Points of Chriſtian Religion, but
onely to thoſe which are <hi>Neceſſary:</hi> beſides which, there
are divers others, concerning which we may have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different, but even contrary Judgments too; and yet
not thereby hazard the loſs either of the Communion of
the Church, or of our Inheritance of everlaſting Salvation.
So then, this Ratiocination concludeth not, ſave onely of
thoſe who are the True Members of the Church. For as
for thoſe who make but an outward Profeſſion onely of
the Truth, it being not at all neceſſary that they ſhould be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98310:85"/>
ſaved, there is in like manner no more neceſſity of their
embracing thoſe Beliefs which are requiſite for that end.
They may, under this Mask, hide all manner of Opinions,
how Impious ſoever they be. Laſtly, that which makes
moſt for our purpoſe is, That this Knowledge is acquired
by Diſcourſe, whereas we ſpeak here of ſuch a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
as is collected by the hearing of ſeveral Witneſſes,
who give in their Teſtimonies touching the thing which
we would know. Now the Fathers having written with
a purpoſe of informing us, not what each particular Man
believed in their time, but rather what they thought fit
that all Men ſhould have believed; we muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That certainly they have not told us all that they
knew touching this particular. And conſequently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
partly their Charity, and partly alſo their Prudence,
may have cauſed them to paſs by in ſilence all ſuch Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
either of whole Companies, or of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
as they conceived to be not ſo conſonant to the
Truth. But ſuppoſing that they had not any of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
and that they had taken upon them to give us
a juſt Account, each Man of the Opinions of his particular
Church wherein he lived; it is evident however, that
they could never have been able to have attaine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the
end of this their Deſign. For, how is it poſſible that
they ſhould have been able to have learnt what the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of every ſingle Perſon was, amongſt ſo vaſt a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which conſiſted of ſo many ſeveral Perſons, who
were of ſo different both Capacities and Diſpoſitions?
Who will believe, that S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> for example, knew
all the ſeveral Opinions of each particular Perſon in his
Dioceſs, ſo as to be able to give us an account of the ſame?
Who can imagine, but that among ſuch a Multitude of
People as lived in the Communion of his Church, there
muſt needs have been very many who differed in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from him, in divers Points of Religion? Even at this
very day, that we may not trouble our ſelves to look ſo
high, we ſee by experience, that there is ſcarcely that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98310:86"/>
Pariſh to be found, how ſmall ſoever it be, where there
are not particular Perſons that maintain, in many Points
of Religion, different Opinions from thoſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.
But if we take a whole Dioceſs together, and paſs
by all thoſe who trouble themſelves not at all with the
difference of Opinions in Religion, whether it be by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their want of years, or their weakneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or their malice; and take notice only of the reſt,
dividing them according to the difference of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I am verily perſwaded, that that part which ſhall
agree in all Points with the Biſhop of that Dioceſs, will
many times be found to be the leaſt. Let a Biſhop preach
or write what he will, touching the Points which are
now in Controverſie, he will very hardly repreſent unto
you the Judgment of half the People of his Dioceſs. Now
we muſt conceive, that the temper of the World of old
was no other than what it is at this preſent day: and
therefore alſo, for this very reaſon, the liberty of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
what Opinions a man pleaſed, was much greater then,
than it is now; foraſmuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did
not exerciſe its Power then throughout <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſo
Abſolutely as it doth now adays: neither did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
or the Princes, uſe that ſeverity and rigour which
is now every where practiſed in our days; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
this diverſity of Opinions. We muſt therefore
neceſſarily believe, that the Opinions of the Faithful were
in thoſe days altogether as different, if not much more,
than they are now. Whence it will alſo follow, That
even the Doctors themſelves, who lived in thoſe Times,
could not know all the different Opinions of Men, much
leſs could they repreſent them unto us in their Writings.
But we ſhall not ſtand any longet upon a thing that no
Man can deny us; but ſhall rather proceed to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that which every one no doubt will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
here to reply upon us, touching this Particular; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That it is not neceſſary that we ſhould know the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
in Points of Religion, of all particular Perſons,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98310:86"/>
which are almoſt infinite in number, and for the moſt
part very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill grounded, and uncertain: but that it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
if we know what the Belief hath been of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi>
and thoſe that have been ſet over the Church, that
is to ſay, of the Church taken in the latter ſenſe. But yet
I confeſs I do not ſee that this Rule is ſo abſolutely right,
as that we ought to walk by it. For, if we are to take the
Church for the Rule and Foundation of our Faith, (as
the Authors of this Reply pretend we ought to do) the
<hi>People,</hi> in my Judgment, ought not then to be here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and paſſed by, as a thing of no conſideration. I
confeſs, the Opinions of particular Perſons are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
one from the other; and the knowledge of ſome of
them is very mean, and ſometimes alſo is none at all. But
yet poſſibly this Reaſon may chance to exclude even a
good part of the <hi>Clergy</hi> alſo, from the Authority which
they lay claim to in this Particular; being it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
but that both Ignorance and Malice have oftentimes
as great a ſhare here, proportionably, as they have among
the very <hi>People</hi> it ſelf. Who ſees not, that, if we muſt
have regard to the Capacity of Men, there are ſometimes
found, even among the plain ordinary ſort of Chriſtians
in a Church, thoſe that are more conſiderable, both for
their Learning and Piety, than the Paſtors themſelves?

that the Opinion of the <hi>People</hi> in theſe caſes ought
not wholly to be neglected. And truly, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> telleth
us in divers places, That the Church in his time had

ſomewhat a little before. But becauſe this Point is
ſtill controverted, I ſhall let it alone for this time. Let us
therefore grant, (ſince our Adverſaries will needs have
it ſo) that it is ſufficient in this caſe to know what the
Belief was of the <hi>Church,</hi> taken in the later and ſtricter
ſenſe; that is to ſay, of the <hi>Clergy:</hi> for even this way it
is evident enough,, that it is a very hard, if not an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
thing, truly to diſcover what it hath been in each
ſeveral Age. For, there is no leſs diverſity of Opinion
among the <hi>Clergy,</hi> than there is among the <hi>People:</hi> and
many times too there is much more; the being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in Books, ordinarily reducing things into nicer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties,
and giving occaſion of raiſing divers Opinions
upon the ſame. Who is he that will undertake to give us
an Account what the Opinion is of all the <hi>Clergy</hi> of one
City onely; I do not ſay of a Kingdom, or of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi>
touching all the Articles of Religion? Who
would be able to perform this, if he ſhould undertake it?
Never was there more exact care taken for the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Uniformity in Judgment among Chriſtians,
than is now at this day; when there is uſe made, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Cenſures and Thunderbolts of the <hi>Church,</hi> but
even of the Fire and the Sword of the <hi>Secular Powers</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.
And yet, notwithſtanding all this, how many Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Perſons are there to be found, even in thoſe very
places where theſe rigorous Courſes are obſerved with
the greateſt ſtrictneſs, even at <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and as it were
in the Popes own Boſom, who differ very much in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
touching Points of Religion, both from their Equals,
and from their Superiours? In <hi>France,</hi> where, by the
Bleſſing of God, the Liberty of Conſcience is much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98310:87"/>
greater than in other places, it would be a wonder, if,
where Four Clergy Men of the more Learned, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
ſort were met together, Two of them ſhould not,
upon ſome Point or other of the Faith, differ in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Main Body of their Church. And here
I am to intreat all thoſe who follow <hi>Caſſander</hi> in great
numbers, adoring the Monuments of the Fathers, and
who take whatſoever they find in him, for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Senſe of the Ancient Chriſtians, but to turn their
eyes back a little upon themſelves, and to conſider,
how many opinions they themſelves hold, which are
not only different, but even quite contrary too to the
Church, in the Communion whereof they live, and of
which they profeſs themſelves to be Members, and by
which indeed they ſubſiſt. The Difference is here ſo
great, as that it ſeems to be, as it were, one State with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
another State, and one Church within another Church.
And yet notwithſtanding, when any of the Doctors of
that Party, to which they adhere, deliver unto us, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their Definitions, or in their Sermons, or in their
Books, the common Senſe, and Judgment of their Church,
this Intermixture of Opinions is quite laid aſide, and
appears not at all. They ſpeak only of the opinions of
others, paſſing by thoſe of <hi>Caſſander,</hi> which are contrary
to them, in ſilence, as if they did not at all concern the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> neither more nor leſs: and yet it is very
well known unto us, even to us who live at this very
day, that they are favoured, and maintained by very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the moſt Eminent Perſons of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi>
it ſelf. And if this ſenſeleſs Sect, who forſooth think
themſelves much more refined in their opinions than the
reſt of the Body whereof they are a part, ſhould chance
in time either to fail of it ſelf, or to be ſuppreſt by force;
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Memory would ſo utterly come to nought, as that
Poſterity would not know any thing of their Belief, but
only by conjecture. Every one will then believe, that the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98310:88"/>
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time preciſely held to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Opinions that he reads in the Decrees of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and in other the like Books: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
we both know, and ſee, that among thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Perſons, which have been Anointed, Conſecrated,
and Preferred alſo by the ſaid Church, there is a Party
that diſſenteth from it in judgment, touching divers
Important Articles of Faith. Let us therefore reckon,
that the Ancient Church had alſo its <hi>Caſſanders,</hi> and
very many even among the Clergy it ſelf, who held ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
opinions which were different from that which was
the common Belief of the Church, and which it hath
at length by little and little ſunk, as it were, under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and wholly ſwallowed up, ſo that now there is not
any Tract of them left us. Chriſtianity was either dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the Ancient times from what it is now, or
elſe it was the ſame. If it was Different, it is then a
Piece of meer Sophiſtry, to endeavour to make it ſeem
to be the ſame; and a very great Abuſe, to produce
unto us, for this purpoſe, ſo many ſeveral Teſtimonies
out of Antiquity. If it were the ſame, it muſt then
without all doubt have produced the ſame Accidents,
and have ſown the ſame ſeeds of diverſity of opinions
in the ſpirits of its Clergy. Thoſe opinions and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
which now give offence to the <hi>Caſſandriſts,</hi>
would then alſo have offended ſome perſons or other,
that were endued with the like Moderation. For we
are not to conceive, but that thoſe Firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
brought forth Spirits, that were as much, and
more refined and delicate, than ours have done. But
that we may inſiſt upon this particular no longer, it is
ſufficient for me, that I have thus clearly made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that in the Ancient Church, the whole Clergy
of a City, or of a Nation, much leſs of the whole
World, had not neceſſarily one and the ſame ſenſe and
opinion, touching Points of Religion. So that it will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98310:88"/>
follow from hence, that we cannot know certainly,
whether thoſe opinions which we meet withal in the
Fathers, were received by all and every of the Paſtors
of the Church at that time, or not. All that you can
gather thence is but this at the moſt; that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſome others perhaps of the moſt eminent
amongſt them (if you pleaſe,) maintained ſuch or ſuch
opinions: in like manner, as that which <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
and others have written, touching the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt, will inform Poſterity, that theſe Men,
and many others of our time, held theſe opinions in
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But as thoſe who ſhall conclude
from the Books of theſe Authors, that there is at this
day no other opinion maintained, among the <hi>Clergy</hi>
themſelves of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> touching this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
would very much abuſe themſelves; ſo is it
much to be feared that we in like manner deceive our
ſelves, when, from what we find in Two or Three
of the Fathers, we conclude, that there was at that
time no other opinion held in the Chriſtian Church,
touching thoſe Points whereof they treat, ſave that which
they have delivered. It is a very hazardous buſineſs,
to take Eight or Ten Men, how Holy and Learned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may have been, as <hi>Sureties</hi> for all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the Church Univerſal, that lived in their Age.
This is too little <hi>Security,</hi> for ſo great a Sum.</p>
               <p>Now there are Two things, which may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt that which we have before delivered. The
Firſt is, that if there had been in Antiquity any other
opinions touching the Points now in Debate, which
had been different from thoſe which we now meet with
in the Books, either of all the Fathers, or at leaſt of ſome
few of them; they would then both have mentioned,
and alſo refuted them. But we have already heretofore
anſwered this Objection, by ſaying, that the Fathers
forbare to ſpeak any thing of this Diverſity of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98310:89"/>
partly out of Prudence, leſt otherwiſe they might
have provoked the Authors of the ſaid opinions, which
were contrary to their own; and ſo might increaſe the
Difference, inſtead of appeaſing it: and partly alſo out of
Charity; mildly bearing with that, which they account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not any whit dangerous. I only ſpeak here of thoſe
Differences in opinion, which they knew of: for there
might be a great number of others, which they knew not
of. Who can oblige you to believe, that a Monk, for
example, that had retired into a Corner, and as it were
forſaken the World, profeſſing only to inſtruct a ſmall
number of Men and Women in the Rules of Devotion,
muſt needs have known, what the opinions in Points of
Religion of all the Prelates of his Age were? Who will
paſs his word unto us, in his behalf, that he doth not
ſometimes reprove that in ſome Men, which yet the
Church allowed in an infinite number of others? Who
will warrant us, that all Chriſtendom in his time embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
all his opinions, and had no other of their own? <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevine</hi>
anſwering an Objection made by ſome,<note place="margin">Poſſevine in Appar.</note> touching
the Works of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> which S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
hath made no mention of at all, ſaith; that it is no
great marvel, that a Man that lay hid in a Corner of
the World, ſhould not have ſeen this Book, which the
<hi>Arrians</hi> endeavoured to ſuppreſs. May not a Man with
as much reaſon ſay, that it is no great wonder, if
S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> or any other the like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
who were taken up all of them with their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Charges, and Imployments, did not know of
ſome opinions of the Prelates of their Age; or that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Modeſty, or their Charity, or the little Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and Repute they had abroad, might have made
them conceal the ſame?</p>
               <p>The other Objection is drawn from hence, becauſe
that theſe Doctors of the Ancient Church, who held
ſome opinions different from thoſe which we read at this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98310:89"/>
day in the Fathers, did not publiſh them at all. But, I
anſwer firſt of all, that every Man is not able to do) ſo.
In the next place, thoſe that were able, were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
willing to do ſo. Divers other Conſiderations
may perhaps alſo have hindred them from ſo doing:
and if they are Wiſe, and Pious Men, they are never
moved, till they needs muſt. And hence it is, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
thoſe opinions, which have leſs truth in them,
do yet prevail; becauſe that <hi>Prudence,</hi> which maintains
the True Opinion, is Mild, and Patient: whereas
<hi>Raſhneſs,</hi> which defends the Falſe, is of a Froward,
Eager, and Ambitious Nature. But now let us but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
how many of the Evidences of this Diverſity of
opinion may have been made away, by thoſe ſeveral
ways before repreſented by us; as namely having been
either devoured by Time, or ſuppreſſed by Malitious
Men; for fear leſt they ſhould let the World ſee the
Traces of the Truth, which they would have concealed?
But that I may not be thought to bring here only bare
Conjectures, without any proof at all, I ſhall produce
ſome Examples alſo, for the confirming, and clearing of
this my Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> maintains againſt <hi>Aerius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiph. in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar. Haer. 75.</note> whom he ranks
among his <hi>Haereſiarchae,</hi> or <hi>Arch Hereticks</hi> that a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi>
according to the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Inſtitution of the thing it ſelf, is more than a <hi>Prieſt:</hi>
and this he endeavours to prove in many words, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
all the Objections, that are made to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If you but read the Paſſage, I am confident that when
you had done, you would not ſtick to ſwear, that what
he hath there delivered, was the general opinion of all
the Doctors of the Church; it being very unlikely, that
ſo Great, and ſo Renowned a Prelate would ſo ſlatly have
denied the opinion which he diſputed againſt, if ſo be
any one of his own familiar friends had alſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſame. And yet for all this, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:98310:90"/>
(who was one of the Principal Lights of our Weſtern
Church, and who lived at the ſame time with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>

this fell from him in diſcourſe only, he there
falls to proving the ſame at large, alledging
ſeveral Paſſages of Scripture, touching this
Particular; and he alſo repeats the ſame thing,
in two or three ſeveral places of his Works.
Whereby it evidently appears, that even Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
which have been quite Contradictory
to the opinions which have been delivered,
and maintained by ſome of the Fathers, and propoſed in
what terms ſoever, have notwithſtanding been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

of his opinions, as moſt Pernicious and Deadly: and yet

But we ſhall have occaſion hereafter to conſider
more at large of the like Examples; and ſhall only at
preſent obſerve, that if thoſe Books of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> which
we mentioned a little before, ſhould chance to have been

with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that no Doctor of the Ancient Church
ever held, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> were one and the
ſame thing, in its Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Who now after all this will aſſure us, that among ſo

there by the Fathers, and that too in as plain terms, as
theſe of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> none of them have ever been defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

before, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> commendeth, and maintaineth

               </argument>
               <p>WE have before ſhewed how hard a
matter it is to diſcover what the Senſe
of the Fathers hath been touching the
Points at this day controverted in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
both by reaſon of the ſmall number of Books
we have left us of the Fathers of the Firſt Centuries;
and thoſe too which we have, treating of ſuch things
as are of a very different nature from our preſent
Diſputes; and which beſides we cannot be very well
aſſured of, by reaſon of the many Forgeries and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
Corruptions which they have for ſo long a time
been ſubject to; as alſo by reaſon of their Obſcurity,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98310:92"/>
and Ambiguity in their Expreſſions; and their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
unto us many times the Opinions rather of others,
than of their Authors: beſides thoſe many other Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which are found in them, as namely, their not
informing us in what degree of Faith we are to hold each
particular Point of Doctrine; and their leaving us in
doubt, whether what they teach be the Judgment of the
Church, or their own private Opinion onely: and
whether, if it be the Judgment of the Church, it be of
the Church Univerſal, or of ſome Particular Church only.
Now, the leaſt of theſe Objections is ſufficient to render
their Teſtimony invalid: And again, on the other ſide,
that it may be of force, it is neceſſary that it be clearly
and evidently free from all theſe Defects; foraſmuch as
the Queſtion is here, touching the Chriſtian Faith, which
ought to be grounded on nothing, ſave what is ſure and
firm. Whoſoever therefore would make uſe of any Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

the Author of that Book out of which the ſaid Paſſage
is quoted: and moreover, that the Paſſage cited is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,

He muſt alſo make it appear, in what degree he
held it, and whether he maintained it as his own private
Opinion onely, or as the Opinion of the Church: and,

is a Buſineſs of ſo vaſt and almoſt infinite labour,
that it makes me very much doubt whether or no we can
be ever able to attain to a full and certain aſſurance what
the Real Poſitive Senſe of the Ancients hath been, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98310:92"/>
the whole Body of Controverſies now debated in
this our Age. Hence therefore our principal Queſtion
ſeems to be decided; namely, Whether the alledging of
the Fathers be a ſufficient and proper Means for the
demonſtrating the Truth of all thoſe Articles which are
at this day maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or not? For who doth not
now ſee, that this kind of proof hath as much or more
difficulty in it, than the Queſtion it ſelf? and that ſuch
Teſtimonies are as Obſcure, as the Controverted Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
themſelves? Notwithſtanding, that we may not be
thought too haſtily, and upon too light grounds, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
this way of Proceeding, we will paſs by all that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
that is found touching the Opinions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;
and ſuppoſing it to be no hard matter to diſcover
what the Opinion and Senſe of the Fathers hath been
touching the aforeſaid Points, we will now in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book conſider, whether or no their Authority be
ſuch, as that we ought, or may, without further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
believe on their ſcore, what we know them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to have believed, and to hold it in the ſame degree
that they did.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Paſſages to be obſerved in the
Writings of the Fathers: In the one, you have them
ſpeaking only as <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and teſtifying what the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Church was in their Time: In the other, they
propoſe to you, like <hi>Doctors,</hi> their own Private Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now, there is a World of difference betwixt theſe
two things: For in a <hi>Witneſs</hi> there is required only
<hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> and Truth; but in a <hi>Doctor, Learning</hi> and
Knowledge. The one perſwadeth us, by the opinion we
have of his Veracity; the other, by the ſtrength of his
Arguments. The Fathers are <hi>Witneſſes</hi> onely, when they
barely tell us, That the Church in their Times held ſuch or
ſuch Opinions: And they are then <hi>Doctors,</hi> when getting
up, as it were, into the Chair, they propoſe unto us their
own Opinions, making them good either out of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98310:93"/>
Scripture, or out of Reaſon. Now, as concerning the
Teſtimonies that they give, touching the Faith held by
the Church in their time, I know not whether we ought
to receive all they bring, for certain Truths, or not: But
this I am ſure of, that though they ſhould deſerve to be
received by us for ſuch, yet nevertheleſs would they ſtand
us in very little ſtead, as to the Buſineſs now in hand.
The Reaſon which moveth me to doubt of the former of
theſe, is, becauſe I obſerve, that thoſe very Men who are
the greateſt Admirers of the Fathers, do yet confeſs, that
although they erre very little, or not at all, in matter of
<hi>Right,</hi> yet nevertheleſs, they are often out, and have their
failings in matter of <hi>Fact:</hi> becauſe that <hi>Right</hi> is an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
thing, which is every way Uniform, and all of
one ſort; whereas, matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is a thing which is
mixed, and as it were enchaſed with divers particular
Circumſtances, which may very eaſily eſcape the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of, or at leaſt be not ſo rightly underſtood by, the
moſt clear and piercing Wits. Now, the condition of
the Churches Belief, in every particular Age, is matter
of <hi>Fact,</hi> and not of <hi>Right;</hi> and a Point of Hiſtory, and
not an Article of Faith: So that it followeth hence, that
poſſibly the Fathers may have erred, in giving us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
hereof; and that therefore their Teſtimonies, in
ſuch Caſes, ought not to be received by us, as infallibly
True: Neither yet may we be thought hereby to accuſe
the Fathers of Falſhood. For, how often do the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſteſt
Perſons that are, innocently teſtifie ſuch things as
they thought they had ſeen, which it afterwards appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that they ſaw not at all? for Goodneſs renders
not Men infallible. The Fathers therefore, being but
Men, might both be deceived themſelves in ſuch things,
and might conſequently alſo deceive thoſe who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided
in them, though innocently, and without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
of doing ſo. But beſides all this, it is very evident,
that they have not been wholly free from Paſſion nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and there is no Man but knows, that Paſſion very

Which ſecret Paſſion might eaſily make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Church held that Opinion, which they
themſelves were moſt taken with, and that it rejected
that which they themſelves diſliked; eſpecially, if there
were but the leaſt appearance or ſhadow of Reaſon to
incline them to this Belief: For Men are very eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to believe what they deſire. I conceive we may

like Carriages in the Writings of the Fathers: but theſe
here already ſet down, in my judgment, do ſufficiently ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the doubt which I have made, namely, that we ought
not to receive as Certain Truths the Teſtimony which the
Fathers give, touching the Belief of the Church in their
Time. Nevertheleſs, that we may not ſeem to make a
breach upon the Honour and Reputation of the Fathers,
I ſay, that though we ſhould grant, that all their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and Teſtimonies in this Particular were certainly
and undoubtedly True; yet notwithſtanding would they
be of little uſe to us, as to our preſent purpoſe. For,
firſt of all, there are but very few Paſſages wherein they
teſtifie plainly, and in direct Terms, what the Belief of
the Church in their Time hath been, touching the Points
now controverted amongſt us. This is the Buſineſs of an
Hiſtorian, rather than of a Doctor of the Church,
whoſe Office is to teach, to prove, and to exhort the
People committed to his Charge, and to correct their
Vices and Errours; telling them what they ought to do,
or believe, rather than troubling them with Diſcourſes of
what is done or believed by others. But yet when they
do give their Teſtimony what the Belief and Diſcipline
of the Church in their time was, this Teſtimony of theirs
ought not to extend ſave onely to what was apparently
ſuch, and which beſides was apparent to themſelves too.
Now, as we have formerly proved, they could not poſſibly
know the Senſe and Opinions of every particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that lived in their time; nor yet of all the Paſtors
and Miniſters who were ſet over them: but of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98310:95"/>
Particular Chriſtians onely. Foraſmuch therefore as
it is confeſſed, even by thoſe very Men who have the
Church in greateſt eſteem, that the Belief of Particular
Churches is not infallible, we may very eaſily perceive,
that ſuch Teſtimonies of the Fathers as theſe can ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
in very little or no ſtead, ſeeing they repreſent unto us
ſuch Opinions as are not always certainly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
True, and which conſequently are ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
and proving ours, as that, they rather ſtand in
need of being examined aud proved themſelves. But,
yet, ſuppoſe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did hold, that the
Beliefs of Particular Churches were Infallible, (which
yet it doth not) yet would not this make any thing at
all againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> foraſmuch as they are of the
clean contrary Opinion. Now, it is taken for granted on
all hands, that Proofs ought to be fetched from ſuch
things as are confeſſed and acknowledged by your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,
whom you endeavour to convince; otherwiſe
you will never be able to move him, or make him quit his
former Opinion. Seeing therefore, that the Teſtimonies
of the Farthers, touching the State of the Faith, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Diſcipline of their Times, are of this Nature;
it remaineth, that we now conſider their other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes,
wherein they have delivered themſelves, not as
<hi>Witneſſes,</hi> depoſing what they had ſeen; but as <hi>Doctors,</hi>
inſtructing us in what they believed. And certainly,
how Holy and Able ſoever they were, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that they were ſtill Men, and conſequently were
ſubject to Error, eſpecially in matters of Faith, which
is a Buſineſs ſo much tranſcending Humane Apprehenſion.
The Spirit of God onely was able to direct their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
and their Pens in the Truth, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them from falling into any Error; in like manner
as it directed the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, while
they wrote the Books of the Old and New Teſtament.
Now, we cannot be any way aſſured, that the Spirit of
God was preſent always with them, to enlighten their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98310:95"/>
Underſtandings, and to make them ſee the Truth of all
thoſe things whereof they wrote. They neither pretend
to this themſelves, nor yet doth any one, that I know of,
attribute unto them this Aſſiſtance, unleſs it be perhaps
the Author of the <hi>Gloſs</hi> upon the <hi>Decrees,</hi>

                  <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> Two Spaniſh Doctors.
For as much therefore, as we are not bound to believe any
thing, ſave that which is True; it is moſt evident, that
we neither may, nor ought to believe the Opinions of the
Fathers, till ſuch time as they appear to us to have been
certainly True. Now, we cannot be certainly aſſured of
this, by Their Single Authority; ſeeing that they were but
Men, who were not always inſpired by the Holy Spirit
from above: and therefore it is neceſſary, that we make
uſe of ſome other Guides in this our Inquiry; namely, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Holy Scriptures, or of Reaſon, or of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or of the Doctrine of the Preſent Church, or of
ſome other ſuch means, as they themſelves have made uſe
of: So that it hence follows, that their bare Aſſertions,
are no ſufficient Ground for us to build any of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon: they only ſerve to encline us before hand to
the Belief of the ſame; the great opinion which we have
of them, cauſing us to conclude, that They would never
have embraced ſuch an Opinion, except it had been True.
Which manner of Argumentation how ever is, at the beſt,
but Probable; ſo long as the Perſons we have here to do
withal, are only Men, and no more: and in this particular
Caſe, where the Queſtion is, touching Points of Faith,
it is by no means in the world to be allowed of; ſince that
Faith is to be grounded, not upon Probabilities, but upon
neceſſary Truths. The Fathers are like to other great
Maſters in this Point, and their Opinions are more, or
leſs Valid, in proportion to the Reaſon, and Authority,
whereon they are grounded: only they have this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98310:96"/>
that their very Name begets in us a readineſs, and
inclination, to receive whatſoever comes from them;
while we think it very improbable, that ſo Excellent men
as they were, ſhould ever believe any thing that was Falſe.
Thus in Humane Sciences, the ſaying of an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of
a far different Value, from that of any other Philoſopher
of leſs Account; becauſe that all men are before-hand
poſſeſſed with an Opinion, that this Great Philoſopher
would not maintain any thing, that was not conſonant
to Reaſon. But this is <hi>Prejudice</hi> only: for if upon better
examination, it ſhould be found to be otherwiſe, his Bare
Authority would then no longer prevail with us; what
himſelf had ſometime gallantly ſaid, would then here
take place; namely, <hi>That it is a ſacred thing, always to
preferre the</hi> Truth,<note place="margin">Ariſtot. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic. l. 1. c. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>before</hi> Friendſhip. Let the Fathers
therefore if you pleaſe, be the <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> in Chriſtian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy:
and let us have a Reverent eſteem of Them and
their Writings, as they deſerve; and not be too raſh in
concluding, that Perſons of ſo eminent, both Learning, and
Sanctity, ſhould maintain any Erroneous, or vain Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
eſpecially in a matter of ſo great Importance: Yet
notwithſtanding are we bound withal to remember, that
they were but Men, and that their Memory, Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Judgment, might ſometimes fail them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſequently, that we are to examine their Writings,
by thoſe Principles from whence they draw their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and not to ſit down upon their Bare Aſſertions, till
ſuch time as we have diſcovered them to be True. If I
were to ſpeak of any other Perſons than of the Fathers, I
ſhould not add any thing more, to what hath been already
ſaid, it having been already, in my judgment, clearly
enough proved, that they are not of themſelves of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
enough, to oblige us neceſſarily to follow their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
But ſeeing the Queſtion here is, touching theſe great
Names, which are ſo highly honoured in the Church; to
the end that no man may accuſe us of endeavouring to
rob them of any of the Reſpect which is due unto them, I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98310:96"/>
hold it neceſſary to examine this buſineſs a little more
exactly, and to make it appear, by conſidering the thing
it ſelf, that they are of no more Authority, neither in

by Us attributed unto them.</p>

thoſe Books of Scripture, which

Reverence and Honour, as to

Eminent ſoever they are, either for Sanctity, or Learning,
I read them ſo as not preſently to conclude, whatſoever I

of thoſe Books which we
Write, not with Authority
of Commanding, but only
out of a Deſign of exerciſing
our ſelves, to benefit others;)
<hi>we are ſo to read them, as not
being bound neceſſarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, but as having a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
left us, of judging of
what we read. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that we may not
quite ſhut out theſe Books, and
deprive poſterity of the moſt
profitable labour of exerciſing
their Language, and Stile, in
the handling and treating of
hard Queſtions; we make a
Diſtinction betwixt theſe Books
of Later Writers, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Canonical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;
which having been
confirmed in the Apoſtles time,
hath ſince by the Biſhops, who
ſucceeded them, and the Churches, which have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
throughout the World, been placed as it were upon
a high Throne, there to be reverenced and adored, by
every Faithful and Godly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding. And if we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98310:98"/>
chance here to meet with any thing that troubleth us, and
ſeemeth Abſurd, we muſt not ſay, that the Author of the
Book was ignorant of the truth; but rather, that either our
Copy is falſe, or the Interpreter is miſtaken in the ſenſe of
the place; or elſe, that we underſtand not him aright. And
as for the Writings of thoſe other Authors, who have come
after Them, the number whereof is almoſt infinite, though
coming very far ſhort of this moſt ſacred Excellency of
the Canonical Scriptures; a man may ſometimes find in
them the very ſame truth, though it ſhall not be of equal
Authority. And therefore if by chance we here meet
with ſuch things as ſeem contrary to the Truth, by reaſon
perhaps of our not underſtanding them only; we have our
Liberty, either in reading, or hearing the ſame, to approve of
what we like, and to reject that which we conceive not to be
ſo right. So that except all ſuch paſſages be made good, either
by ſome certain reaſon, or elſe by the Canonical Authority
of the Scriptures; and that it be made appear, that the thing
aſſerted either really it, or elſe at leaſt, that it might have
been; he that ſhall reject, or not aſſent to the ſame, ought not
in any wiſe to be reprehended.</hi>

teſtifying on our ſide, (as well here, as in many
other places, which would be too long to be inſerted
here;) that thoſe opinions which we find delivered by
the Fathers in their Writings, are grounded, not upon
their bare Authority, but upon their Reaſons; and, that
they bind not our belief otherwiſe, than ſo far forth as
they are conſonant either to the Scripture, or to Reaſon;
and that they ought to be examined by the one, and the
other, as proceeding from perſons that are not infallible,
but poſſibly may have erred.</p>
               <p>So that it appears from hence, that the courſe which is
at this day obſerved in the World, is not of ſufficiency
enough for the diſcovery, and demonſtration of the truth.
For, we are now in doubt, ſuppoſe, what the ſenſe and
meaning is of ſuch a piece of Scripture. Here ſhall you
preſently have the judgment of a Father brought, upon the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98310:98"/>
ſaid place; quite contrary to the Rule S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> giveth
us, who would have us examine the Fathers by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and not the Scriptures by the Fathers. Certainly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the judgment of this Father, the Proteſtant,
though a Paſſage as clear and expreſs, as any of the Canons
of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhould be brought againſt him,
out of any of the Fathers, ought not to be blamed, if he
ſhould anſwer, that he cannot by any means aſſent unto it,
unleſs the truth of it be firſt proved unto him, either by
ſome certain Reaſon, or elſe by the Authority of the
Canonical Scriptures; and that then, and not till then,
he ſhall be ready to aſſent unto it. So that according to
this Account, we are to alledge, not the Names, but
the Reaſons of Books; to take notice, not of the Quality
of their Authors, but of the Solidity of their Proofs; to
conſider what it is they give us; and not the face, or
hand of him that gives it us; and, in a word, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the diſpute, from Perſons, to Things. And S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
alſo ſeemeth to commend unto us this manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
where in the Preface to his ſecond Commentary
upon <hi>Hoſea,</hi> he hath theſe words: <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he, that is,
after the Authors of Books are once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this life) <hi>we judge of their worth,</hi>

                  <hi>and parts only; not conſidering at all the
Dignity of their Name: and the Reader
hath regard only to what he reads, and not
to the Author whoſe it is. So that whether
he were a Biſhop, or a Lay-man; a General
and a Lord, or a common Souldier, and a
Servant; whether he lie in Purple and in
Silk; or in the vileſt, and courſeſt rags; he
ſhall be judged, not according to his degree of honour, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the merit and worth of his Works.</hi> Now he here
ſpeaks either of matter of Right, or of Fact: and his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that either we ought to take this courſe in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or elſe it is a plain Affirmation, that it is the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the World ſo to do. If his words are to be taken in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98310:99"/>
the firſt ſenſe, he then clearly takes away all Authority
from the bare Names of Writers, and ſo would have us
to conſider the Quality only, and weight of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that is to ſay, their Reaſons, and the force of the
Arguments they uſe. If he be to be underſtood in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſenſe, he ſeemeth not to ſpeak truth, it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the ordinary courſe of the world is, to be more
taken with the titles and names of Books, than with the
things therein contained. But ſuppoſing however, that
this was S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> meaning; we may notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very ſafely believe, that he approveth of the ſaid
courſe; for as much as having this occaſion of ſpeaking
of it, he doth not at all reprehend it. If therefore thou
haſt any mind to ſtand to his judgment, lay me aſide the
Names of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and of <hi>Hierome,</hi> of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
and of <hi>Cyril;</hi> and forget for this once the Rochet of the
firſt, and the Chair of the ſecond, together with the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Robe of the two laſt: and obſerve what they ſay,
and not what they were: the ground and reaſon of their
opinions; and not the dignity of their perſons. But that
which makes me very much wonder, is, that ſome of
thoſe who have been the moſt converſant in Antiquity,
ſhould trouble themſelves in ſtuffing up their Books with
declamatory expreſſions,<note place="margin">Card. Perron, of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Aut. 20.</note> in praiſe of the Authors they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce;
not forbearing to recount to you ſo much as the
Nobleneſs of their Extraction, the choiceneſs of their
Education, the gallantry of their Parts, the eminency of
their See, and the greatneſs of their State. This manner
of writing may perhaps ſuit well enough with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of Rhetorick: but ſure I am, that it agreeth ill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s rule, which we gave you a little
before. But let us now obſerve, out of ſome other more
clear, and expreſs paſſages of his, what the judgment of
this great <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> and <hi>Cenſor</hi> of Antiquity hath
been, touching this Point.<note n="*" place="margin">

is a very excellent and remarkable one, and containeth in

Do but think therefore with how much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
we are to read and to weigh theſe Authors, and
how careful we ought to be in examining, in their Books,
whether there be not either ſome fault committed by the

perhaps the ſame Truth, (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith a little

hath obſerved, this laſt Paſſage of S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
ought to be underſtood onely in the Point touching the
Holy Trinity, concerning which, there were at that time
great Diſputes betwixt the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Arians:</hi>
for otherwiſe, if his words be taken in a General ſenſe,
they will be found to be falſe, as to S. <hi>Hilaries</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
who hath had his failings in ſome certain things,
as we ſhall ſee hereafter. In a word, although S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
were to be underſtood as ſpeaking in a General ſenſe
(as his words indeed ſeem to bear) yet might the ſame
thing poſſibly happen to him here, which he hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hath oftentimes befallen to others; namely, to be
miſtaken in his Judgment. For we are not to imagine,
that he would have us have a greater Opinion of him,
than he himſelf hath of other Men. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
told him, as we have before ſhewed, that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he expected Men ſhould judge any otherwiſe
of him. And I ſuppoſe, we may very ſafely keep to S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>'s
Judgment, and believe with him, that S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
had never any intention that we ſhould receive
all his Poſitions as Infallible Truths; but rather, that
he would have us to read and examine his Writings with
the ſame freedom that we do thoſe of other Men. And
if we have no mind to take S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s word in this
Particular, let us yet take S. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s own, who in his
ſecond Commentary upon the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> ſaith,

both of our own Men, and of the Jews;
yet if any Man can give me a better and truer
Account of theſe Things, I ſhall be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to embrace the ſame.</hi> Is this now, I
would fain ask, to bind up our Tongues,
and our Belief, ſo, as that we have no further liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
what he hath once laid down before us, or of
ſearching into the Reaſons and Grounds of his Opinions?
No, let us rather make uſe of that Liberty which they
all allow us: let us hearken to them, but (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
adviſe us) when what they deliver is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Reaſon, and upon the Scriptures. If they had not made
uſe of this Caution, in the reading of thoſe Authors who
went before them, the Chriſtian Faith had now been
wholly ſtuffed up with the Dreams of an <hi>Origen,</hi> or
an <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> or ſome other the like Authors: But
neither the Excellency of the Doctrine, nor yet the
Reſplendency of their Holy Life, which no Man can
deny to have ſhone forth very eminently in the Primitive
Fathers, were able ſo to dazle the eyes of thoſe that
came after them, as that they could not diſtinguiſh
betwixt that which was Sound and True in their
Writings, and that which was Trivial and Falſe.
Let not therefore the Excellency of thoſe who came
after them, hinder us either from paſſing by, or even
rejecting their Opinions, when we find them built
upon weak Foundations. You ſee they confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that this may very poſſibly be: we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Certainly when I ſee theſe Holy men on one ſide, crying
out unto us, that they are Men ſubject to Errours; and
that therefore we ought to conſider, and examine what
they deliver, and not take it all for Oracle: and then, on
the other ſide, ſet before my eyes theſe Worthy Maxims
of the Ages following: to wit,<note n="*" place="margin">Serg. Patr. C. N. Mon. in ep. ad Cyr. Concil. VI. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>That their Doctrine is
the Law of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal:</hi> and, <hi>That we are bound to
follow it, not only according to the ſenſe, but according to the
Bare Words alſo: and that we are bound to hold all, that they
have written, even to the leſt tittle:</hi> This repreſentation, I ſay,
makes me call to mind the Hiſtory of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> to
whom the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> would needs render Divine Honour,
notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance theſe Holy men were able
to make; who could not forbear to rend their garments,
through the Indignation they were filled with, to ſee that
ſervice paid to themſelves, which was due to the Divine
Majeſty alone, running in amongſt them, and crying out
aloud; <hi>Sirs, why do ye theſe things? We alſo are Men of like
paſſions with you.</hi> For, ſeeing that there is none but God,
whoſe word is certainly and neceſſarily True: and, ſeeing
that, on the other ſide, the Word, whereon we ground and
build our Faith, ought to be ſuch: who ſeeth not, that it
is all one, as to inveſt Man with the Glory, which is due to
God alone, and to place him in a manner in his Seat, if
we make His Word the Rule and Foundation of our
Faith, and the Judge of our Differences concerning It?
I am therefore ſtedfaſtly of this Opinion, that if theſe
Holy men could now behold from their bleſſed Manſions,
where they now live in bliſs on high with their Lord
and Saviour, what things are acted here below, they
would be very much offended with this Falſe Honour,
which men confer upon them, much againſt their Wills,
and would take it, as a very great injury offer'd them;
ſeeing that they cannot receive this Honour, but to the
Prejudice and Diminution of the Glory of their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
whom they love a thouſand times more, than Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Or if, from out their Sepulchres, where the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98310:107"/>
of their Mortality are now laid up, they could but
make us hear their ſacred voice; they would (I am very
confident) moſt ſharply reprove us for this Abuſe, and
would cry out in the words of S. <hi>Paul; Sirs, why do ye
theſe things? We alſo were Men, of like Paſſions with
you.</hi> But yet what need is there, either of ranſacking their
Sepulchers, and diſturbing their Sacred Aſhes; or, of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down their Spirits from Heaven; ſeeing that their
voice reſoundeth loud enough, and is heard ſo plainly, in
theſe very Books of theirs, which we ſo imprudently place
in that ſeat, which is only due to the Word of God?
We have heard, what the Judgment was of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
and of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> (the two moſt eminent Perſons in the
Weſtern Church,) touching this Particular: let us not
then be all afraid, having ſuch examples to follow, to
ſpeak freely our Opinions. But now, before we go any
further, I conceive it will be neceſſary, that we anſwer an
Objection, that may be brought againſt us; which is,
that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf alſo,
often times cite the Fathers. Beſides, what ſome have
obſerved, that the Fathers ſeldom entered into theſe
Liſts but when they were provoked by their Adverſaries;
I add further, that when we maintain, that the Authority
of the Fathers is not a ſufficient <hi>Medium,</hi> to prove an
Article of Faith by; we do not thereby preſently forbid
either the reading, or the citing of them. The Fathers
often quote the Writings of the Learned Heathens, the
Oracles of the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and Paſſages out of the Apocryphal
Books. Did they therefore think, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Books were
of ſufficient Authority to ground an Article of Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
God forbid, we ſhould entertain ſo ill an Opinion
of them: Their Faith was grounded upon the Word of
God: But yet to evidence the Truth more fully, they
ſearched into Humane Records; and by this Inquiry, made
it appear, that the Light of the Truth, revealed unto
Them, had in ſome degree ſhot its beams alſo even into
the Schools of Men, how Cloſe, and Shady ſoever they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98310:107"/>
had been. But, if they ſhould have produced no other,
but Humane Authority, they would never have been able
to have brought over any one perſon to the Faith. But
after they had received, by Divine Revelation, the Matter
of our Faith; it was very wiſely done of them, in the next
place to prove, not the Truth, but the Clearneſs of It, by
theſe little Sparks, which ſhot forth their light in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Men. And for ſome the like Reaſon did S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,
Athanaſius, Cyrill,</hi> and many other of them,
make uſe of Allegations out of the Fathers. For, after
that each of theſe had grounded upon the Authority of
Divine Revelation, the Neceſſity, and Efficacy of Grace,
the Conſubſtantiality of the Son with the Father, and the
Union of the Two Natures in Chriſt; they then fell to
producing of ſeveral Paſſages out of thoſe Learned Men,
who had lived before Them; to let men ſee, that this
Truth was ſo clear in the Word of God, as that all that
went before them had both ſeen and acknowledged
the ſame: The Conſideration whereof was both Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and Uſeful unto them. For what can more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
a Faithful Heart, than to find, that the chiefeſt
and moſt Eminent Perſons in the Church, had long ſince
held the ſame Opinions, touching our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
and His Grace, that We now hold at this day? But yet
it does not hence preſently follow, that though theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men ſhould have met with theſe Articles of our Faith,
in the Writings of their Predeceſſours only, without
finding any Foundation of them in the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they would notwithſtanding firmly have believed,
and embraced the ſame, contenting themſelves with the
Bare Authority of their Predeceſſours. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
profeſſeth plainly, that in ſuch a Caſe they might better
have rejected them, and not be blamed for ſo doing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
than have received them, unleſs they would incur the
imputation of being over Credulous. For, it is a point of
too much Credulity, to believe any thing without Reaſon:
and He further affirmeth, that where men ſpeak without
either Scripture, or Reaſon; their bare Authority is not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98310:108"/>
ſufficient to oblige us to believe what they propoſe
unto us. So that it hence appeareth, that Humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are alledged, not to prove the Truth of the
Faith, but only to ſhew the Clearneſs of it, after it is
once well grounded. Now the Queſtion at this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not concerning the
Clearneſs of the Truth of the Articles they believe, and
preſs upon the World: but it yet lies upon them to prove,
even the very Ground, and Foundation of them. Shew
me therefore (will a Proteſtant here ſay,) either out of
ſome Text of Scripture, or elſe by ſome Evident Reaſon,
that there is any ſuch place as Purgatory; and that the
Euchariſt is not Bread; and, that the Pope is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and Head of the Church Univerſal: and then,
I ſhall be very glad to try, if for our greater comfort we
may be able to find, in the Authors of the Third, or
Fourth Century, theſe Truths embraced by the Fathers of
thoſe times. But, to begin with theſe, is to invert the
Natural Order of things. We ought firſt to be aſſured,
that the Thing is; before we make inquiry, whether it
hath been believed or not. For, to what purpoſe is it to
find, that the Ancients believed it, unleſs we find withal
in their Writings, ſome Reaſon of this their Belief? And
again on the other ſide, what harm is it to us, to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
whether Antiquity believed it or not; ſo long as
we know, that the Thing is? And whereas there are
ſome, who to eſtabliſh the Supream Authority of the
Fathers, alledge the Counſel which <hi>Siſinnius,</hi> a Novatian,
and <hi>Agellius,</hi> his Biſhop, gave of old to <hi>Nectarius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by him to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the
Emperour;<note place="margin">Sozomen. l. 7. c. 12. Hiſt. Eccleſ.</note> which was, that they ſhould demand of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
whether, or not, they would ſtand to what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who died before the breaking forth of their Hereſie,
had delivered, touching the Point debated betwixt them:
this is hardly worth our conſideration. For, this was a Trick
only, deviſed by a ſubtil head, and which is worſe by a
Schiſmatick; and conſequently to be ſuſpected, as a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98310:108"/>
Captious Propoſal, purpoſely made to entrap the Adverſe
party; rather than any free, and ingenuous way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
               <p>For, if this manner of Proceeding had been right,
and good; how came it to paſs, that among ſo many
Catholick Biſhops as there were, none of them all adviſed
it? How came it to paſs, that they were ſo ignorant of the
Weapons, wherewith the Enemies of the Church were to
be encountred? How came it about, that it ſhould be
propoſed only by a young fellow, who was a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
too? And, if it were approved of, as right, and
good Counſel; why did <hi>Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi>
and ſo many other of the Fathers, who wrote in that Age
againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> deal with them wholly, in a manner,
out of the Scriptures? And certainly thoſe Holy men,
beſides their Chriſtian Candor, which obliged them to
this way of Proceeding, took a very wiſe courſe in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For, if this Controverſie had been to be decided by
the Authority of Humane Writers, I know not how any
man ſhould have been able to make good that, which this
Gallant ſo confidently affirmeth, in the place aforecited;
namely, <hi>That none of the Ancients ever ſaid, that the Son
of God had any beginning of his Generation;</hi> conſidering
thoſe many ſtrange Paſſages that we yet at this day meet
with, touching this Particular, in the Books of the Firſt
Fathers: which is the reaſon alſo why the <hi>Arrians</hi> al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his is ſo far from advancing the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, which ſome would
attribute to the Fathers, in Matters of
Faith; that on the contrary I meet with
ſomething in it, that makes me more doubt of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
than I did before. For, I find by this mans diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that whatſoever his reaſon was, whether good
or bad, he clearly appears to have had a very great deſire
of bringing all Differences in Religion, before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeat of the Fathers; and to the ſame end, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to prove, with the ſame eagerneſs and paſſion,
that their Judgment is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allible in theſe Caſes. But in
the mean time I find him ſo perplexed and troubled in
bringing out that which he would have, as that it appears
ſufficiently, that he ſaw well enough, that what he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
was not ſo agreeable to Truth. For he hath ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
his Propoſition, and bound it in with ſo many Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
as that it is very probable, that if all theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which he here requires, were any where to be found,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98310:109"/>
we might then ſafely, perhaps, rely upon the Writings of
the Fathers. But then on the other ſide, it is ſo very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
a matter, to meet with ſuch a Conjunction of ſo
many ſeveral Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lifications, as that I very much doubt,
whether we ſhall be ever able to enjoy this happineſs,
or not.</p>
               <p>For firſt of all, for the perſons of thoſe men, whoſe
Teſtimonies we alledge, he requireth that they ſhould be
ſuch, as not only <hi>Lived,</hi> but alſo <hi>Taught:</hi> and which is
more, <hi>perſevered</hi> too, not only in the <hi>Faith,</hi> but in the
<hi>Communion</hi> alſo of the Catholick Church. And then,
for fear of being ſurpriſed, and taken at this Word, he
comes over us with a new ſupply, and qualifies his words
with a Reſtriction of Three <hi>Adverbs;</hi> and tells Us, that
they muſt have lived, and taught <hi>Holily, Wiſely,</hi> and
<hi>Conſtantly.</hi> But yet this is not all: for beſides all this,
they muſt have either died in Chriſt, or for Chriſt. So
that if they <hi>Lived,</hi> but did not <hi>Teach;</hi> or if they both
<hi>Lived,</hi> and <hi>Taught,</hi> but did not <hi>Perſevere;</hi> or if they
both <hi>Lived, Taught,</hi> and alſo <hi>Perſevered</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi>
but not in the <hi>Communion;</hi> or elſe in the <hi>Communion,</hi> but
not in the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Catholick Church; or if they yet
Lived, and Taught <hi>Holily,</hi> but not <hi>Wiſely;</hi> or on the
contrary, <hi>Wiſely,</hi> but not <hi>Holily;</hi> and if, in the laſt place
after all this, having performed all the Particulars before
ſet down, they did not at laſt die either in Chriſt, or for
Chriſt; they ought not according to this mans Rule, be
admitted as Witneſſes in this Caſe. Certainly he might
have ſtopped here, and not have gone on ſtill with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications,
as he doth, limiting the number and the words
of theſe witneſſes. For what Chriſtian ever made ſcruple
of receiving the Opinion of ſuch a one, as had both Holily,
Wiſely, and Conſtantly lived, and taught in the Faith,
and Communion of the Catholick Church? For you
might hence very well reſt aſſured, that whatſoever he
had delivered, was True; and conſequently, Fit to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved:
for how could he have taught Wiſely, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98310:110"/>
if he had taught any Falſe Doctrine? All tha
he here therefore promiſeth us, is no more but this; That
we ſhould be ſure not to be deceived, provided, that we
believed no other Doctrines, ſave what were Holy, and
True. This Promiſe of his is like that, which little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are wont to make, when they tell you, that you
ſhall never die, if you but eat always. Neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there is any man in the World ſo perverſe, and
wilful, as not readily to aſſent to ſuch a man, as he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
knew to be ſo qualified, as <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi>
would here have him to be. But ſeeing that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that we ſhould firſt know the Quality of the Witneſs,
before we hear him; it remaineth, in my judgment, that
before we do ſo much as hear any of the Fathers, we ought
to be firſt aſſured, that he was ſo qualified in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
according to <hi>Vincentius</hi> his Rule before layed
down. Now I would very fain have any one inform me,
how it is poſſible for us to know this? Who will aſſure
us, that <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> St. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> or what other Father
you pleaſe, both Lived, Taught, Perſevered, and Died
Holily, Wiſely, and Conſtantly in the Faith, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Catholick Church? This can never be
done, without a moſt Exact Inquiry made, both into
their Life, and their Doctrines, which is an Impoſſible
thing, conſidering the many Ages that have paſſed, from
Their times, down to Ours. But yet ſuppoſing, that this
were a Poſſible thing, it would nevertheleſs be of no uſe
at all, as to this Authors purpoſe. For, He will have us
hear the Fathers, to the end, that we may be by Them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Truth. Now, that we may be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
whether or no, they were ſo Qualified, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
required; we ought neceſſarily to know firſt of all,
what the Truth is. For how is it otherwiſe poſſible, that
we ſhould be able to judg, whether they have taught Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,
and Wiſely? And if you were before-hand inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Truth, what need have you then to hear Them,
and to deſire to be inſtructed in it, by Them? You may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98310:110"/>
indeed make uſe of them, for the Illuſtration and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that which you knew before; but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn any Truth from them, which you knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And if you underſtand the <hi>Maxime</hi> before alledged
in another ſenſe, and take this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi>
this <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
therein mentioned, for a ſhadow onely, and the <hi>Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
and Outward Appearance of theſe things, and for a
Common and Empty Opinion, grounded meerly upon
the Publick Voice of the People, and not upon an Exact
Knowledge of the thing it ſelf, it will then prove to be
manifeſtly Falſe; thoſe Perſons who have but the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Appearance only, and not the Reality of theſe
Qualities, being no way fit to be admitted as Witneſſes,
much leſs to be receiv'd as the Supreme Judges, in the Point
of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> So that this Propoſition is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Impoſſible, if you underſtand it as the words ſeem
to ſound; or elſe it is Falſe, if you take it in any larger
ſenſe. The like Exceptions may be made againſt thoſe
other Conditions, which he there further requires, touching
the <hi>Number</hi> and the <hi>Words</hi> of theſe Witneſſes: For he
alloweth not the force of a Law to any thing, but what
hath been delivered either by All, or elſe by the Greateſt
part of them. If he here, by All, mean All the Fathers
that ever have been, or but the Greateſt Part of them
onely, he then puts us upon an Impoſſibility. For, taking
the whole Number of Fathers that ever have been, the
Greateſt, and perhaps too, the Beſt Part of them have not
written any thing at all: and among thoſe that have
written, how many hath Time devoured? and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hath the Falſe Dealings of Men either wholly ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
or elſe corrupted, and altered? It is therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
Impoſſible to know, what the Opinions have been,
either of All, or of the Greateſt Part of the Fathers, in
this ſenſe. And if he reſtrains this <hi>All,</hi> and this <hi>Greateſt
Part,</hi> to thoſe who appear at this day, either in their
own Books, or in Hiſtorians, and the Writings of other
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98310:111"/>
men; it will concern us then to inquire, Whether or no,
by All, he means All promiſcuouſly, without diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them by their ſeveral Ages wherein they lived; or
elſe, Whether he would have us diſtinguiſh them into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Claſſes,</hi> putting together in the ſame Rank all thoſe
that lived in one and the ſame Age; and receiving for
Truth whatſoever we find to have been held and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the greateſt part of them. Now both theſe
ways agree in this one thing; namely, that they render
the Judgment of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> wholly Caſual, and
make it depend upon divers and ſundry Accidents, which
have been the Cauſe of the Writings of the Fathers being
either preſerved, or loſt. For, put the caſe that <hi>Vincentius</hi>
ſhould have cleared, by this excellent courſe of his, ſome
Point or other, which had been controverted; he muſt
have thanked the Fire, the Water, the Moths, or the
Worms, for having ſpared thoſe Authors which he made
uſe of, and for having conſumed all thoſe other that
wrote in favour of the Adverſe Party: for otherwiſe he
ſhould have been an Heretick. And if we ſhould decide
our Differences in Matters of Faith after this manner,
we ſhould do in a manner as he did, who gave Judgment
upon the Suits of Law that came before him, by the
Chances he threw with Three Dice. Do but imagine
now, what an endleſs labour it would be, for a Man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go and heap up together, and run over all the
Authors that ever have written, one with another; or elſe
to diſtinguiſh them into their ſeveral Ages they wrote in,
and to examine them by Companies. And do but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
again, what ſatisfaction a Man ſhould be able to get
from hence; and where we ſhould be, in caſe we ſhould
find (as it is poſſible it may ſometimes ſo fall out, as we
ſhall ſhew hereafter) that the Senſe and Judgment of
this <hi>Greateſt Part</hi> ſhould prove to be either contrary to,
or perhaps beſides the Senſe and Meaning either of the
Scriptures, or of the Church. And again, how ſenſeleſs
a thing were it to make the Suffrages of Equal Authority,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98310:111"/>
of Perſons that are ſo Unequal themſelves, either in
reſpect of their Merit, Learning, Holy Life, and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Faith: and that a <hi>Rheticius,</hi> whom S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
cenſured ſo hardly a little before, ſhould be reckoned
Equal with S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> or a <hi>Philaſtrius</hi> be as good
a Man as S. <hi>Hierome?</hi> There is perhaps among the
Fathers ſuch a One, whoſe Judgment is of more weight
than a Hundred others; and yet forſooth will this Man
have us to make our <hi>Doubles,</hi> and our <hi>Sons,</hi> to go for as
much as our <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Piſtols.</hi> And laſtly, What
reaſon in the World is there, that although perhaps the
Perſons themſelves were equal in all things, we ſhould
yet make their Words alſo of equal force, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
of very different and unequal Authority; ſome
of them having been uttered, as it were, before the Bar,
the Books having been produced, both Parties heard, and
the whole Cauſe througly examined: and the other
perhaps having been caſt forth by their Authors at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
as it were, either in their Chamber, or elſe in
Diſcourſe walking abroad, or elſe perhaps by the By, while
they were treating of ſome other Matter? But our
Friend here, to prevent in ſome ſort this later Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
requires, that the Word of this <hi>Greateſt Part,</hi>
which he will allow to be fit to be Authoriſed, muſt have
been uttered by them Clearly, Often, and Conſtantly;
and then, and not till then, doth he allow them for Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and Undoubted Truth. And now you ſee he is got
into another Hold. For I would very fain be informed,
how it is poſſible for us to know whether theſe Fathers,
which we thus have called out of their Graves, to give
us their Judgment touching the Controverſies in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
affirmed thoſe things which we find in their
Writings, Clearly, Often, and Conſtantly, or not? If
in this his pretended Council of Doctors, you will not
allow the Right of giving their Suffrage to thoſe of
whom it may be doubted, that they either expreſſed
themſelves obſcurely, or gave in their Teſtimonies but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98310:112"/>
ſeldom, or have but weakly maintained their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
I pray you tell me, whom ſhall we have left at laſt,
to be the Judges in the Deciſion of our preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies?
As for the Apoſtles Creed, and the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Four Firſt General Councils, (which are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto, and approved of by all the Proteſtant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,)
I confeſs we may, by this way of Trial, allow
them as Competent Judges in theſe Matters. But as for
all the reſt, it is evident, by what hath been delivered in
the Firſt Part of this Treatiſe, that we can never admit
of them, if they are thus to be Qualified, and to have all
the afore-mentioned Conditions. We may therefore
very well conclude, That the Expedient here propoſed
by this Author, is either Impoſſible, or elſe not ſo ſafe
to be put in practice; ſo that I ſhall rather approve of
S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Judgment, touching the Authority of
the Fathers. I ſhould not have inſiſted ſo long upon
the Examination of this Propoſal of his, had I not ſeen
it to have been in ſo high Eſteem with many Men, and
indeed with ſome of the Learned too.<note place="margin">Perron, Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c.</note> For in earneſt,
after S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> have delivered their
Judgments, it matters not much what this Man ſhall
have believed to the contrary. But yet, before we
finiſh this Point, let us a little examine this Author, both
by S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s, and by his own Rule before laid
down. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinks us not bound to believe
the Saying of any Author, except he can prove the Truth
of it unto us, either by the Canonical Scriptures, or
elſe by ſome Probable Reaſon. What Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or what Reaſon hath this Man alledged, to prove
the Truth of what he hath propoſed? So that, whatſoever
his Opinion be, he muſt not take it amiſs, if, according
to the Advice and Practice of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> we take leave
to diſſent from him: eſpecially, conſidering we have ſo
many Reaſons to reject That, which he without any
Reaſon given, would have us to receive. And thus
you ſee, that according to the Judgment of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98310:112"/>
the Saying of this <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> although you
ſhould reckon him among the moſt Eminent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
doth not at all oblige us to give our Aſſent unto
it. And yet you will find, that his Teſtimony would
be yet of much leſs force and weight, if you but examine
the Man by his own Rule. For, according to him, we
are not to hearken to the Fathers, except they both Lived
and Taught Holily and Wiſely, even unto the hour of
their Death. Who is there now that will paſs his word
for him, that he himſelf was one of this number?
Who ſhall aſſure us, that he was not either an Heretick
himſelf, or at leaſt a Favourer of Hereticks? For, is it
not evident enough, that he favoured the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi>
who at that time ſwarmed in <hi>France,</hi> railing againſt
the very Name and Memory of S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> and
who were condemned by the whole Church? Who
may not eaſily ſee this, by his manner of Diſcourſe in his
<note n="a" place="margin">Vinc. Lirin. in Comm 2. c. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>Commonitorium,</hi> tending this way; where he ſeems
to intimate unto us under hand, That <hi>Proſper</hi> and
<hi>Hilary</hi> had unjuſtly ſlandered them; and that Pope
<note n="b" place="margin">Celeſtin. apud Aug. l. 2. contr. Pelag. &amp; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> who alſo wrote againſt them, had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed?
And may not he alſo be ſtrongly ſuſpected
to have been the Author of thoſe <hi>Objections</hi> made againſt
<hi>Proſper,</hi> which are called,<note n="c" place="margin">Proſper. Reſp. ad Object. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</note> 
                  <hi>Objectiones Vincentianae,

which are given him by<note n="d" place="margin">Gennad. in Catal. in Ruff. inter Op. Hier.</note> 
                  <hi>Gennadius,</hi> very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
this ſuſpicion; it being clear, that this Author was
of the ſame Sect, as appears plainly by the great account
he makes of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> who was the
Grand Patriarch of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> ſaying of him, <hi>That
he was not the leaſt part of the Doctors of the Church:</hi>
Tacitely alſo taxing S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> his Adverſary, and
calling him, <hi>A Malicious Slanderer;</hi> as alſo by the
Judgment which he gives of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was
<hi>Flagellum Pelagianorum,</hi> The Scourge of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
paſſing this inſolent Cenſure upon him, and ſaying,
<note n="e" place="margin">Gennad. ubi ſupra.</note> 
                  <hi>That in ſpeaking ſo much, it had hapned to him, what
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98310:113"/>
the Holy Ghoſt hath ſaid by</hi> Solomon, <hi>to wit,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 10. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>That
in the multitude of words there wanteth not ſin.</hi> So that
I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the Boldneſs of Cardinal
<hi>Perron,</hi> who when he hath any occaſion of alledging
this Author, ordinarily calleth him <hi>Saint Vincent de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi>
Saint <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>Lerius;</hi> thus, by a very ill example,
<note n="g" place="margin">Du Perron, en la Repliq. au Roy de la Grand Brit. paſſim.</note> Canonizing a Perſon who was ſtrongly ſuſpected to
have been an Heretick. Since therefore he was ſuch a
one, why ſhould any one think it ſtrange, that he ſhould
ſo much cry up the Judgment and Opinions of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
ſeeing that there is no Man but knows, that the
<hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians</hi> had the better of it, by the
citing Their Authorities, and laboured by this means
to bear down S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Name; and all this forſooth,
only by reaſon that the Greateſt Part of the Fathers, who
lived before <hi>Pelagius</hi> his time, had delivered themſelves
with leſs caution than they might have done, touching
thoſe Points which were by him afterwards brought into
Queſtion; and many times too in ſuch ſtrange Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
as will very hardly be reconciled to any Orthodox
Senſe? Yet notwithſtanding, ſhould we allow this <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi>
to have been a Perſon who was thus Qualified,
and to have had all thoſe Conditions which he requireth
in a Man, to render him capable of being hearkned to
in this Particular; what weight, I would fain know,
ought this Propoſal of his to carry with it, which yet is
not found any where, in the mouth of any of all thoſe
Fathers who went before him; who is alſo ſo ſtrongly
contradicted, both by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> as
we have ſeen in thoſe Paſſages before alledged out of
them; and who, beſides, is full of Obſcllre Paſſages,

after ſuch a manner, as that it is clear, that
when they Wrote, they had no intention of

Some few Examples of their Mistakes and
Overſights.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHoſoever will but take the pains diligently to
conſider the Fathers manner of Writing, he
will not deſire any other Teſtimony for the proof of
this Truth. For, the very Form of their Writings wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
clear enough, that in the greateſt part of them
they had no intention of delivering ſuch Definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
as were to be Obliging, meerly by the Single
Authority of the Mouth which uttered them: but their
purpoſe onely was, rather to communicate unto Us
their own Meditations upon divers Points of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
leaving us free to our own Liberty of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them, and to approve, or reject the ſame, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as we ſaw good. And thus hath S. <hi>Hierome</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered his Mind, as we ſhewed before, where he
ſpeaks of the Nature and Manner of Commentaries upon
the Holy Scriptures. And certainly, if they had had
any other Deſign or Intention, they would never have
troubled themſelves, as they ordinarily do, in gathering
together the ſeveral Opinions of other Men. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
I confeſs, is Laudable in a <hi>Teacher;</hi> but it
would be very Ridiculous in a <hi>Judge.</hi> Their Stile alſo
ſhould then be quite of another kind, than now it is: and
thoſe Obſcurities which we have obſerved in the Former
Part of this Treatiſe, proceeding either from the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Ornaments, or the Logical Subtilties which they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98310:114"/>
made uſe of, ſhould have no place here. For, what uſe
would there be of any ſuch thing in pronouncing a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Judgment, or indeed, in giving ones bare Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
only to any thing? But that which makes the
Truth of this our Aſſertion, more clearly to appear
than all the reſt, is, the little care and diligence that
they took, in compoſing the greateſt part of theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of theirs, which we now would ſo very fain have
to be the Rules of our Faith. If theſe men, who were
endued with ſuch exquiſite ſanctity, had had any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of preſcribing to Poſterity, a true and perfect Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Rule of Faith; is it probable that they would
have gone careleſly to work, in a buſineſs of ſo great
importance? Would they not rather have gone upon
it with their Eyes opened, their Judgments ſetled, their
Thoughts fixed, and every Faculty of their Soul atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
bent upon the buſineſs in hand; for fear, leſt that
in a buſineſs of ſo great weight as this, ſomething might
chance to fall from them, not ſo becoming their own
Wiſdom, or ſo ſuitable to the Peoples advantage? A
Judge, that had but never ſo little Conſcience, would
not otherwiſe give ſentence concerning the Oxen, the
Field, and the Gutters of <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Moevius.</hi> How
much more is the ſame Gravity and Deliberation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
here, where the Queſtion is touching the Faith,
the Souls, and the Eternal Salvation of all Mankind?
It were clearly therefore the greateſt injury that could
be offered to theſe Holy Perſons, to imagine, that they
would have taken upon them to have paſſed Judgment
in ſo weighty a Cauſe as this, but with the greateſt care
and attention that could be. Now it is very evident on
the other ſide, that in very many of thoſe Writings of
theirs, which have come down to our hands, there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be very much negligence, or, to ſpeak a little
more tenderly of the buſineſs, ſecurity at leaſt, both in
the Invention, Method, and Elocutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If therefore we
tender the Reputation either of their Honeſty or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98310:115"/>
we ought rather to ſay, that their deſign in theſe
Books of theirs, was not to pronounce definitively upon
this Particular, neither are their Writings judiciary Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
or final Judgments, but are rather Diſcourſes of a
far different Nature, occaſioned by divers emergent Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences;
and are more or leſs elaborate, according to
the Time, Judgment, Age, and Diſpoſition they were of
when they wrote them. Now although this want of
diligence and of deliberation, appears of it ſelf evidently
enough to any man, that readeth the Fathers, but with the
leaſt attention that may be, yet notwithſtanding that I
may not leave this Aſſertion of mine only ſaid, and not
proved at all, I ſhall here give you ſome few Inſtances for
a taſte only.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, there are very many Pieces, among the
Works of the Fathers, which were written in haſte; and
ſome too, which were meer Extemporary Diſcourſes,
and ſuch, as in all probability the Authors of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
would have found many things therein, which
would have required correction, had they had but lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to have reviewed the ſame.<note place="margin">Hier. Prolog. in Hom. Orig. in Jeſ. Nau.</note> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of his to ſome certain Homilies of <hi>Origen,</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
by him into Latine, ſaith that <hi>Origen</hi> made them
and delivered them in the Church, <hi>Ex tempore.</hi> Touching
theſe therefore, we are pretty well ſatisfied by St. <hi>Hierome;</hi>
but how many in the mean time may there be of the like
nature, among thoſe ſo many Homilies of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others; all which we perhaps imagine
to have been leiſurely and deliberately ſtudied, digeſted,
and compoſed, which yet ſome ſudden occaſion might
perhaps have put forth into the World upon an inſtant,
and which were as ſoon born as conceived, and as ſoon
publiſhed as made? St. <hi>Hierome</hi> often telleth us, that
he dictated what he wrote in haſte.<note place="margin">Hier. Ep. 128. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

meet withal, as well in the Words and Phraſes, as in the
ſenſe. And yet for all this (if, what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>

faſt, as that his Tongue over-run the Hands of his</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſes,
<hi>and by its Volubility and ſwiftneſs, in a manner
confounded them and their Cifres, and Abbreviations.</hi> He
elſewhere excuſeth in like manner another Work of his
of no ſmall importance neither, which is, his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
upon the Goſpel of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> telling us, that
by reaſon he had been ſtraitned in time, he was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to dictate it in very great haſte. And ſo likewiſe in the
Preface to his Second Commentary, upon the Epiſtle of
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he confeſſeth, that he wrote
it in ſo great haſte, as that he many times made as much
of it, as came to a thouſand lines in a day. In a word,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98310:116"/>
that I may not cloy the Reader with producing all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of the ſame kind, that I could here bring in, it is
his ordinary way of excuſing himſelf either in his Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or elſe at the cloſing up of all his Diſcourſes, to ſay,
that either the Meſſenger was in haſte, or ſome other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
called him away; or elſe ſome other the like cauſe,
whatſoever it were, was pretended. So that he never did
any thing almoſt but in haſte, and at full ſpeed. Sometimes
again, either ſome ſickneſs had taken him off his metal;
or elſe, the ſtudy of the Hebrew had let his Tongue grow
ruſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his Pen is not now able to reach its wonted pitch.
Now I would fain know if ſo be he would have us receive
all his ſayings, as Oracles; and did not indeed deſire us to
excuſe rather ſome things in him, and to forgive him ſome
others; why ſhould he uſe theſe ſpeeches unto us? Who
ever heard a Judge excuſe himſelf, by reaſon of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Time? Would not this be rather to accuſe,
than to excuſe himſelf, by making ſuch an Apology as this
for himſelf; for as much as the giving of over-haſty
Judgment, in any Cauſe, is a very great fault? And in my
Opinion, the Fathers could not more clearly have deprived
themſelves of this Dignity of being our Judges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we will inveſt them, whether they will or no, than
by writing and ſpeaking after this manner. But yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
St. <hi>Hierome</hi> had not given us theſe Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which yet ought to make us look well alſo to the
reſt of the Fathers; it appeareth evidently enough, out of
their very Writings themſelves, how little both time and
diligence they beſtowed, in compoſing the greateſt part of
them. For, otherwiſe how could ſo many ſmall trifling
Faults, both in Hiſtory, Grammar, Philoſophy, and the
like, have eſcaped ſo great and Eminent Perſons, who
were ſo well furniſhed with all ſorts of Literature? How
happened it, that they ſo either forgot, or elſe miſtook
themſelves, as they have ſometimes done?</p>
               <p>I ſhall here give the Reader ſome few examples of this
kind, not to take off any thing from the Praiſes due to theſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98310:116"/>
Learned Perſons; as if we thought them really to have
committed theſe Errours out of ignorance; but rather
to let the World ſee, that they did not alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of their whole ſtock of Worth and Learning; and that
ſometimes they either could not, or elſe would not make
uſe, but of ſome part only of their Knowledge, and of
their Time: which is a moſt certain Argument, that they
had never any intention of being received by us as Judges
in Points of Faith. I ſhall not ſay much of their Errours
in matter of Time, which are both very notable ones, and
alſo very frequent with them: as, for example, where

which they were both better acquainted with, and

That the number of thoſe that were in the Ship with

and by and by 80 Souls; whereas the Text ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,

So where<note n="x" place="margin">Hier. Comm. 1. in Abac.</note> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> troubles himſelf very much in
reconciling a certain Paſſage alledged by S. <hi>Paul</hi> out
<hi>Habakkuk,</hi> to the Original, telling us, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had
cited it in theſe words, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by My
Faith:</hi> whereas it is moſt evident, that he Apoſtle,
both in the <hi>Firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romans,</hi>
as alſo in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Galatians,</hi> hath it only thus,
<hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> and not, <hi>The Juſt ſhall
live by My Faith. Athanaſius</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis</hi> (or whoever
elſe was the Author of that Piece) reckoning up the
ſeveral Books of Scriptures, evidently takes the <hi>Third</hi>
Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which hath been always accounted Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98310:120"/>
by the common conſent of all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for
the <hi>Firſt,</hi> which is received by all, both <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and
<hi>Jews,</hi> into the Canon of the Scriptures. We might
reckon to this number (if at leaſt ſo fooliſh a Piece deſerve
to have any place among the Writings of the Fathers)
that groſs miſtake which we meet with in an Epiſtle of
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> II. who raileth fiercely againſt <hi>Vzziah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. II. in ep. ad Leon. Ifaur. de col. Imag.</note> for
breaking the <hi>Brazen Serpent;</hi> calling him, for this Act of
his, <hi>The Brother of the Emperour</hi> Leo <hi>the Iconoclaſt,</hi> which,
as he thought, was all one, as to reckon him amongſt the
moſt miſchievous and wretched Princes that ever had
been: and yet all this while the Scripture tells us, that
this was the Act, not of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> but of the Good King
<hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and that he deſerved to be rather commended
for the ſame, than blamed. As for their ſlips of Memory,
he had need to have a very happy one himſelf, that ſhould
go about to reckon them all up. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;

as that his Expoſitions upon the Scripture are half full
of theſe <hi>Allegories:</hi> and to be ſure to make himſelf
the more work, he ſometimes frames<note n="n" place="margin">Hilar. in Pſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 136.</note> certain Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98310:122"/>
and Abſurdities, which he would make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſeem to be guilty of, which yet it is not; only that
he may have ſome pretenſe to have recourſe to his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories.
As for example, in the 136 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he will needs
have the Letter of the Text to be utterly inexplicable,
where it ſays, That the <hi>Jews</hi> ſate down by the Rivers of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and hanged up their Harps upon the Willows;
as if, in this Country, that was watred with <hi>Tigris</hi> and
<hi>Euphrates,</hi> there had been neither River, nor Willow, nor
any Aquatick Tree.</p>
               <p>The ſame<note n="o" place="margin">Id. ibid. fol. 108.</note> Author alſo demandeth, as if it had been
a moſt indiſſoluble Queſtion, if taken in the Literal ſenſe,
who the Daughter of <hi>Babylon</hi> is; and, why ſhe is called
Miſerable? which is ſo eaſie a Queſtion, as that any
Child almoſt might very eaſily reſolve it, without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
the Text with Allegories. So likewiſe, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the 146 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he underſtandeth by the
<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. in Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>fol.</hi> 128. Haec ita intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere, non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam erroris, ſed irreligioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis eſt.</note> Clouds wherewith God is ſaid to cover the Heavens,
the Writings of the Prophets; and by the Rain which
he prepareth for the Earth, the Evangelical Doctrine; by
the Mountains which bring forth Graſs, the Prophets and
Apoſtles; by the Beaſts, he underſtands Men; and by
the young Ravens, the Gentiles: aſſuring us withal,
that it would not be onely Erroneous, but rather very
Irreligious, to take theſe words in the Literal ſenſe. May
not this be called rather Sporting with, than Expounding
of the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in another place, ſpeaking of the Fowls of
the Air, which our Saviour ſaid, neither reaped nor ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
into Barns,<note place="margin">Id. Can. 5. in Matth. 6. 26. fol. 7.</note> he underſtands, by theſe, the Devils;
and by the Lilies of the Field, which ſpin not, the Angels.
I ſhould much abuſe the Readers patience, if I ſhould here

as to ſay the truth, no Poet ever laſhed out with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

I ſhall here purpoſely paſs by, what I might produce, of
this nature, out of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and
almoſt all the reſt of the Fathers: for, this that we have
already brought, is enough, and indeed more than we
needed for our preſent purpoſe. Let the Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now judge, whether or no the Fathers, by this their
manner of Writing, have not clearly enough witneſſed
againſt themſelves, that their Intention, when they wrote
theſe their Books, never was either to bound and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Faith, or to decide our differences touching the
ſame. I muſt needs confeſs, that they were Perſons who
were endued with very large Gifts of the Spirit; and with
a moſt lively and clear Underſtanding, for the diving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Truth. But yet thoſe, that have the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hare
of theſe Gifts, have it yet to very little purpoſe, if ſo be
they imploy it not all, and every part of it, to the utmoſt
of their power, when the buſineſs they are to treat of is
of ſo great both difficulty and importance; and ſuch, as
to the deciding and diſcuſſing whereof we can never bring
either more attention or diligence, than is needful. Now
that the Fathers have not obſerved this Courſe in their
Writings, appeareth clearly enough by what hath been
formerly ſaid: Their Books therefore are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by us, either as Definitive Sentences, or Final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon our preſent Controverſies. I confeſs that
theſe ſmall, trivial Errors ought not to take off any thing
of the Opinion we have of the Greatneſs and Gallantry of
their Parts. I believe they might very eaſily have avoided
the falling into them, if they would but have taken the
pains to have looked a little better about them. And I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98310:123"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m of Opinion, that they fell into them meerly by inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
only, which may alſo ſometimes happen even to
the greateſt Maſters that are, in any Sciences whatſover. I
ſhall as willingly alſo yield to you, (if you deſire it,) that
they have ſometimes done theſe things purpoſely; letting
fall here and there throughout their Writings ſuch little
ſlips from their Pen, ſportingly, and by way of Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
or elſe out of a deſign of exerciſing our Wits.</p>
               <p>But certainly, whatſoever the Reaſon were, ſeeing that
they had no mind to uſe any more either care or diligence
in the compoſing of their Books, we may very well, and
indeed we ought to conclude from hence, that they had
never any Intention that theſe Books of theirs ſhould be
our Judges.</p>
               <p>Theſe Innocent Faults, theſe Miſtakes, theſe Overſights,
theſe Forgetfulneſſes, and theſe Sportings of theirs, do
ſufficiently declare for their part, that we are to make our
Addreſſes to ſome others; and, that they have not ſo ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered their Opinions, as if they had ſate on the Seat
of Judgment; but rather have ſpoken as in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
venting their own private Opinions only; and not
as our Judges.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations, joyned to what hath been ſaid,
in this particular, by ſome of the chiefeſt and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
among themſelves, as we have formerly ſhewed,
do make it, in my Judgment, evidently enough appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that their own will and deſire is, that we ſhould not
embrace their Opinions, as Oracles, or receive them as
Definitive Sentences, but that we ſhould rather exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them by the Scriptures, and by Reaſon; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Opinions of Doctors, who were indeed very
able and excellent Men; but yet notwithſtanding they
were ſtill Men, ſubject to Errour, and who had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the good Fortune to light upon what was true
and ſound, and who peradventure, even in this very
Caſe in hand, have not always done what they might;
by reaſon of their employing either leſs time, or leſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98310:124"/>
and diligence, than they ſhould have done, if at
leaſt they had had any ſerious purpoſe of doing their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

               </argument>
               <p>I Conceive, that that which hath been delivered in the
two preceding Chapters, is ſufficient to make it appear
to any moderate man, that the Authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
is not ſo Authentick, as People commonly imagine
it to be. Thou therefore whoſoever thou art, if thou beeſt
but an indifferent and impartial Reader, mayeſt omit
the reading of this, and the following Chapter; both
which I am fain to add, though much againſt my will,
to anſwer all Objections that may yet be made by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
and obſtinate perſons. For the prejudice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are before-hand poſſeſſed, may hinder them
perhaps from ſeeing the clearneſs of Reaſon, and from
hearing the voice of the Fathers themſelves; whoſe
words they perhaps will be ready to impute to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
rather than they will conſent to yield unto them
no more honour than they themſelves require. The
ſtubbornneſs therefore of theſe men, and not any need
that thou haſt of my doing ſo, hath conſtrained me to 
lay aſide ſome of that Reſpect, that I bear towards An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
and hath obliged me to give them a ſight of
ſome Errours of the Fathers, which are of much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
than the former, if by this means at leaſt I
may be able to overcome this their obſtinacy. For, when
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98310:124"/>
they ſhall but ſee, that the Fathers have erred in divers
very conſiderable Points; I hope they will at length
confeſs, that they had very good Reaſon, gravely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
us not to believe, or take upon Truſt any of their
Opinions, unleſs we find that they are grounded either
upon the Scriptures, or elſe upon ſome other Truth. I
confeſs, I enter upon this Inquiry very unwillingly, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
very little pleaſure in diſcovering the Infirmities and
Failings of any Men, eſpecially of ſuch, as are otherwiſe
thought worthy of ſo great Eſtimation and Honour:
but yet there is nothing in the World, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>how precious or
dear unto us ſoever it be, that we ought not to account
as Dung, if it be compared with <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men. And I am verily perſwaded, that even
theſe bleſſed <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves, were they now alive again,
would give us thanks for the pains we have taken, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to make men ſee, that they were but men;
and would account themſelves beholding to us, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken the boldneſs upon us, for the ſame reaſon to
diſcover thoſe Imperfections and Failings of theirs,
which Divine Providence hath ſuffered them to leave
behind them in their Writings, to the end only that they
might ſerve as ſo many Arguments to us of their Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
If there be any notwithſtanding, that ſhall take
offence hereat, I muſt intreat them once again to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that the perverſneſs only of thoſe men, with whom
I have to deal, hath forced me to this Irreverence, (if at
leaſt we are to call it ſo) together with the deſire I have
to manifeſt to the World ſo important a Truth as this is.
If I would go about to defend my ſelf by Examples, I
could here make uſe of that of Cardinal <hi>Perron;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Du Perron, Repliq. lib. 6. cap 6 p. 949.</note> who,
to juſtifie the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> interdicting the reading
of the Bible to any of the Laity, ſave only ſuch as ſhould
be allowed ſo to do; makes no more ado but falls to
laying open to the view of the World (not all the <hi>Faults</hi>)
for there are no ſuch there; but) all the <hi>Falſe Appearances
of Faults,</hi> that are found in the Bible, making a whole
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98310:125"/>
Chapter expreſly of the ſame. How much more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
then may we adventure here, to expoſe to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
view ſome few of the Failings of the Fathers, unto
whom we owe infinitely leſs Reſpect, than unto God;
only to moderate a little, and to allay the heat of that
exceſſive Devotion, that moſt men bear towards their
Writings; that ſo the one Party may be perſwaded to
ſeek out for ſome other Weapons, than the Authority of
theſe men, for the defence of their Opinions; and that
the other Party may not ſo eaſily be induced to give
ear to the bare Teſtimony of Antiquity. It was the
Saying of a Great Prince long ſince, that the vileſt and
moſt ſhameful Neceſſities of his Nature, were the things
that moſt clearly evinced him, that he was a <hi>Man,</hi> and
no <hi>God,</hi> as his flattering Courtiers would needs have
made him believe he was. Seeing therefore it ſtands us
ſo much upon, to know, that the Fathers were but <hi>Men,</hi>
let us not be afraid to produce here this ſo clear and ſo
evident Argument of their Humanity. Let us boldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into their moſt hidden Secrets, and let us ſee what ever
Marks of their Humanity they have left us in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;
that we may no longer adore and reverence their
Authority, as if it were wholly Divine. Yet I proteſt
here, before I begin, that I will not make any advantage
at all of thoſe many Arguments of their <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which
we meet withal; partly in their own Writings, and
partly in the Hiſtories of their Life. I heartily wiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that all of this kind might be buried in an Eternal
Oblivion, and that we would account of them, as of
Perſons that were moſt accompliſhed for Purity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of Life, as far forth at leaſt, as the frail Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Humane Nature can bear. I ſhall only touch
upon the Errours of their <hi>Belief,</hi> and thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have failed, not in <hi>Living,</hi> but in <hi>Writing.</hi> The
moſt Ancient of them all is <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> a man ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
in all Ancient Hiſtories for his great Knowledge,
both in Religion and Philoſophy; and alſo for the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98310:125"/>
of his Zeal, which is ſo evidently manifeſied, by
his ſuffering a Glorious Martyrdom for our Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt. And yet for all this, how many odd Opinions
do we meet withal in his Books, which are either very
trivial, or elſe are manifeſtly falſe? Do but hear how he

were Baptized, and even to Infants too, as appears by
his LIX Epiſtle, where, by the ſuffrages of LXV other
Biſhops, he admitteth Infants to Baptiſm, and the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98310:131"/>
Lords Supper, ſo ſoon as ever they are born; againſt the
Opinion of one <hi>Fidus,</hi> who would not admit of them
till the Eighth Day after they were born: and alſo by
that ſtory of his, that he tells us of a certain young Girl,
who being not as yet of years to ſpeak, by a remarkable
Miracle, put back the Liquor which had been conſecrated
for the Blood of our Saviour, and was preſented unto
her by a Deacon to drink in the Church; as judging her
ſelf unworthy to receive it, by reaſon that not long before,
ſhe had been carried to the celebration of ſome certain
<hi>Pagan</hi> Sacrifices. Now the Original of this Errour of
theirs was, the Belief they had, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was as
neceſſary to Salvation, as <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> as may eaſily be
collected out of the words of the ſaid Author, delivered
<hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Teſt. ad Quirin.</hi> Where having firſt laid down
this for a Ground; to wit,<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>That no man
can come into the Kingdom of God, unleſs he
be baptized and regenerated;</hi> he produceth,
for a proof hereof, firſt that Paſſage out of
St. <hi>John,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Except a
man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c.
and then this other: <hi>Except you eat the fleſh
of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye
have no life in you:</hi> urging the firſt of theſe places to prove
the neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and the other for that of the
<hi>Euchariſt,</hi> accounting each of them neceſſary to Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And hence it is, that we find him ſpeaking ſo
often of being <hi>born again, by virtue of the one, and of
the other Sacrament:</hi> in which words he doth not mean

               <p>We ſhould now come in the next place to ſpeak of
<hi>Origen;</hi> but ſince that there have been ſome ſince his
time, who have very much cryed down both him and his
Doctrine; and others again on the other ſide, who have
as ſtifly defended him, we ſhall forbear to ſay any thing
of him, that we may not ingage our ſelves in ſo long and
tedious a Quarrel: we ſhall only obſerve, from this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his, that neither the Antiquity, nor yet the
Learning or holy Life of any man, neceſſarily withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him from falling into very ſtrange and groſs Errours.
For, <hi>Origen</hi> was one of the moſt Ancient among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
having lived about the middle of the Third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury;
and having been ſo eminent for thoſe two other
excellencies, of Innocence and Learning, as that his fierceſt
Adverſaries cannot deny, but that he had them both in a
very high degree.</p>
               <p>Neither ought the<note n="a" place="margin">Epiphan. 64. Haer. quae eſt Orig.</note> Story of his Fall, related by <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi>
to take off any thing from the Reputation of his
Vertue: for though perhaps it might have been true, yet
hath it frequently hapned to others of the Faithful to
fall into great Temptations alſo; as appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
enough, by the Example of <hi>Saint Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>But, that I may not diſſemble, I profeſs my ſelf much

                  <hi>Baronius</hi> his Opinion; who
thinks this ſtory to be an arrant Fable, maliciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
by thoſe who envied the Fame of this excellent, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Wit; and that it was ſoiſted into <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
by ſome ſuch hand; or elſe (as I rather believe,) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon truſt by himſelf, and thruſt into that Book of his,
without any further Examination, as many other things
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98310:132"/>
have been; in the relating whereof this Father hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf a little over-credulous; as is alſo obſerved by
his<note n="†" place="margin">Petav. Not. ad Haer. 55. p. 217.</note> laſt Interpreter.</p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Origen,</hi> notwithſtanding all thoſe excellent
Gifts of his, hath not ſpared to broach very many Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which by reaſon of the abſurdneſs of them, have
been utterly rejected (and certainly very deſervedly too)
by the Church in all the Ages ſucceeding: which is an
evident Argument, that how ancient, learned, and holy
ſoever an Author may have been, we ought not however
preſently to believe him, and to urge him as infallible:
ſince there is no reaſon in the world to be given, why the
ſame thing which hath befallen <hi>Origen,</hi> in ſo many Points,
may not in ſome or other have alſo befallen any other
Author, whoſoever he be. But this I am very well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of, that thoſe very men, who have written againſt
<hi>Origen,</hi> have not been ſo throughly happy in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
but by oppoſing to the utmoſt ſome certain
Errour of his, have ſometimes fallen into as great a one
of their own.<note n="*" place="margin">Method. apud Epiphan. in Panar. haer. 54. quae est Orig. <gap reason="foreign">

is, that ſtrange Opinion which he held, touching the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

great raſhneſs for any Man to affirm either the one or

                  <note place="margin">Petav. ibid. ad Haer. 70. num. 10.</note> upon that

here, whether this Opinion be juſtifiable, or not: but
this I am ſure of, that you will hardly be able to make

them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father.</hi>
But yet ſuppoſing that this Opinion might be defended,
it is however evident, that this Father hath laſhed out
a little too much, when he derides all thoſe, as Fools, and
abſurd People, who chuſe rather to adore the Knowledge
of God, as Infinite, than to bound it, and make it Finite:
and for my part, I ſhould rather fear, that there would be

he</hi>) that God in the Second Benediction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Eating of Fleſh, which he did
not in the Firſt: he is to take notice, that in
like manner as the liberty to put away a mans
wife, according to the words of our Saviour,
was not granted from the beginning, but was
afterwards permitted to mankind, for the
hardneſs of their heart: in like manner was
the Eating of Fleſh unknown, until the Flood;
but after the Flood, the Sinews and Virulency
of Fleſh were thruſt into our Mouths, as the
Quails were given to the People of Iſrael mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Certainly</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
<hi>is a thing which is evil in it ſelf, and
is contrary to the Creation of the Man and
of the Woman, and to</hi> Marriage <hi>alſo, which
was inſtituted by God in Paradiſe: as is divinely proved
by our Saviour, diſputing with the</hi> Jews <hi>touching this
Point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore the <hi>Eating of Fleſh</hi> be like it, this alſo is
evil and unlawful in it ſelf. <hi>Marcion,</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi>

this.</p>

               <p>As for my own part, who have taken upon me this
troubleſom Buſineſs very unwillingly, I ſhall content my
ſelf with theſe few Inſtances already ſet down, ſeeing they
do, in my Judgment, make this Buſineſs very clear; the
diſcovery whereof, I have been neceſſitated to undertake,
though I wiſh rather they might have been concealed.
For, ſeeing that theſe ſo eminent Perſons, who were of
the greateſt Repute amongſt all the Ancients, have through
Humane Infirmity fallen into ſuch Errors, in Point of
Faith; what ought we to expect from others, who come
very much behind theſe, both in reſpect of their Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Learning, and Holineſs of Life? Since <hi>Juſtin Martyr,
Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Hilary, Ambroſe, Hierome, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
that is to ſay, the moſt Eminent, and moſt Approved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ever were, have yet ſtumbled in many places, and
have quite fallen in ſome other; what hath <hi>Cyril, Leo,
Gregorius Romanus,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcene</hi> done, who have come
after them, and in whom hath appeared both much leſs
Gallantry of Spirit, and Sanctity, than in the Former?
Beſides, if theſe Men have been miſtaken in matters of ſo
great Importance; ſome of them, for Inſtance, in the
Point touching the <hi>Nature of God;</hi> ſome, touching the
<hi>Humanity of our Saviour Chriſt;</hi> others, touching the
<hi>Quality of our Soul;</hi> and ſome, touching the <hi>State</hi> and
<hi>Condition</hi> thereof after Death, and touching the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
why, for Gods ſake, muſt they needs be Infallible,
when they ſpeak of the Points now debated amongſt us?
Why may not the ſame thing have hapned to them in the
one, that hath ſo manifeſtly befallen them in the other?
It is not very probable (as we have ſaid before) that they
ſo much as ever thought of our Differences: and it is
much more improbable, that ever they had any intention
of being our Judges in the Deciſion of them, as we have
before proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:98310:143"/>
But now put the Caſe that they were acquainted with
the Buſineſs, and that they did intend to clear our Doubts,
and to give us their Poſitive Determination touching the
ſame in their Books; who ſhall aſſure us, that they have
had better ſucceſs here, than they had in ſo many other
things, wherein we have before heard them, give their
Verdict, ſo utterly againſt all Juſtice and Reaſon? He
that hath erred touching the Point of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi>
is it not poſſible that he ſhould be in an Errour touching
the <hi>State of the Soul</hi> after this Life? He that could be
ignorant what the <hi>Nature of Chriſt's Body</hi> was, muſt
he Neceſſarily have a Right Judgment touching the
<hi>Euchariſt?</hi> I do not ſee what ſolid Reaſon of this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
can poſſibly be given. It cannot proceed, but from
one of theſe two Cauſes, neither of which have yet any
place here. For it happens ſometimes, that he who is
deceived in one Particular, hath yet better fortune in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
by reaſon perhaps of his taking more heed to, and
uſing more Attention in the Conſideration of the Later,
than he did in the Former, or elſe, by reaſon that one of
the Points is eaſier to be underſtood, than the other. For,
in this Caſe, though his Attention be as great in the one,
as in the other; yet notwithſtanding he may perhaps be
able to underſtand the eaſie one, but ſhall not be able to
maſter the hard one. But now, neither of theſe Reaſons
can be alledged here: For, why ſhould the Ancients
have uſed leſs Care and Attention in the Examination
of thoſe Points wherein they have erred? Or, why
ſhould they have uſed more in thoſe Points which are at
this day controverted amongſt us? Are not thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Points of Religion of as great Importance, as theſe
Latter? Is there leſs danger in being ignorant touching
the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> than touching the <hi>Authority of the
Pope?</hi> or touching the State of the Faithful in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi>
than touching the Puniſhment of Souls in
<hi>Purgatory?</hi> the Real <hi>Qualities</hi> of the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> than
the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> of His <hi>Paſſion,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98310:143"/>
than the <hi>Cup</hi> of His <hi>Communion?</hi> Is it more Neceſſary
to Salvation, to know Him <hi>Sacrificed</hi> upon the <hi>Altar,</hi>
than Really <hi>Suffering</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs?</hi> Who ſees not,
that theſe Matters are of equal Importance? or, if there
be any Difference betwixt them, that thoſe Points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Fathers have erred, are in ſome ſort more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
than thoſe which we now diſpute about?</p>
               <p>We ſhall therefore conclude, That if they had had both
the one and the other before their eyes, they would que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs
have uſed as much Diligence at leaſt, and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the Study of the one, as of the other; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
in all probability, would have been either
as ſucceſſful, or elſe have erred as much in the one, as in
the other.</p>
               <p>Neither may it be here objected, That thoſe Points
wherein they have failed, are of more difficulty than
thoſe other wherein theſe Men will needs have them to
have been Certainly in the Right: for whoſoever ſhall
but conſider them more narrowly, he will find that they
are equally both eaſie and difficult: or, if there be any
difference betwixt them in this Particular, thoſe which
they have erred in, were the eaſier of the two to have
been known.</p>
               <p>For, I would fain have any Man tell me what he
thinks in his Conſcience, whether it be not as eaſie to
judge by Reaſon, and by the Scripture, whether or no the
Saints ſhall dwell upon the Earth after the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi>
as it is to determine, whether, after they are departed this
Life, they ſhall go into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or not? Is it a harder
matter to know, whether the <hi>Angels</hi> are capable of
<hi>Carnal Love;</hi> than it is to judge, whether the <hi>Pope,</hi> as
he is <hi>Pope,</hi> be <hi>Infallible,</hi> or not? And if it be anſwered
here, That the Church, having already determined theſe
Latter Points, and having not declared it ſelf at all touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other, hath taken away all the Difficulty of the
one, but hath left the other in their former Doubtful
State: this is to preſuppoſe that which is the main Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98310:144"/>
or rather, it is manifeſtly Falſe: the Church in the
Firſt Ages having not, that we know of, paſſed any Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and Authentick Judgment, touching the Points now
in controverſie, as we have before already proved.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch therefore as theſe Holy Men (if at leaſt they
had any thought at all of theſe our Quarrels) had an
equally Clear Inſight in theſe things; both according
to all Reaſon, and all Probability, they would have alſo
come unto them with an equal both Attention and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And I believe that there is no Man but ſees, that if
they might erre in the Deciſion of the one, it is altogether
as Poſſible that they might be miſtaken alſo in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the other.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe Books of theirs, which are left us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
aloud, and openly enough, (as we have ſeen by
thoſe few Teſtimonies which we have but juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of them) that they have erred, and ſometimes
alſo very grievouſly, touching thoſe Firſt Queſtions: it
remaineth therefore that we ſay, That their Judgment
is not any whit more Infallible in our preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.
I could be content that you had demonſtrated
to any Proteſtant, by clear and undeniable Reaſons, that
S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> in thoſe Paſſages which are produced out of
him for the ſame purpoſe, hath Poſitively taught the
<hi>Real Preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> and I could
be well contented that he ſhould grant you the ſame,
which yet perhaps he will never do. However, after
all, he hath this ſtill to put you in mind of, namely, that
this is the ſelf-ſame S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> who in the ſame Book
maintains, That the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> felt no Pain at
all upon the Croſs. And if he were in an Error in
this Particular, why muſt he Neceſſarily be in the
Right in the other? The Queſtion touching the <hi>Body
of Chriſt,</hi> is of as great Importance as that of the
<hi>Euchariſt:</hi> and it is beſides much more Clearly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Scriptures, where there is nothing in the
Earth that obligeth in the leaſt degree to fancy any
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98310:144"/>
ſuch thing of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as S. <hi>Hilary</hi> hath
done: but where, on the contrary, there ſeems to be
ſome kind of Ground for the Opinion which he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have had, touching the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Foraſmuch
therefore (will the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſay) as that in a thing
which is of equal Importance, and of much leſs Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
he hath manifeſtly erred, who can aſſure me, that
in this Point here, which is both leſs Neceſſary, and more
Difficult he may not alſo be miſtaken? The ſame hath
he to reply upon you, touching thoſe other Allegations
which you produce out of the reſt of the Fathers; every
one of whom hath either Really erred, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> elſe Poſſibly
might have erred in Matters of Religion. Neither can
you hope, that any Solid Anſwer ſhould be given to theſe
things; eſpecially if you but conſider, that the Practice
both of the Fathers, and alſo of our Adverſaiies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
hath clearly confirmed this our Poſition. For,
<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. Ep. ad Hier: inter Ep. Hier. 47. T. 2. p. 551. &amp; inter Epiſt. Aug. 19. T. 2.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in that Diſpute of his which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
againſt S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> ſeeing him produce the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
of Seven Authors, he (taking no notice at all
of the words of the firſt four of them) anſwers no more
but this, That ſome of them were guilty of Hereſie, and
the reſt of Error: Which Anſwer is very Inſufficient,
unleſs you allow, that the Teſtimony of a Man who hath
erred in any one particular Point of Faith, is Null and
Invalid.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of the II Council of <hi>Nice</hi> took the very
ſame Courſe in anſwering an Objection brought againſt
them by the <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> who alledged a certain Paſſage for
themſelves out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. VII. Act. 6. Tom 3. Conc. Gen. p. 627.</note> anſwering
them no more but this, That the Author they cited was an
<hi>Arian.</hi> We need not examine whether this Anſwer of
theirs be true, or no; and if ſo, whether it be to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
or not: It is ſufficient for us, that it appears hence, by
their making uſe of this kind of Anſwer, that they took it
for granted, that he that had failed in one Point, was
not to be truſted in any other. Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98310:145"/>
reſt of the Learned of that Party, oftentimes makes uſe
of the ſame Shift, rejecting the Teſtimonies that are
brought againſt them out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Sozomen,</hi> two
Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians, becauſe they ſay they were <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians.</hi>
Thoſe who put forth the General Councils
at <hi>Rome</hi> diſauthorize <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Praefat prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixa Act. Conc. Niceni Gelaſ. Cyzic. in Edit. Rom Conc. Gen. Tom. 1.</note> who was the
Compiler of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Piece of his.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch therefore, as we are not to build upon the
Authority of any Author that may juſtly be accuſed of
Error; it is moſt evident, that the Authority of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part, and indeed in a manner of all the Fathers, may
very well be called in Queſtion: ſeeing that you will
hardly find any one of them that is not liable to this
Exception.</p>
               <p>But it will here be objected perhaps, by ſome eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that although it be confeſſed, that the Opinion of one
Single Father poſſibly may be, and many times is really
Falſe; yet however it is a very hard, or indeed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
thing, that what hath been delivered unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
by many of them together, ſhould be otherwiſe
than True.</p>
               <p>But we have anſwered ſomething already to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
where we took occaſion to examine that <hi>Maxime</hi>
of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> touching this Particular.</p>
               <p>And in ſhort, this is all one, as if having confeſſed that
every particular Perſon of ſuch a Company is ſick of ſome
Diſeaſe, we ſhould notwithſtanding ſtill deny, that the
whole Company, taken all together, can poſſibly fall into
any Common Diſtemper of Body. It is not indeed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſo probable, that Many ſhould be ſick of any
Diſeaſe, as that One ſingle Perſon ſhould: yet neither is
the thing altogether impoſſible, eſpecially when the
Diſeaſe is Contagious, and beſides, not ſo well Known;
as for the moſt part the Errors of Great Perſons are,
whoſe very Name bears them out, and makes them eaſily
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98310:145"/>
received by the Ordinary ſort, who run after them, and
ſuck them in without the leaſt ſuſpicion at all.</p>
               <p>But yet if Reaſon will not do the turn, let Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
however perſwade us to receive this Truth. For it is
moſt evident, that ſome of thoſe Errors before-ſpecified,
have been maintained, not by One, nor by Two, nor by
Three of the Fathers onely; but by Many, by the <hi>Major
part,</hi> and ſometimes alſo by All the Fathers of the ſame
Age, at leaſt of all thoſe whoſe Names and Writings
have come to our hands. We have heard how that <hi>Juſtin
Martyr</hi> maintained the Opinion of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi>
which is both manifeſtly falſe in it ſelf, and alſo very
dangerous in its Conſequences. Now this Opinion he

upon all the True <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> by ſo great a Martyr.
It is ſufficient for us, that however it appears clearly by
this Paſſage, that a very great part of the Doctors, and
of the Faithful People of thoſe times, maintained this
Errour. We ſee that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived in the ſame
time, and alſo <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who followed not long after
him, were both of the ſame Perſwaſion; no one Man all
this while, that we hear of, offering to contradict them.

endure to hear of.</p>
               <p>If it be here anſwered, that the Church in the Ages
following condemned this Opinion, as erroneous; this
is no more, than to ſay, that the Churches in the Ages
following acknowledged, that the joynt Conſent of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Fathers together, touching one and the ſame Opinion,
is no ſolid Proof of the Truth of the ſame. If <hi>Dionyſius
Alexandrinus</hi> had been of any other judgment, he
would never have written againſt <hi>Irenaeus</hi> as he did; as
<note n="†" place="margin">Id. Com. 18. in Eſ. in Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.</note> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> alſo teſtifieth, in one of his Books of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
before cited. And if we are to have regard
to <hi>Authority</hi> only, the Judgment of the ſucceeding
Church cannot then ſerve us, as a certain Guide in this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98310:147"/>
Queſtion, to inform us on which ſide the Truth is: For,
to alledge it in this Caſe, were rather to oppoſe one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
againſt another, than to decide the Controverſie.
As <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome, Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene,</hi>
and others, conceived not themſelves bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Lactantius,
Victorinus, Severus,</hi> and others; ſo neither are we any
more bound to ſubmit to theirs: For, their Poſterity oweth
them no more Reſpect, than they themſelves owed to
their Anceſtors. It ſeemeth rather, that in Reaſon they
ſhould owe them leſs, becauſe that look how far diſtant
in time they are from the Apoſtles, who are as it were the
Spring and Original of all Eccleſiaſtical Authority; ſo
much doth the Credit and Authority of the Doctors of
the Church loſe and grow leſs.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Antiquity</hi> (as we would have it) be the <hi>Mark</hi> of
<hi>Truth,</hi> then certainly that which is the moſt Ancient, is
alſo the moſt Venerable, and the moſt Conſiderable.
And if there were no other Argument but this, againſt
the <hi>Authority</hi> of many Fathers, unanimouſly conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any Opinion; yet would it clearly ſerve to leſſen
the ſame: but there are yet behind many others; ſome
whereof we ſhall here produce. We have heard before,
<hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
affirming all of them, that Heaven ſhall not be opened,
till the Day of Judgment; and that during this ſpace of
time the Souls of all the Faithful are ſhut up in ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
place, except ſome ſmall number of thoſe who
had the Priviledge of going immediately to Heaven. The
Author of thoſe <hi>Queſtions and Anſwers,</hi> that go under
the name of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> maintains the ſame Opinion,
as you may ſee in the <hi>Anſwers</hi> to the LX, and LXXIV
<hi>Queſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that I may not unprofitably ſpend both Time and
Paper, in bringing in all the particular Paſſages, I ſay in
General, that both the <hi>Major Part,</hi> and alſo the moſt
Eminent Perſons among the Ancient Fathers held this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98310:147"/>
Opinion, either abſolutely, or at leaſt in part. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
and the Author of thoſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> we before
mentioned, which is a very Ancient Piece indeed, though
falſly fathered upon <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> it is clear, that <hi>Origen,
Lactantius, Victorinus,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,
Oecumenius, Aretas, Prudentius, Theophylact,</hi> St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi>
and, among the Popes, <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
XXII. were all of this Opinion, as is confeſſed by all;
neither was this ſo admirable and general Conſent of
theirs contradicted by any Declaration of the Church, for
the ſpace of Fourteen Hundred years; neither yet did any
one of the Fathers ſo far as we can diſcover, take upon
him to refute this Errour, as <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> and
St. <hi>Hierome</hi> did to refute the <hi>Millenaries;</hi> all the reſt of
the Fathers being either utterly ſilent, as to this Particular,
and ſo by this their ſilence going over in a manner into
the Opinion of the <hi>Major</hi> Part; or elſe contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with declaring ſometimes here and there in their
Books, that they believed that the Souls of the Saints
ſhould enjoy the ſight of God, till the Reſurrection, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
formally denying the other Opinion.</p>
               <p>But that which doth further ſhew, that this Opinion
is both very Ancient, and hath been alſo very Common
among the Chriſtians, is, becauſe that even at this day it
is believed, and defended by the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Church:
neither is there any of all thoſe, who make Profeſſion of
ſtanding to the Writings of the Fathers, as the Rule of
their Faiths, who have rejected it, ſave only
the <hi>Latines,</hi>

Common Conſent:</hi> and do but think, whether or no
he ſhould not have been hiſſed out by theſe Reverend
Fathers, as one that made the <hi>Truth,</hi> which is holy and
immutable, to depend upon the Authority of Men?
For, theſe men regarded not at all neither the Multitude,
nor the Antiquity, nor the Learning, nor the Sanctity of
the Authors of this fooliſh Opinion; but, finding it to
be falſe, without any more ado rejected it, as they thought
they had good Reaſon to do, and withal ordained the
contrary.</p>
               <p>Now I am verily perſwaded, that there are very few

no ſufficient Argument of the Truth of the ſame? But I
ſhall paſs on to the reſt.</p>

one of the moſt Eminent Biſhops of the whole Eaſtern
Church, held alſo in a manner the very ſame Opinion;
and that a long time too after the Determination of the
Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> as appeareth by the Epiſtle which he

touching the <hi>Neceſſity of the Euchariſt,</hi> hath been of
old maintained, not by three or four of the Fathers only,

                  <hi>Pererius</hi> hath informed us,
(and indeed the obſervation is obvious enough to any

thoſe Authors, who lived before St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time) that
all the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, and a conſiderable part alſo of the

was, the <hi>Fore ſight</hi> which God had, either of Mens <hi>Good

that I conceive we may, without troubling our ſelves any
further in making this envious Inquiry into the Errours
of the Fathers, conclude from what hath been already
produced, that ſeeing the Fathers have Erred in ſo many
Particulars, not on ſingly, but alſo many of them together;
Neither the private Opinion of each particular Father,

the whole Difference, betwixt the Greek and Latine
Churches, to be brought before the Judgment Seat of the
Fathers.</p>
               <p>And for as much as he knew, that unleſs the Judges did
all agree, and were of one Opinion, the <hi>Cauſe</hi> (eſpecially
in Matters of Religion,) neceſſarily remains undecided;
he ſtrongly labours to prove, that he hath all the Fathers
conſenting not only with him, but, (which is yet much
harder to prove) that they are all of the ſame Opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
among themſelves; inſomuch that he commands us,
when ever there appeareth any contrariety in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that we ſhould accuſe our own ignorance, rather
than blame them for contradicting each other.</p>
               <p>We may conclude therefore, from what is here laid
down by this Author, who was both as acute, and as
Learned a man, as any was at this Council, that to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Fathers capable of being the Judges of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
it is neceſſary that they ſhould be all
of the ſame Judgment and Opinion, in Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98310:150"/>
And certainly, this is a moſt clear Truth: For, if there be
any Contradiction amongſt them, or Diſſenting in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
they will leave our Controverſies more Perplexed,
rather than Decided; and in ſtead of Uniting, will rather
Diſtract us, and rend us into many Parts.</p>
               <p>That we may therefore be able to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth in this Particular, it will concern us
firſt of all to examine, whether that which <hi>Beſſarion</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
hereupon, be true alſo, or not; namely, That the
Opinions of the Fathers do never claſh one with the
other, touching the Points of our Religion.</p>
               <p>Now although this were ſo, yet would it not Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow from hence, that their Judgment muſt needs
be therefore <hi>Infallible;</hi> foraſmuch as even an Error
may, either by the Conſent of the ſeveral Parties, or by
Accident, or elſe by ſome other the like means, happen to
meet with an Unanimous Entertainment by ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>But now in caſe this ſhould prove to be falſe, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we may make this Infallible Concluſion, That we
ought to ſeek out for other Judges of our Controverſies,
than the Writings of the Fathers. We ſhall therefore
ſhew, by way of addition to the reſt of our Proofs, that
this Aſſertion of his is more Bold than True; and, that
there are very many Real Differences to be found among
the Ancient Fathers, in Matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>We have already touched before upon ſome of them,
by the bye onely, as lying in our way, ſpeaking of other
Matters, and therefore we ſhall onely lightly run them
over again; as namely, firſt of all, That Diſagreement
in Opinion of the moſt Ancient among the Fathers,
<hi>Juſtine Martyr, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> on the one ſide;
and <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus, Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98310:151"/>
but the other very courſely, and in downright Terms
reproving this their Conceit, as being an idle Fancy, fit
to be entertained by Little Children, and Old Women

               <p>The like to this was that Difference betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

               <p>S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and thoſe of his Faction held, That all
that Reprehenſion uſed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which
we find mentioned in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> was
onely a Feigned Buſineſs, purpoſely Acted betwixt the

S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> with thoſe of his Side, maintains

the contrary, and ſays, That the thing was Real, and was
meant heartily and ſeriouſly, and as it is related by S. <hi>Paul;</hi>
and that there was no Cunning, or Under-hand Dealing

                  </gap>, in diſcourſing of the <hi>Son:</hi>
Others again make uſe of it, without any ſcruple at all.</p>
               <p>I doubt very much, whether <hi>Beſſarion</hi> had ever ſeen the
<hi>Apologies</hi> and <hi>Invectives</hi> of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and of <hi>Ruffinus;</hi>
who were yet both of them Fathers, and of good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
too in the Church, both that of their own time,
and of the Ages following; although they were not both
of them of equal Eſteem. Neither do I believe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that Quarrel that there was betwixt <hi>Theophilus</hi>
and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> on the one part, and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on the
other.</p>
               <p>For certainly, their Carriage toward each other in this
their Debate, doth not ſhew them to have been ſo very
good Friends, and ſo well agreed upon the Point debated.
But now, to overthrow this Bold Aſſertion of his at once,
we need go no further than to the very Point it ſelf,
touching which he propoſed it. For, whom will he ever
be able to perſwade, that All the Fathers have written and
ſaid the very ſame things, touching the <hi>Proceſſion of the
Holy Ghoſt?</hi> It is evident, that ſometimes they will have
It to Proceed from the <hi>Son</hi> alſo; as S. <hi>Baſil</hi> by name hath
expreſſed himſelf, in that Paſſage of his, which is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Latins</hi> out of his Book againſt <hi>Eunomius;</hi>
(which Piece yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay is forged:) and as the
Fathers of the Weſtern Church have moſt expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themſelves in many places.<note place="margin">Conc. Flor. Act. 20. T. 4. Conc. p. 454.</note> But yet I cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

I ſhall not here meddle with thoſe other Authorities,
produced by the <hi>Greeks</hi> out of the Fathers; which their
Adverſaries put by as well as they can, oftentimes moſt
miſerably wreſting and ſtretching upon the Rack the
Words and Meaning of the Fathers. But that Paſſage

Holy Ghoſt <hi>proceedeth properly from the

and as proceeding from the</hi> Father, <hi>we
ſhall willingly agree with him, and ſhall
receive his Doctrine as Sound and Pious: But if he
mean, that the</hi> Holy Ghoſt <hi>hath its Subſiſtence from the</hi>
Son, <hi>or by the</hi> Son, <hi>we muſt then reject it, as Impious,
and Blaſphemous.</hi> He could not have thrown by this
Propoſition of S. <hi>Cyril</hi> more bluntly, or in courſer Terms:
And yet for all this ſo flat giving him the Lie, as it
were, and his ſo inſolent rejecting of an Opinion that
was then received by the Church, as the <hi>Latins</hi> pretend,

with the</hi> Father. Why did he not cry out
againſt him as an Heretick, as he many
times elſewhere doth, with much leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
if at leaſt you muſt needs have it granted you, that the
Opinion of the Church at that time was, That the <hi>H. Ghoſt</hi>
proceeded from the <hi>Son?</hi> Why did he not take it very ill
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98310:153"/>
at his hands, that he ſhould in ſo inſolent a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as Impious and Blaſphemous, a Propoſition that was
ſo Holy, and ſo True? Why did he not call the Whole
Church in, to be his Warrant for what he had ſaid, if ſo
be it had Really been the General Belief of the Church at
that time? And how comes it to paſs, that in ſtead of
all this, he rather returns ſo tame an Anſwer, as ſeems
rather to betray his own Cauſe, and ſomething alſo to
encline to the contrary Opinion of his Adverſary? For,
it is evident, that neither <hi>Theoderet,</hi> nor yet any of the
<hi>Modern Greeks</hi> ever held, That the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> was a
<hi>Stranger</hi> to, or was Unconcerned in the <hi>Son,</hi> ſeeing they
all confeſs, That theſe three, to wit, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are One and the ſame God, who is
Bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever ſhall but diligently conſider theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
(for we cannot ſtand any longer upon the Examination
of them) he cannot, in my Judgment, but confeſs that
the Church had not as yet declared it ſelf, or determined
any thing touching this Point; and, that theſe Doctors
ſpake herein each Man his own Private Opinion only, and
according as the Preſent Occaſion of Diſputation led him
to ſpeak; where you ſhall have them contradicting one
another, in like manner as is uſual in ſpeaking of things
not as yet throughly examined, or expreſly determined: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that it would grieve a Man to ſee how the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and the <hi>Latins</hi> toil and ſweat to no purpoſe, each of
them labouring to bring over the Fathers to ſpeak to

they ſeem to be but never ſo little ambiguous; and
ever and anon accuſing one another of having corrupted
the Ancients Writings, whenſoever they are found to
ſpeak expreſly againſt them: and when all is done,
leaving thoſe who either read or hear them without any
Prejudice, very much unſatisfied; whereas it had been
much more eaſie, to have honeſtly confeſſed at firſt, that
which is but too apparent, that the Fathers, as in this, ſo

the Church for having denied that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the <hi>Son;</hi> and that he afterwards publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
his Error, at the Council of <hi>Cbalcedon,</hi> where he

a Piece of <hi>Grecian Confidence,</hi> which ſhews more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than all the reſt, how much this Man was carried away
with his Paſſion, and the violence of his Affection to the
<hi>Latin</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>For, I beſeech you, in what Ancient Author had he
ever read, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> was, I do not ſay, Condemned,
or Excommunicated, but ſo much as Reproved, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
onely, for having maintained any Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
touching the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> We
have the Acts of the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he was
Excommunicated: We have the Letters of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi>
wherein he again received into the Communion of the
Church <hi>John</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
of which number <hi>Theodoret</hi> was the Chief.
We have the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> where <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
after ſome certain Cryings out of his Adverſaries againſt
him, was at length received by the whole Aſſembly as a
Catholick Biſhop, and was admitted to ſit amongſt them.
In which of all theſe Authentick Pieces is there ſo much
as one word ſpoken, touching this Opinion of his, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Point of the <hi>Proceeding</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
S. <hi>Cyril</hi> himſelf, that is to ſay, thoſe of his Party, did
not at all condemn what he ſaid, touching this Particular;
but he rather contented himſelf in excuſing, or, if you
pleaſe, in defending onely his own Opinion. The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for which <hi>Theodoret</hi> was queſtioned in the Councils
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> had nothing in the World
to do with this, touching the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi>
for, the Queſtion was onely there, touching the <hi>Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>

the Proceeding of the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt him;
and withal rejecting ſeveral things that were contained
in the <hi>Anathemas</hi> of S. <hi>Cyril.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now with what face could this Man tell us, after all
this, That <hi>Theodoret</hi> had been depoſed from his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
for having maintained an Erroneous Opinion
touching the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> But enough
of this.</p>
               <p>I would in the next place fain know, how this <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler
of Differences</hi> could compoſe that Debate betwixt
the DCXXX Fathers of the Council at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and
<hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and how he can reconcile the
XXVIII Canon of the one, with thoſe many Epiſtles
written by the other, touching this Point, to <hi>Anatolius</hi>
Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Marcianus,</hi>
and his Empreſs, to the Prelates who were there met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

the Fathers of this Council advancing the Throne of the

<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: Pope <hi>Leo</hi> in the mean time ſending out his
Thunderbolts againſt this <hi>Decree</hi> of theirs, and charging
them as guilty of a moſt inſufferable Injury offered him.
And when this our <hi>Conciliator</hi> ſhall have done his buſineſs
at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> if he pleaſe, he may paſs over into <hi>Africk,</hi>

now theſe honeſt Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the end

at all of theſe their Differences; but receive each of them,
with their own particular Canons, and Opinions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obliging them to any one <hi>Common Rule;</hi> doing this,
I believe, upon condition, that themſelves may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
by thoſe whom they thus admit, to receive any
more from them, than they ſhall think convenient. I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98310:155"/>
know no man, that would not at this rate readily admit
of, as <hi>Canon,</hi> all the Writings of the Fathers; provided
that he might but have liberty to take, or leave therein
what he thought good.</p>
               <p>So that we may very well from henceforth reſt ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, notwithſtanding <hi>Beſſarion's</hi> reſolution to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Fathers have not always been of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in matters of Religion: and that conſequently they
ought not to be received by us, as our Judges touching
the ſame.</p>
               <p>For, ſeeing that I find them contradicting each other,
in ſo many ſeveral Points of very great importance; how
ſhall I be aſſured, that they are all unanimouſly agreed,
touching thoſe Points which are now debated amongſt
us?</p>
               <p>Why may they not have had the ſame diverſity
of Opinion, touching the Point of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the

which we have before preſented to the Readers view;
which were of as great importance as theſe, and no leſs

               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> are as oppoſite in their

Hereticks:</hi> and ſo likewiſe in many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Why then ſhould we take ſo much pains, and trouble
our ſelves ſo to no purpoſe, in reconciling theſe men, and
making them ſpeak all the ſame thing?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:98310:155"/>
Why ſhould we ſo cruelly, and ſo uncivilly rack them
as we do, to make them all of one Opinion, and to ſay
the ſame things, whether they will or no; and, ſometimes
too againſt our own Conſcience; but, certainly, for the
moſt part, without any ſatisfaction to the Reader?</p>
               <p>Why ſhould we not rather honeſtly confeſs, that their
Opinions were alſo different, as well as their words?</p>
               <p>We make no ſcruple at all to confeſs, that they have
been of contrary Opinions, touching thoſe other Points
of Religion; which are not at all now controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us: How much greater harm, for Gods ſake,
would it be, if we ſhould confeſs, that they have not any
better agreed among themſelves, touching theſe Points
now in debate?</p>
               <p>But we ſhall not need to preſs this matter any further:
it is ſufficient for us that we have proved, that they were
of different Opinions in Point of Religion: ſo that it
clearly follows from hence, that we ought not to admit
of their Writings, as the proper Judges of our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
               <p>I have formerly touched, though very lightly only, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Diverſity of Opinion, and Contrariety, in their
Expoſitions upon the Scriptures, which yet is a buſineſs
of no very ſmall conſideration.</p>
               <p>For if we take them for our Judges, we ſhall neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
then have occaſion every minute of having recourſe
to them, touching the ſenſe of thoſe Paſſages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
about which we diſagree among our ſelves. If now
there be as great Contrarieties, and Difference in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
touching theſe things among them, as there is

               <p>It would be an endleſs Task, if I ſhould here go about

               <p>Thoſe that have a mind to ſee any more of them, may
have recourſe to ſome of our late <hi>Commentators,</hi> whoſe
uſual courſe is, to bring in all together the ſeveral Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations

Cardinal <hi>Tolet,</hi> upon St. <hi>John, Bened. Juſtinianus,</hi>
upon the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and others: where they

               <p>For as much therefore as we many times meet with
Contrariety of Judgment, as well in their Expoſitions of
the Scriptures, as in their Opinions, we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they are not of ſufficient Authority to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as the Supreme Judges of our Controverſies: that
Contradiction, which is often found amongſt them, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſhewing, that they are not <hi>Infallible Judges,</hi> ſuch
as it is requiſite that they ſhould be, for the making good

               <argument>
                  <p>Reaſon VI. That neither thoſe of the Church
of Rome, nor the Proteſtants do acknowledge
the Fathers for their Judges in Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but do both of them reject ſuch of their
Opinions, and Practices, as are not for their
Guſt. An Anſwer to two Objections, that may
be made againſt what hath been here delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THus far have we laboured to prove that the Writings
of the Fathers have not Authority enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
for to be received as <hi>Definitive Sentences</hi> paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Differences in Religion.</p>
               <p>Let us now in the laſt place ſee, how much they have in
reſpect of us. For although a Sentence of Judgment
ſhould be good, and valid in it ſelf, as being pronounced
by one who is a competent and lawful Judge, duly and
according to the Forms of Law; yet notwithſtanding
would not this ſerve to determine the Controverſie, if ſo
be the Authority of this Judge be denied by either of the
Parties, (unleſs, as it is in worldly Affairs, the Law be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with ſuch a Power, as is able to force thoſe that are
obſtinate to ſubmit to Reaſon:) for as much as the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is here touching Religion, which is a Holy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
thing, to the embracing whereof men ought to be
perſwaded, and not compelled, ſince force hath no place
here. For although perhaps they could compel men out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to render ſome ſuch reſpect to the Writings of the
Fathers, yet notwithſtanding would not this ſerve to make
any impreſſion of the Belief of the ſame, in the heart of
any one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98310:157"/>
The ſame Diviſions would ſtill remain in the minds of
men, which you are firſt of all to pull up by the roots, if
ever you intend to reconcile them to each other, and to
make them agree in Point of Religion.</p>
               <p>For the certain determination therefore of all Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of this nature, it is neceſſary that both Parties be
perſwaded, that the Judge, who is to pronounce Sentence
upon the ſame, hath as much Authority as it requiſite for
that purpoſe. Notwithſtanding therefore that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhould have clearly and poſitively pronounced what
they had thought, touching the Point in hand, which
yet they have not done, as we have proved before: Let
us ſuppoſe further, that they had been endued with all
thoſe qualities, which are requiſite for the rendring a man
fit to be a <hi>Supreme Judge,</hi> and from whom there can be
no Appeal, which yet is not ſo, as we have already clearly
proved: yet notwithſtanding would all this be to no
purpoſe, unleſs this Authority were acknowledged by
both Parties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is a Book which was written by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and is endued with ſo ſupreme an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as that every part of it ought to be believed. Yet
doth not this work any whit at all with a <hi>Pagan,</hi> becauſe
he doth not acknowledge any ſuch excellent worth to be
in it.</p>
               <p>In like manner is it, between the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> and
the <hi>Jew:</hi> neither can it decide the Differences betwixt
the <hi>Jews</hi> and us; not becauſe it is not of ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in it ſelf; but, becauſe it is not ſo to the <hi>Jew.</hi> And
indeed he were worthy to be laughed at, whoſoever ſhould
alledge, in diſputing againſt the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the Authority of
the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> or that of the <hi>New,</hi> for the bringing
of a <hi>Jew</hi> over to our Belief.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe therefore, that the Writings of the Fathers
were clear, upon our Queſtions: nay which is more, let
it be granted moreover (if you pleaſe,) that they were
written by Divine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and are of themſelves of a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98310:158"/>
full and undeniable Authority: I ſay ſtill, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
decide our Debates, if ſo be that either of the Parties
ſhall refuſe to acknowledge this great and admirable dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to be in them; much leſs if both Parties ſhall refuſe
to allow them to have this Priviledge. Let us now
therefore ſee, in what account the ſeveral Parties have the
Fathers; and, whether they acknowledge them as the
<hi>Supreme Judges</hi> of their Religion; or at leaſt as <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
whoſe definitive Sentence ought to ſtand firm and
inviolable. As for our Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> whom
their Adverſaries would fain perſwade, if they could, to
receive the Fathers for Judges in Religion; and to whom
conſequently they ought not, according to the Laws of a
legitimate Diſputation, to alledge for the proof of any
Point in debate, any other Principles, than what they do
allow of; it is evident, that they attribute to the Fathers
nothing leſs, than ſuch an Authority. For, in the <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Faith</hi> they declare,<note place="margin">Confeſſ. de foy des Egliſ. Ref. de Fran: Art. 4.</note> in the very beginning of it,
That they hold the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of their
Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as for all other <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writings,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they account them to be <hi>uſeful,</hi> yet nevertheleſs do
they not conceive, that a man may ſafely build any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith upon them.</p>
               <p>And indeed ſeeing that they believe, (as the tell you
immediately after,) that the <hi>Scripture</hi> containeth all
things neceſſary both for the ſervice of God, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of mens Souls, they have no need of any other
Judge, and ſhould in vain have recourſe to the Writings
of the Ancients; the Authority whereof, how great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, is ſtill much leſs, both in it ſelf, and alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of us, than that of the Bible.</p>
               <p>In the next place they ſeriouſly profeſs, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is to reform the Chriſtian Doctrine according to this
<hi>Rule;</hi> and to retain firmly what Articles of Faith ſoever
are therein delivered; and to reject conſtantly all thoſe,
that are not there found laid down, how high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
ſoever the Authority be, that ſhall reſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the one,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98310:158"/>
or eſtabliſh the other in the Belief of Men. <hi>It is not
Lawful</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for Men, nor yet for the Angels themſelves,
either to add to, or to diminiſh from, or to alter it; neither
may Antiquity, nor Cuſtoms, nor Multitude, nor Judgments,
nor Humane Wiſdom, nor Definitive Sentences, nor Edicts,
nor Decrees, nor Councils, nor Viſions, nor Miracles be brought
in oppoſition to it: but on the contrary rather, all other
things ought to be examined, regulated, and reformed by it.</hi>
Theſe be their own Words. If therefore they will not
depart from this their Belief, which is as it were the
Foundation and Key of their whole Reformation, they
cannot receive the Fathers who lived in the Second,
Third, and Fourth, and ſo in the following Centuries, as
<hi>Judges,</hi> nor yet Abſolutely and Simply as <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> in the
Points of Faith. For they all hold, That that Pure, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Holy Doctrine, which was taught and preached
by the Apoſtles at the beginning of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
over unto us by themſelves in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>
hath been by little and little altered and corrupted;
Time, which changeth all things, continually mixing
among it ſome Corruption or other; ſometimes a <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
or a <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometimes again ſome Nice
Obſervation; otherwhiles ſome Superſtitious Ceremony
or other; whilſt one building upon the Foundation with
<hi>Stubble,</hi> another with <hi>Hay,</hi> a third with <hi>Wood;</hi> the Body
ſeems at length, by little and little, to have become quite
another thing than it Anciently was; we having, in ſtead
of a Palace of Gold, and of Silver, a Houſe built up of
<hi>Plaiſter, Stone, Wood,</hi> and <hi>Mud,</hi> and the like pitiful Stuff.
In like manner, (ſay they) as we ſee, that Brooks of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the farther diſtant they are from their Springs, the
more Filth they contract, and the more doth their Water
loſe of its firſt Purity. And as a Man, the more he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in years, the more doth that Native Simplicity which
appeared in him in his Infancy, decay; his Body and his
Mind are changed, and he is ſo much altered by little and
little, through Study, Art, and Cunning, that at length he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98310:159"/>
ſeemeth to be clean another Man: In like manner (ſay

                  </gap>ared with <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And here they
preſently urge that notable Paſſage out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his
Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where he ſpeaks of a
Great <hi>Falling away,</hi> which then in his time began already
to work ſecretly and inſenſibly, but was not to break forth
till a long time after; as you ſee it is in all Great Things,
whether in Nature, or in the Affairs and Occurrences that
happen to Mankind, which are all conceived and hatched
ſlowly, and by degrees, and are ſometimes a whole Age
before they are brought forth.</p>
               <p>Now, according to this <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which, as I conceive,
is equally common to us of <hi>France,</hi> and all other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
whatſoever, the Doctrine of the Church muſt
Neceſſarily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have ſuffered ſome Alteration in the Second
Age of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by admitting the Mixture of ſome
New Matter into its Belief, and Policy: and ſo likewiſe
in the Third Age ſome other Corruption muſt neceſſarily
have got in; and ſo in the Fourth, Fifth, and the reſt that
follow; the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> continually loſing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Its Original Purity and Simplicity; and on
the other ſide ſtill contracting all along ſome new Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
till at length it came to the higheſt Degree of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption:
in which condition, they ſay, they found it;
and have now at laſt, by the Guidance of the Scriptures,
reſtored it to the ſelf-ſame State wherein it was at the
Beginning; and have, as it were, fixed it again upon its
true and proper Hinge, from whence, partly by the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and partly by the Fraud of Men, during the ſpace
of ſo many Ages together, it had by little and little been
removed.</p>
               <p>This therefore being their Opinion, they cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of, as the <hi>Rule</hi> of all their Doctrine, the Writings
of any of the Fathers, who lived from the Apoſtles time
down to ours, without betraying and contradicting
themſelves. For, according to what they maintain,
touching the Progreſs of Corruption in Religion, there
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98310:159"/>
hath been ſome Alteration in the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> both
in the Second, Third, and all the following Ages.</p>
               <p>And then again, according to what they conceive,
and believe of their own <hi>Reformation,</hi> their Doctrine
is the very ſame that was in the time of the Apoſtles, as
being taken immediately out of their Books. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould examine it by what the Fathers of the
Second Century believed, there muſt neceſſarily be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
found in the Doctrine of the Fathers, which is not
in theirs: and the Difference will be much greater, if
the Compariſon be made betwixt it, and the Doctrine of
the Third, Fourth, and the following Ages; in all which,
according to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the Corruption hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
encreaſed. For, if their Doctrines were in every
reſpect conformable to each other, and had in them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more nor leſs the one than the other, there muſt
neceſſarily then follow one of theſe two things; namely,
That either this Corruption, which they preſuppoſe to
be in the Belief, and Politie of the Church, is not that
<hi>Secret</hi> which worked in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time; or elſe, That
their <hi>Reformation</hi> is not the Pure and Simple Doctrine
of the Apoſtles: the Members of which Diviſion are
contradictory to thoſe two Poſitions, which, as we have
ſaid, they all of them unanimouſly maintain. So that
to avoid this Contradiction, it concerns them conſtantly
to perſevere in that which they profeſs is their Belief,
in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith:</hi> to wit, That there are no
Eccleſiaſtical Writings whatſoever, that are of ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Authority, as that a Man may ſafely build upon them,
and make them the <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>Faith:</hi> and, That the Holy
<hi>Scripture</hi> is the onely <hi>Rule</hi> by which all theſe things are
to be examined.</p>
               <p>And this is that which they All agree upon (as far as
I have either read, or known;) as any Man may ſee in the
Books of <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Melancthon, Luther, Beza,</hi> and
the reſt; who all relie upon the Authority of the
Scriptures onely, and admit not of any part of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98310:160"/>
of the Fathers, as a ſufficient Ground whereon to
build any Article of their Belief.</p>
               <p>It is true, I confeſs, that ſome of their Firſt Authors,
as namely, <hi>Bucer, Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>J. Jewell</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Salisbury,</hi> and in a manner all the Later Writers alſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Teſtimonies of the Fathers; but (if you but
mark it) it is onely by way of Confutation, and not of
Eſtabliſhing any thing: They do it onely to overthrow
the Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
their Own. For, though they hold, That the
Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is not ſo Pure as that of the
<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> yet do they withal believe, that it is much
Purer, than that which is at this day taught by the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> the Purity of Doctrine having continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
and the Impurity of it encreaſed, in ſuch ſort, as
that the further they are removed from the Time of the
Apoſtles, the nearer they approach (as they ſay) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the afore-mentioned <hi>Falling away,</hi> ſpoken of by
S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> therefore allow the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
onely for the True Foundation of their Faith; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
do they account the Writings of the Fathers
to be Neceſſary alſo, and of good uſe unto them; firſt of
all, in the Proving this <hi>Decay,</hi> which they ſay hath hapned
in <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and ſecondly, for the making it appear,
that the Opinions which their Adverſaries now maintain,
were not in thoſe days brought into any Form, but were
as yet onely in their Seeds.</p>
               <p>As for example, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not as yet
an Article of Faith; notwithſtanding that long ago they
did, innocently, and not foreſeeing what the Iſſue might
prove to be, believe ſome certain things, out of which,
being afterwards licked over, by paſſing through divers
ſeveral Languages, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was at length made
up.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the <hi>Supremacy</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> had at that time
no place in the belief of Men: although thoſe ſmall
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98310:160"/>
Threds, and Root-ſtrings, from whence this Vaſt and
Wonderful Power firſt ſprung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> long ſince appeared in the
World.</p>
               <p>And the like may be ſaid of the greateſt part of thoſe
other Points, which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not by any
means receive. And that this is their Reſolution and
Senſe, appears evidently by thoſe many Books which they
have written upon this Subject, wherein they ſhew
Hiſtorically the whole Progreſs of this <hi>Decay</hi> in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>
as well in its <hi>Faith,</hi> as in its <hi>Polity,</hi> and <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly this their Deſign ſeemeth to be very ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and ſatisfactory. For, ſeeing that they propoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Poſitively, and as an Article of Faith, Neceſſary to
Salvation, which may not eaſily and plainly be proved
out of the Scripture; they have no need to make uſe of
any other Principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Demonſtration of the
Truth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, ſeeing that thoſe Poſitive Articles of
Faith which they believe, are in a manner all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and confeſſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we have
ſaid before in the Preface to this Treatiſe, there is no
need of troubling a Mans ſelf to prove the ſame, thoſe
things which both Parties are agreed upon, being never
to be proved, but are always preſuppoſed in all Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, if any one have a mind to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
what the Belief of the <hi>Fathers</hi> hath been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſaid Articles; it is an eaſie matter for them to
make it appear, that they alſo believed all of them, as
well as themſelves: as, for Example. <hi>That there is a God,
a Chriſt, a Salvation, a Sacrament of Baptiſm, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Euchariſt,</hi> and the like Truths; the greateſt
part whereof we have formerly ſet down, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe other Articles which are propoſed to
the World, beſides all theſe, by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98310:161"/>
ſufficient for them, that they are able to anſwer the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which are brought to prove them, and to make
it by this means appear, that they have not any ſure
Ground at all, and conſequently neither may, nor ought
to be received into the Faith of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And this is
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> make of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
making it appear to the World (out of them) that
they did not hold the ſaid Articles, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth at this day.</p>
               <p>So that their alledging of the Fathers to this purpoſe
onely, and indeed their Whole Practice in theſe Diſputes,
declare evidently enough, that they conceive not the
Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſo perfectly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
conformable to that of Antiquity; eſpecially of the
Four or Five Firſt Ages: which accords very well with
their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> touching the Corruption of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Doctrine: But yet no Man may conclude from hence,
That they do allow of the Authority of the Fathers as
a ſufficient Foundation to ground any Article of Faith
upon; for this is repugnant both to their Doctrine, and
to the Proteſtation which they upon all occaſions make
expreſly to the contrary. So that I cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
wonder at the Proceeding of ſome of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Authors, who in their Diſputations with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi>
endeavour to prove the Articles of their Faith by
Teſtimonies brought out of the Fathers; whereas the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> never go about to make good their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but onely to overthrow thoſe of their Adverſaries,
by urging the Fathers Teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>For ſeeing that they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
That the Church neither hath, nor can poſſibly err
in Points of Faith; and, That its Belief in Matters of
Faith hath always been the ſame that it is at this day; it
is ſufficient for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> to ſhew, by comparing the
Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers with that of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there is great Difference betwixt them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth this in any wiſe bind them to believe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98310:161"/>
whatſoever the Fathers believed; it being evident,
according to their <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that there may have ſome
Errors crept into their Belief; though certainly not ſuch,
nor ſo groſs ones, as have been ſince entertained by the
Church in the Ages ſucceeding.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude therefore, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not, neither in the Fathers, nor in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
any ſo Abſolute Authority, as renders them capable
of being received by us, as our Supreme Judges in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion, and ſuch from whom no Appeal can be
made.</p>
               <p>Whence it will follow, That although the Fathers might
really perhaps have ſuch an Authority; yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
could not their Definitive Sentence put an end to any
of our Controverſies: and therefore it concerns the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have recourſe to ſome other way of
Proof, if they intend to prevail upon their Adverſaries
to receive the aforeſaid Articles.</p>
               <p>But what will you ſay now, if we make it appear to
you, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth not allow that
the Fathers have any ſuch Authority? I ſuppoſe, that if
we are able to do this, there is no Man ſo perverſe, as not
to confeſs, That this Proceeding of theirs, in grounding
their Articles of Faith upon the Sayings of the Fathers,
is not onely very Inſufficient, but very Inconvenient alſo.
For, how can it ever be endured, that a Man that would
perſwade you to the Belief of any thing, ſhould for that
purpoſe make uſe of the Teſtimony of ſome ſuch Perſons
as neither you nor himſelf believe to be Infallibly True,
and ſo fit to be truſted? Let us now therefore ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> really have themſelves
ſo great an Eſteem of the Fathers, as they would be
thought to have, by this their Proceeding, or not.</p>
               <p>Certainly ſeveral of the Learned of that Party have,
upon divers occaſions, let us ſee plain enough, that they
make no more account of them, than the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do.
For, whereas theſe require, That the Authority of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98310:162"/>
                  <hi>Fathers</hi> be grounded upon that of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and
therefore receive nothing that they deliver, as Infallibly
True, unleſs it be grounded upon the Scripture, paſſing
by, or rejecting whatſoever they propoſe, either beſides,
or contrary to the Senſe of the Scripture: the other in
like manner will have the Judgment of the Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon that of the <hi>Church</hi> in preſent being in every
Age; and approve, paſs by, or condemn all ſuch Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of theirs, as the Church either approveth, paſſeth by,
or condemneth. So that although they differ in this,
That the one attributeth the <hi>Supremacy</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
and the other to the <hi>Preſent Church</hi> of their Age; yet
notwithſtanding they both agree in this, That both the
one and the other of them equally deprive the Fathers
of the ſame. Inſomuch that they both of them ſpend
their time unprofitably enough, whilſt they trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to plead their Cauſe before this <hi>Inferiour Court,</hi>
where the wrangling and cunning Tricks of the Law
have ſo much place; where the <hi>Judgments</hi> are hard to be
got, and yet harder to be underſtood; and, when all is
done, are not Supreme; but are ſuch as both Parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they may lawfully appeal from: whereas they
might, if they pleaſed, let alone theſe troubleſom and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Beatings about, and come at the firſt before the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Tribunal,</hi> whether it be that of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or
of the <hi>Church;</hi> where the <hi>Suits</hi> are not ſo long, and
where the <hi>Subtilty</hi> of <hi>Pleading</hi> is of much leſs uſe;
where the Sentences alſo are more clear and expreſs, and
(which is the Chiefeſt thing of all) ſuch as we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
from. But that we may not be thought to impoſe
this Opinion upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> unjuſtly, let us
hear them ſpeak themſelves.</p>

the Church, although perhaps it differ from
that which is given by the whole Current
of the Holy Doctors; I ſhall deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that they would not too haſtily reject it,
but that they would rather cenſure charitably
of it. Let them remember to give every
man his due: there are none but the Authors

ſuch Authority, as that we ought to

for others, (<hi>ſaith</hi> St. Auguſtine) of how great
Sanctity, and Learning ſo ever they may have

               <p>Let no man therefore reject a new Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that it is contrary to what the Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

whoſe truſt the Diſpenſation of the Divine
Myſteries hath been committed. We are
therefore to hear him, who is to us inſtead of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98310:165"/>
God, in things that concern God, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Certainly, for my own part (that I may
ſpeak my mind freely) in things that belong
to the Myſteries of Faith, I had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one ſingle</hi> Pope, <hi>than a thouſand</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines,
Hieromes, <hi>or</hi> Gregories, <hi>that I may
not ſpeak of</hi> Richards, Scotuſſes, <hi>and</hi> Williams.
<hi>For, I believe, and know, that the</hi> Pope <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Erre, in matters of Faith, becauſe that the
Authority, and Right of determining all ſuch
things, as are at all Points of Faith, reſides in
the</hi> Pope. This Paſſage may ſeem to ſome,
to be both a very bold, and a very indiſcreet
one: but yet whoſoever ſhall but examine
the thing ſeriouſly, and as it is in it ſelf, and
not as it is in its outward appearances only,
which are contrived for the moſt part only to amuſe the
ſimpler ſort of people. I am confident he will find, that
this Author hath both moſt ingenuouſly, and moſt truly
given the world an account, what Eſteem the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> hath of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> For, ſeeing that theſe men
maintain that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and they confeſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
that the <hi>Fathers</hi> may have erred: who ſeeth not, that
they ſet the <hi>Pope</hi> very much above the <hi>Fathers?</hi> Neither
may it be here replied, that they do not all of them
hold, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Infallible.</hi> For, beſides that thoſe
among them, who do contradict this Opinion, are both
the leaſt, and the leaſt conſiderable part alſo of the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe very men attribute to the preſent <hi>Church</hi>
in being, in every Age, this Right of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which
they will not allow the Pope: inſomuch that a <hi>Council,</hi>
now called together, is, according to their account, of
much greater Authority than the ancient <hi>Fathers.</hi> So that
there is no more difference at all, betwixt theſe men
and the fore-mentioned Italian Biſhop, ſave only that
whereas they will have the Authority of the ancient
<hi>Fathers</hi> to ſubmit to the whole Body of <hi>Modern Biſhops</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:98310:165"/>
aſſembled in a General <hi>Council;</hi> He will have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to be leſs, than that of a ſingle <hi>Pope</hi> alone. All
that can be found fault with in that ſpeech of his, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that his Hyperbolical way of Expreſſion, of a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Auguſtines, Hieromes,</hi> and <hi>Gregories;</hi> all which joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, he, in too diſdainful a manner, caſts down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the feet of one ſingle <hi>Pope.</hi> But this height of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
may be ſomewhat excuſed in him, conſidering
that ſuch Exceſſes as theſe, are very ordinary with all high
and free-ſpirited Perſons.</p>
               <p>But the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf will be
able to inform us more truly and clearly, what eſteem
they have of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> For, if we ought to ſtand to the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and not to depart from any thing that they have
Authorized; nor to Ordain any thing that they were
ignorant of, how comes it to paſs, that we at this day ſee
ſo many ſeveral Obſervations and Cuſtoms, which were
obſerved by the Ancients, now quite laid aſide? And
whence is it, that we find in Antiquity no mention at all
of many things, which are now in great requeſt amongſt
us? There are as it were three principal Parts in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
namely, Points of <hi>Belief,</hi> of <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
We ſhall run them over lightly all three, and
ſo far as is neceſſary only for our preſent purpoſe; that ſo
we may let the world ſee, that in every one of theſe three
parts they have both aboliſhed, and eſtabliſhed very many
things, expreſly againſt the Authority of the <hi>Ancients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, we have formerly given the
Reader ſome <hi>Taſts</hi> only, in the preceding Chapters. For
we have ſeen, that the Opinion of the greateſt part of the
<hi>Ancient Church,</hi> touching the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> till the
time of the Reſurrection, which beſides is at this day
alſo maintained by the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> was condemned,
not much above two hundred years ſince, by the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Council of <hi>Florence;</hi> and a quite contrary
Belief there eſtabliſhed, as an Article of the Chriſtian
Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:98310:166"/>
We have ſeen beſides, that the Opinion of the Fathers
of the Primitive Church, and even down as far as to the
end of the ſixth Century after our Saviour Chriſt, and
afterwards, was, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was as neceſſary to
Salvation, as <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and that conſequently it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be adminiſtred to <hi>little Children.</hi> And yet for all
this, the Council of<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>Trent</hi> hath condemned this Opinion,
as an Error in Faith; withal Anathematizing, by a Canon
made expreſly for that purpoſe, all thoſe who ever ſhould
maintain the ſame. <hi>Let him be Accurſed</hi> (ſay they) <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhall ſay, that the</hi> Euchariſt <hi>is neceſſary for little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
before they are come to years of diſcretion.</hi> Only,
that the <hi>Fathers</hi> might not take offence hereat, as having
ſo fearful an Affront put upon them; theſe men have
endeavoured to perſwade both them and others, that
they never did believe that, which themſelves have moſt
clearly, and in expreſs Terms proteſted that they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as we have before made it appear: which is, to
double the injury upon them, rather than to make them
any reparations for it; ſeeing that they deal with them
now, not as <hi>Hereticks</hi> only, but as <hi>Fools</hi> alſo; whom a
man may at pleaſure perſwade that they do not believe
that which they really do believe.</p>
               <p>We have abundantly heard out of St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s mouth,
how that the Opinion of the <hi>Chilaſts</hi> was of old main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
by ſeveral of the <hi>Ancient</hi> Fathers; which yet is
now condemned as an Error in Faith. And indeed the
number of theſe kind of differences in Opinions is almoſt
infinite.</p>
               <p>It was accounted no Error in thoſe days to believe,
that the Soul was derived from the <hi>Father</hi> down to the
<hi>Son,</hi> according to the ordinary courſe of Generation: but
this Opinion would now be accounted an Hereſie.</p>

               <p>We have already told you here before, That the Church

him to declare himſelf any otherwiſe, or to give them
any Satisfaction touching this Point.</p>
               <p>And indeed, we might reckon up very many the like
Differences betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and the <hi>Ancient</hi>

holdeth, That the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Opinions of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>

which Cuſtom of theirs is of very late ſtanding among

Point, let him be Accurſed?</hi> For, it ſeemeth
to be no very eaſie matter, to be able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
the <hi>Modern Church,</hi> without condemning the <hi>Ancient,</hi>
ſeeing their Practices have been manifeſtly contradictory
to each other; the <hi>Modern</hi> Church forbidding that, which
the <hi>Ancient</hi> permitted; and the <hi>Ancient</hi> Church ſeeming
to have expreſly forbid that; which the <hi>Modern</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
How can you ſay, that the one had juſt Reaſons for
what it did; unleſs you withal grant, that the other in
doing the contrary, had either no Reaſon at all, or elſe
but very unjuſt ones? ſeeing it is moſt clear, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the World, nor the Times are any whit changed,
within this two hundred years, from what they were
before. For, it is impoſſible for any man to alledge any
Reaſon, for the Practice of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> which ſhould
not in like manner have obliged the <hi>Ancients:</hi> nor
again to produce any Reaſon for the contrary Practice
of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> which doth not in like manner oblige
the <hi>Moderns.</hi> So that of neceſſity, either the one or the
other of them muſt needs have been guilty either of
<hi>Errour,</hi> or at leaſt of <hi>Negligence,</hi> and of Ignorance.
We may very well therefore conclude, that the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing it believes it ſelf to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> manifeſtly
in this particular condemned the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> as
guilty of Ignorance, or of Negligence at the leaſt;
which, in my Judgment, ſeems not ſo well to become
thoſe perſons, who do nothing elſe but continually preach
unto us the <hi>Honour of Antiquity.</hi> But here now will all
the true Honourers of Antiquity have as good ſport as
can be. For, as for thoſe <hi>Reaſons,</hi> by which the Fathers
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98310:173"/>
of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> were induced to make the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<hi>Decree;</hi> how (will they ſay) may we be able
to come to the knowledge, whether they were <hi>juſt</hi> or not;
ſeeing that they themſelves produce none at all? Whereas
the Reaſons, which moved the Ancients to do as they did,
and which you have ſet down at large in a certain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
printed at <hi>Paris,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inter Opera Caſſand. pag. 1019.</note> at the end of <hi>Caſſanders</hi> Works,
are very ſolid, and clear, and, in my judgment, very full
both of Wiſdom and of Charity. But we ſhall not need to
enter any further into this Conteſtation: it is ſufficient for
my purpoſe, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in doing thus, hath
manifeſtly aboliſhed a very ancient Cuſtom in the
Church.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe Ceremonies, which were practiſed by the
Fathers in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they have ſaid

be Regularly finiſhed, by the Colledge of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
And thus have they by this one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ſhot
beaten down the Authority of the
Fathers, and of the Primitive Church; who
always allowed to the faithful <hi>People</hi> ſome
ſhare in the Elections of their Paſtors: neither hath this
Cuſtom been able ever ſince to lift up its head again; the
People being (as every man knows) now, more than
ever, defrauded of this their Right, and having not the

that is.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>People</hi> Anciently had their voice in the
Election of their <hi>Paſtors;</hi> ſo probably alſo they had the
like in all other Affairs of Importance, that hapned in
the Church. There happening in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time a very
great Perſecution, many, who had been forced to yield
by the cruelty of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> being afterwards touched
with a ſenſe of their fault, deſired to return to the
Church again: but yet to avoid the ſhame, and the
length, and rigour of thoſe Penances, which were
uſually impoſed upon all ſuch Offenders, the greateſt part
of them begged of their <hi>Confeſſors</hi> to be favourably
dealt withal, and corrupted their Prieſts, that ſo
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98310:176"/>
they might be received again into the Communion of the
Church, without undergoing <hi>Canonical Penance.</hi> St.
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was a ſtrict Obſerver of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> wrote
many things againſt this Abuſe; by which it evidently
appeareth, that the <hi>People</hi> had their Right alſo in the

<hi>Should give an account of what they had done,

Where are thoſe <hi>Eight,</hi> thoſe <hi>Ten,</hi> thoſe <hi>Twenty</hi> years of

All this whole Courſe of <hi>Penance,</hi> ſome kind of account

wherein no part of the Penance appears at all to the

other kinds of <hi>Penalties,</hi> which are indeed very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
and advantageous to the temporal Eſtate of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but are moſt pernicious for the Souls
of Offenders; ſuch as are their <hi>Interdictions,</hi> when, for
the offence (and that oftentimes too, rather a pretended,
than a true one,) of one, or two ſingle perſons, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of a <hi>Corporation,</hi> They will Excommunicate a whole
<hi>State,</hi> wherein there are perhaps many millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
depriving them of the benefit of partaking of the
Holy <hi>Sacraments;</hi> which are the means, by which the
Grace and the Life of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is communicated unto
poor Mortals: an Example of which kind of proceeding
I remember to have been practiſed by them, ſince my
time, againſt the State of <hi>Venice.</hi> In what <hi>Code</hi> of the
Ancient Church can you find, where any ſuch ſtrange
kind of puniſhment was ever inſtituted, as that for the
offence of a few, many millions of Souls ſhould be
damned? How can you call that Power <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> that
puniſheth in this manner; ſeeing that the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi>
Power was given for <hi>Edification,</hi> and not for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>

               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Point with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Author of the Latine Church, whom <hi>Pamelius</hi> (as we

been a Perſecutor of Hereticks; who yet was a man,
that would not allow a Chriſtian ſo much as to draw a
ſword, neither in war againſt a Publick Enemy, nor yet in
diſcharging the Office of a Magiſtrate upon Offenders;
whom all Civil Laws whatſoever puniſh with death.</p>
               <p>Let us now therefore ſee what he ſays, touching Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

<hi>whether this be not to add to the Crime of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion,
to take away the Liberty of Religion,

by not ſuffering him to worſhip, whom he

he would not. There is none, no not among
men, that takes pleaſure in being ſerved by any
againſt their will.</hi> And ſome few Chapters

ſeemeth very unjuſt, that Free-men ſhould
be conſtrained to do ſacrifice againſt their

God, a willing heart is required.</hi> And in
another Book, but ſpeaking of the ſame
thing, he ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>It is a Point of Humane
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98310:182"/>
Right, and a Natural Power that every man
hath to worſhip that which he thinks fit. The
Religion of another man neither hurteth, nor
profiteth any one. Neither is it indeed the
part of Religion; to compel Religion; which
ought to be entertained willingly, and not by
force; foraſmuch as Sacrifices themſelves are
required only from willing minds.</hi> Upon
which paſſage of his <hi>Pamelius</hi> gives us a marvellous, rare
gloſs, ſaying; That we ought not indeed directly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
men to our Religion, but yet we may puniſh them, if
they will not change their opinion. Certainly he thinks
it is no <hi>Compelling</hi> of a man, to force him to do a thing
under <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi> Let any man that can, reconcile
the Practice of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and the Popes <hi>Thunderbolts</hi>

What is become of thoſe Ancient Laws?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 33. Ub; religio? ubi veneratio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus debita à vobis? Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, victu, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructu, ſenſu ipſo denique ſermone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avis renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis: laudatis ſemper anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem, &amp; nove de die vivitis.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. Where
is the Religion? Where is the Reverence which is due from
you to your Anceſtors? You have renounced your Fore-Fathers,
both in your Habit, Apparel, Manner of Life,
Opinion, and in your very Speech alſo. You are always
crying up Antiquity, yet every day your ſelves take up a
New manner of Life.</hi> Whether therefore they of the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have upon Juſt Grounds dealt thus
with the Ancients, or not; it ſerves my turn however to
conclude, That by this their Proceeding they have given
us a ſufficient Teſtimony, that they do not acount their
Authority <hi>Supreme</hi> in Matters of Religion. And if ſo,
what Reaſon have they to urge it for ſuch, againſt the
<hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Seeing they have weakned the Authority
of ſo many of thoſe Judgments, touching Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which have been given by the Fathers, how can
they expect that their Authority ſhould paſs for Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
in any one? Let us ſuppoſe for inſtance, that they
held, that there was ſuch a Place as <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But by
your Favour, (will the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſay) if you have found
their Belief to be ſo erroneous touching the <hi>State of the
Souls</hi> of Departed Saints, till the Day of the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
why would you impoſe upon me a Neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
to what they held touching <hi>Purgatory?</hi> The
Laws of Diſputation ought to be equal; and therefore
if you, by examining this Opinion of the Fathers by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> have found it to be Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
why will you not give us leave to try that other,
touching <hi>Purgatory,</hi> by the ſame Touch-ſtone? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhould we but ſpeak the Truth, it is the plaineſt mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the World that can be, to cry out, as theſe Men do
continually, <hi>The Fathers, The Fathers,</hi> and to write
ſo many whole Volumes upon this Subject, as they have
done; after they have ſo dealt with them, as you have
ſeen. And if it be here objected, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>
themſelves do alſo reject many of thoſe Articles which
we have before ſet down; we anſwer, That this is nothing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98310:183"/>
at all to the purpoſe; foraſmuch as they take the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
and not the <hi>Fathers,</hi> for the Rule of their Faith;
neither do they preſs any Man to receive any thing from
the hands of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> unleſs it be grounded upon the
<hi>Word of God.</hi> And if, laſtly, you ſay, That the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> hath no place, nor is at all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in the Points before ſet down, becauſe that the <hi>Churcb</hi>
hath otherwiſe determined touching the ſame; this is
clearly to grant us that which we would have, namely,
That the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> is not <hi>Supreme.</hi> And
as for the <hi>Church,</hi> that is to ſay, how far the Authority of
it extends in theſe things, this is a New Queſtion to be
diſputed of, which I ſhall not meddle withal at this time.
Only thus much I ſhall ſay, That what Authority ſoever
you allow it, whether Little, or Much, you will ſtill
find, that it will very hardly be able to do any thing,
touching the Deciſion of our preſent Controverſies; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as you can never be able to make any uſe or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of this Poſition, till ſuch time as you are aſſured, both
<hi>What,</hi> and <hi>Where</hi> the <hi>Church is,</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
ſtiffly deny, That it is That which appears at this
day at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the greateſt Difficulty of all conſiſting
in the Demonſtrating this unto them. For, if they did
but once believe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the <hi>True
Church,</hi> they would immediately joyn themſelves with
it; ſo that there would not henceforth be need of any
further Diſpute.</p>
               <p>We ſhall here conclude therefore, That the Alledging
the Teſtimonies of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> upon the Differences that
are at this day in Religion, is no proper Courſe for the
Deciſion of them, ſeeing it is no eaſie matter to diſcover
what their Judgment hath been touching the ſame, by
reaſon of the many Difficulties that we meet with in the
Writings of the Ancients: neither is it of ſo ſufficient
Authority in it ſelf, as that we may ſafely build our Belief
upon it; ſince the <hi>Fathers</hi> themſelves have been alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Errour: neither, laſtly, is it of any force, either
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98310:183"/>
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nſt the one, or the other Party; ſeeing that they both
regulate, and examine the <hi>Opinions, Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
of the <hi>Ancients;</hi> the One by the Rule of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
and the Other by that of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here I find, that upon this Concluſion, Two
Queſtions may ariſe. For, ſeeing that the alledging
the <hi>Fathers</hi> is not ſufficient for the deciding of thoſe
Points that are now in debate amongſt us; it may
be demanded, in the firſt place, What other Courſe
we ought to take, for the attaining to the Truth in
theſe Controverſies? And then ſecondly, How, and in
what Caſes the Writings of the Fathers may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto us? Now although both theſe Queſtions are
without the compaſs of our preſent Deſign, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
in regard they ſo nearly border upon
it, we ſhall in the laſt place ſay a word or two in
anſwer of them.</p>
               <p>As for the Firſt, it would be a hard matter, in my
Judgment, to find out a better way for Satisfaction
herein, than that which one <hi>Scholarius,</hi>
a <hi>Greek,</hi> who is very highly accounted
of by thoſe who printed the General
Councils at <hi>Rome,</hi> hath propoſed. This
Learned Man, in a certain Oration of

Fathers of the Council at <hi>Nice</hi> after this manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> upon the True Belief touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Son of God.</hi> and then applying all this to

                  <hi>That the
Scripture ſaith clearly and expreſly, that
the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that this is agreed upon by both
Sides, both by the Greeks, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins:</hi>
But that It hath not ſo expreſly
declared it ſelf, whether the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceed alſo
from the <hi>Son,</hi> or not: and that this is the thing now
in Queſtion, the <hi>Latins</hi> affirming it, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> on
the other ſide denying it.<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>We ought
therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to prove this, from
ſome other things which are there more
clearly delivered:</hi> Which he afterwards
performeth, and indeed, in my Judgment, very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
and Happily; proving this Doubtful Point out
of other Paſſages that are more Clear. And this was
the Judgment of this Great Perſon; which will not
give any offence to thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it came from one that was of their Side. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I ſee what could have been ſpoken more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally.
And indeed, this is the Courſe that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in all Sciences whatſoever: If thy Adverſary
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98310:184"/>
doubt of the truth of what thou propoſeſt, thou art
to prove it by ſuch <hi>Maxims</hi> as are acknowledged and
allowed of by him, making good that which is
<hi>Doubtful,</hi> by that which is <hi>Certain;</hi> and clearing that
which is <hi>Obſcure,</hi> by that which is <hi>Evident.</hi> And this
is the Rule that I conceive we ought to walk by,
in the Diſputes that are betwixt us at this day. The
<hi>Word of God</hi> is our <hi>Common Book;</hi> let us therefore
ſearch into It, for that upon which we may ground
our own Belief, and by which we may overthrow
the Opinion of our Adverſary. As for example, it
is there ſaid clearly and expreſly, That that which
our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> took at his Laſt Supper, was <hi>Bread:</hi>
and herein we All agree. But it is not at all there
expreſſed, whether this <hi>Bread</hi> were afterward <hi>changed,</hi>
or <hi>annihilated,</hi> or not. And this is now the <hi>Queſtion</hi>
in Diſpute amongſt us. We ought therefore (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Counſel of <hi>Scholarius</hi>) to prove this by
ſome other things which are there delivered clearly.
And if thou doſt this, thou haſt got the Victory: If
not, I do not at all ſee why or how thou canſt oblige
any one to believe it.</p>
               <p>In like manner, the Scripture telleth us, in as expreſs
Terms as may be, That our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded
His Apoſtles to Take and Eat, and to Drink, that which
He gave them in Celebrating the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> But It doth
not at all ſay, that he commanded them to Offer the
ſame in <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> either Then, or Afterwards. And this
is now the <hi>Queſtion:</hi> which it concerns thoſe of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they will have us believe it, to prove
by ſome other things, which are clearly and expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Scripture in like manner ſaith expreſly, That <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt God and Man: and,
That He is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and, That He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
us by His <hi>Blood</hi> from our Sins. Now in all this
both Sides are fully agreed. But it is not at all there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98310:185"/>
That the <hi>Departed Saints</hi> are <hi>Mediators;</hi> and, That
the <hi>Pope</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and, That our Souls
are in part cleanſed from their Sins by the Fire of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>
And herein lies the Controverſie betwixt us. The
Learned <hi>Scholarius</hi> his Opinion herein would now be, that
certainly thoſe who propoſe theſe Points as Articles of
Faith, deduce, and collect them from ſome things which
are clearly delivered in the Scriptures: for otherwiſe
they are not to be preſſed, as Truths. And although that
in matters of Religion, or indeed in any other things of
Importance, a Man may very well be excuſed for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
a thing, when there appears not any ſuch Reaſon
as may oblige him to believe it; yet notwithſtanding, if
thoſe who reject the Articles now debated betwixt us,
have a mind to go further yet, and to prove poſitively the
Falſeneſs of them; you ſee this Author hath laid them
down the way by which they are to proceed. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
thoſe very abſurd, that require at your hands
that you ſhould ſhew them all things expreſly delivered in
the Scripture: and this ought principally to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of <hi>Negative Propoſitions,</hi> of which no Science
giveth you any certain account: foraſmuch as to go about
to number them all up, would be both an infinite, and alſo
an unprofitable, uſeleſs piece of Work. It is ſufficient
to deliver the <hi>Poſitive Truth.</hi> For, as whatſoever rightly
followeth thereupon, is <hi>True;</hi> in like manner, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
claſheth with, or contradicteth the ſame, is <hi>Falſe.</hi>
wouldſt thou therefore demonſtrate thoſe Propoſitions
that are preſſed upon thee, to be Falſe? Do but compare
them with thoſe things that are clearly and expreſly
delivered in the Scripture. And if thou findeſt them
contrary to any thing there ſet down, receive them not
by any means. As for example, If a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himſelf with having anſwered all thoſe Reaſons
which are brought to prove that there is ſuch a Place as
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſhall yet deſire to go further, and to make it
appear, that the Opinion is Falſe; he is in this caſe to have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98310:185"/>
recourſe to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to examine it by thoſe
things which are there clearly and expreſly delivered,
touching the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> after it is departed this
Life, and touching the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of the <hi>Expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and the like. And if the Opinion of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory</hi>
be found to contradict any thing there delivered,
then (according to <hi>Scholarius) it ought not to be received
by any means.</hi> But the brevity which we propoſed to
our ſelves in this Diſcourſe, permitteth us not to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this Point any further.</p>
               <p>As for the Second Queſtion, it is no very hard matter
to reſolve it. For, although we do not indeed allow any
<hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> to the Writings of the
Fathers, yet do we not therefore preſently account them
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs.</hi> If there were nothing of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> in Religion, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what was alſo <hi>Infallible,</hi> we ſhould have but little
good of any <hi>Humane Writings.</hi> Thoſe who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our own Age, or a little before, are of no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at all, either againſt the one or the other Party. Yet
notwithſtanding do we both read them, and alſo reap
much benefit from them. How much more advantage
then may we make, by ſtudying the Writings of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
whoſe Piety and Learning was, for the moſt part,
much greater than that of the <hi>Moderns?</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
believed them not in any thing, otherwiſe than as he
found what they delivered to be grounded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
and yet notwithſtanding, he had them in a very
great eſteem. The like may be ſaid of S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
who had read almoſt all of them over, notwithſtanding
that he takes liberty ſometimes to reprove them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſharply, where he finds them not ſpeaking to his
mind. Though you ſhould deprive them not onely of
this <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which yet they never ſought after; but
ſhould rob them alſo of their <hi>Proper Nomes:</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
would they ſtill be of very great <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> unto
us. For, Books do not therefore profit us, becauſe they
were of ſuch or ſuch a Man's Writing, but rather becauſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98310:186"/>
they inſtruct us in thoſe things that are Good and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
and keep us out of Errour, and make us abhor thoſe
things that are Vicious. Blot out, if you pleaſe, the Name
of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> out of the Title of thoſe excellent
Books of his <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> or thoſe other which he
wrote <hi>De Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ.</hi> His Writings will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
you never a whit the leſs, neither will you find
any whit the leſs benefit by them. The like may be ſaid
of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, therefore, you ſhall find in the Fathers very
many earneſt and zealous Exhortations to Holineſs of
Life, and to the Obſervation of the Diſcipline of <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, you ſhall there meet with very ſtrong
and ſolid Proofs of thoſe <hi>Fundamental Principles</hi> of our
Religion, touching which we are all agreed: and alſo
many excellent things laid open, tending to the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of theſe <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
wherein they are contained. In this very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
their Authority may be of good uſe unto you, and
may ſerve as a Probable Argument of the Truth. For,
is it not a wonderful thing to ſee, that ſo many Great
Wits, born in ſo many ſeveral Ages, during the ſpace of
Fifteen hundred years, and in ſo many ſeveral Countries,
being alſo of ſo different Tempers, and who in other
things were of ſo contrary Opinions, ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
be found all of them to agree ſo conſtantly and
unanimouſly in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity?</hi> that
amidſt ſo great diverſity in Worſhip, they all adore one
and the ſame <hi>Chriſt?</hi> preach one and the ſame <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
hope all of them for one and the ſame <hi>Immortality?</hi>
acknowledge all of them the ſame <hi>Goſpels?</hi> find therein
all of them Great and High <hi>Myſteries?</hi> The exquiſite
Wiſdom, and the ineſtimable Beauty it ſelf of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi>
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I confeſs, is the moſt forcible and
certain Argument of the Truth of it: yet certainly this
Conſideration alſo is, in my Opinion, no ſmall proof of
the ſame. For, I beſeech you, what Probability is there,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98310:186"/>
that ſo many Holy Men, who were endued (as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by their Writings) with ſuch Admirable Parts, with
ſo much ſtrength and clearneſs of Underſtanding, ſhould
all of them be ſo groſly overſeen, as to ſet ſo High a
Price, and Eſteem upon this <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as to ſuffer, even
to Death for it; unleſs it had in it ſome certain Heavenly
Virtue, for to make an Impreſſion in the Souls of Men?
What likelyhood is there, that Seven, or Eight Dogs,
and as many Atheiſtical Hogs, that Bark, and Grunt ſo
Sottiſhly, and Confuſedly againſt This Sacred, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Religion, ſhould have better luck in lighting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Truth, than ſo many Excellent Men, who have all
ſo Unanimouſly born Teſtimony to the Truth? As for
<hi>Atheiſts,</hi> their Vicious Life ought to render their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ſuſpected to every one; notwithſtanding they may
be otherwiſe (as indeed they conceive themſelves to be)
Able Men. For, I beſeech you, what wonder is it, if a
Whoremaſter, or a Bawd, or an Ambitious perſon cry
down that <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> that condemneth theſe Vices to
Everlaſting Fire? that he that drowneth himſelf every
day, and at length vomiteth up his Soul in Wine, ſhould
hate that Religion, which forbiddeth Drunkenneſs, upon
pain of Damnation? The great Reaſon that theſe men
have, to wiſh that it were Falſe, muſt needs make any man
ceaſe to wonder at their pronouncing it to be Falſe.</p>
               <p>To take any notice of what ſuch wretched Things as
theſe ſay, is all one, as if you ſhould judge, by taking the
Opinion of Common Strumpets, of the Equity, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of the Laws that enjoin people to live Honeſt. But
the caſe is clean otherwiſe with theſe Holy Men, who have
ſo Conſtantly, and ſo Unanimouſly taught the Truth of
the Chriſtian Religion. For ſeeing they were Men, born,
and brought up in the very ſame Infirmities with other
men; we cannot doubt but that they alſo Naturally had
ſtrong Inclinations to thoſe vices, which our Saviour Chriſt
forbiddeth; and very little Affection to thoſe Virtues,
which He commandeth. For as much therefore, as not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98310:187"/>
all this, They have yet all of them Conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

certainly in this caſe neither can, nor ought in any wiſe
to be ſuſpected. So that although They had not any of
thoſe Great, and Incomparable Advantages of Parts, and
Learning above the Enemies of Chriſtianity; Their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are
word however is much rather to be taken, than the
Others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſeeing that theſe men are manifeſtly carried away
by the force of their own vile Affections, of which the
other cannot poſſibly be ſuſpected Guilty. And as for
thoſe Differences in Opinion, which are ſometimes found
amongſt Them, touching ſome certain Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
ſome whereof we have formerly ſet down; theſe
thing are ſo far from taking off any thing from the
weight of Their Teſtimonies, as that on the Contrary
they add rather very much unto the ſame. For this muſt
acquit their <hi>Conſenting</hi> of all ſuſpicion, that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
might have, that it proceeded from ſome Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or ſome Correſpondence, and Mutual Intelligence.
When thou findſt them ſo diſagreeing among themſelves,
touching ſo many ſeveral Points; it is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they have not learnt their knowledge from one
another, nor yet have all agreed upon the ſame thing by
common Deliberation; but have all of them collected it
out of a ſerious Examination, and Conſideration of the
things themſelves. And if we received no other Benefit
by the <hi>Writings,</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> than this, yet were this
however very much.</p>
               <p>But now, that the Benefit, and Contentment, which
we ſhall receive from this Conſideration, may not be
interrupted, and diſturbed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by our meeting with ſo many
ſeveral <hi>Private Opinions</hi> of theirs; we are to take notice,
that Chriſtianity conſiſteth not in <hi>Subtilties,</hi> nor in the
great number of <hi>Articles.</hi> The <hi>Efficacy</hi> of them is much
more Conſiderable, than the <hi>Number.</hi> A great part of
theſe Points of Faith and the end of all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt, is, <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>A pure worſhip of God,</hi> and, <hi>A
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98310:187"/>
Hearty Charity towards Men.</hi> Thou maiſt therefore
boldly conclude, That Man to be a true Obſerver of This
Diſcipline; that thou ſhalt find to have a True, and
Right Senſe, and Apprehenſion of theſe Two Points.
Though perhaps he be ignorant of thoſe Other, that lie
rather in <hi>Speculation,</hi> than in <hi>Practiſe,</hi> thou oughteſt not
to reject him for that. And if, being carried away with
his own Curioſity, or ſome other reaſon, he chance to
err in ſome of thoſe other Articles, bear with him not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.
As God forgives us our <hi>Sins,</hi> ſo doth He
alſo forgive us our <hi>Errours.</hi> The <hi>Hay,</hi> and the <hi>Stubble,</hi>
and the <hi>Chaffe</hi> ſhall be conſumed: But yet He that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
therewith, ſhall be ſaved, if ſo be He but hold faſt to
the <hi>Foundation.</hi> Neither oughteſt thou to be troubled, if
thou now and then meeteſt with ſome <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome <hi>Erroneous</hi> Paſſages in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> touching
theſe Points. They are never a whit the leſs Chriſtians
for this; and may for all this, have been moſt Faithful
Servants of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is not any <hi>Face</hi> in the
World ſo Beautiful, but that it hath ſome Speckle, or Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
in it. Yet is it not either the leſs eſteemed, or the
leſs beloved for this. The Natural condition of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Men, and Things, is, to have ſome Mixture in it of
Imperfection.</p>
               <p>But now, beſides what hath been hitherto ſaid, we
may, in my opinion, make another very Conſiderable
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> For there ſometimes ariſe ſuch
troubleſome Spirits, as will needs broach Doctrines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
of their own Head, which are not at all grounded
upon any Principle of the Chriſtian Religion. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Authority of the <hi>Ancients</hi> may very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and Seaſonably be made uſe of, againſt the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of theſe Men: by ſhewing, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> were
utterly Ignorant of any ſuch <hi>Fancies,</hi> as theſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to the World. And if this can be proved, we ought
then certainly to conclude, that no ſuch Doctrine was
ever preached to Mankind; either by our Saviour Chriſt,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98310:188"/>
or by His Apoſtles. For what Probability is there, that
thoſe Holy Doctors of Former Ages, from whoſe hands
Chriſtianity hath been derived down unto us, ſhould be
Ignorant of any of thoſe things, which had been Revealed,
and Recommended by our Saviour, as Important, and
Neceſſary to Salvation? It is true indeed, that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
being deceived either by ſome Falſe manner of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation,
or elſe by ſome Seeming Authority, do
ſometimes deliver ſuch things, as have not been revealed
by our Saviour <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but are evidently either Falſe, or
Ill grounded; as we have formerly ſhewed in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
before produced by us. It is true moreover, that
among thoſe things which have been revealed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Scripture, which yet are not Abſolutely
Neceſſary to Salvation, the <hi>Fathers</hi> may have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of ſome of them; either by reaſon that Time had
not as yet diſcovered what the ſenſe of them was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe,
becauſe that for lack of giving good heed unto them, or by
their being carried away with ſome Paſſion, They did not
then perceive, what hath ſince been found out. But that
they ſhould all of them have been Ignorant of any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
that is Neceſſarily Requiſite to Salvation, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Impoſſible. For, after this Account, They ſhould
all have been deprived of Salvation; which, I ſuppoſe,
every honeſt Soul would tremble at the thought of.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, and, as I conceive, have ſufficiently proved
in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> that an <hi>Argument</hi> which concludeth the
Truth of any <hi>Propoſition,</hi> from the <hi>Fathers</hi> having main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the ſame, is very Weak, and Ill-grounded; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that, which is Clearly Falſe; namely, That the
<hi>Fathers</hi> maintained nothing, which had not been <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed</hi>
by our Saviour <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For, this would be ſuch a
kind of Argumentation, as if a man ſhould prove, by
the General <hi>Agreement</hi> herein of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that all
the <hi>Departed Souls</hi> are ſhut up together in a certain
Place, or Receptacle, till the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment:</hi> or, that
the <hi>Enchariſt</hi> is Neceſſarily to be adminiſtred to <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98310:188"/>
Infants;</hi> and the like; where every one ſees, how
Inſufficient, and Invalid this way of Argumentation is
And, to ſay the truth, ſuch is the Proceeding of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they go about to prove, by the
<hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> thoſe Articles which they
propoſe to the World, and which are rejected by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay moreover, that to conclude upon the <hi>Nullity,</hi> or
<hi>Falſeneſs</hi> of any <hi>Article,</hi> that is not of the number of
thoſe that are <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> from the general
<hi>Silence</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> touching the ſame, is a very Abſurd
way of Arguing; as ſuppoſing a thing which is alſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
Falſe; Namely, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> muſt Neceſſarily
have ſeen, and Clearly known All, and every of thoſe
things, which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath revealed in <hi>His Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such a kind of Argument would it be thought among
the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> if any one ſhould conclude againſt them,
from the <hi>Silence</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that our Saviour Chriſt
hath not at all revealed, that the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>
was conceived without Sin. But yet I confeſs again on
the other ſide, that in thoſe Points that are accounted
as Abſolutely Neceſſary to Salvation, an Argument that
ſhould be drawn from the <hi>General Silence</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
to prove the Nullity or Falſeneſs of it, would be very
Pertinent, and indeed Unanſwerable. As for example,
His manner of Argumentation would be very <hi>Rational,</hi>
and Solid, that ſhould conclude that thoſe Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
which are propoſed by a <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſuppoſe, or a
<hi>David George,</hi> or the like <hi>Sectaries,</hi> are Null, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Will of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (how much ſoever
theſe Men may ſeem to Honour Him,) ſeeing that none of
ehe Ancient Chriſtians ſpeak ſo much as one ſyllable of it,
and are utterly ignorant of all thoſe <hi>Secrets,</hi> that theſe
Wretches have preached to their Diſciples, and delivered
as <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Means</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi> After

appear to the World, that this ſo Strange Doctrine was

pretended they had. For certainly if they had
done ſo, the memory of it could not have been ſo utterly

might, with very good Reaſon, be made uſe of againſt
Them. But it is moſt Evident, that there is no ſuch thing
at all in their Belief: for they maintain only ſuch things,
as are eithe Expreſly delivered in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or elſe
are Evidently deduced from thence; and ſuch as have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
been expounded, the greateſt part of them, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the <hi>Ancients</hi> not in their own private Writings
only, but even in their <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Synodical Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
alſo. They pretend not either to any Particular <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Secret Tradition,</hi> or any other <hi>New Principle</hi>
of Doctrine. Their Faith is grounded only upon the
<hi>Old,</hi> and (which is the Moſt Authentick <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of
Chriſtianity) the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Only in their Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
either of the Doctrines therein Contained, or other
Paſſages, They produce ſome few things, that are not at
all found in the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But theſe things being not Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to Salvation, the Argument which is brought
from the <hi>Silence</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> herein, is not ſufficient to
prove the Falſeneſs of them. <hi>Time, Experience, Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>

of others, and the very <hi>Errours</hi> alſo of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
having (as They ſay) now laid that Open to Them,
which was Heretofore more Difficult, and hard to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and taken notice of, in <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> Who
knoweth not that a <hi>Dwarf,</hi> mounted upon a <hi>Giants</hi>
ſhoulders, looketh higher, and ſeeth further, than the <hi>Giant</hi>
himſelf? It would be ridiculous in any man that ſhould
conclude, that That which the <hi>Dwarf</hi> pretends to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is not at all in Nature, becauſe then the <hi>Giant</hi> muſt
alſo have ſeen it. Neither would He be much wiſer, that
ſhould accuſe the <hi>Dwarf</hi> of Preſumption; becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth,
He hath told Us that, whereof the <hi>Giant</hi> ſaid not
a word: ſeeing that it is the <hi>Giant,</hi> to whom the <hi>Dwarf</hi>
is beholding for the greateſt part of His Knowledge. And
this is Our Caſe, ſay the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> We are mounted
upon the Shoulders of that Great, and High Giant, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</hi>
That advantage which we have above it, by its
means enables us to ſee many things in <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
which it did not ſee. But yet however this cannot be any
occaſion of Preſumption to us, becauſe we ſee more than
it did; for as much as it is this very <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to which
we owe a great part of this our Knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is Certainly therefore very Clear, that as for the
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and what concerns the Poſitive Points of
Their Faith, they are wholly without the Compaſs of
this Diſpute. And as for thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
They cannot, for the Reaſons before given, make any
Advantage of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> for the
proving of any of thoſe Points of Doctrine which They
maintain, ſave only of thoſe wherein their Adverſaries
agree with them; and therefore, if they would have us
to come over to Their Belief, They muſt Neceſſarily have
recourſe to ſome other kind of Proofs. But yet I do
not ſee, but that we may very well make Inquiry into
<hi>Antiquity</hi> touching many Articles, which are now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and if we find,
that the <hi>Ancients</hi> have not ſaid any thing at all of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98310:190"/>
ſame, we may then poſitively conclude, That they are not
to be accounted as any part of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.
I confeſs, that there are ſome of them, againſt which this
Argument is of no force at all; as namely, thoſe which
they do not account <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, and which
both the <hi>Ancients</hi> heretofore might have been, and we
alſo at this day may be ignorant of. But certainly, this
Argument, in my Judgment, would be utterly unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
againſt ſuch Points as they preſs as <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and
whereon indeed they would have our Salvation wholly
to depend: As for Example, The <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> which owneth him as Its
<hi>Head;</hi> The <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt;</hi>
the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſs;</hi> the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Confeſſion,</hi> and the like. For, if ſo be they are of ſo
great Importance, as they would make us believe, it would
be a Point of high Impiety to ſay, That the <hi>Fathers</hi> knew
not any thing at all of them; in like manner as it would
be a moſt abſurd thing to maintain, That though they
did know them, they would not yet ſpeak any one word
of them, in all thoſe Books which we have of theirs at
this day. And, if they had ſaid any thing at all of them
in their Writings, we have no reaſon in the World to
ſuſpect, that poſſibly thoſe Paſſages, where mention was
made of them, may have been raſed out, or corrupted and
altered by falſe hands; ſeeing that this Piece of Knavery
would have been done to the diſadvantage of thoſe who
had theſe Books in their Cuſtody. We have rather very
good reaſon to ſuſpect, that whatſoever Alterations there
are, they have been made in favour of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as we have proved before in the Firſt Book. If
therefore, after ſo long a time, and after ſo many <hi>Indexes</hi>
as they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have put forth, and ſo
great a deſire as they have had to find theſe Doctrines of
theirs in the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the little Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that they have ſometimes made of foiſting into the
Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> what they could not find there;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98310:191"/>
We can ſtill notwithſtanding make it appear, that they
are not to be found there at all: After all this, I ſay, who
can poſſibly doubt, but that the Fathers were ignorant of
them? Who will ever be perſwaded to believe, that they
held them as <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Salvation?</hi> And if they were
not known to be ſuch then, how can any body imagine,
that they ſhould at length come to be ſuch now?</p>
               <p>My Opinion therefore is, That although the Authority
of the <hi>Fathers</hi> be not ſufficient to prove the Truth of thoſe
Articles which are now maintained by the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> although the <hi>Ancients</hi> ſhould
perhaps have believed the ſame; it may notwithſtanding
ſerve to prove the <hi>Falſeneſs</hi> of them, in caſe that we
ſhould find by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were either
wholly ignorant of them, or at leaſt acknowledged them
not for ſuch, as they would now have us believe them to
be: which is a Buſineſs that ſo nearly concerns the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
as that to be able to bring about their Deſign, I
conceive they ought to employ a good part of their time
in reading over the Books of the <hi>Ancients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely it is requiſite, that either Party, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſo tedious and ſo important a Buſineſs as this is,
ſhould come very well provided of all Neceſſary Parts;
as namely, of the Knowledge of the <hi>Language,</hi> and of
<hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and ſhould alſo be very well read in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
and, that they uſe herein their utmoſt Diligence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and withal read over exactly whatſoever we have
left us of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> not omitting any thing that Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they can get; becauſe a little ſhort Paſſage many times
gives a Man very much Light in the finding out their
Meaning: and not think (as ſome, who much deceive
themſelves, do) that they perfectly know what the Senſe
and Belief of the <hi>Ancients</hi> was, becauſe perhaps they have
ſpent four or five Months in the reading of them over.
But above all, it is Neceſſary that they come to this Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
void of all Paſſion and Prejudication: which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the greateſt, and the moſt general Cauſe of that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98310:191"/>
which is found in theſe Writings of the Fathers,
whilſt every one endeavours to make them ſpeak to his
ſenſe; whereas in the greateſt part of theſe Points of
Religion which are now controverted amongſt us, theſe
Ancient Authors really believed much Leſs than the one
Party doth, and ſome little matter More than the other
doth: and there are but a very few Points of all this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
wherein they are fully and abſolutely of the ſame
Judgment that either of the Two Parties is. Neither is
it ſufficient in this Buſineſs to take notice of ſuch Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as either poſitively affirm or deny thoſe things which
we look after; becauſe that how clear ſoever they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be, it will go very hard but a quick Wit will
find ſomething to darken the ſenſe of them: as you may
obſerve in all Books of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> where you ſhall have
them ſo baffle, and make nothing of ſuch Teſtimonies as
are brought againſt them out of the Ancients, as that you
would hardly know what to hold to. But you muſt alſo
obſerve, what the Neceſſary <hi>Conſequences</hi> are of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Article; it being impoſſible to conclude upon any
One Point, that is of any Importance, but that there will
preſently follow upon it divers <hi>Conſequences,</hi> as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as without the Church.</p>
               <p>As for example: you are to conſider what the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi>
are of the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as
it is now held by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> of <hi>Purgatory;</hi>
and of the <hi>Monarchical Authority</hi> of the <hi>Pope:</hi> and when
you have obſerved them well, you are then to mark, in
reading the Books of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> whether they appear
there in Whole, or in Part. For, if you find them not there
at all, it is a moſt Certain Argument, that the Doctrine
from whence they proceed, and upon which they follow,
is <hi>New</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſound.</hi> But I ſhall not proceed any further
in this Diſcourſe, ſince divers have already treated hereof
at large; it being, in my Judgment, no hard matter to
collect, from what we have here delivered, how we ought
to read the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
