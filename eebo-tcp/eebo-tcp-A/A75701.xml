         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Upon Friday, the fifth of this inſtant <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twelve of the clocke, there was ſent from the
Lord Marqueſſe and the Commiſsioners unto your
Committees and Deputy Lievtenants then in the
field neere <hi>Chewton, Anthony Stocker, VVilliam Baſset,</hi>
and <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> three Juſtices of the Peace, of
this County, who went but that very morning to
Wells, upon a Letter which they produced unto us
ſent unto them from the Marqueſſe, wherein they
were deſired to come unto Wells, to preſerve the
peace of the Countrey. Theſe three Meſſengers
told us that they had a Meſſage to deliver us from
the Lord Marqueſſe, and the Commiſsioners
which they were willing to bring unto us, becauſe
(as they conceived) it did conduce to the peace of
the Countrey, and thereupon delivered the meſſage
in writing, a Coppie whereof is herewith ſent you,
and at the ſame time they delivered us a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the Lord Marqueſſe and the Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
had cauſed to be publiſhed for the ſatisfaction
of the Countrey, in which is eſpecially ſet out thoſe
ſeverall paſſages at Shepton Mallet upon Munday,
the firſt of this moneth, the Declaration we do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſend you, which when you have compared &amp;
examined with our relation formerly ſent you
touching the ſame matter, you may then ſee the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and miſtakes committed by the Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
contained in the ſaid Declaration. When your
Committees and Deputy Lievtenants had peruſed
this Declaration and Meſſage, for that Maſter <hi>Strode,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Pyne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Rogers,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112253:3"/>
not come unto us, and ſome of them were principally
concerned in that of <hi>Shepton Mallet,</hi> we thought fit to
returne the Commiſsioners for the preſent this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
which we here ſend you, promiſing them a more
full anſwer the next day, by which time we did hope
to enjoy the company, and have the adviſe and conſent
of thoſe Gentlemen above-named, for wee expected
them every houre, but they came not unto us at all.
When your Committees and Deputy-Lievtenants
had deliver'd unto the meſſengers their ſaid Anſwer.
They the Meſſengers did propoſe that a courſe
ſhould be taken, that the peace might be kept between
us during this time, that the Commiſsioners were to
expect our next Anſwer, and thereupon was added the
laſt clauſe in this our firſt anſwer, upon this condition
that they the three meſſengers ſhould engage that the
like aſſurance ſhould be given us from the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe,
and the other Commiſsioners, or elſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
timely advertiſement by them, whereby wee
might have time to put our ſelves in ſome readineſſe
for our ſafety and defence, which the Meſſengers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
unto they departed; And in the evening (by
which time all our Companies were marched from
<hi>Chewton</hi> unto a Hill above, and in view of the Towne
of <hi>VVels)</hi> the ſame Meſſengers came againe unto us,
and brought the Warrant for our ſafety under the Lord
Marqueſſe, and ſome of the Commiſsioners hands,
which writing we likewiſe doe herewithall ſend unto
you. The next morning wee made ready our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to their firſt Meſſage which was digeſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
propoſitions, and about ten of the clocke ſent the
ſame into <hi>VVels</hi> by foure Gentlemen, Maſter <hi>Giles
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:112253:4"/>
Hungerford,</hi> Maſter <hi>VVilliam Eyre,</hi> Maſter <hi>George Bomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>
the Maſter <hi>Prickman,</hi> who were attended by our
Trumpetter, and ſo brought ſafe to the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe,
and delivered him the Propoſitions, from whom
they received this Anſwer, That the Anſwer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
were of a very high Concernment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Lordſhip and the Commiſsioners did deſire
time to conſider of them, but would give their reply
by two of the clocke at the fartheſt, and ſend the ſame
unto us by Meſſengers of their owne; The Meſlage and
Propoſitions you ſhall receive herewithall.</p>
            <p>After the Lords and Gentlemen had received theſe
our Propoſitions, they then (as wee were informed)
made ready all things for their departure, and haſtned
away with ſpeed, yet to keepe the people in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whilſt they might with the more ſafety depart the
Towne, They ſent us up to the Hill by three Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Maſter <hi>Stocker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Seymour,</hi> and maſter <hi>Button</hi>
an anſwer to our Propoſitions, but before their meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
came from them, all their Carriages were gone
out of the Towne, and the Lords and Gentlemen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to take horſe, the anſwer wee have herewith ſent
unto you.</p>
            <p>But by that time we had received, and read this their
Lordſhips reply, there came Meſſengers unto us from
the Major and Citizens of <hi>Wells,</hi> who aſſured us that
the Lord Marqueſſe and all the company were gone,
and had left the Towne, and therefore petitioned us,
that the Sould<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers might not come down, nor attempt
any thing againſt them. Upon which relation the
Souldiers looking round the Countrey, they eſpied
the Lord Marqueſſe and all the company marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112253:4"/>
and gone about three miles off, neere unto a
Towne called <hi>Glaſsenbury,</hi> ſince which time we have
received certaine intelligence from one that continued
with them unto this very day; That they marched that
night unto <hi>Somerton,</hi> a Towne neere unto Sir <hi>Iohn Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
houſe, from which place went the Lord <hi>Paulet,</hi>
and many other Gentlemen from the Marqueſſe unto
their homes: The Lord Marqueſſe and thoſe that
were left, ſtayed at <hi>Somerton</hi> untill Munday morning,
and then left that Towne, and are gone and ſetled at
<hi>Sherborne,</hi> as we are credibly informed. Sir <hi>Ralfe Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and Sir <hi>Francis Dodington</hi> with ſome others reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not to leave the Lord Marqueſſe, but to keepe
under his protection, for that the whole Countrey doe
take Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> for no better then a Rebell.
There are reports that they intend to returne into this
County againe to bee avenged for this affront: Very
probable it is, that they goe about to get more ſtrength
to come into this County or into <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> for <hi>Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi>

his Lordſhips and the Commiſſioners hands,
which they will obſerve in all points, unleſſe they
ſhall be forced for their own defence to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And you are further to give them notice, that
yeſterday ſome few horſe going out to open the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
hereabouts, which were ſtopped by armed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112253:6"/>
men, and meeting many hundreds of men armed
with Muſquets, Pikes, Bullets, Match lighted, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
ſome of the Gentlemen that went out by my
Lord Marqueſſes and the Commiſſioners appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſent to them a deſire to treat; and thereupon
three or four of them meeting with as many of the
other, they deſired them to return their armed men,
and ſome of them to come and ſpeak with my Lord
Marqueſſe and the Commiſſioners, who would give
them all juſt ſatisfaction: They took time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of it, and at laſt returned anſwer, that they would
come on, and make their way; and ſo marching, when
they came within Muſquet ſhot they gave fire upon
them, and ſo continued till they came within the
reach of the Carabines, who then gave fire upon
them alſo; by which means, the blood which was
ſhed, muſt light on their own heads; for we deſire
nothing but peace: Whereunto if you ſhall agree,
and diſmiſſe your Aſſemblies, and advance no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
there will be an end of the Diſtractions of this
Country, which God Almighty grant.</p>

deſirous of peace, and their coming hither is to

ſome of them with unwarrantable and diſorderly

of this deſired peace, the ſame being of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

whoſe preſence is hourly expected, they deſire to

not be broken by them.</p>

of Array, or any other; And if you deſire to have
the Execution of the Commiſſion of Array to be
