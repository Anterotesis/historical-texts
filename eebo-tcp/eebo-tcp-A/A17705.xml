         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The substance and ground of this Epistle to the Ephesians
is this: That beyng once throughly instructed and rooted in
the fayth of Iesus Christ, wee must (for full confirmation and
stablishment of our consciences in the louing kyndnesse and
fauour of our God, ageinst all assaultes and temptations both

onely begotten sonne, before the foundations of the world

               </gap>he pure doctrine of the Gospell. And when he
was prisoner at Rome, perceyuing that they had

               </gap>heefly vppon the prayzyng and magnyfying of

                  <desc>••</desc>

after his greetings, he speaketh of Gods free
election, too the end they should knowe that they
were now called too the kingdome of heauen, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had bin predestinated vntoo lyfe before
they were borne. And heerin shineth foorth Gods
wonderfull mercy, that the sauing of our soules

as mens wittes are too weake to conceyue so hygh

a secret: he prayeth God to inlighten the Ephes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nesse of Gods grace, he putteth them in
rememberance how wretched they were till they
were called too Iesus Christ, by comparing their
present state, and their former state toogither. For
wee can neuer perceyue sufficiently how greatly
wee bee beholden too our Lord Iesus, nor consider
as becommeth vs how greate his benefyts are

had bin apoynted peculiarly for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles,
too the intent that they who had bin straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

people of God. And for bycause it was an vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
thing, and such a one as trubbled many

it a secret, hidden from all tymes, saying neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
that the vttering of the same secret was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

God agein too giue the Ephesians the perfect and
lyuely knowledge of Iesus Christ, so as they may
not couet too knowe any other thing. By which
woords he not only goeth about too make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians

were not consecrated too God by Circumsion,

               </gap>ere vnholie. For it was their common song, that

               </gap>one ought too bee reckened among the people of

Paule, for making Iesus Christ common too the
Gentyles, as well as too the Iewes, and affirmed

               </gap>eauenly doctrine, bycause he did after that sort of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and set forth the couenant of grace to vncleane
people without any difference at all. Therfore too

too giue them a remedie. And so, wheras

<pb facs="tcp:23289:16"/>
warneth them on the other syde, not too thinke
that the Gospell came too them by haphazard at
the apoyntment of men, or that it lyghted in their
lappes at aladuenture. For he telleth them, that
wheras Christ was preached too them: that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
was nothing else than the vttering or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Gods euerlasting determination. When
as he setteth the vnhapie plight of their former life
before their eyes, he therwithal putteth them in
mynd, that their getting out of so deepe a gulf, was
through the singular and woonderfull mercie of
God. And wheras he speaketh of the Apostleship
which was committed too him towards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles:
he dooth it too strengthen them in the fayth
which they had once receyued, bycause their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
intoo the communion of Christes Church,
was wrought by the will of God. Neuerthelesse,
looke how many sentences heere be, so many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are there to chere vp the Ephesians to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Gods bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yts.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Chapter he descrybeth the meane
wherby our Lord gouerneth and maynteyneth
his Church: namely by the Gospell which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by men. Wheruppon it foloweth, that that
is the verie full poynt of perfection, and that the
Churche cannot otherwyse bee kept vp vnappay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And therfore the Apostles meaning is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vntoo the Ephesians the ministerie, wherby
God reigneth among vs. Afterward he commeth
too speake of the fruts of preaching, that is to wit,
of innocencie, holinesse, and of all dewties of a

theruppon he sheweth vs also what wee haue in Christ, too the end wee
should so sticke vntoo him, as not to presume too seeke helpe any where
else, but assure our selues that he hath bought vs all. Againe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side he sheweth vs, that Christ hath so wel prouided for his church,
that if wee haue the wit to vse the giftes of grace which he offereth vs,
wee shall haue full and perfect happinesse. Therewithall he warneth
such as haue bin instructed in the truth of the Gospell, too leade a holy
lyfe, and too shewe that they haue profited as they ought too doo in
Gods schoole. Now, these thinges serue not onely for the Citie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,
nor for any one Countrie, ne for any one age or time: but wee
had neede too bee furthered more and more, seyng that the diuell prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth
without ende or ceassing, too thrust vs out of the way. And when
he cannot leade vs quite away from the doctrine of Iesus Christ, he
laboreth too bring it out of taste with vs by some way or other, and too
intangle vs in new curiosities, onely too bring too passe that wee may
not bee constant in the faith that wee haue receiued, but stand alwayes
in a mamering. Now, whensoeuer our fancies are so ticklish, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that there is a gap opened too wype out the rememberance of all
that wee had learned afore, &amp; too take in many folies, yea and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
doctrines, which serue too corrupt and peruert all the purenesse of
our faith. We see then that the doctrine which is conteyned in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
is directed and dedicated vntoo vs at this day, &amp; that God hath
by his woonderfull prouidence so dispozed thinges aforehand, that wee
not onely haue had the foundations of the Gospell whereuppon too
ground our selues, but also whereby our faith may from day too day
growe and increase, and wee go still forward, till wee come too perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And first and formest S. Paule claymeth the authoritie vntoo him
which had bin giuen him of God, too the intent that men should not
stop at his person, as though it had bin but a mortall mannes saying.
For in very deede our Lord Iesus Christ is the onely mayster at whole

                  </gap>bsolute grounde, that if any man thrust foorth himselfe too speake in

                  </gap>is owne name, there is nothing but rashnesse in him. Why so? For
he taketh that thing vppon him, which belongeth alonely vntoo God.
Ageine, forasmuch as our Lord Iesus Christ was purposely sent, too
be our last teacher, that wee might haue such wisdome as were perfect
and vtterly without fault: therefore dooth S. Paule call himselfe an
Apostle sent of him. This presuppozeth twoo thinges: the one is, that
S. Paule had that charge committed vntoo him: and the other is, that
he acquited himselfe dewly of it, by imploying himselfe faithfully in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he office that he was called too. For were a man the best able &amp; most
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xcellent in the world: yet if he thrust foorth himselfe of his owne head,
he trubbleth all common order. And wee knowe that God will haue
order, and not disorder among vs, as S. Paule sayeth in the fowrteenth
chapter of the first Epistle too the Corinthians. He then that speaketh
(at leastwise too teache) must haue calling: that is too say, he must bee
admitted, &amp; haue his charge (giuen him,) so as euery man may not put
foorth himselfe of an vnaduized zeale, as I sayd afore. Now too speake
any further of S. Paules calling,<note place="margin">Act. 9. c. 15.</note> it is not needefull at this present. For
wee knowe how God gaue record that he auowed him for his Apostle.
And in deede he disputeth not much of it heere, bycause it was knowen
well ynough in the Church of Ephesits. But forasmuch as the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
had bin trubbled by deceyuers, in so much that S. Paules autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
yea and the name of God himselfe had bin disgraced there: wee
sawe howe he mainteyned his owne state, telling them that the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
dew too an Apostle of Iesus Christ coulde not bee taken from
him,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. c. 13. 14, 15. &amp;c.</note> without ouerthrowing the order of God. And therfore it is ynough
for him heere too haue sayd in one woord, that he is an Apostle of Iesus
Christ. Let vs come too the seconde poynt which I touched, namely
that it is not ynough for a man too bee called, except he discharge his
dewtie with a pure conscience and vpright dealing in his office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
thing S. Paule tooke vppon him as a thing out of all Qutesion and he


<pb facs="tcp:23289:19"/>
had giuen sufficient proofe of it. The deceyuers may well boast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with full mouth that they bee called, as wee see they doo. For all
they that fight ageinst God and his woord, and sowe trubble and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
in his Church, would fayne make a buckler of their calling, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of their zeale, for they will needes bee called Christians, yea &amp; more
too. But S. Paule had sufficiently proued that he came not of himselfe,
ne sought any thing else than too spend himselfe in the building vp of
the Church. And forasmuch as the same was well knowen in Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,<note place="margin">Act. 19.</note>
(as wee may gather by the storie of S. Luke) yea and that he had
borne out many a hard brunt: therefore he thinketh it ynough too say
in one woorde, that he is an Apostle of our Lorde Iesus Christ. And
heere wee bee warned, first too holde our selues too the pure doctrine
which wee knowe too haue proceeded from God: for wee cannot doo
amisse if wee followe that rule. And bycause that in our Lord Iesus
Christ wee haue the performance of all that is requisite and needefull
for our instruction, so as wee neede not too doubt whither wee may

                  </gap>afeth
too stoope so lowe as too take that charge vppon him, and also protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that if wee haue profited well in his doctrine, wee shall come too
the trew marke wheruntoo wee should go. Yee see then that the first

                  </gap>n which wee haue too gather vpon this text, is that our faith must
not wauer one way nor other, but haue a sure and vnmoueable founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
too rest vppon, that is too wit, Gods truth, euen as it is conteyned
in the Gospell. And seyng that S. Paule is sufficiently auowed vntoo
vs: let vs not doubt but Gods spirit speaketh too vs at this day by his
mouth, nother let vs heere the doctrine as though it were subiec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the thinges which wee haue too marke vppon this text. Furthermore
too the ende that this doctrine may not onely bee reuerenced among
vs, but also bee amiable too vs: let vs marke that S. Paule speaketh
in the name of Christ, who was sent vntoo vs of God his father, too
bring vs glad tydinges of peace: and also let vs beare in mynd how he

Iesus Christ: it is certeine that all such as are separated from him,
haue nothing else in them but vyce, and all maner of vnclenenesse, how
much so euer the world fawne vppon them. And on the other side let vs
marke also, that all such as boast themselues of beleefe in the Gospell,
and are not sanctifyed of God, doo bewray their owne hipocrisie and
lying, and dote themselues by their owne lyfe, whatsoeuer their mouth
sing or say, according as wee see many now a dayes, which defyle and
vnhalowe the name of faith which ought too bee holie. For euerie man
will say he is faithfull, and they that haue least faith, are boldest too say
that there is no faith but in themselues. And would God it were so but

faith of the Gospell, wee must therwithall giue ouer our selues wholly
vntoo our God, and separate our selues from the corruptions of the

this, S. Paule had one other respect more: which was, too feede vs in

how fickle wee bee of nature, &amp; when God is so good vntoo vs, as too

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>edged alreadie out of the sixteenth Psalme) all our seruices can doo

                  </gap> no good: &amp; agein we must needes conclude, that (as I haue also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged


<pb facs="tcp:23289:23"/>
out of the hundred &amp; xvi. Psalme) all that wee can bring vntoo
God is no more but this acknowledgement, that wee bee beholden too
him for all the good things which wee haue. Yee see then that all our
blissing is but too yeeld the sacrifice of praize vntoo God. Let that
serue for one poynt. But now when God blisseth vs, is it but onely in
woordes? No: but it is a filling of vs, and a bestowing of all things
vppon vs which wee want, so farre foorth as is needefull. And why is
this woord <hi>Blissing</hi> attributed vntoo him? Bycause he needeth not too
trauell and take much paine too helpe his seruantes, and too giue them
the things that he knoweth too bee expedient for them. If he doo but
say the woord, that is too say, if he doo but vtter his will, the thing is
doone. Forasmuch then as God hauing created the world by his onely
woord, hath power also too doo vs good by his alonely behyghting of
it: therefore it is sayd that wee become riche by his onely blissing, that
is too say, by his shewing of himself louing and fauorable too vs. Now
let vs see if wee bee too bee excuzed when we defraud God of his dew,
by disdeyning too open our lippes too confesse howe much wee bee
bound and beholden vntoo him, after wee haue receyued so many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
at his hand. Let all the blissinges that all the men in the world
can giue vntoo God, bee layd intoo the balance ageinst the onely blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
wherwith he inricheth vs: and which shall outwey other? All that
they can alledge, is, but that they must bee fayne too confesse, that they
can nother doo, nor say any thing that is aught woorth: wheras on the
other side God sheweth vs that he hath all that is requisite for our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
Therefore it is not without cause that S. Paule sayeth heere,
that the faithfull must giue and apply all their wittes and indeuers too
blisse God, seyng he giueth them so great cause: for else they bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
and starke churles. Therefore he speaketh twoo thinges:
<hi>The father of our Lord Iesus Christ, vvhich hath blissed vs in
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas he sayeth, the God and father of <hi>our Lord</hi> Iesus Christ,
it must bee layd foorth after this maner: namely, that the God whom
wee feele so fauorable vntoo vs, is the father of our Lord Iesus Christ.
This circumstance deserueth too bee well marked. For thereby S.
Paule dooth vs too vnderstand, that Gods benefites, &amp; specially those
that belong too the heauenly lyfe, and too the euerlasting saluation of
our soules, cannot come at vs, except Iesus Christ bee as it were the

maiestie of God must needs make the heares of our head too stand vp
for feare. But when we consider that he calleth himselfe the father of
him that is our head: wee knowe that he also must needs auow vs for
his children, bycause he hath bought vs.</p>
               <p>Furthermore although S. Paule doo set downe heere but the one
woord of <hi>Spirituall blissinges:</hi> yit notwithstanding he sheweth that
God hath shewed himselfe bountifull towardes vs mo wayes than
one. And therof he will make a more large declaration hereafter, by
laying foorth the benefites particularly which wee obteyne by the
Gospell. For all this chapter is full of them. But howsoeuer the eace
standeth, yit dooth he giue vs too vnderstand in this streyne, that Gods
giuing of his gracious gyfts vnto vs, is not by patches and parcells,
and that his making of vs too taste them, is not with a wet finger and
away, as they say: but that he hath giuen vs them so diuersly and fully,
that wee haue cause too magnifie him in all respectes. Therfore let vs
vnderstand, that seyng that Iesus Christ is so giuen vntoo vs, in him
wee obteyne all that is auaylable too our saluation, and too make vs
happie, according also as Paule speaketh of it in the eyght to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.
For if the onely sonne bee giuen vntoo vs, how should not all
the benefites which he hath in him, bee communicated too vs with him
and by his meanes?</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer wee fare, let vs learne too fauour Gods spirituall
giftes in such wise, as all our wittes may bee gathered home to make
much of them. And for the bringing therof too passe: let vs beware
that wee haue not our myndes too much wedded too the world. For the
verie cause that draweth vs away, so as we perceyue not the hundredth
part of the good that God hath doone vs, nor can apply his benefites
too our profit: is our owne vanitie, bycause euery of vs begulleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with his owne fond and wandering lustes. Therfore let vs learne
too shake off the things that stop vs from comming too our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. And although our naughtie nature prouoke vs too seeke
the transitorie things of this world: yit let vs doo our indeuer to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
from them, so as wee may yeeld our selues with a free hart vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God, and bee earnestly mynded too obey him, and too giue our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
wholly vntoo him, for so is it his will too haue vs ioyned vnto him.
This is the thing which wee haue too marke vppon S. Paule, when
hauing spoken of the spirituall blissings, he addeth immediatly, in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

aske of the Philosophers: They wil alwayes tell him that God loueth
such as are worthy of it, and that forasmuch as vertue pleaseth him, he
dooth also marke out such as are giuen theretoo, too hold them for
his people. Yee see then, that after our owne imagination, wee will
deeme that God putteth none other difference between man and man,
in louing some, and in hating other some, than eche mans owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse
and deseruing. But by the waye, let vs remember also, that in
our owne vnderstanding there is nothing but vanitie, and that wee
must not measure God by our meetyard, and that it is too excessyue
an ouerweening too bynd God too the stake, so as he should not do any

they malicious and froward also, which would now a dayes haue the
doctrine of election kept in silence. For they woulde ouerrule God if
it were possible, &amp; stop his mouth as oft as he vttereth any thing that
lyketh not them. Agein, a man may euidently see their beastlynesse, in
that S. Paule had not a better proofe whereby too magnifie Gods
goodnesse, than this. Then if there were none other reason, yit were it
better that the whole world should go too confuzion, than that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
should bee suppressed with silence. For is it reason that God
should set the infinite treasures of his mercies before our eyes, and yit
that they should not be spoken of, but bee thrust vnder foote? But there
are yit twoo reasons mo, which shewe that this doctrine is most neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
too bee preached, and that wee reape so great profit by it, as it had
bin much better that wee had neuer bin borne, than too bee ignorant of
the thing that S. Paule sheweth heere. For there are twoo thinges
wherat wee must chiefly ame, and whereuntoo it behoueth vs too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all our wittes and indeuers, and they bee the very summe of all the
thinges which God teacheth vs by the holy scripture. The one is

God drawe all men alyke, and that such as intend too obteyne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
must come of their owne free will and selfmouing: if it be so, then is
it certeine that wee deserue too bee receyued at Gods hand, and that
he should handle euery man according too his worthinesse. But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
shall Gods goodnesse bee magnifyed? Euen in this, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth
vs of his owne mere free good wil, and loueth vs neuerthelesse
without fynding any thing eyther in vs or in our woorkes why he
should loue vs. If this bee trew, then must there needes bee election, so
as God must take the one sort bycause he thinketh it good so to doo, &amp;
leaue the other. Thus ye see it is a most assured point, that Gods glory
doth not appeere &amp; shyne foorth as were requisite, except it be knowen

a great sort continued in their vnbeleefe and stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:28"/>
and othersome beleeued. Now S. Luke sayeth playnly that the
cause therof was not for that the one sort were more forewarde folke
than the other, or for that there was any towardnesse of vertue more
in the one than in the other: but for that God had foreordeyned them
too saluation. Therefore at one woord, wee see that all mannes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
must ceasse and be layd vnder foote, or else God shall not haue
his deserued praise. Yea and wee must vnderstand, that fayth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not of our selues: for if it did, then should there be some woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in our woorkes. Trew it is, that by fayth wee confesse that there
is nothing but wretchednesse in vs, that wee bee damned and accursed,
and that wee bring not aught with vs but onely an acknowledgement
of our sinnes. But yit should our fayth serue for some desert, if we had
it of our owne breeding. Wee must therefore conclude, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for men too beleeue, vnlesse it bee giuen them from aboue.
And surely S. Paule declareth heere a thing well woorthie too bee
marked, when he sayeth, <hi>blissed bee God.</hi> And for what cause? Euen
for inriching vs in such wise in Iesus Christ, that our lyfe is happie
and blissed. And afterward he addeth, <hi>according too his choozing of
vs.</hi> Is not fayth comprehended among the spirituall riches whereof
S. Paule maketh mention? Yis, and (which is more) it is the chiefe
of them. For it is by fayth that wee receyue the holy Ghost, it is by
fayth that wee become patient in our aduersities,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>b. 11</note> it is by fayth that we
become obedient too God, it is by fayth that wee bee sanctifyed to his
seruice. Too bee short, fayth continueth alwayes chiefe of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
benefites that God bestoweth vppon vs. Now let vs remember
well S. Paules order. He sayth that God hath giuen vs fayth as well
as any of all the rest, according too his choozing of vs. Wee see then
that fayth dependeth vppon Gods election, or else wee must make S.
Paule a lyer. And so as touching the first poynt, yee see that all such
as cannot abyde to haue predestination plainly and openly spoken of,
are deadly enemies of Gods grace, and would deface it too the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of their power. For (as I sayd afore) the hyding therof were the
ouerthrowing of all religion.</p>
               <p>The second poynt is the assurednesse of our Saluation. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
say wee must dout of it, and that wee cannot come vntoo God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyze

<pb facs="tcp:23289:29"/>
any person. For had wee once that foredeele at his hand, that he were
neuer so little beholden vntoo vs: then we might well go too lawe with
hun. But forasmuch as he on his side is nothing at all bounde vntoo
vs, but wee altoogither vntoo him: let vs see now what wee shall win
by our contending with him. For if wee will needes constreyne God
too deale alyke with all men, he should haue lesse libertie than mortall
creatures. If a man bee riche, he may doo what he listeth with his
owne goods: if he bee liberall too some one, is it reason he should bee
sewed at the Lawe for it, and that euery man should demaund the lyke
summe of him? Behold, a man of his good will aduanceth one whom
he loueth: now if all poore folke should come and require him too doo
as much for them, as it were of bound dewtie, were it not a fond thing?
Uerily a man may adopt the farthest straunger in the world too be his
chyld and heire,<note place="margin">Math. 5. g. 45.</note> and it is free for him so too doo. Behold, God is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
too all men: for he maketh his sunne too shyne both vppon good
and bad. Onely he reserueth a certeine part of men on whom too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
the priuiledge of adopting them too his children. What shall
wee now gayne by murmuring ageinst him? If any man say, that
then he should seeme too bee an accepter of persons:<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. d. 25.</note> No, it is not so:
for he choozeth not the riche, and letteth the poore go: he choozeth not
noble men and gentlemen,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. a. 26.</note> rather than men of no estimation and bace
degree. And therefore it cannot bee sayd that there is any accepting of
persons before God. For in choozing those that are vnwoorthy, he
hath no respect but only too his owne mere goodnesse: nother passeth

wee haue not the skill too thinke one good thought of doyng well, and
much lesse therefore are able too doo well in deede. Although God
should tarie for vs a hundred thousand yeers, if wee could continew so
long in the world: yit is it certeine that wee should neuer come vntoo
him, nor doo any thing else than increase the mischiefe continually too
our owne condemnation. Too bee short, the longer that men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God? How obey wee him? How haue we a quiet mynd that yeeldeth
it selfe according too his fayth? All these things come of him. And so
it followeth that he is fayne too doo all himselfe. Wherfore let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that in saying that God choze vs before the creation of the world,
S. Paule presuppozeth the thing that is trew: namely that God could
not see any thing in vs, saue the euill that was there: for there was
not one droppe of goodnesse for him too fynd. So then, seying he hath
chozen vs, yee see it is a very manifest record of his free goodnesse.
And for the same cause,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

worker: it is sayd, that the elder should serue the yonger. Wee see then
how S. Paule declareth there more at large, the thing that he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
heere briefly: that is too wit, that whereas God choze vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the creation of the world, therein he sheweth sufficiently, that one
man is not more woorthie or excellent than another, that he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
too any deseruing. Therefore seyng that the putting of difference
betweene Iacob and Esawe, was before they had doone eyther good
or euill: it came not of the woorkes, but of the caller. Then must all
praise bee yeelded vntoo God, and nothing at all bee reserued too man.

chaunged: that cannot come too passe without Gods woorking &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
too of his hand. Thus yee see that the cause why God delayeth
the calling of those whom he had chozen, is (say I) too touche them
too the quicke by his holy spirit, that he may make them too walke in
his obedience. For when wee see them refourmed vpon the suddayne,
and beyond the common expectation and opinion of men: therin we
perceyue that God hath vttered his power in them, as I sayde afore.
And agein on the other part, euery of vs is conuicted by experience,
that wee bee beholden too God for all the good that is in vs. For when
wee bee naturally inclyned too any vyce, and afterward the same is
corrected: wee perceyue well that God hath looked mercifully vppon
vs. Yee perceyue then that wee haue so much the more cause too hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vs, seyng wee were in the way of perdition, till he had drawen vs
out of it. And it standeth vs in hand too mark that well: For there are
some fantasticall heades, which imagin that God dooth so guyde his
chozen ones by his holy spirit, that they bee sanctifyed aforehand, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from the tyme that they bee borne intoo the worlde, as soone as they
come out of their moothers womb: but the contrarie appeereth. And
in good sooth wee see how S. Paule in another text speaking too the
faythfull,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. d. 29.</note> sayeth, some of you were plundged in couetousnesse, some
were giuen too crueltie, some were scorners, some were whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and looee lyuers, and othersome were gluttons and drunkardes:
and too bee short, yee were full of all vnclenesse: but God hauyng
chaunged you, and made you cleane from such filthinesse and infection,
hath dedicated you too himselfe. Agein he sayeth too the Romanes,

you too himselfe. So then, whereas it is sayd in this text, that God
choze his seruantes to make them walke in holinesse of life: it is not
ment that he is bound too gouerne them with his holy spirit eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
their chyldhood forth. For (as I haue sayd alredy) experience sheweth
that he letteth them runne astray, till conuenient tyme bee come for too
call them. But yit must wee alwayes beare in mynd, that Gods choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of vs, was too the end too call vs too holinesse of lyfe. For if he
should let vs alone still as wretched castawayes: surely wee could doo
nothing but all manner of naughtinesse, according too the corruption
that is in vs. The good then proceedeth of his free bestowed mercy,

any one place only, but throughout all the whole holie scripture. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whensoeuer Gods wil is mencioned, it is to shew that men cannot
bring ought of their owne. Neuerthelesse S. Paule setteth downe
heere a woord of ouerplus, and sayeth, <hi>according too the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
As if he had sayd, truly seing that Gods will is the cause of our
saluation, wee should not fleete too and froo, and seeke other reasons &amp;
meanes therof: Howbeit forasmuch as men are so vnthankefull and
malitious, that they would alwayes darken Gods glory: &amp; so puffed
vp with fond ouerweening, that they continually chalendge more too
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongeth vntoo them: therfore if they be not sufficiently
perswaded of Gods wil, let them vnderstand that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the good
pleasure of his will: that is too say, of a free inclined wil which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

way or other, but vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

why God hath chozen vs, woold (if it lay in them) ouerthrowe his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng
ordinance: for the one is vnseparable from the other. If
God haue chozen vs as it is shewed vs heere: then can nothing hang
vppon our deserts, nor vppon aught that wee myght haue too comme,
but God wrought it according too his owne free inclyned will, and
found not any other reason (to moue him therto) than his owne good
pleasure. If any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> think this to be strange geere, it is bycause they
would be haylefellow with God. And heerin appeereth their diulish
malapertnesse, that they cannot suffer God to raine freely, as the thing
that he lyketh myght bee receyued as good, iust, &amp; ryghtfull, without
geynsaying. But let such folke barke lyke doggs asmuch as they list,

and boast and seeke armes too innoble our selues: for wee see how the
holy Ghost disgradeth all such as thinke themselues too bee aught
woorth. Wherfore let vs consider that if wee bee enemies vntoo God,
wee bee in woorser taking than if wee had neuer bin created.</p>
               <p>Heeruppon S. Paule telleth vs, <hi>that God hath accepted vs in his

God his father too bee the <hi>beloued,</hi> not only in his owne person, but
also in respect of the loue that is extended too all the members of his
bodie: by that meanes wee bee called home agein, and God imbraceth
vs for his children, wheras erst wee were his enemyes and vtterly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of him. But howsoeuer the world go, wee must alwayes come
backe too the election that wee haue spoken of before. For the grace
that is communicated too vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, dothe issewe
lykewyse out of the same spring. Theruppon going foreward with
the matter that I haue touched alredie, he sheweth vs howe greate
neede wee haue too bee welbeloued in Iesus Christ. For if it were not
proued too our faces, wee woold neuer graunt (I meane vnfeynedly)
that wee bee beholden too God for all things. For wee bee alwayes
laboring too aduaunce our selues some way or other, and euery of vs
seeketh how he may reserue somewhat too himself, though it bee but
the mountenance of a pinnes poynt. But contrariwyze S. Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that God must be fayne too loue vs out of our selues, and that
if he lyke well of vs, it must not bee in respect of our owne selues. And
why? For wee be prisoners and bonds<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vnder the yoke and tyrannie of Satan, and finally wee bee shet vp in
the bondage of death, till wee bee raunsomed by our Lord Iesus
Christ. Now then wee see that the summe of this lesson is, that men
are admonished too depart out of themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Gods only goodnesse, euen by holding the meane that is
shewed vs heere, which is too resort too our Lord Iesus Christ. For
there are two euill extremities wherof wee must beware.<note place="margin">Math. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 8.</note> The one is,
that in comming too our Lord Iesus Christ, wee must not imagin
that there is anie woorthynesse in vs, why he should make vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his benefytes. And how may that vyce bee corrected? Euen
by being led too Gods free election. For the verye cause why men
presume so much vppon their owne free will, and the very ground also
wheron they build the opinion which they haue conceyued of their
owne deserts and woorthinesse, is that they know not how they bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23289:37"/>
in any other respect, than for that God hath accepted them of
his owne mere free goodnesse, bycause he had chozen them alredie in
his owne euerlasting purpose. Therfore wee cannot by any meanes
father the beginning of our saluation vppon God, except wee confesse
that which is shewed vs heere, namely that wee were vtterly damned
and accursed at such tyme as he adopted vs, &amp; that the verie originall
cause of his adopting of vs, is for that he had predestinated vs before
hand, yea, euen before the making of the world. Marke that for one
poynt. The other euill extremitie whereof wee must likewyze beware,
is speculation. Many fantasticall folke will say, As for mee I shall
neuer knowe whether God hath chozen mee or no, and therfore I must
bee fayne too abyde still in my destruction. Yea, but that is for want of
comming too Iesus Christ. How knowe wee that God hath chozen vs
before the making of the world? By beleeuing in Iesus Christ. I sayd
heeretofore that faith sprinketh of election, and is the fruite of it, which
sheweth that the roote is hidden within. He then that beleeueth, is
therby assured that God hath wrought in him: and fayth is as it were
the copie or counterpane which God deliuereth vs of the originall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister
of our adoption. God hath his euerlasting purpose or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and that he keepeth alwayes too himselfe as a chiefe president
or originall record, whereof he gyueth vs a copie by fayth. I speake
heere after the manner of men, for wee knowe that God vseth nother
paper nor parchment too ingroce vs in: and I haue told you alreadye,
that too speake properly, the register wherein wee bee inrolled, is our
Lord Iesus Christ. Neuerthelesse God reserueth too himselfe the
knowledge of our election, as a Prince would doo an originall Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
Register, or Record: but yit he giueth vs copies or counterpanes
of it, autenticall ynough, in that he imprinteth it in our hartes by his
holy spirit, that wee bee his children. Yee see then that the fayth which
we haue in our Lord Iesus Christ, is ynough too warrant vs our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and therefore what seeke wee more? I tolde you euen now that
Iesus Christ is the looking glasse wherein God beholdeth vs, when it
is his will to lyke well of vs. Likewyse also on our side he is the glasse
wheruppon wee must cast our eyes and lookes, when wee mynde too
come too the knowledge of our election.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 12.</note> For whosoeuer beleeueth in
Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5. c. 15.</note> is Gods chylde, and consequently his heire, as I haue
declared before. Then dooth it followe, that if wee haue fayth, wee bee
also adopted. For wherfore doth God giue vs fayth? Euen bycause he


<pb facs="tcp:23289:38"/>
choze vs before the creation of the world. This therefore is an infasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
order, that inasmuch as the faythfull receyue Gods grace and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
his mercy, holding Iesus Christ for their head, too the intent too
obteine saluation by his meanes: they knowe assuredly that God hath
adopted them. Trew it is that election is of it selfe secrete: it is so
deepe &amp; hidden a determination, as it beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ueth vs to honor it. Yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
God sheweth it too vs so farrefoorth as is requisite, and
as he knoweth it too bee for our benefite and welfare: and that dooeth
he when he inlyghteneth vs with the beleefe of his Gospell. Thus yee
see why that after S. Paule had spoken of Gods euerlasting election,
he setteth foorth Iesus Christ, as the partie too whom wee must resort,
too bee assured that God loueth vs and auoweth vs for his children,
and consequently that he had adopted vs before wee knewe him, yea
and before the world was made.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we haue to gather vppon this sentence that the doctrine
of predestination serueth not too carie vs away intoo wandering spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations:
but to beate downe al pryde in vs, &amp; the fond opinion which
wee conceyue alwayes of our owne woorthinesse and deseruings: and
too shewe that God hath such free power, priuiledg, and souereyn do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ouer vs, that he may refuze whom he listeth, and chooze whom
he listeth: and that by that meanes wee bee led too gloryfye him, and
therwith too acknowledge that his choozing of vs is in Iesus Christ,
too the end wee should bee hild fast vnder the fayth of his Gospell. For
if wee bee his members and take him for our head, according too the
couenant and holie vnion that is betwixt him &amp; vs, which can neuer
bee broken so long as wee beleeue his Gospell: wee must repayre too
him too be made sure of our saluation, bycause we see and feele by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that God had adopted and chozen vs, and that he presently
calleth vs, &amp; telleth vs that the assurance which he hath giuen vs and
dayly giueth vs by his Gospell, namely that he will bee our father, &amp;
specially his ingrauing of it in our harts by his holy spirit, is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull
thing. For the Gospell may well bee preached too all men,
yea euen too the castawayes: but yit for all that God is not so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse
too them, as too touch them too the quicke. Therfore when wee
haue Gods adoption ingrauen in our harts, then (as shalbee declared
further herafter) wee haue a good and vndeceyuable gage, that God
will guyde vs vntoo the end, and that sith he hath begunne too lead vs
intoo the waye of saluation, he will bring vs too the perfection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untoo


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23289:38"/>
he calleth vs, verely bycause that without him we could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew
so much as one day.</p>
               <p>But now let vs fall downe before the maiestie of our good God,
with acknowledgment of our faults, praying him too make vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
them more and more, that being vtterly ashamed of them, wee
may hate our vyces, and al our whole lyfe, with the naughtinesse and
frowardnesse therof, &amp; resort to him who alonly is able to remedie the
same, &amp; not swarue one way or other from him, as he communicateth
hymselfe too vs in our Lorde Iesus Christe: but keepe on right foorth
too hym, acknowledging that as we be chosen in hym, so also wee bee

children, notwithstanding that wee bee woorthy of death before him.
Thus yee see that the assurance of our saluation (as is sayd in the song
of zacharie) is that God bee mercifull too vs and forgiue vs our sinnes
whereby wee were become his enemies.<note place="margin">

in mynd, that the cleere release of our sinnes through Gods free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is not doone without the raunsome that was payd by our Lord
Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. d. 18.</note> not in golde nor siluer (as sayeth S. Peter in his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle)
but in such wyse that he which was the vnspotted Lambe, was
fayne too serue that turne his owne selfe. Wherefore whensoeuer wee
intend too seeke Gods fauour and mercy, let vs fasten all our wittes
vpon the death &amp; passion of our Lord Iesus Christ, that we may there
fynd wherwith too appease Gods wrath. And furthermore seyng that
our sinnes are done away by such payment and satisfaction: let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that wee cannot bring aught of our owne, for the which wee
should bee reconcyled vntoo God. Wherin wee see how the diuell hath
by his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yghtes cut of all hope of saluation from the world, by bearing
men in hand that they must euery man raunsome himself, and make
his owne attonement with God. And that is the very thing which men
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all good woorkes, merites, and vertewes in Papistrie. For too what
ende tend all the inuentions which they haue forged? Why martir
they themselues after so many fashions, so as men neuer make an end
day nor night, but are euer still making of new wyndlasses and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
The marke that all these things ame at, is too pacifie God. And
so all the good woorkes which are so counted in Papistrie, are nothing
else but meanes whereby too make amendes for sinne. Howbeit that
is but a defacing of the raunsome whereof S. Paule speaketh heere.
For there is (as yee would say) an inseparable bond betweene these
twoo things, namely that God putteth our sinnes out of his remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and drowneth them in the bottom of the sea: and moreouer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the payment that was offered him in the person of his only sonne.
Therefore wee cannot atteyne the one without the other. Wherforeif
wee intend too haue Gods fauour, let vs consider that wee bee his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
till he haue pardoned all our sinnes of his owne free goodnesse:
and yit notwithstanding, that our Lord Iesus Christ must bee fayne


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23289:40"/>
too step in betweene him and vs. For the sacrifyze of his death serueth
too purchase vs an euerlasting attonement, so as wee must alwayes
flee thither for refuge. Trew it is that the whole lyfe but of Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is become our raunsome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the obedience which he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too God his father in this world, was too make amends for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
offence, and for all the iniquities wherthrough wee bee ronne in
arrerages. Howbeit S. Paule speaketh heere purposely of his blud,
bycause it behoueth vs too resort too his death and passion, as too the
sacrifyze which is of power too blot out all our sinnes. And for that
cause hath God represented in figures vnder the lawe, that men could
not bee reconcyled vntoo him but only by that meane. Now it is trew
that Iesus Christ did not only shed his blud, namely at his death: but
also feele the feare and terrour which ought too haue lyghted vpon vs.
But S. Paule dooth heere vnder one parrell comprehend the whole
after the ordinarie maner of the holy scripture. Too bee short, let vs
repose all our right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>usnesse in Gods shewing of himselfe mercifull
towardes vs of his owne free goodnesse: and let vs not presume too
face him with any vertew of our owne, thereby too bynd him vntoo vs:
but let it suffize vs that he receyueth vs intoo his fauour, freely without
any desert of ours, onely bycause the rememberance of our sinnes is
buryed out of his sight. And agein, let vs vnderstand, that the same can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
bee doone but by the death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ,
and that that is the thing wheruppon wee must wholly rest.</p>
               <p>Heeruppon S. Paule addeth, <hi>that all is done according too the
richesse of Gods grace.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> without cause dooth he heere magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye
Gods mercie which he vttereth in receyuing vs too fauour. For
wee see on the one syde how men doo wilfully ouershoote themselues
through their foolish ouerweening: For most men haue alwayes i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
that they myght make their attonement with God by their
owne satisfactions, and I wote not what shiftes besydes. Seeing
then that men are so farre ouerseene in their owne imaginations, S.
Paule too exclude all such dealing, sayth that wee must bee rauished
in loue with the richenesse of Gods goodnesse. He could haue sayd
simply that God dooth all according too his grace: but he setteh downe
heere his greate treasures, too the intent that men should not bee so
fond, as too bring as it were but a farthing, for the discharge of ten
hundred thousand crownes. And truly when the Papists prattle of
their satisfactions, they say not that they bee able too doo it throughly


<pb facs="tcp:23289:41"/>
in all poyntes: but they are of opinion that with the death and passion
of our Lord Iesus Christ, they also are able too bring somewhat of
their owne, and too doo so much by patches and peeces, that God shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee
satisfied and contented. Thus yee see what a diuelish opinion
reigneth in papistrie, for they will needes found masses, they will
needs bable many prayers, they will needs gad on pilgrimage, they
will needs keepe this feast and that feast, they will needs performe I
wot not what deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they wil needs weare sack cloth next their skin:
and all too help foorth the death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ:
as who should say, it were not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ynough of it self. But S. Paule
telleth vs that Gods goodnesse as it is shewed vs in Iesus Christ, is
so greate a treasure, that all other things must needs giue ouer and be
thrust vnder fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te. And seing that God vseth so greate bountifulnesse
as wee ought too bee wholy rauished at it: is it not too outrageouse a
presumptuousnesse, when wee will needs bring our owne pelting
trash, as though our going on pilgrimage, &amp; our dooing of some other
deuotions were of any valew or estimation? Is it not al one, as though
the blud of Iesus Christ were not a sufficient pryce, I say a sufficient
pryce and raunsome for our saluation? Yee see then on the one syde,
how S. Paule ment heere too cut of all occasions of the fond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that men conceyue in surmizing themselues able too pacifye
Gods wrath by their owne satisfactions and paymentes: and on the
other syde how he purpozed too succour our feeblenesse. For although
wee bee giuen too beleeue wonderous well of our owne vertuosusnesse,
and too beare ourselues in hand that God is greatly beholden vntoo
vs: yit notwithstanding, when it commeth too the calling vppon God
in good earnest, and too the putting of our trust in him: then if Satan

we be so dismayed, that all the promises of the holy scripture,

Christ, cannot make vs too haue any hope. S. Paule therfore too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
this vyce of vnbeleefe which is too deepely rooted in vs, doth
heere set before vs the greate treasures of Gods goodnesse, too the end
that all the distruste which wee can conceyue, may bee as it were swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

Christ which are wanting in our selues, and that his death &amp; passion
will bee a sufficient sacrifyze, too put away the rememberance of all
our misdeedes. Howbeit dooth it followe therefore, that all men are
parttakers of this benefite which is purchaced for vs by our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ? No: for the vnbeleeuers haue nother part nor portion in
it. Then is it a speciall priuiledge for those whom God gathereth too
himselfe.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. a. 4.</note> Also S. Paule sheweth, that eyther wee must haue fayth, or
else Christ shall not boote vs at all. Although then that Christ bee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the redeemer of the whole world, yit dooth his death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
aduauntage none but such as receiue the thing that S. Paule shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
heere. And so wee see that when wee once know the benefites that
are brought vs by Christ, and which he offereth vs dayly by his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
we muste also bee knyt vntoo hym by faith. For the Turkes,
Iewes, and Papistes, and all other lyke are cut of and estranged from
Christ, &amp; rot away in theyr owne filth, bycause they presume to worke
wonders of themselues. For it is a common principle among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,
Iewes, Turkes, and all the Heathen men that euer were, that
they must appease Gods wrath. And how? By a great sort of meanes
of their owne deuising, and of euery mans imaginyng in his owne
brayne. Such men therfore haue no part in Christ. Wherfore if faith
be the key that openeth vs the doore to inioy the treasure whereof S.
Paule spake euen now: then is that the next way too make vs riche, so
farre forth as shalbe requisite for our saluation, so as we shal not want
any thyng, if wee bee knyt vnto Christ by fayth.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, it is not for nought that S. Paule hath heere
set downe this twoo wordes of <hi>wisdom and vnderstanding.</hi> For they
doo vs too wit, that the lerning of the Gospell is ynough too bring vs
to all perfection, and that whatsoeuer is added moreouer, is but dung,
filth, and rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nesse. Too be short, S. Paules intytling of the Gospell
with those twoo honorable termes, is too the ende that euery man
should quietly giue eare to the things that God teacheth him by the

meanes of his only sonne, and that wee should yeeld our selues s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s
and are alwayes desirous too heere somme new thing. Too the end
therfore that wee bee not so wauering, nor ouerled by foolish desyre of
knowing more than is lawfull for vs too knowe: let vs marke well
how S. Paule sayeth here, that if we haue once profited throughly in
the Gospel, we shall find there all wisdome to the full, so as we may
reiect all other things, not only as needlesse, but also as noysome, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that by them wee shalbee turned from the pure doctrine, wherby
it is his will too haue vs knit vntoo him. Too bee short, S. Paule
ment to shew heere, that God dooeth vs an inestimable good turne,
when he voutsafeth to call vs too the knowledge of our Lord Iesus
Christ his only sonne, and that when we haue him, wee must dispyze
all other things, and not bee trubbled with a foolish desire of knowing
this or that, bycause that (as I haue sayd alredy) the full perfection
of all our knowledge is there, that is to wit, in our Lord Iesus Christ.
And here yee see also why it is sayd to the Colossians,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1. d. 25.</note> that he had bin
a faithfull teacher, yea euen too bring men too the perfection of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. b. 6.</note>
Indeede he confesseth that he was rude and homely of speech,
and that he had nother the wisdom nor the eloquence that was hyghly
commended in the world: but yit he declareth, that if his doctrine
were receyued, there should bee found a full substance in it for the full
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rrishment of mens soules, and that there needeth not any more too
be added vntoo it. When we heere these things now adayes, we must
take warning to brydle our selues, &amp; to represse the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd ouer curious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that is rooted too deeply in vs, that wee may hold vs too the pure
doctrine of the Gospell, &amp; rest wholy therupon. Thus yee see in effect
what wee haue too gather vppon that streyne.</p>
               <p>Heerewithall let vs marke the thing that I haue touched alredye:
namely that as oft as the Gospell is preached, so oft is Gods grace
spred out vpon vs. If we acknowledge his goodnesse and liberalitie,
which he maketh vs too perceyue by his moystening of the earth, too
the end it should yeeld vs fruits too the sustenance of our bodies: much
more may wee vnderstand, that when God sendeth vs the woord of


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23289:42"/>
saluation, he not only watereth vs too the welfare of our soules, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
giueth vs so largely therof too drink, as wee may bee throughly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
therwith. For S. Paule thinkes it not ynough too say, that
wheras wee bee barren wee haue some refresshing by the Gospell:
but he sayeth, that it is as if God should poure downe al undance of
water vppon vs, and that wee myght bee so watered and refreshed
with it, as wee myght gather substance and lustinesse of it too hold out
to the end. And so yee see in what wyse we ought to esteeme of Gods
goodnesse, when he voutsafeth too drawe vs too him by meanes of his
Gospell, and that therwithall wee enter into possession of the benefites
that haue bin purchased for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, according as
he offereth them too vs by his woord, and will haue vs also to receyue
them by fayth.</p>
               <p>Nowe for a larger openyng of the matter, he addeth immediately,
<hi>That his so dooyng is, bycause he hath vttered the secrete of his
vvyll vntoo vs, euen accordyng to his ovvne good pleasure vvhich
he had purposed afore in hym selfe.</hi> Loe heere an other thing which
ought to aduance the dignitie of the Gospell yit more: whiche is, that
there we haue the secretes which were hydden heretofore in God. And
it is not here onely that S. Paule speaketh after this maner: but wee
shall see yit a larger discourse of it in the second chapter.<note place="margin">Rom. 16. d. 25.</note> And not only
in this Epistle,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Cor. 2. b. 7. &amp;. 4. a. 1.</note> but also euerywhere els, he sheweth howe wee ought to
bee as it were rauished at the preaching of the Gospell, bycause God
dooth there open the things that were incomprehensible to all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. d. 19.</note>
and which no man would neuer haue beleeued, or once thought of.
For he seemed too haue chosen the onely lyne of Abraham,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1. d. 29.</note> in such wise
as if he had cast away all the world besides. Therefore it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
thyng when he poured out his grace in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon al nations.
Yit notwithstanding wee knowe, that at suche tyme as Iesus Christe
came intoo the worlde, the very selfe same people were growen out of
kynde, and Gods doctrine was so corrupted, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but superstition among the Iewes. It seemed then that all had
bin past hope of recouerie, when sodenly beyond the opinion of al men,
behold, saluation was offered too all nations. Beholde, Christe which
had erst byn hidden in deepe darknesse, yea, and in so deepe darkenesse,
as there was not any hope that euer he shoulde haue comme out of it,
rose vp as the Daysimne of rightuousnesse,<note place="margin">Es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i. 4. a. 2.</note> to giue light to the worlde.
For this cause therfore dooth S. Paul say, that in the Gospell wee bee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:43"/>
made priuie too the secrets of Gods wyll. Trewe it is, that at the first
sight there seemeth to bee nothyng but simple stuffe in the Gospel. And
that is a cause also why many scoffers thinke that the things which are
conteyned in the Gospell, doo serue but for idiots: and they beare them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues
in hande, that they are able too deuize many wyttier thynges in
theyr owne dreames and dotages, than all the doctrine is that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
Iesus Christe. But such folke are vnworthy to taste of the thyng
that is shewed vs heere: for theyr pride dooth vtterly blynde them, and
make them starke doltes. Notwithstandyng, how s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>euer they fare, yit

                  </gap>ll wel, that there is a diuine maiestie in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Gospell. And for that cause S. Paule doeth giue vs to
wyt in this same text, that our commyng thyther must not bee to learne
any common thyng, but too lyft vp our selues aboue the world. For we
shall neuer bee good scollers to Godward, nor neuer be in any toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it in his schoole, except we mount aboue the world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
the things that God speaketh with his owne holy mouth. To
be short, the beginnyng and entrance of our fayth, is lowlynesse. But
how can men wel humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, vnlesse they know that the thinges
which God telleth them, doo farre surmount theyr owne wyt and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie?
Ye see then that the thyng whereat S. Paul amed, is, that wee
should reuerence the Gospell, assuring our selues, that it is not for vs to
iudge whether God haue spoken well, or yll. For it becommeth vs too
be fully resolued, that all that euer commeth from hym, is infinite wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yea and such wisedome as is vtterly faultlesse. To the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that all glorying may be beaten downe in our selues, &amp; wee learne
to reuerence soberly and modestly the doctrine that is preached too vs
in Gods name: S. Paule hath purposely set downe this secret.</p>
               <p>And too the end wee should knowe how much wee be bounde vntoo
God, he repeteth this woord, <hi>According to his good pleasure,</hi> which
he had set downe before. And that is doone too put awaye, and too
shet out all opinion which men might conceiue of their owne woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For Gods good pleasure can haue no place, vnlesse men be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from al deseruyng, and repayre to hym vtterly empty. For so soone
as wee presume too bring any thyng at all vntoo God, surely it is an
aduauncyng of our selues too the defacing of Gods grace, so as it may
haue no more beautie nor preheminence among vs, as it ought too
haue. Too the end therfore that men should forbeare such presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
S. Paule sendeth vs styll backe too Gods good pleasure: as


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23289:43"/>
if he should say, that there was none other cause of the preaching of the
Gospell too the world, than the only franke and free goodnesse of God.
Yit notwithstanding, too represse all ouerboldnesse of men, he addeth,
that <hi>God had purposed the said ordinaunce, and the said high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
determination of his wyll aforehand in hymselfe.</hi>
For what is the cause that men take so great libertie of questionyng,
disputing, and going to lawe with God, but for that (to their seemyng)
they treate of matters which ought to be open &amp; manifest vntoo them?
So then, S. Paule perceiuyng vs too bee so foolishe and rashe, as to
presume ouer boldly to be inquisitiue of Gods purpose, saith it is a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
letter, and that God hath his purpose in hymselfe, and that it is not
lawfull for creatures too mount so high, and that if they doo so, it is the
next way too cast them downe, and too breake their neckes. Trewe it
is, that wee may well apply our whole indeuer too knowe Gods wyll:
howbeit, that must bee no further than he hath vttered in his woord: for
his woord is our light. But if God doo once holde his peace, he will
haue vs too brydle and as it were too imprison our selues, and not too
start out any further, for if wee woulde needes knowe more than is
graunted vs, that is too say, more than wee ought too know, &amp; more
than is imparted too vs by his woord: it were but an entering further
and further intoo a maze, or rather intoo the bottome of hell. Therfore
let vs marke well, howe S. Paules meaning in this text, is that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
God keepeth his purpose to himself, it becommeth vs to stoope,
and too holde our selues contented too bee ignorant of it. For it is a
cursed wisdome, and such a wisdome as sendeth vs too the pit of hell,
when wee take leaue too knowe more than God hath taught vs. And
contrariwise wee bee wyzer in our ignorance than all the wyze men of
the world, when wee take not vppon vs too knowe any thing further
than Gods woord guydeth and gouerneth vs. Trew it is that there is
not any mo than onely one single will in God. Neuerthelesse he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the same vntoo vs according too our capacitie, and so farre foorth
as is expedient and profitable for vs. As for example, wee haue seene
that the forgiuenesse of sinnes is a poynt that wee cannot ouerpasse nor
forbeare: and therefore zacharie calles it the knowledge of saluation.
Agein, it standeth vs on hand too knowe where the forgiuenesse of our
sinnes is too bee sought for. For if wee haue not Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Luke. 1. g. 77.</note> wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
still enemyes vntoo God, wee haue no agreement nor rest in our
selues, and Gods iustice must needes pursue vs: but Iesus Christ is


<pb facs="tcp:23289:44"/>
our peace. Furthermore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know the things that are witnessed to
vs by Gods woord, wee must therwithall reuerence the misteries that
are hidden from vs, as hath bin sayd alredy, and must hereafter be said
agein, when wee come too Gods election. And S. Paule dooth yit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein
set downe heere the woord of foreordeyning or forepurpozing, to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hewe that God had predestinated vs before the making of the world,
and yit that the same was hidden. Yea verily: but nowe is the same
discouered vntoo vs, sayeth he. Thus yee see in effect, that the thing
which wee haue too beare in mynde, is that wee bee not called too the
knowledge of the Gospell by our owne towardnesse, nor for that any
of vs putteth foorth himself too it of his owne accord, nor for that wee
haue bound God vntoo vs by any vertue of ours: but for that God of
his owne infinite goodnesse listed too inlyghten vs. And he hath not
doone it bycause it came sodeinly in his mynde too doo it, as men are
woont too doo, who are caryed with sodeine braydes: but bycause he
had determined the same in his owne purpose, euen from before all
tyme. And if our wittes bee ticklish and prouoke vs too bee inquisitiue
and too say, How so? Had God chozen vs aforehand? And why then
did he not vtter it vntoo vs sooner? How happeneth it that it was not
perceyued ere this? too the ende wee should not so ouershoote our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
S. Paule sayeth that this purpose was after a sort locked vp in
God, till it was vttered vntoo vs. And so, too bee short, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs too knowe any more than is vttered vntoo vs in the Gospell:
and looke what is shewed vs there, it behoueth vs too reuerence it. And
for the same cause it is added, <hi>that his so dooyng vvas too set foorth
the same in the fulnesse of tyme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now heerin he sheweth, that men may wel vexe themselues, but yit
shall they come short of their purpose, and all their witts &amp; imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall fayle them, if they go about too knowe more than God hath
giuen them leaue to know. For if any man demaund why God hasted
no rather too do it: therin he sheweth that he would be wiser tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.
And is not that a diuelish pride? Is the creature woorthie to go vpon
the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, when it aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth it self so hygh? For this cause S. Paule
sayeth, that the appoynting therof belongeth vnto God. For if a man
may set order after this maner, in his owne house &amp; say: I will haue
my folke to fare thus, I will haue them to drinke such drinke, I will
haue them too eat that kynd of bread, I will haue them lodged after
this maner: how much more ought we too let God doo so? why should


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23289:44"/>
he haue lesse priuiledge than woormes of the earth? Therfore let vs
giue God leaue to dispose of his church, &amp; of the welfare of his chozen,
as lyketh best himself. And as for the tyme, let vs take that for the full
tyme which it shall please him too shewe vs. For it is not for vs too be

And this is the very selfsame thing that we haue seene alredy in the

wherthrough men wander away in mounting vp hygher than
is lawfull for them to do. Therfore let vs conclude, that it is Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
office too appoynt tymes and seasons, and that wee must not
think any other too be the dew, than that which he appoynteth. For
albeit that winter and sommer bee ordinarye with vs euery yeere: yit
if sommer come ouer late, wee must brydle our selues, and not grudge
ageinst God. Wee may well say, alas, if it pleased God too send vs
heate, it should bee well welcome. But yit in the meane while wee
must fully resolue our selues thus: It belongeth too God too gouerne,
and all souereintie and authoritie perteyne too him. If wee ought too
behaue our selues so modestly as in respect of the order of nature which
is common among vs, and wherein God shewes himselfe familiarly
vntoo vs: what ought wee too doo when wee come too the scanning of

see why S. Paule spake heere expresly of the fulnesse of tyme, as if he
should say, that wee can neuer profit in the Gospell, till wee yeeld God
so much honour, as too hold our selues contented with his onely will, so
as wee step not foorth too reply ageinst him, nor face him with our
iangling, but glorify him by acknowledging his will too bee the rule
of all wisdome, of all ryght, and of all equitie.</p>
               <p>And for the better declaration hereof, he addeth immediatly, <hi>that
it vvas too gather all thinges toogither, as vvell in heauen as in
earth, by Iesus Christ, in himselfe.</hi> As touching this woord <hi>gather,</hi>
S. Paule ment too shewe vs thereby how wee bee all of vs horribly
scattered, till such time as our Lord Iesus Christ set vs in aray agein:
and this is verifyed not onely of vs, but also of all other creatures. Too
bee short, it is all one as if he had sayd, that the whole order of nature is
as good as defaced, and all thinges decayed and disordered in the sinne
of Adam, till wee bee repayred ageyne in the person of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. For although wee beholde Gods woonderfull wisdome,
power, goodnesse, iustice, and rightuousnesse in all creatures: yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
there are markes of sinne both aboue and beneath, and
all creatures are subiect too corruption, and all is disordered by reason
that God hateth and reiecteth vs.<note place="margin">Rom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Needes therefore must a restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bee made by Iesus Christ. And that is the thing that is ment by
the gathering toogither that S. Paule speaketh of heere, too the ende
wee would learne too mislyke of our selues, and too bee ashamed of the
disorder that is in our selues, and wherwith the whole world is fylled
through our sinfull lyfe: and moreouer learne also too magnify Gods
goodnesse so much the more. Then on the one side the holy Ghost war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs in this text, that not onely wee our selues are out of order, but
also that wee haue brought the whole world too the same poynt, and
doo keepe it still at the same stay dayly by our sinnes, and that there is
none other remedy thereof, but that Iesus Christ must bee fayne too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
all agein, and make such a gathering and vnion, as wee may bee
knit agein too our God. And so yee see the first poynt that wee haue
too marke vppon this text. Truly this thing is spoken in fewe words:
but it had neede too bee muzed vppon more at length. For it is the
thing wheraboutes wee ought too occupie our selues both earely and
late, that when wee looke intoo our selues, wee myght bethinke vs in


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23289:45"/>
this wise: who art thou o wretched creature? for thou seest thou art se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from thy God euen from thy birth: behold, thou art his enemy
and inheritour of his wrath: and on the other side there is nothing in
thy selfe which tendeth not too naughtinesse and frowardnesse: &amp; thou
oughtest not onely too feele this disorder in thine owne person, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
too perceyue that all thinges else are out of order through the whole
world by reason of thy frowardnesse. Therefore let vs sink downe and
bee ashamed of it, and therwithall confesse how much wee bee indet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vntoo God, for his voutsafyng too gather vs toogether in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his onely sonne, euen vs that haue so torne a sunder the thinges
that he had set in so goodly order.</p>
               <p>And for the same cause S. Paule speaketh heere, not only of men,
(which were estraunged from God afore by reason of sin): but also of
<hi>all things that are in heauen and earth:</hi>

euen the verye Angells. For although Gods glorie shyne foorth in
them, and that they were neuer yit separated from him: yit neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> gathered toogither by our Lord
Iesus Christ, and that after twoo sorts. For albeeit that they neuer
swarued asyde, ne fell from that they were at the first, and that Gods
ryghtuousnesse doo alwayes shewe it self in them, insomuch that they
bee as it were mirrours and paternes of it: yit notwithstanding, if
God li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted too looke vppon them with rigour, they should fynd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
farre short of the perfection of ryghtuousnesse that is in him, as
it is sayd in the booke of Iob.<note place="margin">Iob. 4. d. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>8.</note>
Furthermore, there is yit one other
reason too bee matched with this: which is, that the Aungells should
not hane such constancie and stedinesse as were requisyte, vnlesse Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ had so stablished them as they myght neuer fall. Thus yee
see one way how they were gathered togither. But this gathering
wherof S. Paule speaketh heere, is in respect of their vniting agein
vntoo vs. For wee knowe that inasmuch as wee were banished out
of Gods kingdome, wee were cut of from all hope of saluation, so as
the Angells were by and by fayne too become our enemies, and should
bee so still, were it not for the attonement which wee haue with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
by meanes of the head which is common too vs both. And heere
yee see also why that in the ladder that was shewed vntoo Iacob,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. c. 12.</note> it is
said that God stood vppon the toppe of it, and touched both heauen and
earth, and that the Angells went vp and downe on it. Now our Lord
Iesus Christ is the trew liuing and euerlasting God which touched


<pb facs="tcp:23289:46"/>
both heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and earth, bycause that in his persone God hath knit his
owne diuine being (or substance) and the nature of man toogither.
Thus therefore yee see that heauen is open, so as the Angells begin
too acquaynt themselues with vs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. d. 14.</note> yea and too become our seruants, as
is sayd in the Epistle too the Hebrewes, bycause the care of our soules
is committed vntoo them, and they (as is sayd in the thirtie and foure
Psalme) incamp about vs,<note place="margin">Psal. 34. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fynd any fauour at Gods hand, &amp; that yit notwithstanding, now that he

the head, not only of the faythfull, but also of the Angells: he hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
all toogither agein in such wyse, that wheras the diuells make
warre ageinst vs and practize our destruction without ceassing: the
Angells are armed with infinite power too maynteyne vs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee see them not with our eyes: yit must wee certeynly beleeue
that they watch for our welfare. Otherwyse what a thing were it? For
wee knowe that the diuell is as a roring Lion,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

else but too deuoure vs. Wee see what a number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>yghts he hath
too wynd about vs with. Needes then must the Angells haue an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power too defend vs withall. Also it must needes bee, that wee bee
preserued vnder the protection of our Lorde Iesus Christ, who is both
their head and ours too. Thus yee see briefly that the thing which S.
Paule ment too tell vs in this Text, where he saith that we are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
togither agein, is, that wee were scattered asunder before, &amp; that
wee bee not onely reconciled to God by the death and Passion of our
Lord Iesus Christ, but also now henceforth knyt ageyn vntoo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles,
so as they are become our brethren and fellowes, and God hath

of all the enemyes that make warre ageynst vs, tyll wee be gathered

hath declared, that there is none other
grounde of our saluation than Gods free
goodnesse, and that wee must not seeke any
where else for the cause why he choozeth
the one and forsaketh the other. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
vs too holde our selues contented
with his onely will, purpose, &amp; vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
determination. And whosoeuer goeth
any further, must needes stumble intoo such a dimgeon through his


<pb facs="tcp:23289:47"/>
owne rashnesse, as he shall feele that such as cannot honour Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
and euerlasting ordinance with all lowlynesse and reuerence,
must euery one of them (say I) come too shame. Therefore whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
we come to the serching of the cause of our saluation, let vs learne
too father it altoogither vppon God. It is trew that too bee Gods
children and heires it behoueth vs too bee of the body of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, which thing is doone by fayth: but yit can wee not beleeue
the Gospell except God drawe vs theretoo by his holy spirit. Nowe
wee see that he dealeth not alyke with all men. For he could very well
inlyghten all the world, and bring too passe that there should be no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers
at all: but wee see the contrary. Therefore let vs assure our
selues, that be choozeth whom he listeth. For if a man should aske the
reason why he dooth it: it were too loftie a presumptuousnesse, and
that is the very cause that maketh so many ouerweening folke too
breake their owne neckes, for that they cannot fynd in their hartes too
graunt, that God gouerneth men according too his owne will, as of
good ryght he may full well. Furthermore also S. Paule hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set the Iewes and Gentyles both on one euen ground, and that is
a thing that requyreth yit longer discourse. For seyng that God had
chozen Abrahams ofspring, it myght haue bin thought that there had
bin some woorthinesse in them. Surely if wee haue an eye too the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fauour that God shewed too the Iewes, they bee well worthy too
bee preferred before all the rest of the world. But if a man take them
as they bee of themselues: he shall fynd them voyde of all ryghtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For wee must alwayes come backe too this poynt, that God is
not bound nor beholden too any man at all: and his receyuing of the
Iewes by free adoption, is not for that they were better woorth than
other men, or for that they myght make any maner of vaunt at all of
themselues. Therefore yee see why S. Paule sayeth expresly, that they
which beleeued in Iesus Christ in tymes past, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended vnder
Gods election, as well as the others, &amp; that the others ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not boast the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
too bee more worthy, or too haue deserued more than they, but
that all must come too this poynt, that as well of the Iewes as of the
Gentyles God choze whom he lyked and listed, too the ende that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should bee considered in that behalfe but his onely mercy, and
that all mouthes myght bee stopped, and no man bee able too alledge
that be brought any thing of his owne. Howbeit, when S. Paule en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
intoo this comparison betweene the Iewes and the Gentyles,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23289:47"/>
he sayeth that if a man haue an eye too Gods accepting of the Iewes
for his owne peculiar heritage, they were a holy linage, and he had
giuen them his Lawe and promises, by meanes whereof they were
in more excellent and hygh degree, than all the residew whom he had
forsaken and shaken of. But if wee haue an eye vnto God, all mannes
glory must needes bee layd awater. But S. Paule in that place spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
alonely of the forgiuing of our sinnes, and of our imbracing of
Gods grace by fayth: which things he sheweth cannot bee fathered

a common opinion, that the Iewes were a holy lynage, bycause they
were descended of Abrahams race: very well (sayeth he), howsoeuer
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he cace stande, wee haue none other refuge nor assurance of saluation,
but too beleeue in Iesus Christ: for he wist well that men are vtterly
fordoone and lost in themselues, bycause they bring nothing with them
but Gods wrath and curse. Therfore lyke as in those textes S. Paule
hath shewed that men beguyle themselues, if they imagin that they
haue any desert or woorthinesse in them: so now for the better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the same doctrine, and too take away all disputing, and too
beate backe all replyings, he bringeth vs too this welspring, namely,
that God not onely giueth fayth too whom he listeth, but also hath
elected and chozen vs before the making of the world. Yee see then
that the thing which wee haue too marke in effect, is that all men from
the most too the least are indaungered vntoo God, and there is none so
holie or excellent, that can exempt himselfe from that generall state
of men.</p>
               <p>Nowe hereupon S. Paule magnifieth Gods goodnesse, in that the
Ephesians were gathered toogither, and made all one with those that
were hild and accounted afore for Gods people, and for the housholde
folke of his Church. Before the Ephesians beleued the Gospell, there
was great diuersitie betweene them, as shalbe declared yit more at
large in the second Chapter. But notwithstanding that the beleuyng
Iewes which had alredy bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to our Lord Iesus Christ, were
as brethren too the Angels of heauen, for so muche as they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the head that was common too them both, wheras in the meane
while the Ephesians were poore wretches, shet out from al hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
enemyes of God, and plunged in all cursednesse: beholde, God


<pb facs="tcp:23289:48"/>
tooke away that diuersitie, and raundged them both in one aray. Gods
goodnesse therfore was so much the more manifest, in that he did so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
them backe which were drowned in the bottome of hel, to match them
with his owne children, and too make them fellowes and heyres of his
heauenly kingdome. That therfore is the cause why S. Paul hauing
spoken of such as had beleued in Iesus Christ afore, telleth vs expresly,
that God hath gathered and stablished his Churche in such wise, as it
wel appeareth that the greatest depend wholy vpon hym, and haue not
any other thing to rest vpon, than his only mercy: and that those which
were after a sort caste away, yea and abhorred, haue cause to glorifie
hym, seeing he hath deliuered them from the confuzion wherein they
were. And herewithal S. Paule sheweth, that the thing whiche hee
had said afore, is verified vntoo vs by the effectes of Gods grace. For
(as I haue said afore) our election is a secret thing, yea and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.
When men haue inquired of it as much as is possible, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they must needes quaile in their owne imaginations, if they mynde
to enter intoo the sayd euerlasting ordinaunce of God. And therefore
it is not lawful for vs too seeke any further than the Scripture guideth
vs, and sheweth vs the way. Yee see then that Gods choozing of vs,
is hidden in hym selfe: but yit he yeeldeth vs recordes of it by the gifts
of grace which he bestoweth vpon vs, as by faith, which is a gyfte of
the holy Ghost. Marke that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Nowe, were it but suche a gyft, as when he maketh his Sunne to
shyne both vpon good and bad, or as when he causeth the earth to bring
foorth fruit indifferently for all men: the same ought also too bee recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
among the gyftes and benefites of God. But faith is a singular
gift, which is not bestowed commonly vppon all men, but is reserued
of God as a Iewell for those whom he liketh well of. And what is the
cause of it? Wee are all of vs the chyldren of Adam, and we are all of
one mould. Why then inlighteneth hee the one sort, and letteth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alone in their blyndnesse? There is none other cause but his
owne choyse. So then although we can not conceyue nother by wyt
nor by reason, howe God hath chozen vs before the making of the
world: yit wee know it by his shewing of it vntoo vs, and experience it
selfe auoucheth it sufficiently, in asmuch as we be inlightened by faith.
What is the cause that I receyue the Gospell, and sticke to it, and in
the meane whyle others abyde styl in their beastly blockishnesse, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

too God. For wee must alwayes come backe to that which wee haue
seene alredy,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. b. 7.</note> and say, Who is hee that hath made thee to excel others?
S. Paule then dooth in that saying pull downe all loftinesse of man, to
the end that no man should aduance hymselfe, nor alledge that he hath

that it must needes bee that they were confirmed by the holy
Ghost. Now, if they were confirmed, it was of necessitie that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost must needes haue wrought beforehand. And so it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to enter intoo so deepe a maze as Gods euerlasting ordinaunce.
For he sheweth vs as it were with his finger, how he hath chozen vs,
at least wise if we play not the churles with hym, but acknowledge the
good that he hath done vs, and bee fully perswaded and resolued in our
selues, that there is none other cause of it, than for that hee had giuen
vs his marke from before all euerlastingnesse: that is too say, for that
he had reserued vs too hym selfe, as his owne chyldren. Nowe then
wee see S. Paules meanyng: and therfore let vs learne too leaue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of long raunges, when the cace concerneth our imputyng of all
things to Gods onely mere mercy. For the faith that we haue, dooth
shew it wel ynough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bycause that (as I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

not from our owne moother witte, but as a gifte that commeth
from aboue, &amp; such a one as God communicateth not too all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, but onely so such as he lysteth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore heere are many woords well worth the weying. For
on the one syde S. Paule intendeth too magnifie the grace of the holy
Ghost, by shewing that wee can haue no part nor portion in our Lord
Iesus Christ, nor in any of all the benefites that he hath purchased for
vs, except God put vs in possession of our saluation by his holie spirit.
That therfore is one poynt. And yit notwithstanding S. Paule fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not too shew therwithall; the ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:23289:49"/>
doubting or grudge of conscience. For so long as wee bee in doubt
whether God loue vs or hat vs, it is vnpossible for vs too praye truly
vntoo him. And so by that meanes yee see how our saluation is vtterly
defeated, according too that which is sayd by the Prophet Ioell.<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. f. 32.</note> And
it is a common doctrine in the holy scripture, that wee cannot obteyne
saluation, but by fleeing vntoo Gyd with prayer and supplication. But
wee should be shet out from that, if wee had not the sayd warrant, as
wee shall see more fully in the third chapter. Therfore it stands vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
too be throughly assured, that God is our father, and that he accepteth
vs for his children. And how shall wee bee warranted that vnlesse the
doctrine of the Gospell bee so certeyne in all poynts, as it bee not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs to bring it in question? That therfore is the cause why S.
Paule sayeth that it is the word of truth. No doubt but there are other
truthes also: for euen when God threatneth vs, he dooth it not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est
nor yit in vayne: for as well his threatninges as his promises haue
their execution sure and certeyne. Howbeeit forasmuch as the present
cace concerned the correcting of al distrust in vs, as wherunto we be to
much inclined: S. Paule hath termed the Gospell the <hi>doctrine of
truth:</hi> as if he should say, my frendes, God is a faithfull witnesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
you of his owne wyll: for the Gospell is as much as if he laid forth
his hart vntoo you: and therefore settle your selues vppon it. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
also he saith, that our saluation lyeth inclosed in the Gospell: and
that it is too make vs too looue it, and esteeme it. For should we be so
wirlesse, or rather starke mad, as to holde scorne of our owne welfare?
But yit notwithstandyng he saith, that al this commeth of Gods mere
mercy, and of his euerlasting electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which as in respect of our selues
is farre of, and vnknowen too vs, but we haue knowledge of it by the
Gospell, which is the meanes and instrument therof. For too what
purpose were it that our Lorde Iesus Christ hath offered hym felfe in
sacrifice too reconcile the worlde to God his father, vnlesse wee were
made partakers of it by faith? Now, faith is not an opinion of mans
conceyuyng in his owne brayne: but a setled beleefe, that God cannot
lye nor deceyue vs, and that it is not to be feared, that our hope shall
not come too good end, if wee wayt vpon hym. So then, too be short,
S. Paules intent was to shewe, that if we haue the skyll to make our
profit of the doctrine of the gospell, wee shall no longer stand in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
and perplexitie, but shalbe able to call vppon God with open
mouth, acknowledgyng our selues so bound and wholly indetted vntoo


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23289:49"/>
hym in all things, as wee feare not but that he auoweth vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and are accepted at his hande, and that hee heareth vs in all the
prayers that wee make vntoo hym. Thus much concernyng the first
poynt. Therfore according to S. Paules exhortation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs learne to
rest in suche wise vppon the doctrine of the gospell, that it may bee as
much too vs, as if God shewed hymselfe, visibly vntoo vs, and that the
heauens were opened vntoo vs:<note place="margin">Math. 16. c. 19.</note> and let vs alwayes beare in mynde,
howe it is anouched by the mouth of our Lord Iesus Christ hymselfe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20. c. 23.</note>
that when soeuer sinnes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by the preaching of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
the same is out of hand ratified in heauen. Thus ye see what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tintie
we ought to haue, that wee bee no more doubtfull whether God
wyll heare vs, or no. But lyke as the gospell teacheth vs to beleeue,
so also S. Paule sheweth vs that we ought too esteeme it as an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
treasure, for so much as it is the power of God, tendyng to the
saluation, of all that beleeue, as hee speaketh of it in the first Chapter
too the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b. 16.</note> Seeing then that wee bee forlorne and vndone of
our selues, and there is none other meanes too call, vs backe ageyn too
God, but by the gospell: let vs set store by that treasure, and bee well
aduized too make our profite of it. And in so doing let vs hardily des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pize
both the Diuell hymselfe, and all his temptations which he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth
ageinst vs, seeing that God calleth vs, and hath given vs a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
record of hys fatherly loue and good wyll towardes vs.</p>
               <p>But let vs come too the second part which I glaunced at. For S.
Paule sheweth that besyds Gods voutsafing no haue the Gospell
preached vntoo vs, it behoueth him also too wooke by his holie spirit
and by a speciall grace. And in very deede wee shall find many that
will well ynough graunt that God was not moued to send vs his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
vppon any other cause than his owne, mere free goodnesse. But
therwithall they surmyze, that the cause why some receyue it and
some receiue it not, is for that their owne free wils do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> rule the roste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and by that meanes Gods grace is diminished. For God offreth vs
not his grace, as a man shoulde offer an apple too litle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> so as
hee that could ronne best, should come and haue it. If God should cast
it out so, it is certaine that the greatest parte of our saluation shoulde
proceede of our owne power and policie, and the commendation
therof should redound too our selues. Now then, after S. Paul hath
shewed that God hath called, and dayly dooth call vs too the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of his heauenly kingdome, and that his so dooing proceedeth


<pb facs="tcp:23289:50"/>
of his own mere free goodnesse. He addeth further, that it behoueth vs
of necessitie to be touched with his holy spirite. In deede he setteth
downe but the one part of the grace of the holy ghost: &amp; that is bycause
he had set downe the other part before: for he hath not in this discourse
forgotten aught that belonged to his matter: but he began with Gods
free goodnesse wherewith wee bee all filled, and shewed that fayth
springeth out of the said fountaine of free election. And nowe for the
second part he addeth, that Gods inlightening of vs by his holy spirit,
so that wheras we were blynd, he hath printed his grace in our hartes,
and bowed and bent them to the obeying of hym, is not ynough for vs:
but that moreouer he muste bee fayne to confirme vs, and strengthen
our fayth, by geuyng vs an inuincible constancie too holde out too the
end. Yee see then that the thing wheretoo S. Paule bringeth vs, is,
that besides our receiuyng of fayth at the hand of the holy Ghost, and
besides his inlightenyng of vs by his grace, wherof I haue spoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy:
he dooth also stay vs in such wise, as wee fal not away. For the
better vnderstanding hereof, wee must first call to mynd the thing that
hath bin treated more at length alredy: that is too wit, that so long as
God letteth vs alone in our owne state and plight, wee bee blind wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
wandring in darkenesse, and what soeuer is preached or spoken
vntoo vs, wee abide styll as blockes in our brutishnes. For the sensual
man shall neuer vnderstand any thing that belongs to God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

owne saluation. Yee see then howe wee bee vtterly barred and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the heauenly light, tyll God pitie vs, and giue vs the spirit of
light and insight. Marke that for the first poynt. Howbeit, for asmuch
as that poynt hath bin discussed heretofore: it suffizeth to doo no more
but too put you in mynd of it.</p>
               <p>Now there is yit another poynt, which is that when wee haue once
imbraced Gods grace by fayth, so as wee knowe that our Lord Iesus
Christ is he in whom wee fynd all that is requisite too make vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
happie: it standeth vs on hand too be stablished in the same. For
why? let vs marke how wauering men are. He that is best dispozed
too followe God, shall by and by fall, bycause wee be so frayle that the
diuell will ouerthrowe vs euery minute of an houre, if God hild vs n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vp by strong hand. And for that cause is it sayd that God vttereth his
power in mainteyning vs, when he hath chozen vs, and giuen vs too
our Lord Iesus Christ. For if he fought not for vs, alas what woulde
become of vs? wee should bee confounded out of hand, and we shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23289:50"/>
not take one or twoo falles, but infinite falles, as I sayde afore. As
soone then as we were in the way of saluation, by &amp; by should we sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

vnlesse wee were hild backe, and that God wrought so in vs, as
wee might by his holy spirit ouercome all the assaultes of the diuell
and the world. Thus dooth Gods spirit woorke dubble in vs as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of fayth. For he inlyghteneth vs to make vs vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the things
that else should bee hidden from vs, and too receyue Gods promises
with all obedience. That is the first woorking. The second is, that the
same spirit is fayne too continue in vs, and too giue vs perseuerance,
that wee quayle not in the middes of our way. That then is the thing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat S. Paule treateth of as now. As if he should say, my friendes, yee
haue knowen Gods grace, and yee haue had experience of it, and that
he hath drawen you too the obeying of his Gospell: For you had neuer
rome vntoo it, if he had not shewed himselfe pitifull towardes you. But
yit assure your selues, that he dubbleth his grace, in that he giueth you
power too hold out in the same. For had ye continued but two or three
dayes, or two or three yeeres, yea or more: needes must it bee that
God had helped you therein, for else yee should alwayes haue bin in a
mamering, yea, and as poore wretches at your wittes ende, without
any certeintie at all, but that God hath promised too haue a care of
you, and too guyde you continually till you bee come too your wayes
end, and haue accomplished your course. That therefore is the cause
why he sayeth heere, that they were sealed or signed by the holy Ghost.
Now it behoueth vs to marke well the similitude that S. Paule vseth.
For wee know that euidences are made authentik by s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ales: and that
hath bin in all tymes. Trew it is that men did not set them too in such
maner as they doo now adayes. But yit notwithstanding in stead of
signing them with their owne handes, they deliuered their seale or a
ring, and that was the maner of the publication of Testamentes, and
of other euidence, and of all bargaynes and couenants. In this respect
S. Paule sayeth that wee must bee sealed in our hartes. Trew it is,
that too speake properly, he should haue sayd that the Gospell was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
Howbeit, too the end too doo vs too vnderstand that the fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
and springeth from our selues, and that the Gospell is a doctrine
of sufficient authoritie of it selfe, he mynded too shewe vs, that Gods
sealing of his truth is in respect of our hard hartednesse, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
for that we be shaken with euery wynd lyke wouering reedes,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:51"/>
vntill such time as he haue strengthened vs. But howsoeuer the cace
stand, let vs marke that the holy Ghost is as it were the scale where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he ratifyeth and warranteth his truth vntoo vs. Nowe I haue
told you alredy how greatly wee stand in neede thereof. For although
wee graunt that Gods word deserueth to be admitted without geyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then which shake vs, doo shewe well ynough that wee profit not

by making continually such examination of our owne weakenesse,
as I haue spoken of before. For take wee all the reasons of the world,
and yit shall wee neuer bee certifyed so fully and perfectly as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
that God will bee mercifull too vs and defend vs in the middes of

               <p>And S. Paule addeth yit one similitude more, saying that Gods

                  </gap>ny. And let vs not thinke it straunge that S.
Paule hath so myghtily confirmed this doctrine, forasmuch as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23289:51"/>
hath neuer ceassed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world, to puffe vp men
continually with some fond opinion of their owne wisdome &amp; vertew.
The cause of Adams fall, was that he would needes aduaunce himself
hygher than was lawfull for him, and be wyser than God: which thing
God gaue him not leaue to doo. Euen so standeth the cace with vs, &amp;
the diuell pursueth his chalendge still. For behold he ouerthrew man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
by that sleyght, and all his indeuour yit still is to make vs beleue
that wee be able too doo this and that. Therfore it stoode S. Paule
on hand too rid men of that false and cursed opinion of their owne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reewill and selfuertew, and too shewe them that they are beholden too
the holy Ghost for all. Mark that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we be so grosse and earthly, that we had neede too haue
the doctrine chawed vntoo vs, and wee cannot conceyue any more of
Gods gratious giftes which are inuisible, than we see with our eyes,
and touche with our hands. Therfore it was requisite that S. Paule
should by similitudes declare how it is Gods holie spirit that putteth
vs in possession of the Gospell, and of all the benefits conteyned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and which holdeth vs in them vntoo the end. Now wee knowe that
bargaynes are confirmed by giuing of an earnest penny, which men
doo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly call a Gods penny. For asmuch then as in buying eyther
Lands, houses, inheritaunces, or wares, although a mans bare word
ought to suffyze, yit notwithstanding me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are so yll dispozed, that if they
perceyue any disaduauntage to themselues in the matter, they will not
bee ashamed too eate their woord: therfore was this ceremonie of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
an earnest penny, added: and it is all one as if the payment were
fully performed, so as the bargayne were vtterly past calling backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne.
S. Paule then meaneth heere, that Gods spirit serueth to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

(sayeth he) <hi>too the day of your redemption.</hi> It is trew that

according too the third of the Colossians,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. a. 2.</note> where it is sayd, that wee be
lyke dead men that are departed out of this world, and that our lyfe is
hidden with God in Christ. Therfore although wee be Gods children,
yit haue wee not the full inioyment of it as yit. And it is all one
with that which S. Iohn sayeth in his cannonicall Epistle.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3. a. 2.</note> Wee

too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. b. 6.</note> that as long as wee bee in this earthly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
wee bee (after a sort) absent from God. For why? wee walk

but wee see it by fayth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

death too lyfe (as is sayde in the fift of Iohn:) yit do we fyght ageinst
an infinite number of deathes, bycause wee be beseeged by them. And
S. Paule dooth well match bothe toogither in this text. For on the
one syde he sayeth wee bee not yit come too our redemption and hery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
and yit therwithal he sheweth, that we bee neuerthelesse sure of
it for all that, and that nothing but our owne vnthankfulnesse letteth vs
too glory fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of our comming too the heauenly lyfe, forasmuch as wee haue an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
penny therof by the holy Ghoste, and are so knyt too our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, that all the goodes which he hath, doo belong vntoo vs, and
are made common to vs by fayth. Therfore let vs mark well what is
conteyned in these words of S. Paules. He sayeth that the holy ghost
is our earnest penny. Seing it is so: wee must needs be sure of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
wherof we shall haue the possession at the last day, yea euen
to the full: &amp; that doth the thing of it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lf shew sufficiently. For we be
but sillie wormes of the earth, wee bee compassed aboute with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and corruption, wee bee beset with so many miseries as is pitie
to see, the world rayleth vpon vs, and mocketh vs and our simplicitie,
we bee fayne too indure hunger and thirst, it seemeth often tymes that
God hath forsaken vs, and after a sort cut vs of, yea, and that he vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
not too pitie vs, as the most despyzed creatures of the worlde.
Lo at what poynt wee bee too outward appeerance. And therefore it
standeth vs on hand too haue a remedie, too warrant our selues withall
in the middes of so many perplexities and hartgriefes. That is the
cause why S. Paule sayeth purposely, that the holy Ghost is our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
penny. Although then that the world haue the brydle looce to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vs vnder his feete, as they say: although our Lord keepe vs occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
with many temptations: although he humble vs in such wyse, as
it may seeme that wee bee as sheepe appoynted too the slaughter, so as
death bee continually betweene our teeth: yit are wee not vnpurueyed


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23289:52"/>
of good remedie. For why? Seyng that the holy Ghost reygneth in our
hartes, wee haue whereof too boast euen in the middes of all our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
according as it is sayd in the viii.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15.</note> too the Romanes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once assured that God taketh vs for his children, wee may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call vppon him, but also although wee bee afflicted and tormented,
yit wee ceasse not too bee alwayes fully and infallibly resolued that he
is our father, too leade vs too the glory of heauen: for euen that also is

                  </gap> meane whereby our hope is tryed.</p>
               <p>Furthermore wee bee warned also too walk in pacience, and that
seing God hath giuen vs his holie spirit for an earnest pennye, wee
must not bee so hastie and impaciente as wee haue bin woont too bee.
For if God handle vs roughly, by and by wee fall too grudging, and
are very loth too suffer any thing: for wee see how tender and nyce we
bee of nature. But wee must indure paciently, bycause God will not
haue vs too come too his kingdome at one leape, as they say, but will
haue vs too passe by this world through the midds of thornes and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
so as wee shall haue much a doo to get through, and wee shalbee in
greate distresse. Seing that he will haue vs led such a way, and yit
notwitstanding giueth vs so good a remedie as ought to suffyze vs,
which is that he strengtheneth vs in inuincible constancie by his holie
spirit: let vs stand in a redinesse too fyght till the tyme of victorie bee
fully come. It is trew that our fayth doth euen now alredy get the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                  </gap> of it, nother doo wee fully
inioy it. Therfore wee must determine with our selues too sygh and
grone continually, and yit therwithall too reioyce also. For (why? too
reioyce in our hartes, and also) too cry with S. Paule, alas wretched
wyght that I am, who shal deliuer me from this prison of my bodie,
are things that may match verye well toogither. Therfore let euery
of vs moorne, yea and bee greeued at the hart, for that wee bee still so
much giuen too our wicked lusts, and too the number of vices that are
in vs. And yit notwithstanding let vs ceasse also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

performe the thing that he hath begunne, seing wee haue his holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

of him vntoo the end. Thus yee see how wee bee heere incoraged too

end. And that is the cause why S. Paule speaketh purposely of
redemption. It is trew that wee bee redeemed by our Lord Iesus
Christ,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. d. 30. &amp;c.</note> and he is giuen vs for our redemption or raunsome, as is sayd
in another text: yit notwithstanding wee haue not the effect and full
fruition of it as yit.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. b. 6.</note> Then is there a dubble redemption: one which
was accomplished in the person of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
which wee wayte for, and which shalbee shewed vppon vs at his
comming ageine.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 23.</note> According wheruntoo S. Paule sayth in the viii.
too the Romanes, that although wee grone and bee hild downe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
yit wee must not bee dismayed at it, nor think it straunge: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all creatures (sayth he) doo beare vs companie, yea and bee as a
woman that trauelleth of child. For wee see that all the world is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
too corruption through the sin of Adam. Seing then it is so: let
vs not quayle in our gronings, but let vs so measure our affections as
too hold vs contented in that we haue our redemption purchaced in
the person of our Lord Iesus Christ, and thereuppon trust that he will
accomplishe the same thing in vs and in our persons, which he hath
brought vs in his owne. The thing therefore that S. Paule ment too
say, is that Gods spirit is our earnest penny duryng the tyme that wee
wayte too be taken out of this transitorie lyfe, and too bee set free from
all miseries, specially from the bondage of sinne, which is the heauyest
burthen that can bee. Untill such tyme then as wee bee deliuered from
all those thinges, wee must rest vppon this, that Gods spirit dwelleth
in vs.</p>
               <p>And as touching <hi>the redemption of purchace:</hi> it may well bee
taken for purchaced redemption: for it is a very ryfe maner of speech:
lyke as when it is sayd, the spirit of promis, it is ment, the spirit that
assureth or warranteth al the promises: The spirit of the feare of God,
bycause it is he that maketh vs obedient too his rightuousnesse. So
lykewise when he speaketh of the Redemption of purchace, it may
well bee sayd that it is the redemption which was purchaced for vs,
too shewe that if wee feele the effect of it in our selues, so as wee be out
of all doubt of the things that Iesus Christ hath doone for vs, we must
not mistrust that he hath suffered in vayne. For surely his suffering
were too no purpose at all towardes vs, vnlesse it came vntoo vs, so as
it myght redound too our profit, and wee inioy it. That therefore is the
thing that is purchaced in the person of our Lord Iesus Christ. And
yit in the meane season, as in respect of our selues he reyneth vs short,

the benefite that God offereth vs, that is too wit, our reioycing in our
afflictions, bycause wee knowe that our saluation is sure, nor repyne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
God and blaspheme him, but walke on quietly till wee bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from this prison wherein wee bee, and till wee bee fully set free

               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the maiestie of our good
God, with acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs

that there is nothing in vs but a dungeon of all naughtinesse, may

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue seene already howe Saint Paule
brought the Epesians not onely to the chief
but also too the onely cause of their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and shewed that they must of necessitie
father all the whole vppon God, without
mingling of any foolish presumption ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
as who should say that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
had furthered Gods grace which
they had receyued, eyther by their free wil,
or by any good intent in them. Saint Paule therefore hath shewed in
effect, that not onely the Ephesians too whom he spake, but also they
that had bin Gods Church before, ought all without exception to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that all their welfare proceeded of Gods onely free goodnesse,
not onely bycause they were all redeemed by meane of our Lord Iesus
Christ, but also bycause he had called them too the beliefe of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
according too his choozing of them before the creating of the
world.</p>
               <p>And nowe he warranteth all the sayd doctrine by the recorde which
it yeeldeth vnto God, in that it doth euen then magnifie his goodnesse,
when he is as it were separated from mannes eye, and from the sight
of all witnesses. Trewly the doctrine of the Gospel oughte not too bee
the lesse esteemed when it is preached and published in the open face
of the whole woorld: but yit it behoueth him that speaketh it too haue
it throughly printed in his hart, &amp; to say the same thing in himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and his Angels, which he speaketh before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for otherwise
it were but a iangling, or rather an vnhalowing of Gods word: if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
should step vp intoo the pulpet too talke lyke an Angell, and in the
meane while haue no such meaning in his hart, nor bee perswaded of
the thing that he speaketh. It were better that a man were drowned a
hundred times, than too beare abrode the most excellent record of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
&amp; of Gods truthe: and in the meane season not too bee perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in himselfe of the thing that he preacheth, so as God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
might knowe that he hath the same thing printed in his harte.
Therefore it is not without cause, that after S. Paule hath preached
Gods free goodnesse in choozing whom he lyked, and in calling them
too the knowledge of his Gospell when he had chozen them, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
them with his strong hand, and by giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
and stedfastnesse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had called them: nowe he addeth that

God knoweth his witnessing therof too bee in good earnest and vnfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly.
For he protesteth heere concerning the prayers which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
alone by himselfe, when no man could know his thought nor what
he sayeth and vttereth with his mouth: that euen then he auoweth the
same doctrine before God, inasmuch as he prayeth him to voutsafe too
accomplishe the thing that he hath begunne. Heere therfore wee haue
too marke first of all, that such as mynde too haue their labour profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Seing it is so: Let such as haue the charge of teaching Gods Church
walke fearfully &amp; carefully, &amp; not onely indeuer to win men vnto God,

and that they should but cast foorth a sounde intoo the aire, which
would vanishe away out of hand, if God wrought not with them by the

too remember vppon the woords that S. Paule speaketh heere.</p>
               <p>But euerye of vs also ought too apply it generally too his owne vse.
Therfore when wee come too bee taught Gods woord, or when any of
vs readeth it alone by himselfe: let vs not imagin our witts too bee sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ynough, and that wee bee able ynough too vnderstand whatsoeuer
the scripture telleth vs: but let vs acknoweledge our own beastlinesse,
and praye God too make his doctrine too preuaile in such wyse with
vs, as it may not slip fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. But this thing will be perceyued the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by the processe that S. Paule holdeth on heere, if wee wey well all
the woords that he vseth. He sayeth <hi>that he yeeldeth thanks vnto
God without end or ceassing,</hi> for the fayth which he hearde to bee in
the Church of Ephesus, <hi>And for their loue towards the Saints:</hi> &amp; yit
notwithstanding he continueth his praying vntoo God, that he
should inlighten them more and more, and bring them too the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which all the faythfull ought too labour too attayne vntoo, till God
haue taken them out of this world. Now, in that he sayth that he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth


<pb facs="tcp:23289:55"/>
not to giue thanks vnto God, wee see by his example wherabouts
the faythful ought too spende their time. For in very deede the cheife
sacrifyze that God requireth and alloweth, is that wee shoulde honour
him for all his benefits, and yeelde him his deserued prayse for the
same. And it is not too bee thought that that can bee doone (as yee
would say) by starts or by patches: but lyke as God on his side ceasseth
not too poure out his benefits infinitely, so also behoueth it euery of vs
too inforce ourselues, too blesse and prayse him without ceassing. For
S. Paule speakes heere vnfeynedly: and when he blessed God for the
Ephesians, he ment as much for all other Churches. What an vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
then were it, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should not thinke at all vpon the benefits that
he hath receyued at Gods hand? Wee are all of vs bound too prayse
God for our neighbours. If wee heare it reported that God hath pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
his Churche, or shewed mercie too his people a hundred leages
of, and too bee short, if wee heare of any thing that ought too make vs
glad: it becometh our mouthes too be open to prayse God for it. Now
if wee bee bound too doo this for the good turnes that wee see not, but
which our neighbours feele, though they bee distant in far Countryes
from vs: what is too bee thought of vs when God filleth our mouthes
(as it is sayd in the Psalme),<note place="margin">Psal. 145. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 16.</note> and yit in the meane whyle wee haue no
mind at all too yeelde him thanks? And wee haue too note further,
that if wee bee bound too prayse God for our meate and drinke, and
for all the things that belong too this flightfull life: he bindeth vs to
hym much more without comparison, when he calleth vs too the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
heritage, and when he blisseth and inritcheth vs with spirituall
gifts of grace, which serue too leade vs farre further than this worlde.
Seing then that God vseth such bountifulnesse towards vs: what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
can wee haue, if wee followe not the example that is shewed vs
heere in S. Paule? which is, that all our life long wee must occupy
our selues continually in praysing the name of God.</p>
               <p>Now heerewithall he sheweth that faith and charitie are the verye
giftes of God, &amp; come not of our selues, as men doo alwayes imagine
through a diuelishe pryde. I told you afore, that S. Paule playd not
the Hypocrite in geuing thanks too God for the fayth and charitie of
the Ephesians. If euery man could beleeue, and had faith of his owne
inclination, or cold get it by some power of his owne: the prayse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ought not too bee giuen vntoo God: for it were but a mockerye too
acknowledge our selues beholden too him for that thing which wee


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23289:55"/>

<pb facs="tcp:23289:56"/>
wee ought too frame our selues, and which is our rule. But herewith
all wee haue also to marke, that vnder this worde <hi>Fayth,</hi> he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
the whole seruis of God. For it is imposible that wee should not
be wholy rauished in loue to our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father, being once acquainted
with his goodnesse, as hee hath shewed it vs in the person of his only
sonne. Behold, God draweth vs out of the dungeon of confuzion and
death, and openeth vs the gate of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly kingdome, and telleth vs
that he will take vs for his children. Now can we heare and beleue
this, but that wee shalbe wholly geuen ouer vnto him, forsaking the
world, and hating the euill that is in our selues, bycause it separateth
vs from him. Yee see then how the woorde fayth importeth a full yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ouer of our selues wholly vnto God. Ageine, faith is not an ydle
thing: it importeth that wee should resort vnto God, and that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
wee bee steyned with any blot, wee should pray him to redresse it:
for there is not any necessitie in the world, which is not as a dash with
a spurre, which God giueth vs to make vs comme vnto him. Fayth
therfore importeth prayer &amp; supplication. It importeth moreouer that
it cannot be but we must halow the name of God by resting our selues
vppon him, and by yeelding him the whole glorie that belongeth too
him, when wee knowe that hee giueth vs all thinges of his owne free
goodnesse, looking for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the first table of the Lawe. Trew it is that the part is put for
the whole: howbeit it is too bee considered that the thinges which wee
haue spoken of, cannot bee put asunder. Now then it standeth vs on

he then? That wee should bee giuen too dooing of good to his

expresly in this Text. Trewe it is that wee ought too vse charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

God, who maketh his Sunne to shine both vpon good and bad, except
wee loue our enemies, and streyne our selues too succour &amp; helpe them.

wee ought too doo for others, is also requisite for our selues. Too bee
short, wee bee heere warned too magnifie God in such wyse for his

that there is still much default in vs, and that it standeth vs on

that he should correct our vyces, and augment his grace in vs, till wee
bee come too full perfection, which thing will neuer bee till wee bee
rid of this mortall body. Yit notwithstanding wee see howe Satan
dooth now adayes possesse such as surmyze a hellishe perfection, and
make but the three first petitions too their father, saying, that it is y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
too pray God that his name bee hallowed, that his kingdome

the signing of their owne handes which theyr disciples know, wherby

why? I haue tolde you already, that the Ephesians had profited, and
that the giftes of God and of his holy spirit were augmented in them:
He hath shewed that. Now too knit vp the matter, he sayeth further,
that he prayeth God too giue them that which they haue not, &amp; which
they want as yit. Sith it is so: let vs marke that the more wee haue
profited, the more cause haue wee too humble our selues, and with all

any whit of his maiestie, nor that he was any whit abridged or
diminished of his eternall glory, there was no such thing at all. But as
in respect of vs he was abaced, yea and vtterly emptyed. And wee
must not bee ashamed too say, that Iesus Christ was abaced, seing it
is sayd that he was emptyed: for that is the very woord that S. Paule
vseth too the Philippians.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 7.</note> Therfore when wee speake of Iesus Christ
as he is ioyned too vs, too the end too bring vs too his father: so is he
vnder God his father, namely in respect that he hath taken our nature

he sayd to his disciples (as S. Iohn reporteth in his twentith chapter)
Go yee too my brethren and tel them,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20. d. 17.</note> I go too my God and your God,

himself? Yis: howbeeit forasmuch as he is clothed with our flesh, and
inasmuch as he voutsaued too bee made fleshe, too the ende that wee
myght bee members of his bodie: that is the cause why he hath one
God with vs. And that is the cause also why the Apostle applyeth
this text of Esayes too his person:<note place="margin">Esai. 8. d. 18. &amp;c.</note> Lo heere am I with the seruants

               <p>S. Paule prayeth God heere expresly too giue the Ephesians the
spirit of wisedome and reuelation. It is certeine that God had alredy

wee could not haue one sparke of fayth, or of lyght, except God had

chapter of S. Mathew, Flesh and blud hath not opened these thinges
vntoo thee, but my heauenly father which is in heauen. And yit for all
this, Peter sheweth afterward, that he knewe not any whit of Christes
spiritual kingdome. Then although he were but as a silly nouice sat

bee fayne too giue vs new eyes, as I sayd afore. And he addeth the
woord <hi>wisdome,</hi> the better too beate downe the fond ouerweening that
men conceyue in themselues, when they will needes flye without
wings too come vntoo God. For there is not that man which woulde
not bee wyse. If wee desyred trew wisedome by seeking it at Gods
hand: it were a good and well ruled desyre. But there are twoo faults
in vs: for wee will needes bee wyze after our owne conceyt. Am I not
wyze ynough too gouerne my selfe, wyll a foole say? And in the meane
whyle wee despyze Gods word, and euery of vs will needes haue the

                  </gap>rydle layd looce in our necke, and haue leaue giuen him too doo what
he thinketh good. But that is too great an ouerweening. The other
vyce is, that in reading the holy scripture, wee still imagin too come
too the knowledge of the things that are conteyned there, by our owne
discretion. But heere both twayne of them are excluded by S. Paule.
For when as he desyreth God too giue his faythfull ones the spirit of
wisdome, he sheweth that they haue no discretion, no more than brute
beastes, except it bee by the guyding of our Lord Iesus Christ, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
too come too the kingdome of heauen. For euen in ciuill matters
and worldly affayres, God giueth it not too any, but too such as he
thinketh good. Now if he keepe his speciall goodnesse alwayes too
himselfe, too giue discretion too whom he listeth, too guyde himselfe
withall in these bace things of the world: then dooth he make the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers
too bee well syghted: and therefore when the cace concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the heauenly lyfe, there is no preparation in vs. And so S. Paule
presuppozeth the thing which I haue sayd already, namely, that wee
must bee taught at Gods hand, too know him by the doctrine of truth
through the record of the Gospell, for without that, wee shoulde bee
lyke these fantasticall fellowes, which roue vnder the pretence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the reuelation of Gods holy spirit: howbeeit, that is not after
the maner that S. Paule taketh the word <hi>Reuelation,</hi> when he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God too giue it too his children. As for example, when Iesus
Christ speaketh of his spirit, he doth not separate it from the doctrine
that he had preached. When the spirit commeth (sayeth he) he shall
tell you all truth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. d. 26. &amp; 15. d. 26.</note> And how is that? Had not the Apostles receyued
it alredy? Yis: but he addeth, he shall shewe you the things that you
heare now of my mouth. Too bee short, it is the peculiar office of the
holy Ghost to teach vs in such wise, as the word which we heare, may

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:61"/>And theruppon S. Paule sheweth also wherin lyeth all our light

comprehend all that in so small a roome? Yit neuerthelesse we see how
men take vnmeasurable leaue to bee inquisitiue of this and that, &amp; to
put foorth questions in way of pleading and disputing ageinst God.
For this cause S. Paule sheweth vs here, that if wee mynde too bee
wize, it behoueth vs too bee sober: that is too wit, we must vnderstand
what manner a thing God and our Lord Iesus Christ is, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
will shew anone after, that when wee be once come to that poynt,
wee haue so much as ought wel too suffize vs, and if wee presume too
go any further, it is but a wilfull ouerthrowing of our selues. S. Paule
then wil shew that more at length hereafter: but it ought to suffize vs,
that as wel in this text, as in all the whole holy scripture, we ought too
learne which is the God whom wee ought too serue, what is his will,
how we may haue our trust in him, what entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may haue to pray
too him, and too flie too him for succour at all times. That is the thing
wherunto we must imploy our selues. But that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be doone, vnlesse
al that euer we haue neede of, and is auaylable to our welfare, be too
bee had in Iesus Christ, in whom God hath manifested himself. For
in it selfe the maiestie of God is too high a thing, and wee should bee
vndone a hundred times before wee could come nere him, if it were
not that he is come downe vnto vs. But if wee once haue Iesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there wee haue a lyuely image of him, wherein wee may behold what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is requisite for our saluation. For there we vnderstand that God
is our father, and that wee bee clenzed from all our sinnes too be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
intoo the glorye of God. There wee see how God accepteth
vs for rightuous, and that wee bee reconciled too God ageine. There
wee perceyue how he hath raunsomed vs, and that wee shall neuer bee
left destitute of the grace of his holy spirit, till he haue brought vs too
the ioying of our inheritaunce. Thus doo wee knowe all these things
in our Lord Iesus Christ.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in another place, that he desired not too knowe any other thing than

why S. Paule sayth, that he had leuer come too the hauen of saluation

and as halfe an Angell: yit made he no reckening of all that, so he
might bee partaker of the remission (of sinnes) that was giuen him in

kynd of feeling in their harts, as our liues must needs bee brydled, and
euen the wickeddest and woorst natured of vs all, shall of force haue
some remorse or hartbyting, and bee constreyned whether they will

or howe too call vppon God. Then are wee starke blynd in that

must bee fayne too woorke in vs, and too giue vs new eyes too spye out
the things that are requisite too our saluation. And that is the cause
why S. Paule prayeth vntoo God heere too giue them inlyghtened

not too atteyne so hygh as is requisyte: but too haue some seede of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

bycause that therby he reformeth vs, and giueth vs a cleere and sure

               <p>Now hereupon it is easye too gather, how the wretched world hath
bin beguyled by the opinion of freewill, which hath bin put into their

that we may well further Gods grace by our owne freewill: &amp; so they
make a medly of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they mynd to defyne freewill, they
say it is a mingled thing, so as wee haue reason and wit too chooze the
good, and too refuze the euill, and that therwithall we haue also power
and abilitie, to performe and put in execution the thing that wee haue
purposed. But wee see after what manner S. Paule speaketh heere
of mamies reason, which they terme the Queene that ouerruleth and
brydleth all our thoughtes and deedes. He sheweth that shee is starke
blynd, vntill God haue renewed hir, and not that he dooth but supply
our wantes where any bee, as though there were some peece of power
in vs. Had it bin so, S. Paule would haue sayd, that God furthereth
our light, or that he increaseth it, or that he addeth too it whatsoeuer it
hath neede of. Howbeit he speaketh not so: but he sayeth, God giue
you inlyghtened eyes: shewing therby that it is a free gift, &amp; not only
that our Lord must bee fayne too beare with our infirmities, and too
put some further portion theruntooo: but also that we being blynd can
see nothing at all, till he haue opened our eyes, and that wee bee guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

secretes of Gods word are too deepe and incomprehensible for vs. We

And for proofe therof men wyl alwayes iudge after their owne

Is it so, say they? And howe is that possible? They reason, they scan

bee but a simple doctrine, and that it hath not finenesse and suttletie
ynough for them? So much the more neede therefore haue wee too
bethinke vs of the thing that is shewed vs heere by S. Paule: which
is, that the glorious heritage wheruntoo God hath called vs, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> shetteth vs out from all hope of saluation. And so long
as wee bee Gods enemyes, what can wee looke for at his hand but
vtter confuzion? Yit notwithstanding it pleaseth him too make vs
fellowes with the Angells of heauen, yea and more than that too: for
we be made members of our Lord Iesus Christ, to the end we should
bee parttakers of his lyfe and glory. How excellent riches are these?
When wee shall haue imployed all our wittes about them, ought wee
not too bee tootoo much ashamed, seyng that God hath vttered so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
goodnesse towardes vs? So then, S. Paule too waken vp
mennes drowzinesse, and to rebuke and correct their vnthankfulnesse,
for that they commend not the hundreth part of Gods grace, as they
ought too doo: telleth vs that if wee thinke better vppon it, wee shall
fynde that his speaking after that maner, is too stirre vs vp too pray
God too inlyghten vs, bycause that without him, wee should not bee
able too come any thing neere fayth, nor neere any knowledge at all.</p>
               <p>Thus wee see now S. Paules meaning, which hee pursueth and
continueth much more in adding, <hi>what the excellencie of his power
is in vs that haue beleeued.</hi> And ageyn, <hi>according too the effectual
voorking of the strength of his power.</hi> He gathereth and heapeth

it is as it were a correcting of mans leawdnesse, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
too deface Gods goodnesse as much as they can, insomuch that
wheras they bee not able too deface it altogither, they diminish it in
such wyse as it appeereth not, as if it had but a sparke wheras it ought
to haue full light. But by the way let vs mark, that wheras S. Paule
setteth downe here the Saintes and beleeuers: he meaneth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
whom God hath already called too him. And therein he sheweth
that euen when wee haue fayth, all our holynesse proceedeth of Gods

vs not, yit dooth it dwell in vs, and wee keepe continuall battell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
it, to get the vpper hand. But howsoeuer the world go, yit when
God once hath sanctified vs, we must apply our selues to his seruice, we
must indeuer too clenze our selues more and more from all vyces, and
wee must giue our selues wholly vntoo him, so as wee bee no more as
worldlings, which take leaue too doo what they list. This in effect is
the thing that S. Paule ment too say.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, no do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

that they haue no mynd at all too submit themselues too the obedience
of the Gospell, but doo fyght furiously ageinst it: and the faythfull
which are as sillie sheepe, herkening to the voyce of the good shepherd.
S. Paule then condemneth heere all scoffers and scorners which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyze
God, and are as Doggs or brute beasts, without any feeling of
religion. When wee see these things, they are all of them mirrours
vntoo vs, too make the heares stand vp vppon our heades, by making
vs too knowe what wee should be, if God pityed vs not. And therfore
when we see folkes scorne God so openly, and rush forth at randon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
al leaudnesse, let vs acknowledge the infinite goodnesse of our God,
in that he hath separated vs from the companye. Wherefore when
wee see one sort sotted in their vnbeleefe, and an other sort full of pryde,
bitternesse, and stubbornnesse ageinst the Gospell: let vs vnderstand
that wee our selues should bee lyke them, but that God hath reached
foorth his arme vppon vs.</p>
               <p>But now let vs marke well the woordes that S. Paule vseth heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

the effectuall vvoorking of the povver of his strength.</hi> It should
seeme that the holie Ghost ment too thunder downe vppon this diuelish
opinion wherwith the world hath at all tymes bin besotted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is too

wit, of freewill. For the heathen men presumed so farre, as too say
that God had in deede created them too bee in the world, and that it
was in his power too giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good or bad fortune, as they termed it:
but that it was in euerye mans owne power and freechoyce too follow
vertew, and too behaue himself in such wyse, as no fault myght bee
founde in him. Loe how the heathen men parted the stake betweene
God and themselues. The lesser matter, which is the setting of vs
heere beneath too crawle heere lyke frogges, they left vntoo God: but
the greater matter, namely our atteyning vntoo heauen, and the ruling
of our selues in all vertew, that sayd they, was in mans owne abilltie,
and belonged only too himself. The Iewes and Papists haue not bin
altoogither of this mynd: for (as I haue touched alredye) they confesse
that we haue neede of Gods helpe: But yit for all that, they will haue
vs too mingle some peece of our owne holinesse with Gods grace, and
too bee able too woorke ioyntly with it, as they say, insomuch that
when it commeth too the reckening, the cheef part shall alwayes bee
found in our selues.</p>
               <p>But let vs see how the holy Ghost speaketh of it. Too what end v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
he all these terme of <hi>hyghnesse, power, strengh, effectual vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and myghtinesse?</hi> wherfore heapeth he vp all these toogither,
but too shewe that men bee mad when they will take more vpon them
than beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth them? Ther is not that woord heere, which serueth not
to abate our cackling, if wee boast of neuer so little a drop of goodnesse.
For if men say, I haue yit some good mouing in mee, I haue some
peece of vertew: behold, S. Paule speaketh of <hi>Hyghnesse:</hi> as if he
ment to shew that all the goodnesse which we haue, is aboue the world,
and hath not his roote nor spring in our selues, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from aboue,
as S. Iames sayeth.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. c. 17.</note> Agein, if men say, wee haue some power too
withstand our owne vyces, and to fyght ageinst temptations: S. Paul
sayeth heere, that our strength, our power, and our myght commeth of
God, and that he must bee fayne to vestowe it vppon vs, and we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
it of him. If men say still, yit by streyning our selues we may be
able too doo somewhat: S. Paule telleth vs, ther is no effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
ther is no bringing of the thing to passe, vnlesse God giue it vs,
according too his speaking of it in the second to the Philipians, where
he sayeth,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 12. 13.</note> that it standeth vs on hand too walke in feare and warinesse,
bycause it is God which giueth both the will &amp; the abilitie to performe
the will, according too his owne good pleasure: that is too say, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth


<pb facs="tcp:23289:66"/>
the woorke, and bringeth it too the end and knitting vp. Too
bee short, let vs marke, that looke how many woordes there are heere,
so many great thunderclappes and lyghteninges are there too beate
downe and too sinke all the pryde of man, too the intent that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
in our selues, wee myght giue God the glory which he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
and with all lowlinesse frankly and freely yeeld our selues giltie,
acknowledging that al goodnesse commeth of him, &amp; that we be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to him only for it. Thus yee see how the effect of the matter which
wee haue too marke vppon this streyne, is too imbace our selues in
such wyze, as wee myght haue no desyre too part halues with God, too
saye that he dooth but helpe vs, and that there is some portion of his
grace and holy spirit in our owne freewill: but too yeeld him purely
and simply the whole prayse of our saluation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, let it also make vs too despyze the world, that wee
may content our selues with the hope of the euerlasting lyfe which is
purchased for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ. For wee knowe that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
men bee generally subiect too many afflictions, and that this
lyfe of ours bee notwithout cause termed a vale of wretchednesse: yit
god exercizeth his owne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with greater abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of aduersities,
than he dooth the other sorte: for they also haue neede too bee alwayes

heere bylowe? yee see then in fewe woordes, howe God will exercyze
vs many wayes after he hath called vs too the fayth of the Gospell,
for else wee would bee weery of seruing him, and it would seeme too vs
that his loue were but a very slender thing, if wee should not learne to
giue ouer all other things as little or nothing woorth, and too imbrace
Iesus Christ. Therefore let vs learne that S. Paules intent heere,
is too drawe vs in such wyse vntoo God, as nothing may let vs too
walke in our calling: and that if wee haue not all thinges to our lyking
in this world, wee may lerne too esteeme the inestimable benyfites of
our God better than wee haue doone, that wee may say with Dauid
(as he speaketh in his sixtenth Psalme) I haue myne heritage, which

these thinges shalbee sweete too mee, so I possesse my God, and he
make mee to feele that he hath chozen mee, and reserued mee too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and is mynded too haue mee partaker of all his goodes. Thus
you see in effect, that by this text wee may bee hartened and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vntoo pacience, too beare myldly all the afflictions and aduersities
of the worlde, and not too bee greeued or out of conceyt: and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God make vs now and then too drinke of a bitter cup, and giue
vs cause too sigh and lament, yit wee must not fall too repyning and
grudging, but assure our selues that God hath giuen vs a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
in that he hath called vs too bee parttakers of his kingdome, and
so vttered his power already in vs, as wee ought as it were too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
our selues aboue all earthly thinges, and too looke downe at
them as at our feete.</p>
               <p>And for as much as wee doo not yit perceyue such fulnesse of Gods
grace, as were to be wished, therfore S. Paule sendeth vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Lord Iesus Christ. And surely if he had not added, that God
hath vttered his power in his only sonne, after such maner as we haue
herd it: what a thing were it? For we myght alledge in way of reply,
howso? where are these riches of God? For we be not only bereft of the
goods of this world, but also we be as a dry &amp; barrein gro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ud in respect
of the grace of Gods holy spirit. If there bee any portion of it in vs, it
is so smal, as wee ought too bee ashamed of it: and yit for all this, wee
bee moreouer plundged in our infirmities. If yee speake of Gods
power, it ought too get the vpper hand of all sinne in vs. But wee bee
so weake, that wee bee as good as beaten downe. Agein, it were meete
that Gods image should shyne foorth in vs, and wee beare such store of
fylthinesse and such blemishes about vs as is pitie too see. Wee should
bee wholly consecrated too God, but the worlde holdes vs backe, and
wee bee as it were snarled in it. Loe how the faythfull myght bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basshed
when any talke were ministered concerning Gods grace, if
they stayed there, and were not led foorth too Iesus Christ. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause therfore doth S. Paule adde here, that God did then vtter the
excellencie of his power, when he rayzed our Lord Iesus Christ from
death. And he speaketh purposely of his resurrection, bycause that in
his death wee see nothing but astonishment. For there appeered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but weaknesse: but by his vanquishing of death he shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too bee the sonne of God, yea and the Lord of glorie and lyfe, who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad all power in himself. And that also is the cause why S. Paule


<pb facs="tcp:23289:67"/>
sayth, that God did set him at his ryght hand. For it had not bin y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for Iesus Christ to haue bin rayzed agein, except he had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
and abyding dominion. Trew it is that euen in his (only) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
wee haue a record that he is the sonne of God: but yit for all
that, wee must passe one step further, namely that he had not a blast of
power and away, but that by his ryzing agein, he atteined such superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie,
that all the world is gouerned by him, and he is now set downe
at the right hand of God his father, to maynteyne and preserue his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
that call vppon him, and put them selues intoo his keeping,
and hath sufficient power to ouercome Satan and al the world, and all
our enemyes. Now then wee see S. Paules meaning: that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as wee myght bee cast downe, and our fayth at least wyse sore
shaken, if wee should looke no further than too our selues: therefore he
setteth Iesus Christ before vs, as the trew patterne, wherin wee may
see the thing that as yit is vnseene in our selues: that is too wit, Gods
inestimable power which surmounteth the whole world. For first he
is rayzed from death: and secondly he is set at the ryght hand of his
father. Now the speaking of Gods ryght hand is a resemblance ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of men. It is certeyne that God hath nother ryght hande nor
lefte, for he is infinite, and fylleth both heauen and earth, and agein,
he hath no body, but is a spirituall beyng. Therefore wee must not

And wehn as it is sayd, that Iesus Christ sitteth there, it is too shewe

it is a similitude borowed of men, as when a prince maketh his vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,

vnable too atteyne too the maiestie of God, therefore it is sayde, that
Iesus Christ hath obteyned all souereintie, so as wee bee sure that he
hath vs in his protection, &amp; that being vnder his hand, wee be safe, and

that we which are his members be weak: yit is there strength ynough
in the head, which is the chiefe part of the body. And so ye see for what
cause it is sayd, that Iesus Christ is set at the right hand of God his
father: namely too shewe vs that wee neede not too seeke farre for his
help, seeing he gouerneth all things both aboue and beneath, and wee

his high and infinite power in vs. Howebeeit forasmuch as that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fizeth
not, by reason of the infirmities which wee feele, &amp; for that there
is so much amisse in vs still, and wee bee not yit come too the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
no nor too the hundreth part of it: therefore too the intent we may
bee the better assured of all the things that wee want, wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them in Iesus Christ: Are wee then subiect yit still vntoo death?
Behold Iesus Christ is receyued vp intoo euerlasting life: for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cause why he became a mortall man as wee bee, was that the life
which he hath, might belong vnto vs. Doth sinne dwell still in vs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
Iesus Christ hath no spot nor blemish in him. Are wee weake?
He is the power of God his father, and looke whatsoeuer he receyued
in his manhod, which he tooke of vs, was for our sakes and too our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe.
Too bee short, looke whatsoeuer wee want, and whatsoeuer
may comfort or quicken vs, we shall fynd it in our Lord Iesus Christ,
bycause wee should not bee in care and perplexitie, as though we were
excluded from the benefites that S. Paule hath made mention of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toofore.
Finally wee should neuer haue any settled trust, except wee

most of all. Sith it is so then, wee should alwayes hang in a mame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and doubt. But when wee know that all is accomplished in our
Lord Iesus Christ, and that he is as it were the first fruites, and that
wee were sanctifyed in him, and that in his person wee haue receyued
the things aforehand, which shall bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

our certeintie, wheruppon wee ought too rest, that wee bee not shaken

text, that although Gods grace bee weake in vs, that is too say, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he haue put but a small beginning of it in vs, and not so large
an abundance as were requisite or too bee wished for: yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the same giueth vs a taste and sauer too trust in him. For there
cannot bee so little grace of his holy spirit in vs, but that (as sayeth S.
Paule in the eyght too the Romanes) we know the same is as a gage
or earnest penny aforehand, of the lyfe that he hath promised. Trew it
is that this lump of sinne dwelleth still in vs: but it ought too content
vs that God voutsafeth too bestowe neuer so little of his holy spirite
vppon vs.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, for asmuch as wee can not be sure of all these things,
consydering the slendernesse that is in our selues, and the infirmities
and wantes which wee haue: therfore wee must lift vp our eyes to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Yea, what auaileth it vs, that wee may fynd all perfection
in hym? for wee bee tootoo farre of from hym. Wee bee farre from
hym as in respect of distance of places, &amp; in that respect doth S. Paul
say, that wee bee absent from hym, bicause we walke but by faith, and
not by open eye syght and beholding. But yit for al that, wee he mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his body. Then seeing it is so: like as a roote cannot bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the tree, but sendeth foorth his sap intoo all the boughes
and braunches of it: Euen so let vs vnderstand, that the end wherunto
our Lord Iesus Christ hath in such fulnesse receiued the spiritual gifts
that belong too the heauenly life, is too communicate them too vs so

that if it were not so, wee should bee vndoone out of hand, and al should

that he meaneth the Angells: howbeit he hath vsed this maner of

yit dooth it no whit diminish, that which he hath giuen too Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

is it lawfull too ioyne any companion with him, bycause all preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
and whatsoeuer else may bee thought or deuyzed too bee moste
noble and excellent, is there, that is too say, in our Lord Iesus Christ,
and he (only) is too bee sought vntoo, as Paule himselfe sayeth also
in the first too the Colossians. For it is not now alate that the world
hath sought occasion too turne away from our Lord Iesus Christ, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of seeking too the Angells of heauen. Wee see how Gods
creatures are alwayes drawen too some superstition, and men make

and they be as it were his handes, his officers, and his instrumentes.
That is the cause why men think them selues too haue doone much in

wote not whom else. For (as I sayd) it is not a vyce newly deuyzed:
the diuell who is the father and author of lying, hath intangled men
at all tymes with such fancies, yea and euen the Christians haue fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

the heathen men haue alwayes surmized the Angells too bee as halfe

come vntoo God, bycause they were not woorthie of themselues. And
euen after the same maner, talk the Papistes at this day. Now, the
selfsame abhominations began too be buylded vppon the earth euen in
S. Paules tyme. And for that cause he sheweth that it is not lawfull

that the cause of S.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 10.</note> Paules packing toogither of so manie woordes in


<pb facs="tcp:23289:70"/>
this place too expresse the Angells withall, is that wee should the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bee hilde too our Lord Iesus Christ, and rest wholly vppon him,
without wandering one way or other, vnder pretence that the Angells
haue excellent and noble giftes. And so wee see and may gather vpon
this streyne, that all the dotage of the popedomme in imagining of
Patrons, Aduocates, and mediators vntoo God, sprang vp euery whit
of it of none other cause, than for want of knowing of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and of the things giuen vntoo him by God his father: For wee
haue no mynd too repoze our selues vppon him, except wee know too
what ende he is come. But the Papistes haue on the one syde imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselues too bee separated from our Lord Iesus Christ, not
knowing that he is become our brother, too the end wee should repayre
familiarly vntoo him: and on the other syde they haue robbed him of
his office which is allotted him in the holy scripture, and made but a
dead thing of it. So much the more therefore behoueth it vs too marke
wel these sayings, that we be made al one, &amp; gathered togither into one
body with the Angells of heauen, and with the holy fathers that lyued
vnder the Lawe, and that wee and all the Prophetes, Apostles, and
Martirs, must with one common accord glorify our commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> head Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and resort vntoo him, and that he must bee set vp on hye for
euery man too looke at, and that wee must not wilfully put blyndfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
before our eyes, but take away all impediment, that his glorye
be not in any wyse dimmed. The very meane then to ouercome all lets
that Satan shall cast in our way too stop vs from comming too Iesus
Christ, is too consider that there is no dignitie or worthinesse in the
whole world, neyther aboue nor beneath, which is not made too stope,
too the end wee should all of vs bee ioyned vntoo him, with one accord.
Thus you see in effect what wee haue too gather vpon this text.</p>
               <p>Trew it is that by those wordes, wee be doone too vndestrand also,
that God distributeth offices among his Angels as pleaseth him, so
as one hath a greater charge than another. Yit notwithstanding it is
not in our power too knowe how the case standeth with them. Let vs
bee contented too knowe it according too the measure of our fayth,
and onely giue eare too Gods woord, and in all sobernesse learne of
him, without giuing brydle too our owne fond curiositie, as a number
doo, whom wee see disputing finely of the Angels, as though euery of
them would bee marshal of Gods house, too place euery of the Angels
according too his degree. For there is not a more diuilish malapert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23289:70"/>
than too babble in that sort of Gods secrets, further than God
hath made vs priuie too them by his woord. Therefore let vs hold our
selues contented, that the Angels (how noble so euer they bee) are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
too be the ministers of our welfare, by meanes of Iesus Christ.
And whensoeuer wee intend too haue the familiaritie (or acquintance
and helpe) of them: Let vs not doo as the Papists doo, which haue
their peculiar prayers too make vnto them: but let vs repayre too Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ: for by that meanes shal all things become common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and vs. When hauing spoken of the Churche, wee say,
I beleeue the communion of Saincts: it is certeyne that the Angels
are comprehended therin, seeing that God imployeth them too doo vs
seruice. And why doth he so? It is not for that wee bee worthye of it:
but bycause he hath gathered vs all toogither vnder Iesus Christ.
That therefore is the verye bond of concorde and brotherhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs and the Angels.</p>
               <p>Now hereupon S. Paule addeth, <hi>that Iesus Christ hath obteyned
a name,</hi> (that is too say, a maiestie) <hi>which is aboue al names, as vvell

of God, and which wee possesse in him alone, so our fayth bee settled
wholy vppon him, according as it is sayd in the Acts of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Act. 4. b. 12.</note>
that there is none other name giuen vnder heauen, whereby wee must
bee saued. For (as I told you this morning) inasmuch as God is
incomprehensible, and dwelleth in light which wee cannot approche
vntoo,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. c. 16.</note> (as S. Paule termeth it:) Iesus Christ must as it were step
in betwixte him and vs, too the end wee may preace boldly vntoo him,
and know that he is not far distant, nor farre separated from vs, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs marke that whereas here is mention made of <hi>Name:</hi> it is
bycause God wilbee knowen in the person of his onely sonne.<note place="margin">Deut. 4. f. 35. 39.</note> It is
sayd herewithall,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. b. 4. 6.</note> that there are not manie Godheads. As touching

said that wee ought too glorye in our knowing of the onely one God:
but yit that is accomplished in the person of our Lord Iesus Christ,
bycause that when men go about too seeke God, they enter intoo a
terrible maze, vnlesse Iesus Christ bee their way and leader. Thus
wee see now whereat S. Paule amed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:71"/>And it is added also, <hi>that the same is not onely for this worlde,
but also for the other:</hi> wherby is ment, that the knoweledge which
wee haue of Iesus Christ, will suffize vs for the heauenly lyfe. Nowe
it should seeme at the first blush, that there is some contrarietie bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this Text, and that which is sayd in the fifteenth Chapter of
the first Epistle too the Corinthians. For there he sayeth, that at the
latter day when the worlde shalbee iudged, our Lord Iesus Christ
shall yeeld vp the kingdome too God his father, of whom he holdeth
it: and here he sayeth, that Christ is stab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ished in all aucthoritie, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for the worlde too come. But these twoo agree very well. For
wheras he sayeth, that Iesus Christ hath a name aboue al names, and
that he is the image of God his father: that is bycause of our rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and infirmitie, according also as when he is called Gods liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
that is, bycause we could not bee in rest, except wee knewe that
God hath his hand stretched out too succour vs at our neede: and wee
perceiue that the better in Iesus Christ, inasmuch as he is come neere
vntoo vs, and is become our brother. God than dooth not so reigne by
the meane of Iesus Christ, that he shoulde giue ouer his owne offyce,
and sit ydle in heauen himselfe: it were a leawd dotage too thinke so.
And truly wee see how our Lord Iesus Christ speaketh therof in the
fifteenth of S. Iohn: my father and I (sayeth he) haue alwayes our
hand at woorke. There he sheweth that the ordeyning of him too bee
ruler of the worlde, was not too the ende that the father should in the
meane whyle sit vnoccupied in heauen: but it is saide so in respecte of
vs, too the intent that we should not doubt but that God is continually
neare at hand too vs, when wee seeke hym in faith. At the latter day,
and after the iudgement, wee shall haue new eyes, as saith S. Iohn.

Paule) and that wee knowe hym in part. You see then, that the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp of the kingdome by our Lord Iesus Christ vntoo God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is that wee shal behold Gods maiestie and substance which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
too vs as nowe. For wee shal haue our nature chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and wee shalbe newe fashioned in the heauenly glory, and we shal
be quite and cleane rid of al the corruption wherewith wee be compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
about as now. And yit for al this, it is not ment that Iesus Christ


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23289:71"/>
shalbe abaced: for hee shalbe then muche better in his perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is said in the third too the Colossians, that our life is hyd
in God with Iesus Christ, and that when Iesus Christ appeareth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
shal our life bee discouered likewise. Too be short, when wee be come
too the souerein blisse, that is purchaced for vs, then shal wee haue the
thing that lieth as yit but in hope, &amp; Iesus Christ shal gather al things
too hym selfe, so as wee shal be then partakers of his glory, euery man
according too his owne degree and measure. Thus yee see how these
two Textes agree very wel: namely (that God hath giuen Christe a
name aboue all names, and also) that he shal yeeld vp the kingdome to
God the Father. And why? for wee shal then see his heauenly maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
which we bee not able too conceiue as now, bicause wee be flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Also wee shal perceiue, that wheras Iesus Christ is appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs a mortal man, he hath bin so glorifyed in his humane nature,
that in very deede he is God, of one selfe same substance with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This (say I) shalbe fully knowen then, wheras nowe wee haue
but a litle shadow of it. Furthermore, let vs learne, that when Iesus
Christ was exalted by God his father, it was too the ende that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
should serue too our euerlasting saluation. And therefore
in the .ix. of Esay he is called the father of the worlde too come, too the
end wee might knowe, not only that he is giuen vntoo vs for this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
life, but also that the substance of the faith which is grounded in
hym, is in heauen, and that there wee shall feele the fruite of the thing
that is now hidden, and which wee taste as yit but in part, and that wee
shal enter intoo full possession of all the goodes that are giuen too hym
already. Thus yee see why S. Paule hath purposely made expresse
mention of the world too come.</p>
               <p>He addeth immediately, <hi>that God hath put all thinges vnder his
feete, and made hym head of the Church aboue all thinges.</hi> His
speaking here of the subiection of the whole worlde, is too shewe, that
what soeuer thing wee haue neede of, if wee can resort too our Lorde
Iesus Christ, he is able too succour vs, for he hath wherewith too doo
it. Yea and wee must marke well how it is sayd in the eyght Psalme,
that God hath care of all thinges, yea euen vntoo the sheepe, too the
byrdes of the ayre, and too the fishes of the sea. Too bee short, al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are put vnder his feete. And too what end? For the holy Ghost
ment too drawe vs therby, as litle babes, and to shew that the spiritual
benefites (which wee ought too haue in greatest estimation) are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated


<pb facs="tcp:23289:72"/>
too vs by our Lord Iesus Christ. His saying then is, that
wee might not eate one byt of bread, saue in respect that wee bee mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Iesus Christ. For it is all one as if he intended too traine vs
vp higher by an Apcie, in as much as all thinges are giuen too our
Lord Iesus Christ, with condition, that if wee bee members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in deede, al things that he hath, doo belong vntoo vs, and that if wee
separate not our selues from him, he wyl hereafter make vs partakers
of farre higher and excellenter goodes: that is too wit, that we shalbe
named Gods chyldren, and bee taken so too bee, and become the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of his holy Ghost. And what a thing is that? What a thing is
it, that wee may come freely vntoo hym, and cal vppon hym boldly, as
our father? What a thing is it too bee inriched ageine with the giftes
that wee were bereft of by the sinne of Adam? What a thing is it too
bee matched in felowship with the Angels, in stead of being vnder the
tyrannie of Satan, and vnder the thraldome of sinne? Howe can wee
haue these so high and noble thinges, sith wee can not clayme so much
as a morsel of bread as our owne, without theft, sauyng in that wee be
members of our Lord Iesus Christ. Now then wee see whereat S.
Paule amed, in saying that all things are made subiect too our Lorde
Iesus Christ. So then let vs learne now too giue God thankes in the
name of his onely sonne our lord Iesus Christ, whom he hath sent, not
onely too feede and nourishe our bodyes, but also too bee foode too our
soules, that they may lyue euerlastingly. And by that meane let vs
learne too inure our selues, to acknowledge that our Lorde Iesus
Christ hath wherwith too succour al our necessities. Then if the diuell
make so violent assault vpon vs, as we may be afrayde of vtter quay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
let vs vnderstand that our lord Iesus Christ hath an inuincible
fortresse wherwith too defend vs ageinst hym, and armyes wherewith
too make vs inuincible in al battels. Therfore when wee bee weake,
let vs resort too his strength: when wee want any grace, let vs desyre
him too giue vs what he thinketh necessary: when our enemyes play
the mad beastes, and it seemeth that wee shoulde be quite and cleane
swallowed vp as it were in gulfes, let vs beseech our lord Iesus Christ
too hold vs vnder his protection, and too hold Satan as it were chay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with al his vpholders, so as he suffer vs not too be ouercomme of
of them. Yee see then how all thinges were made subiect to our lord
Iesus Christ, not for his owne vse: (for what neede had he of them?)
but for our sakes, too the end he should giue vs what soeuer he knoweth


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23289:72"/>
too bee for our behoofe, and that wee also shoulde learne too seeke all
thinges at his hand, and that when he seeth our enemyes haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of vs, he should represse them, as he wel can.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, wheras S. Paule sayeth heere, that <hi>he was ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
head in the Church</hi> (or ouer the Church) <hi>in all thinges:</hi> it is a
continuing in his matter, too bring vs wholly too Iesus Christ. As
if he should say, It is trew that Gods gracious giftes are delt abrode,
yea and that the Angelles and mortall men also may bee ministers of
them vntoo vs: but yit howsoeuer the cace stand, we must alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
too the welhead. The veynes that are dispersed throughout the
whole bodie, may well giue strength too euery part, for they bee as it
were the Cunditpypes of the blud: but yit howsoeuer the world go, the
brayne must alwayes be the welspring of lyfe. It is wel to be seen, that
in a tree the sap is spred throughout: and yit notwithstading albeeit
that the roote ascende not vp too giue nurrishment too euery braunche
and leafe: all the nurrishment commeth of the roote. And if any man
woold say, that the whole tree is maynteyned alyue by any one brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch:
the cleane contrary is seene. It is trew that a great bough may well
giue nurrishment to the braunches and twigges that are about it: but
is it meete that that should preiudice the roote therfore? (No surely:)
no more than the members of a mans body ought too preiudice the
heade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though euery member doo his dewty. Here S. Paule sayeth
that our Lord Iesus Christ was giuen to the Churche to be hir heade
aboue all thinges, as if he should say, it behoueth vs all too resort vntoo
him. In this cace ther is nother S. Paule, nor S. Peter, nor the virgin
Mary, nor S. Michaell that haue ought of their owne. For they are
all needie &amp; hungery, sauing so farforth as Iesus Christ filleth them: &amp;
therfore al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well che great as the small, must be fayne to draw
out of his plentie. And that is the cause why that in the selfsame text
which I alledged out of the first to the Colossians,<note place="margin">Colos. 1. c. 19.</note> S. Paule sayeth, it
pleased God the father that all plentie or fulnesse should dwell in him.
For the tytle of <hi>Head</hi> is not alonely a style of fleeting honour: but it
serueth too expresse the power of our Lord Iesus Christ so much the
better. Therefore lyke as a (naturall) head not onely hath superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and preeminence aboue the whole body, but also yeeldeth nurrish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
too the whole, and keepeth the man alyue: euen so is it betweene
our Lord Iesus Christ and vs, in so much that all should go to wrecke,
if wee depended not vppon him. Although (say I) it seeme that wee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:73"/>
haue receiued ryght excellent giftes at Gods hande already: yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all is but wynde and smoke, vnlesse wee holde out in the
vnion of our Lord Iesus Christ. Herewithall it behoueth vs too note
also, that inasmuch as Christ is called a heade, it is meete that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
should obey him, and that wee should yeelde vntoo his doctrine,
that he may rule all things as the head ruleth all the rest of a mannes
body. For the feete go, and the handes stirre, and too bee short, there is
no part which is not willing and forewarde too doo whatsoeuer the
head shall appoynt it. The lyke must bee doone in the Church: Iesus
Christ must rule, and all men must quietly obey him. And so we haue
too marke in this text, first that our saluation dooth so depend vppon
Iesus Christ, that there are nother Angells nor men, how holy soeuer
they bee, which haue not neede too receyue at his hand, the thinges
that they want in themselues. And therefore when wee stand in neede
of any thing that is requisite, eyther for the present lyfe, or for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
lyfe, eyther for our bodyes, or for our soules: there is no running
too S. Peter, nor too S. Paule, but wee must go streyght to our Lord
Iesus Christ. Marke that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Secondly also let vs lerne too suffer our selues too bee ruled, and
too bee hild in awe by the hand of our Lord Iesus Christ, that therby
wee may shewe our selues too bee trew members of his bodie. And
he cannot bee our head, but he must needes therwithall bee our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
too, and haue all authoritie ouer vs. But lyke as I told you that
the diuell hath labored too deface the glorie of Gods only sonne, vnder
the pretence of Angells: so on the othersyde, he hath sent vs an ydole
intoo the world, too bee a barre in our way, that Iesus Christ myght
bee as it were separated from vs. For the Pope is not ashamed too
spew out this blasphemie, that the Chruch should bee but a headlesse
bodie, if he himselfe reygned not ouer it, ne had the vniuersall domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, so as euery man looked at him, and his seate were aboue the
whole world. And that is as much as if he should say, that Iesus
Christ hath no more too doo here, but ought too hold him contented
with heauen, and let his successor alone too rule in his stead. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee see how he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uershoots himselfe, to abolishe the whole souerein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the sonne of God. So much the more therefore doth it stand vs
on hand too beare well this Text in mynd, wherein S. Paule sayeth,
that Iesus Christ is appoynted too bee head of the Churche aboue all
things. It is trew that the Pope will affirme himselfe too bee but as


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23289:73"/>
an vnderhead, and therefore that Iesus Christ is not thrust out of his
place. But let vs looke backe too that which I haue touched alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
which is, that Iesus Christ will haue no imaginatiue title, but
will haue his power reserued vntoo him, which belongeth vntoo him.
For a head requireth not onely too bee set hyghest: but also too haue
all men too receyue all things from him: and it behoueth vs all too
vnderstand, and that he is the very roote of our life, and the fountayne
from whence it behoueth vs too draw, notwithstanding that he send
foorth his spirituall benefits and goods among vs, by such chanels or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>undits, as he thinks good. Thus yee see what wee haue yit further
briefly too beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>This matter is layd foorth more at large in the first Chapter too
the Colossians. For S. Paule sheweth there, that our Lord Iesus
Christ,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1. b. 16. 17. 18.</note> was appoynted too bee the head euen from the beginning of
the world, forsomuchas all things were created in him, and not alonly
forsomuchas he is our redeemer at this day. For put the cace that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
had not falne intoo the ruine wherintoo he hath drawen vs with
him: yit had Gods sonne bin alwayes still as the first borne of al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Not that he himselfe is a creature, but bycause he is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according also as S. Paule addeth the reason thereof, which is,
that in him the Angels were created, and in him they haue their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or abiding. Yee see then that the sonne of God should not haue
ceassed to haue had all preheminence both aboue and beneath, though
wee had not falne with our father Adam intoo such confuzion as wee
bee in. But now our Lord Iesus Christ must bee our head after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner: that is too wit, too make vs at one agein with God his
father, aud too gather vs toogither agein vntoo him, from whom wee
were estraunged by sinne, so as he was our deadly enemie, til we were
brought in fauour agein by meanes of Iesus Christ, by forgiuing vs
our sinnes. And besides this, S. Paule declareth in the same Text,
that Iesus Christ was ordeyned head of the Churche, too the end that
all fulnesse should bee in him. Thus wee see how wee ought too be
knit with the Angels, with the auncient fathers, and with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
with condition that our Lord Iesus Christ must neuerthelesse
not onely continew the first and chiefe, but also haue all things refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vntoo him, and wee communicate in such wise toogither, that euery
of vs keepe his place, and bee all members of one body, and that there
bee no mo heads thereof but onely one. For if we adde any fellowe


<pb facs="tcp:23289:74"/>
to Iesus Christ, it is a bereeuing him of the thing that God his father
hath giuen too him alone. Let vs bee contented that he maketh vs
partakers of all his benefits, vppon condicion that wee acknowledge
all things too come from him, and seeke all things in him. For in the
fiue and fortith Psalme it is well shewed,<note place="margin">Psal. 45. b. 8.</note> that we are al of vs fellowes
with Iesus Christ, and that we receyue some portion of all the good
things that were giuen vntoo him. But yit for all that, it is not too
bee sayd that he is fellowe and fellowelyke with vs, and that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee discerned from his Apostles as the papists prate in their (pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish)
prouerbe, but it is too the end that wee should knowe, that none
of all the good thinges which wee can wishe, are farre from vs, but
that they bee offered vs by him, and that he is so liberall, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth
nothing else at our hands, but that we should receyue the things
that are for our owne welfare, according as he himselfe sayeth, Come
vntoo mee all yee that are a thirst,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 55. 1.</note> come drinke water, yea euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money or moneyes woorth, drinke your fyll of water, wyne, and
mylke. There our Lord sheweth howe it is he that wee must resort
vntoo, and that if wee looke vppon him, his maiestie is too hygh and
too farre of from vs. Iesus Christ therefore must bee as our meane,
and forasmuch as he is come downe too vs: let vs also repayre vntoo
him,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. f. 38.</note> according as is sayd in the seuenth of S. Iohn, come vntoo mee
all yee that are a thirst:<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. b. 14.</note> and whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I
wyll giue him, he shall haue his belly so full, that fountaines of water
shall flowe out of him. Condicionally that men seeke faythfully in
Iesus Christ for the things they haue neede of, he will giue vs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so much as shall serue the turne of euery one of vs for himselfe: but
also so much as wee shall bee able too bestowe vppon our neyghbours
too, and too succour their want.</p>
               <p>Now for a conclusion S. Paule addeth, <hi>that the Church is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and accomplishment of him that accomplisheth</hi> (or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth)
<hi>all things in all men.</hi> In terming the Church the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, he sheweth the thing that I haue touched already: that is
too wit, that wee neede not too make long windlasses or harde iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
too get the things that wee haue neede of. For sith wee bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ioyned too the sonne of God: what require wee more? Wee
must needes graunt this principle, that we haue nother lyfe, nor glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
nor any good thing, but onely in God alone. That beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
let vs see by what meane wee may atteyne too him: and that is


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23289:74"/>
by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ. And so yee see the cause why
it is sayd heere, that all fulnesse dwelleth in him, &amp; that it is his charge
too vnite vs vntoo God, and too drawe vs backe from the scattering,
wherein wee bee. Therfore wee cannot swarue aside one way nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too conuey any peece of that thing to S. Peter, or too S. Powle,
which is reserued too Iesus Christ alone, but that wee must rob God
of his dew. Trew it is, that wee will not bee acknowen of it: but yit
shall not our Hipocrisie serue too acquit vs before God. Wee may
well pretend many starting holes, but yit doo wee giue sentence of
condemnation vppon our selues, in confessing that wee ought to seeke
all our welfare at Gods hand. Well then, if wee alledge that wee be
not woorthye too preace intoo Gods presence: it is trew, and if wee
aske how wee may bee able too fly without winges: that is trew too.
And if wee say, then must wee repayre too S. Peter or too S. Paule,
that wee speake of our owne head. For God sayeth the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
I send you too myne onely sonne (sayth he:) for in him shall
you fynde all that you want: and feare not that yee shall haue any
scarcitie, if yee bee once fylled with the grace that I haue put in him,
and which abydeth in him. And that is the cause why the Prophet
Esay<note place="margin">Esay. 55. a. 1.</note> speaketh purposely of Wyne, Water, &amp; Milke: as if he should
say, wee haue all fulnesse of lyfe in Iesus Christ. As for those then
which gad too S. Peter and too S. Paule, and will needes haue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Mediators: they not onely doo wrong too Iesus Christ, in
cantling out the thing by peeces and gobbets which is giuen wholly
vntoo him: but also rob God of his honour. For sith it is his will, that
all fulnesse should dwell in Iesus Christ, accordyng as I haue alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
afore: it is certeine that wee go about to defye him openly, when
wee abyde not within the boundes which he hath set vs, in putting vs
in subiection too that person which he hath giuen vntoo vs, too the end
that he should giue vs all that wee haue neede of.</p>
               <p>But yit the thing which he addeth ought too be a greater and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
comfort to vs, when he saith, that <hi>the Chruch is the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him that accomplisheth all.</hi> Now, by this woord <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,</hi>
he meeneth that our Lord Iesus Christ, yea and also God
his father account them selues as vnperfect, except wee bee ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him. And that (as I sayd) is a record of Gods infinit goodnesse,
wherat a man can neuer maruell ynough. First and formost, God
needeth not too borrow at other mens handes: for he is perfect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:75"/>
nother wanted he aught euen before he made the worlde. And
when he made it, did he it for his owne profit, or too his owne aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?
No: it was alonely too the intent that wee should knowe his
goodnesse, power, wisdome, and ryghtuousnesse, and bee witnesses of
it. For he hath set vs heere as on a stage, too the end wee should see
his glorie in all his creatures: and yit notwithstanding he could verye
well forbeare vs. But put the cace that God should borrowe of others
too perfect himself withall, and that he were lyke too mortall men, of
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none is able to forbeare companie: put the cace that God were
such a one: What are wee? What can he fare the better by being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vntoo vs? It is all one as if the sonne were matched with a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myre.
For what haue wee but infection and filthinesse? what are we
else than things so corrupted by Adams sin, as it is horrible too think?
How then can wee bring any such perfection vntoo God? Although
there bee nothing but frayltie in vs: although wee bee froward and
leawd: although there bee nothing in vs but all manner of filth: and
too bee shorte, although wee bee lothely in his syght: yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it is his will to haue vs ioyned to him, yea euen vppon condition
that he should bee perfected in vs by his and our ioyning after that
sort toogither. As if a father should say, mee thinkes my house is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when I see not my child in it. A husband man will say, mee thinkes
I am but half an man, when my wyfe is not with mee.</p>
               <p>After the same manner speaketh God, that he thinkes not himselfe
full and perfect, but by gathering of vs too him, and by making vs all
one with himselfe. He taketh his whole pleasure in vs, and will
haue his glory too shine foorth in vs, so as his beames may sheade
out on all sides. And although the whole glory bee in himselfe: Yit
will he haue it seene, how it is his will that wee should haue our part
and portion of it. Thus you see in effect what S. Paule ment by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Churche, the accomplishment of God and of Iesus Christ.
Now then, can wee bee excuzed before God, when wee say that wee
cannot come at him, seing wee bee his bodie in the person of our
Lord Iesus Christ? If one of our feete being diseased, would runne I
wote not whither, and raunge vp and downe, saying, I go too seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e where else: and for performance thereof, would bee cut
of from the bodie: if (say I) that the members of a bodie had any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and discretion, and could speake after that maner: were it
not a madnesse that the foote should say, he would bee rent from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23289:75"/>
too seeke else where the thing that it wanteth? Euen so when the
Papistes and other Idolaters alledge that they must bee fayne too
serue their turne by the Saynctes, and too haue diuers mediators and
meanes too bring them too God: it is all one as if they should say, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is nobodie, nother haue wee any successe or enterance vntoo
him. Yea, are the membes separated from the head? Of a truthe,
S. Paule hath heere accused and condemned all those of vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and vnkyndnesse, which vnder colour of vnwoorthinesse too come
vntoo God, doo deuyze themselues new meanes, and separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from Iesus Christ, and diminish his power, and rend it in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
S. Paule condemneth them for that they cannot fynde in theyr
hartes too accept the benefyte and priuiledge that is offered them, in
that our Lord Iesus Christ hath voutsafed too become all one with
them, as with his owne body. Nowe then let vs lerane too haue such
familiaritie with our Lord Iesus Christ, as too resort vntoo him at all
times whensoeuer wee bee warned of our defaults and wantes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore too the intent his maiestie shoulde not bee defaced
thereby: S. Paule addeth, that he ceasseth not too accomplishe all
things in all men. For wee see on the one side, that when men are
once indewed with Gods giftes, they fall too thrusting of themselues
intoo his place, and would bee esteemed in his stead. After that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doo wee deale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and wee beare our selues in hand that the gyftes
which God hath bestowed vppon vs freely, are as a pray or bootie too
boast of, and too aduaunce our selues more than is lawfull. Agein, on
the other syde, when wee heare Iesus Christ spoken of, how he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baced
for our sakes, how he went downe intoo the dungeons of death,
how he voutsafed to bee subiect to all reproche: it seemeth too vs that
wee may well despyze him. S. Paule therefore too beate downe all
pryde, and too shew that Iesus Christ was not so abaced, that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
was diminished: sayeth, that yit neuerthelesse hee dooth all in all
things. Wherefore let vs learne too receyue the blissing, grace, and
benefites which are giuen vs by our Lord Iesus Christ. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
let vs acknowledge, not only that we be made of nothing, and
that our lyfe is but a flyghtfull and vanishing shadowe: but also that
all the vertue and excellencie which wee weene our selues too haue, is
but lyke a greene flower, which withereth out of hand as soone as
God breatheth vppon it. And therefore let vs not imagin our selues
too bee riche, wheras wee bee poore: let vs not vaunt our selues of our


<pb facs="tcp:23289:76"/>
owne free will: let vs not presume vppon our owne desertes, nor vpon
any other of the flimflammes which the diuel hath deuyzed in poperie:
but let vs draw, let vs draw of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine that cannot be drained dry,
that wee may fynd wherwith too staunche our thirst whensoeuer we be
dry. Finally there are two meanes wherby God doth all in all things.
For like as he himselfe created the worlde: so also must all thinges
bee guided and gouerned by his hand. If it bee demaunded who
causeth the Sunne too ryse and set euery day, who guideth the whole
order of nature, who ordreth the dayes, moonethes and yeares, and
who maketh the intercourse of day and night: It is God, who dooth
all in all things. As much is too bee sayd of all other things which
we perceyue in the vniuersal gouernement of the whole world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must not imagine that God was a Creator but for a minute
of an houre: but that he dooth also hold on in mainteyning the things
that he created. Howbeeit S. Paule speaketh here of the spirituall
goods which are, as yee would say, the peculiar heritage of Gods
children. God then doth all things in vs: Yea, but not alonly by the
common order of nature: but by inlightening vs with the beleefe of the
Gospel, in that he halloweth vs, and clenzeth vs from the vices and
wicked lusts of our fleshe, in that he draweth vs from the world, and to
bee short, in that he pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uideth vs all things requisite too our welfare
and saluation. And so yee see how he doeth all in all things. As if S.
Paule had declared in one woord, that the faythfull are not any thing,
ne can doo any thing, ne haue any thing of themselues. Then spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
he not here, nother of the sunne, nor of the moone, nor of the trees
in the fieldes, nor of any other frute: nother speaketh he of beasts, no
nor yit of men, as in respect that they be the children of Adam: but of
those whom God hath begotten agein by his holy spirit: so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
concerneth saluation, or belongeth too the heauenly lyfe, is not
to bee had but onely at his hand which hath all things in himselfe, and
dooth all in all things, as is sayd of him here. And therefore let vs
learne too emptie our selues, and too offer our selues in sacrifize too
God with trew and right humilitie, too yeeld him his deserued praise,
so as none of vs separate our selues from him through our owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindenesse,
but all of vs doo him such honour, as too confesse that wee
hold all of him, and that wee bee ioyned too him by our Lord Iesus
Christ, who is our euerlasting God, acknowledging that it is he from
whom all good things come, and that it is he also too whom all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:23289:76"/>
ought too bee yeelded and rendered.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let vs cast our selues downe before the Maiestie of
our good God, with acknowledgment of our sinnes, praying him
too make vs perceyue them more and more, and that the same may
cause vs too haue such a mislyking in our selues, as wee may earnestly
and hartily seeke too giue ouer our selues wholly too our Lord Iesus
Christ. And that forasmuch as he hath called vs already too him by
his Gospell: wee may so frame our selues thereafter, as too renounce
all superstitions, and too assure our selues that all that euer wee can
imagin too bring vs too the kingdome of heauen, are but deceytes of
Satan, and that it is ynough for vs too haue Iesus Christ alone too
make our recourse vntoo: that lyke as it was the fathers will too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
him on high, too the intent that all men should looke at him: so
also wee may haue our eyes fastened vppon him, and apply our whole
myndes in such wyse thitherwarde, as wee may haue none other way
nor preparation than by him alone, nor swarue one way nor other: but
when wee bee once brought intoo the ryght way, holde on continually
towardes our marke, till we be fully come thither. That it may please
him too graunt this grace, not onely to vs, but also too all people. &amp;c.</p>

saluation, and too assure our selues that our whole welfare lyeth in
him, so as wee seeke it there with al lowelynesse: and also too knowe

               <p>Thus you see what the spirituall lyfe of man is, and where it lyeth:
that is too wit, in the lyght of Gods woord, and in the woorking of his
holie spirit, so as wee be new fashyoned agein according too the image
that was lost, and vtterly defaced in vs by Adams sin. And is that
too bee found among worldly men? Yea euen among those that are
most honored? No surely. Then is it not without cause that our Lord
Iesus vseth this similitude, saying, that wee bee raysed from death by

that man bringeth death with him euen with his birth: not only
bycause he is mortall, but also bycause he is separated from God. We
bee mortall wyghtes, and it were but in respect that wee must needes
passe through this world, and depart thence whensoeuer it pleaseth
God: but wee bee also dead afore hand. And how is that? Bycause
our soules are altoogither sinfull.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. a. 7.</note> There is nother thought nor affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

eyther one thing or other, wee can neuer deuyse any thing in

Genesis, that God knew that all that euer man had in his thought and
imagination,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

wee had knowledge of good and euill,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. b. 6.</note> and that wee had farre
greater skill and discretion than wee haue: yit are wee so marred, that
all our desires and lustes rebell ageinst God, as it were too make
warre ageinst him. Seyng then that we be so corrupted in our soules,
and that there is nother thought nor affection which is not vtterly
naught: let vs not thinke it straunge, that God with his owne mouth
auoweth vs too bee dead, notwithstanding that through our owne fond
ouerweening, wee imagin that there is some lyfe in vs. And that is
the very thing which S. Paule treateth of as now, in saying that the
Ephesians were parttakers of the aboue mentioned grace, though
they were deade through their owne sinnes and iniquities. As if he
should saye, Too the intent yee may the better esteeme the valew of
Gods grace, and what it bringeth with it: thinke not only vppon your
present state, but consider that if God had left you such as you were of
your selues, and had not succored you at all, but had let you followe
your owne swindge: you had bin vndoone. Consider what your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, for yee were dead, and there was no hope that euer you should
bee quickened agein, bicause it is not in the power of mans owne free-will,
too giue himselfe lyfe agein when he is once dead. Knowe yee
therfore that God did draw you out of the dungeon of all destruction,
yea rather out of the bottom of hell, when he voutsafed too adopt you


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23289:78"/>
too bee his children, and too call you too the knowledge of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
Wee see that this saying of Saint Paules, is conformable too
the doctrine and recorde of our Lorde Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>So then, let vs alwayes runne backe to the welles head, whensoeuer
we be tempted too glory in our owne vertewes, and imagin our selues
too haue I wote not what too aduaunce vs withall: let vs resort too
our naturall state, let vs consider that wee had bin vndoone, and that
wee were vndoone yit still at this day, if God of his infinite mercy had
not drawen vs out of the confuzion wherin wee were, and deliuered vs
from it by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ. And it is purposely
sayd in <hi>offences and sinnes:</hi> too stoppe all mennes mouthes, that no
man myght make profer too withdrawe himselfe from the common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raye,
nor think that any thing is so greeuous as the corruption of our
nature, which cannot bee stayed but by death. It S. Paule had set
downe but one of the words, eyther <hi>offences</hi> or <hi>sinnes:</hi> by and by there
woold haue bin answearing and replying. For some woold haue
thought themselues too haue bin of the common aray. And other some
would haue said, Uery wel, though there bee some synne in vs, though
there bee some fault in vs, it doth not therfore folowe, that wee bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
condemned and cursed of God: for wyl he vse suche rigour and
extremitie ageinst vs? But S. Paule hath ioyned both the woordes
toogither, too shew that there is nothing in our nature, but all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and sinne: and at a woord, that there is not one drop of life too bee
found in it. Therfore it is al one, as though he ment too aggrauate or
make the thing heynous, which men on their part would make light.
For if wee haue neuer so smal a portion of vertue, yea, or but a shadow
of it: wee wyll needes exalt it aboue all the mountaines of the worlde.
But if there bee any vices in vs, though they bee neuer so grosse and
apparant, yit wee make but very light faultes of them. Therefore it
stood S. Paule on hand too beate downe this fond presumptuousnesse
of men, and too shew them that they bee wholly saped in sinne. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he speake heere too the Ephesians, yit speaketh he generally
too all men. And in good sooth, he expresseth it yit better, in saying,
<hi>that vvee vvalked according too the trade of the vvorld:</hi> for the
euyll lurketh vnespied, tyll it bewray it selfe by his fruites. And the
cause why men cannot humble themselues before God as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
is that they flatter themselues till they bee conuicted, and bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

For wee see what hipocrisie is in vs, insomuch that wee woold beare
our selues in hand that blacke were whyte, and neuer fynd our selues
faultie, so long as our misdeedes could not bee layd open too our faces,
nor any man stop our mouthes, by witnessing them too our heads. Too
haue many wicked thoughtes, or too bee tempted too doo this or that
euyll, wee thinke it no sinne at al. Too bee short, S. Paule hath iustly
set downe, that the Ephesians walked in their sinnes: too the intent too
shewe, that he speaketh not of a thing which ought too bee vnknowen
too them. For in beholding their owne lyues, and in beholding what
they had bin, and what trace they had followed: they should be driuen
too confesse that they were vtterly forlorne &amp; cursed afore God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when soeuer our hypocrisie hindereth vs from submitting our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
yit is it nothing in comparison of that whiche God knoweth.
Yit notwithstanding too waken vs the better, that wee may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

vs alwayes iudge of the roote by the fruites of it. Seeing then that
wee bee gilty of offending God so many wayes, let vs conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that there is nothing but frowardnesse in our nature. And too
shewe the better that he speaketh not here of any one sort of men, but of
al mankind: S. Paule addeth, <hi>that it vvas according too the trade

and sinnes. Wee be so filled and stuffed with them, that we burst agein.
Thus yee see how S. Paule ment heere, not too rebuke some one sort
of men, but too shewe all men without exception what their state is, till
God haue redressed it. Therefore let vs open our eyes, and looke intoo
the thing that S. Paule sayeth, and wee shall perceyue that all our
woorthinesse and noblenesse is decyphred vntoo vs heere, heere are
our armes blazed: that is too wit, that wee bee but dead men, till God
quicken vs by his mere grace. Agein, too the end wee should knowe
that this death proceedeth not from elswhere than of our owne sinnes:
it is sayd, that wee bee all corrupted, that there is nothing in vs but
faultes, sinnes, and offences, and that all our whole lyfe beareth record
thereof, so as the fruite sheweth what the roote is. And on the other
syde, that our starting aside is not for once and no more, but that wee
tend wholly thither, that is too say, too euill: wee bee inclyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untoo,
nay rather wee bee caryed headlong thereuntoo, yea and wee
bee driuen with such a rage, that wee neuer ceasse stryuing ageinst
God, tyll he haue broughte vs in subiection too him by his holye
spirit.</p>
               <p>And S. Paule thinkes it not ynough to saye so: but addeth things
which ought to make vs too tremble yet more, saying, <hi>that it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the prince of the aire, according as he hath all power in the
vvorlde, according too the spirit that ruleth all the vnbeleeuers.</hi>
His talking after that maner, is too shewe, that till God haue quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs by meanes of our Lord Iesus Chryst, &amp; vntill he haue gathered
vs vnto him: the diuell hath dominion ouer vs. See I pray you what
the dignitie of men is, vntill Iesus Christ haue raunsomed them. They
dye not once and away, (but euerlastingly:) and he must bee fayne by
his Gospell to make them parttakers of the saluatinn which he hath
purchased for them. Then vntyll God haue wrought in vs by his
grace, whose are wee? The diuels: he is our prince. Too bee short, he
hath all authoritie ouer vs, and ruleth vs with such tyranny, as there is
nothing but haling of vs too him by force. But S. Paule vseth this
word <hi>Spirit</hi> purposely, to shew that the diuell ruleth all our thoughts,
all our affections, and all our desyres, that he possesseth vs, and that
wee bee all wholly his bondslaues. At a woord, wee cannot stirre one
finger, wee cannot once moue, wee cannot thinke one thought, but the
diuell is at our elbowe, and haleth vs in such wyse, as wee vtterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
deadly enemyes too God. When wee heare these things, it is


<pb facs="tcp:23289:80"/>
no time for vs too fall a sleepe and too flatter our selues, nor too bee so
lustie and presumptuous, as too go too lawe still with God, as though
there were some goodnesse in vs, &amp; that he were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to acknowledge
our vertues. Must not men needes bee too farre out of their wittes,
when they continue still in their hipocrisie, and will needes stand too
their tackeling ageinst God, and win him by their replying, after that
the holy Ghost hath thundred so dreadfull and horrible a sentence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
our heades? Then if a man bee considered in himselfe and in his
owne nature, what shall he bee able too say? Behold, a creature cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of God, and woorthie too bee cast out of the common account of all
other creatures, yea euen of woormes, flyes, lyce, and vermine. For
there is more valour in any vermin in the world, than there is in man.
For man is a creature wherein Gods image is defaced, and the good
that he had put in it, corrupted: there is nothing in it but sinne, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that wee bee the diuells limbes, and he not onely ruleth vs, but
also possesseth vs and is our prince. Bee wee once throughly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of this in our hartes, shall wee not on the one side haue cause too
runne quaking too our Lord Iesus Christ, and too holde vs shrowded
vnder the shadowe of his winges? And on the other syde, must it not
needes bee a beastly blockishnesse, if wee bee so thanklesse as not too
magnifie Gods goodnesse, in that he hath drawen vs out of such a
dungeon vntoo himselfe, too make vs fellowes and brethren not onely
of the Angells of heauen, but also of our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the
Lord of glory, thereby too put away all reproche, and in stead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hatefull too all creatures, too make vs beare his marke, and too
bee honored, and too bee imbraced of the Angells, as their brethren,
and too bee auowed of our Lord Iesus Christ as members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die?
So then, now wee see S. Paules meaning.</p>
               <p>And further, too the intent that all replying should ceasse: he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what the power of the diuell is. For he could haue sayd in one
woord, yee haue liued after the maner of the world, that is too say, diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>for so doeth the thing that he speaketh import: but in sted of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the diuell in one woord, he sayeth first, <hi>according too the prince
that hath his povver in the aire, and the spirit that vvoorketh euen
novv in the rebellious children.</hi> In saying, the prynce that hath his
power in the aire, he disappoynteth vs of all starting holes. For it is
not for n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught, that the diuell is named the prince of the world: and
yit it is not for that he reygneth ouer the sonne, the moone, the starres,


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23289:80"/>
the skyes, and the earth: but for that he holdeth vs captiue in his
bondes: bycause wee bee not woorthie too bee gouerned by God. For
had Adam continued in the soundnesse wherin God created him:
God woold haue hild vs as his children. But after the fall of our first
father, God left vs, and Satan tooke vs in possession. True it is that
Satan cannot doo any thing at all without Gods leaue: for wheras
he is named the prince of the woorld, it is not ment that he fyghteth in
such wyse ageinst God, as it cannot bee knowen who is the stronger:
that were a cursed blasphemie, and lyke these heretikes, which seeing
such phrases in the scripture, haue imagined that the diuell dooth now
and then resist God, and that he hath such force and power, that God
is fayne sometymes too giue him place. But such woordes are stark
madnesse. Neuerthelesse this souereintie of Satan is Gods iust ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
according as it is sayd, that he deliuereth vs intoo the handes
of our enemyes, when wee cannot abyde that he should reigne ouer vs.
And so is that thing fulfilled and verefyed in vs all. Forasmuch as
God hath printed his mark in vs, wee ought too bee gouerned by his
spirit: but our father would needes exalt himselfe, he would needes set
vp his bristles ageinst God, and he was not contented with his owne
state and boundes. Forasmuch therfore as he rebelled in that wyse,
and could not fynd in his hart too abyde the souerein dominion of
God: he was giuen vp too the diuell, and made subiect too him: and
forasmuch as he could not abyde that God should reigne ouer him, he
was fayne too haue another mayster, and that subiection must reach
vntoo all men in generall. So then let vs marke that the souerenitie &amp;
tyrannie of the diuell, is a iust vengeance of God vppon men for their
sinne. Let that serue for one poynt. And therfore let vs not imagine
that the diuell hath the reynes of the brydle layd looce in his necke, or
that he hath libertie too doo what he liste, though God withstand him:
but that wee bee left vp and giuen ouer vntoo him. And too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
wee may yit better knowe this subiection, S. Paule sayeth that
he <hi>is in the aire,</hi> as he will speake more at large ageyn in the ende of
the Epistle. He could haue sayd simply, according too the prince that
hath great power, according as our Lord Iesus sayeth,<note place="margin">Luk. 3. d. 27.</note> that he is the
strong man which possesseth the world in peace. Yee see then that the
diuell is called a prince, bycause he hath such power as wee bee not
able too withstand.</p>
               <p>And besides that: S. Paule giueth him his place in the ayre. Not


<pb facs="tcp:23289:81"/>
that the diuels are inclozed in a place certeine, for wee our selues see
that they enter intoo mens bodies, yea and into the bodyes of Swyne,
after as our Lord giueth them leaue and power.<note place="margin">Luke. 8. d. 33.</note> But he speaketh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
of the ayre, too make vs vnderstand that they bee aboue our
heads. If wee haue an enemy, wee will see if we can ouerthrowe him.
But if he haue his foote vppon our throte alreadye, if he treade vppon
our bellyes, if he bee already gotten vppon vs: what remedie is there
then? None at all on our part. That is the cause why S. Paule
speaketh here expresly of the ayre: as if he should say, that men may
well brag and lifte vp their nebbes, and bee brazenfaste in auauncing
themselues: but yit is the diuell aboue them with all that he can make.
Too bee short, he sheweth that wee bee vtterly giuen vp too that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
bondage. And to make the matter the playner, he addeth, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too the spirit.</hi> For what is the cause that wee perceyue not the
state which he speaketh of, but bycause wee be fleshely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If there reyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a tyran ouer vs that would lay a subsidie vppon vs too day, and a
tax to morrow, and sacke mens houses: &amp; the next day cut this mans
and that mans throte, and rauish mens wyues, and commit other enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and outrages: wee would well ynough perceyue it. And why?
Bycause wee be quicke of feeling in the things that touche our fleshe,
and so earthly, as wee cannot perceyue any thing, except it concerne
this present lyfe. That is the cause why wee perceyue not our owne
miseries: for they bee inuisible. Wee thinke not that the diuell is such
a Tyran, nor so horrible as he is: bycause wee see him not. But S.
Paule telleth vs, that we must looke higher then this world, and that
wee must haue other eyes than those that beehold visible things: and
that it standeth vs on hand too looke vppon the diuell, though he bee
ghostly: &amp; that although he haue nother armes too strike vs with, nor
legges too go with, nor any such other things: yit he fayleth not too be
the woorst tyran that can bee deuized in the whole woorld. And why
so? For he entreth vnseene. If there were a man that could enter into
other mens heads and harts, yea and intoo their thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without swoord or staffe, without venim or poyson, without threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening,
or any thing else: or if he had an hundreth deathes in his hand,
and could make them enter without feeling how: I pray you were
not such an enemy much more too bee feared, than such as come fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with great force, and make a great noize? Yis surely. Now
S. Paule telleth vs, that the diuell is such a one: for he is a spirite,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23289:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sayeth he. So then, let vs not to be so fleshely as we haue bin wont too
bee, nother let vs iudge according too our owne rude and fond fancye,
when the sayd spirituall enemye is spoken of: But let vs assure our
selues, that he is able too doo vs much more mischiefe without al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison,
then if wee could see how he came towards vs, and how he
entered intoo vs. So then forasmuch as he is a spirit, let vs bee so
much the more afrayd of him. And too the intent the faythfull should
bee the better dispozed too come too this foresayde poynt, that is too
say, too know their owne confuzion, till God haue prouided for it: S.
Paule addeth yit one confirmation more of his saying. For as soone
as wee haue receyued the fayth, and bee inlightened by Gods holy
spirit: if wee haue any desire too doo well, wee shall by and by inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too serue our God. And it will seeme that that were inough. But
if a faythfull man looke intoo himselfe, he shall finde ynough to mislike
and too sighe and groone for: according as I haue tolde you before,
that euen S. Paule confesseth himselfe too haue bin vnhappy,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. c. 24.</note> and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out, who shall set mee free from this prison of death? The faythfull
then shall alwayes fynd ynough in themselues wherfore too morne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. Yit notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding forasmuch as God hath put some good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
some wel meaning, and some good intent intoo vs: the same doth
halfe couer the leawdnesse of our nature, so as wee knowe not a long
time after that it were requisite, howe wretched our state is, so long as
wee thinke but vppon our selues, I say, vppon our selues, such as wee
bee after that God hath partly reformed vs by his holy spirit. That
is the cause why S. Paule sendeth vs too behold what the vnbeleeuers
are. If wee looke vppon the worlde, wee shall see some giuen too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,
and some too pilling and poulling, and not onely the little
theeues that are whipped and hanged: euen such as are robbers, I say,
not in woods and forests, but in houses, in markets, and in places of
Iustice. Wee shall see that there is nother fayth nor loyaltie among
most men, but that all men are giuen too pilling and pouling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any respect of equitie or vprightnesse. Wee shall see some rushe
out intoo whoredome and dishonestie, some intoo drunkennesse, and
some intoo other leawdnesse and looce behauiour. Wee shall see
men rap out othes, periuries, and other cursed things.</p>
               <p>Agein, wee shall see secret conueyances, impoysonings, spytings,
malicings, treasons, and wicked practizes. Too bee short, wee shall
see some so diuelish, that they fling them selues headlong altoogither,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:82"/>
as though they ment too make warre wilfully ageinst God. These are
things that may astonish vs: And although wee bee dull, yet ought
wee too haue some remors, when we see things so farre out of order in
the world. Neuerthelesse S. Paule sayeth that if we consider what is
doone, and how all thinges are turned topsiteruie, and what libertie
the world taketh too withstand God: it behoueth vs too apply the same
too our selues, and too conclude thus: the same should betyde mee, yea
and euen as much as I see in them that are moste wretched. For when
wee looke vppon the diseases that are abrode, how some are eaten with
cankers and other filthie diseases, and othersome haue as terrible sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
as can be: we must prie vpon them and say, as ill, yea &amp; worse to,
should lyght vpon me, if God pitied me not. For all of vs doo carye the
seede of them about vs: &amp; that not only in our bodyes, (but also in our
soules) for there may be some diuersitie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexions, so as some shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
stronger and lus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yer than other some: but the soule of man is vtterly
corrupted and marred. So then the sinnes that reigne in vs, are all of
them warnings to make vs cast downe our eyes, and too be ashamed
before God and his Angells, yea and too make vs hate and vtterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
our selues. Thus yee see why S. Paule hath added here, that the
diuell woorketh now still. He vseth the woord <hi>Now:</hi> as if he should say,
my frendes, if in looking vppon your present state, you fynd any thing
well, and that the same keepeth you from humbling of your selues
throughly, and from feeling how miserable yee shoulde haue bin, if
God had not shewed pitie and mercie towards you: see what is doone
about you, see how the vnbeleueres behaue themselues, and you shall
fynd them to be as wyld beastes, and enemyes of their owne saluation:
you shall fynd them stark mad ageinst God, and ageinst all ryght. Too
be short, yee shall see so great enormities, as shall abash men, &amp; make
them too say, Alas, is it possible that it should bee thus? And so yee see
what yee bee. Say not: fy on thee naughtipacke. Yee may well fynd
fault with such a one, but ye must therwithal adde by &amp; by for a sauce to
season it, how greate hath Gods mercie bin towards me? Then let vs
neuer condemne the sin that wee see euerywhere in other men, without
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering therwithal, that if God had not brydled vs, we had falne as
deepely as wee see others too haue falne: and therfore let it stirre vs
vp immediatly too pray God that he leade vs not into temptation,<note place="margin">Math. 6. b. 13.</note> and
let vs acknowledge Gods infinite goodnesse, in that it pleaseth him
too reyne vs in such wyse, that wee fall not intoo the horrible falles


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23289:82"/>
which wee see about vs. For when wee looke vpon the wickeddest in
the world, yea and euen vpon such as wee bee driuen too abhorre as
monsters: wee must (as I said afore) conclude thus with our selues:
Alas, as much should befal vs, if God remedied it not.</p>
               <p>And so yee see how wee ought to put that lesson in vre. And S. Paul
speaketh expresly of the rebellious children, too shewe that there wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee
no obedience in vs, except God put it intoo vs, and reforme vs,
and both chaunge the naughtinesse whereuntoo wee were giuen afore,
and continue and increace the goodnesse that he hath begunne: for
else Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an hath so taken possession of vs, as he must needes drawe vs
lyke brute beastes. Trew it is that S. Paule addeth anon after, that
this serued not only for the heathen, (howbeit that Gods grace was
most apparant in them:) but that euen the excellentest men were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
therin, and (which more is) that the Iewes, (who thought
themselues too haue a singuler priuilege of exemption from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cursednesse of men,) were also forlorne and damned, till they were
redeemed by our Lord Iesus Christ. Wherin wee see yit better the
thing that wee touched not long since: that is too wit, that heere is no
mention made of any one sort of men alone, but that the holy Ghost
thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dereth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al men, to the end that al of vs shold be beaten down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the least to the the most. But this cannot be discoursed as now. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must for conclusion take that which S. Paule treateth: which
is that God hath quickened vs. Wherby he dooth vs too wit, that
we bring not lyfe with vs from our mothers womb, but that by reason
of sin we bee in death, when wee come intoo this world, which is worse
than if wee were not at all: yea and that there is no geynsaying too it,
bycause wee shall not find any thing in our selues but corruption and
wickednesse, and bycause that the more a man stirres it, the more it
stinketh, and wee shall bee the more loth too see the great and deepe
dungeon of all iniquitie which is in vs. Therfore it standeth vs on
hand too bee quickened, and too haue lyfe giuen vs, not of nature, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
of the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, bycause wee bee renewed by
him: yea and too knowe that God hath taken vs out of a wretched
and cursed state, and theruppon too forget all vayn glorie. And Let vs
not think that euer wee shall yeeld vntoo God the prayse that hee deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
till wee abhorre all our owne wretchednesse, &amp; bee come too the
poynt (to know) that the deuill reigneth ouer vs, till God pluck vs out
of his pawes, and set vs free from his cursed tyranny. For is there any


<pb facs="tcp:23289:83"/>
thing more irksome than too say, that wee bee subiect to the diuell, and
that he reygneth, not only ouer our bodyes, as somme worldly tyran
myght doo, but also ouer our soules, and ouer all our thoughts? For he
is a spirit, and there is not that thing in vs which is not corrupted by
him, &amp; filled with his poyson. Sith we know this: let vs consider also
that God hauing found vs in that plyght, hath notwithstanding not
disdeined vs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

deadly enemyes, at such tyme as Iesus Christ redeemed vs. And so
let vs conclude, that God respecteth nothing but our miseries, when he
calleth vs too him. Hee looketh not whether wee seeke him or no, for
how were that possible? wee drawe cleane arsward. He looketh not
whether wee bee able too doo him any seruis or no: for wee bee rank
rebells ageinst him. He looketh not whether there be any good toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs: for al our thoughtes &amp; lustes are deadly enemyes fyghting
ageinst his ryghtuousnesse. Wherat looketh he then? What moueth
him too succour vs? Euen the infinite number of miseries that he fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in vs, and the horrible confuzion wherein wee bee: those are the
thinges which inclyne God too shewe vs mercie. So then, let all

aught in vs wherefore he should shewe vs fauour: for he must take all

he seeth vs miserable, damned, and vtterly forlorne, and let that stirre
vs vp too doo good, and too prouide remedie, not onely for our diseases,
but also for our death. For if wee were but corrupted with sinne and
vyce: the maladie were alreadie vncurable. But besides that, there
is a death, yea and a spirituall death, which cannot bee recouered by
all the meanes and remedies of the world: God must bee fayne too put

                  </gap>o lie drawen out of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of confuzion, wherof I spake this morning. Too bee short, S.
Paule sheweth heere, that euen those whom men woold deeme too bee
the excellentest, can bring nothing wherof too brag, or too purchace
themselues estimation before God, but are all receyued too grace too
bee made heires of the heauenly lyfe, by meanes of our Lord Iesus

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:84"/>Now heere myght a question be demaunded, why S. Paule setteth
the heathen men on euen ground with the Iewes, seing that God had
set such oddes betwixt them. For it myght seeme that all the promises
were disanulled: and that were a dooing of wrong vntoo God, rather
than vntoo men. If wee graunt (as of necessitie and reason wee needs
must) that Gods choozing of Abrahams ofspring, was not in vayne,
and that his telling of them, that he accepted them too bee of his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
&amp; Church, was not too deceyue them: they must needes be neerer &amp;
more familiar vntoo God, and they must needes haue some marke
wherby too bee gathered vntoo him. It seemeth then that S. Paule
should not haue abaced the Iewes after that sort. But in another
place he sheweth, that all this geere agrees full well, if wee consider
the Iewes (on the one syde) in the state of (Gods) chozen and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
people: and (on the other syde) what they bee (of themselues) and
what they haue deserued before God. For in the Epistle too the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after that S. Paule hath giuen sentence vppon the whole
world, shewing that there is not any one which is not damned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne:
he moueth this question: Seing then that God gathered Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
linage, and dedicated it wholly too himself, what shall become of
them? Shall there bee no holinesse in them? For it seeemeth else that
God had but dalyed, and that his saying in the holie scriptures, that he
had not delt so with any other nation, was nothing woorth. But S.
Paule sayeth,<note place="margin">De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they are too bee preferred before all the whole world, so farre

promises. Hewbeit he addeth foorthwith, that in asmuch as they bee

nature, and it seemeth that wee ought too go alone by our selues, seing
that God is our King, and hath sanctifyed vs, and voutsafeth too dwel
among vs. Well then, it seemeth at the first blush, that wee should
shake of the Gentyles, as vncleane persons, and such as haue none
acquaintance with God. But let vs come too account (sayeth he) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

there is none of vs all but he is indaungered vntoo God, &amp; must needes
perceyue himselfe too bee a wretched sinner. Sith it is so, God must
bee the iudge of all men, and we must needes sinke before his maiestie,
till wee bee reconcyled vntoo him by our Lord Iesus Christ. Too bee
short, S. Paules meaning in this text, is not too deface Gods grace,
but too shewe that the Iewes had not any other meane in themselues
whereby too obteyne the saluation and heritage of heauen, than onely
by beyng members of our Lord Iesus Christ, and that they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bee fayne too take themselues first for cursed and damned. For
the woorthinesse which they haue is but as a wyndfall, &amp; they be borne
in sinne, and subiect too cursednesse, no lesse than all other men, and
Gods accepting and choozing of them too himself, was a speciall and
(as they saye) a supernaturall gift. Yee see then that by nature the
Iewes are forlorne as well as the rest of the whole world, and yit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
that God hath also receiued them too mercy.</p>
               <p>By the way wee must marke, that vnder the word <hi>Nature,</hi> Saynt
Paule sheweth, not only that wee bee sinners by custome, so as euery
of vs thrusteth his fellowe out of the way, and wee bee too much incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
too followe the euill, rather than the good: but also that there is a
further matter in it, which is, that euery of vs bringeth sinne with him
euen from his birth. Too eate and too drinke are things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
vs: but yit is sinne more rooted in vs, than all the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
too this lyfe. Truely the heathen men will thinke it straunge,
that the young babes which are not able too discerne betweene good
and euill, nor haue any discrecion or will, should alreadie bee sinners
and damned before God, according too S. Paules saying, who calleth
them the children of wrath: but yit must wee needes yeelde our selues
too condemnation whether we wil or no. As soone as babes bee able
too make any signe, it is certeyne that they will shewe inough and too
much, that they bee froward and naughtie, and that there is a secrete
poyson lurking in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And that although they cast it not out at the
first, yit they bee as a broode of serpentes. Sith it is so, let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that Saint Paule dooth not without cause call vs the children of
wrath, as well as the Iewes, not excepting the very infantes out of
the number, whom men terme innocents, and take them so to bee: For
wee must not regarde our owne opinion, nor the things that wee see
before our eyes, but wee must giue glory vntoo God, who is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peteent
iudge thereof, although wee finde it incomprehensible. How


<pb facs="tcp:23289:85"/>
soeuer the world go, wee must alwayes come backe too that which is
sayd in the one and fiftith Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. b. 7.</note> namely that wee not onely offend
God dayly in diuerse manners: but also are lothsome too hym before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
yea euen before wee haue eyther done or thought any thing, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee were begotten in sinne and cursednesse. And by that word
<hi>Children of wrath,</hi> S. Paule meaneth that wee bee the heyres of
death, and that God must needes bee our enemie, yea euen as soone
as wee bee conceyued. Yit is not God cruell, nother hateth he the
things that are of his owne making. That is trew, if we had such pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs as was in our forefather Adam, according too this saying,
that all things which God made were good, God then should hate
his owne workemanship in vs. But wee must conclude, that sith he
hateth vs, and is as it were armed to take vengeance on vs all, we haue
well deserued it. And that although sinne cannot be poynted out with
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inger, as yee would say: yit dooth God know it well ynough, and
wee must hold our mouthes shet at it. That is in effect the thing that
wee haue too gather vppon this Text, in applying it too S. Paules
meaning. For if the Iewes, which seemed too haue or ought too
haue some peculiar prerogatiue, are neuerthelesse included vnder the
generall state of men: what can wee alledge which are borne Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles,
if wee will presume too bring any brauerie before God? So
then wee haue well wherwith to be confounded dubble, seing that they,
in comparison of whom wee bee nothing, haue notwithstanding no
enterance intoo the kingdome of God, but by his only free mercie, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
by being reconcyled by meane of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>But there is yit one question or doubt more. For how should the
Iewes be Gods enemies, seing he had auowed himself alredye to bee
their father? Some man will say, that the seeing of the things that
were figured, and the truthe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd substance of them remayned as yit too
bee accomplished. But wee haue too marke yit further, that although
God had adopted the Iewes in Abraham: yit they were receyued in
Iesus Christ, and that that grace was grounded vppon him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too this saying, In thy seede shall all nations of the earth bee blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.<note place="margin">Gen. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>8.</note>
And wee haue seene in the Epistle too the Galathians, that the
sayd seede must bee referred too our Lord Iesus Christ: for without
him there is no vnitie,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>attering asunder. Sith it is so, it is
not too bee marueiled, that the receiuing of the Iewes into the Church,
as well as the receyuing of the Gentyles, is fathered heere by Saint


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23289:85"/>
Paule vppon the onely free bestowed goodnesse of God.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit, there is yit a second poynt, which is not too bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
which is, that although the Iewes had obteyned such grace, yit
they abode in suspens till the comming of the Redeemer. And for that
cause wee shall see in another place, that those which were neere, and
those that were farre of, were reconcyled by him. For wee know that
there is no attonement too bee made with God, without sheading of
blud. Now the Sacrifizes of the Lawe could not put away sinne,<note place="margin">Leuit. 17. c. 11. &amp;. Heb. 11. f. 22.</note> nor
pacifye Gods wrath and cursing. When men offered the blud of an
Oxe, or of a Calfe, or of a Lamb, it was not too make attonement with
God, there was no such power in the brute beastes: for the thing that
is corruptible, atteyneth not too the soule. Therfore it is too bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the Iewes were Gods children by hope, and yit that they
were vtterly separated from him, till the attonement was made in the
person of the Redeemer. And by that meanes did God shew himself
fauorable towards them, as he did towards the rest of the world. And
for that cause also dooth S. Paule adde, <hi>that God being rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
hath quickened them,</hi> as he did the Gentyls, <hi>euen according too
his great loue vvhervvith he loued them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cheef poynt (as I told you this morning) that S. Paule
handleth, is, that wee should lerne too bee ashamed, yea and too lothe
our owne wretchednesse, by resorting too our originall, and by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in what plyght God findeth vs, and out of what a dungeon wee
passe, when God reacheth vs his hand. And the second is, that wee
should magnifie his goodnesse so much the more, bycause it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
thing, that he should voutsafe too cause the doctrine of lyfe too
come downe too the bottome of hell too quicken vs: for wee were sunk
downe thither. Thefore wee must marke well these wordes, where
it is sayd, that God being rich in mercie, quickened vs when wee
were dead, according too the great loue which he beareth vs. Trew
it is, that this tytle myght alwayes agree vnto God, bycause he nother
abateth nor increaseth: and so shall God bee euermore rich in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But we must therwithall marke the circumstance of the place,
and the matter that S. Paule treateth of heere: which is, that God
hath vttered the inestimable treasures of his mercie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs according
too the greatnesse of our miseries. And For that cause also he addeth,
<hi>the great loue wherwith he loued vs.</hi> For needes must there haue
bin such a goodnesse in God, as is able to rauish vs, seeing it surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth


<pb facs="tcp:23289:86"/>
all our capacitie, and that wee bee not able too taste the hundredth
parte of it, though wee giue our selues neuer so much vntoo it. And
why? For when S. Paule sayeth that God loued vs, he speaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of himself, and of such lyke, which had bin chozen from among
that people, when as the greater part of them was cut of. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Iewes were the first borne, and had preheminence aboue
vs, as by ryght of inheritance, &amp; that we be but as silly things borne
out of season,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. a. 8.</note> as S. Paule speaketh of himself: yit notwithstanding
wee see that they bee now banished from Gods kingdome, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as a president that ought too make the heare stand vp vppon our
heades, when wee behold the wrath and vengeance of God that is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
vppon them. Therfore wheras S. Paule and some small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
mo were chozen from among the Iewes: it was through Gods
loue which had the greater apparance towardes them. Lykewyse
nowe adayes, if the Gospell were preached purely throughe the
whole world, &amp; fayth giuen indifferently too all men, soo as there were
none but he should be touched immediatly with the holy Ghost, and all
of vs were alyke: it woold seeme to be as the course of nature. And
lyke as meat and drinke are common to all men, so it woold seeme that
wee had this of our owne naturall motion, and that it were not a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
grace of God. But when wee see so manie Countries hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starued,
so as there rayneth not one drop of good doctrine vppon them,
but rather the wretched people are fed with Lyes and trumperies of
Satan: and that on the other syde God inlyghteneth vs heere, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
vs with his woord: whereof commeth that, but of the great loue
whereof S. Paule speaketh heere? Agein, many men haue their eares
beaten with the Gospell, and yit it is apparant too mennes eyes, that
they become hard harted by it, and waxe woorse and woorse. For it is
certeine that a man shall not see so horrible monsters in the papacie,
as where the Gospell is preached and professed, for they will say they
bee reformed, and yit they seeme too bee diuells incarnate: and wee
neede not too go farre to see such syghtes. So then, let vs marke heere,
that wee must not surmyze that any of vs hath aught wherwith too
please God, more than his felowes, nor presume too make any account
of our selues: but that we must alwayes repayre too the fountaine that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>annot bee drayned dry, and not go too the pits that are full of holes
and can holde no water, or rather which haue nothing but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in them, (for all the gloriousnesse and brauerie of men is no better) but


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23289:86"/>
drawe of the sayde loue of our God, &amp; confesse that God must not bee
perswaded or moued by other folkes, but onely that it pleased him too
loue vs freely, by receiuing vs vntoo him, and by inlyghtening vs with
his holy spirit in the fayth of the Gospell. And so yee see what Saint
Paule ment too note heere.</p>
               <p>Now on the other side, to the end that men (who are alwayes suttle
witted, in seeking some shifts and starting holes or other: should not
excuze themselues by being vnder the Tyrannie of the diuell, nor
alledge that the same ought not too bee layde too their charge: Saint
Paule sheweth that the sayd bondage ceasseth not too bee wilfull. I
shewed you this morning, that notwithstanding all our free choyze,
and notwithstanding our reason and will, yit we be as it were fettered
too Satans seruice, so as wee can doo nothing but all naughtinesse,
nother should wee bee any better by nature, than the arrantest theues
in the world, if God had not pitied vs, accordingly as Saint Paule
setteth forth al other men vntoo vs as a looking glasse, yea &amp; euen such
as despyze God and all order, and are driuen by Satan intoo all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
saying, that wee should bee lyke them, if God had not bin merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
too vs. But now there are many which grudge ageinst God, and
which go too lawe with him, saying: If free will bee so defaced, what
shall become of vs? If men were able too giue themselues vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and yit notwithstanding made none account of it, but gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
too euill: surely it were good right and reason, that they should
bee hild for giltie. But if they cannot but doo euill: why should God
condemne them? At leastwise they ought too bee borne withall, seing
it is apparant that they bee hild vnder Satans dominion, euen from
their mothers wombe. Loe what many men alledge, in hope to washe
their handes. Yea, and they bee not contented too iustifie themselues
by vayne shifts, but they doo also rayle ageinst God, as though he were
the cause of their damnation. But S. Paul to preuent such s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aunders,
sayeth, that they which are vnder the bondage of Satan and of sinne,
ceasse not for all that too be condemned by good right. For they be not
constreyned theruntoo by force: they bee subiect in deede, but that is
with their owne good will. And that is the cause why he sayeth, that
euen such as are brought backe agein to our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>haue
walked in the lustes of the fleshe:</hi> that is too say, that before God
had chaunged them, and brought them too his obedience by his holy
spirit, they walked in their owne wicked lusts. True it is that men will


<pb facs="tcp:23289:87"/>
graunt their nature too bee sinfull, but yit they say, it suffizeth that the
will bee otherwyse. All men will graunt that it is the will which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the difference betweene vice and vertue: But when the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
spake after that fashion, they were of opinion that wee haue a
francke and free will. And that is the thing that deceyued them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knewe not that wee were marred by the fall of Adam, and
yit notwith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ne will that dryueth them thereuntoo. Thus yee see in
effect, how S. Paule ment too stop the mouthes of all misspeakers, too
the intent, that men should not picke any quarrells too God, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they ought not too bee shent for their naughtinesse, seing they
bee subiect too it by nature. But let vs marke heerewithall how S.
Paule hath matched thoughtes with the fleshe, too the end wee myght
knowe that sinne reacheth throughout vs, and that wee haue no peece
of vs cleane and pure, wherintoo infection is not spred. For the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
will well ynough confesse that wee bee corrupted in Adam: but
they say, that wee doo in deede tend alwayes vntoo euill, when wee bee
tempted vntoo it, and yit neuerthelesse, that if wee herken vnto reason,
and brydle our lustes by ruling them well, then wee shall see playnely
that wee bee not altoogither vnable too doo good. And so the opinion
of the Papistes is, that mans free will is not of such force as it was at
the beginning, but that it is wounded, yea and sore maymed, howbeeit,
that it hath yit still some lyfe, that is to say, some vertuousnesse, as they
imagin. But wee haue seene this morning, that the determinate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the holy Ghost is more generall: that is too wit, that wee bee
not onely sicke, but also dead, till wee be rayzed agein by Iesus Christ.
Nowe S. Paule confirmeth the same thing, saying, that our wicked
lustes, and the affect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s that are termed the sensual appetytes, wherin
wee resemble the brute beastes, are not the onely things that harrie vs
heere and there: but that we must take the matter more strictly. What
are all our thoughtes, all our determinations, and all that euer is dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
too bee best in man? They bee (sayeth S. Paule) starke wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For if God should let vs go after our owne thoughtes: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine,
that there is not a more horrible confuzion, than that would bee.


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23289:87"/>
So then, wee see that men are not humbled heere by halues, too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
onely their frailtie, and that they haue partly neede too bee suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored
and helped at God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hand: but wee see they bee vtterly damned
before him, sit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their thoughtes are heere called wicked and froward,
and that they haue nothing in them which prouoketh not Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
ageinst them. So then, let vs on the one side yeelde our selues
giltie, assuring our selues that wee were iustly bereft of all Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the person of Adam: And agein, on the other side let vs not take
the same for an excuse, in hope too scape by such shifte, as who should
say, we were not the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dslaues of sinne, nor wee our selues any whit too
blame for it, bycause wee bee hild downe in Satans snares and nettes
euen from our birth. But it behoueth vs to consider alwayes, that euery
of vs shall fynde the welspring of his disease in his owne conscience.
Men may hold plea as much as they list: but if they enter intoo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and aske their owne consciences, yee shall see them condemned
and confounded without any nay. When a man hath babled what he
can, so as he thinkes he hath wonne the gole, by saying that he hath no
free will of his owne, nor abilitie too resist God: there needeth no
more but thys one woorde: what thinkest thou too bee the thing that
prouoketh thee too euill? Ho, it is the diuell. Thou sayest well. But
yit marke a little whether that dooth so fully excuze thee, as that thou
perceyuest not ryght well, that thou wart stirred vp and driuen too it
by thine owne selfmouing: knowest thou not that the welspring and
roote of the mischiefe is in thy selfe? When thou art so rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
God, that thy thoughtes are full of vntruth and vnbeleefe, and
that so much the more bycause thy lustes are out of square, and imbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled
ageinst God and his rightuousnesse, euen too make warre with
him: when thou seest all this, must thou yit hold plea further with him?
So then, let vs not seeke any starting holes, seyng wee carie a sufficient
iudge with vs, euen within vs, namely seyng that euery of our owne
consciences rebuketh vs. That is the thing that S. Paule amed at in
this streyne. And thereby wee also are war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at all on our selues, but too brydle all our senses and imaginations, and
all the vnderstanding and reason which wee weene our selues too haue.
For vntill wee haue so renounced our selues, it is certeine that we shall
neuer bee meete too apply our selues too the seruing of God.</p>
               <p>And S. Paule sayeth expresly, that those whom God hath quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are by that meanes made felowes with our Lord Iesus Chryst:

ought too seeke it in Gods being: howbeeit forasmuch as that is too

reacheth out his armes too allure vs too him, insomuch that in his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

let this speeche bee marked, where S. Paule sayeth, that those which
were dead afore, were quickened agein by Iesus Christ. And heere
wee see yit better the thing that I touched shortly this morning:
which is, that S. Paule speaketh not of a visible death, wherof men
may iudge by outward syght: but of the corruption that is in our souls:
for he fyndeth fault with vs all. How then may wee atteyne too the
heauenly lyfe. How shall we bee rayzed &amp; quickened agein to possesse
the heri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>age that is promised vs? Wee see on the contrarie part, how
wee bee subiect too as many miseries as can bee. This therfore must
needs bee ment of the newnesse of lyfe which he speaketh of in other
places. Now it is certein that this lyfe is not yit perfeet in vs: there is
but a little enterance of it, which serueth too leade vs further, and too
bring vs too the end, (which shalbee) when wee bee come too the full
glorie that he speaketh of heere. And wee see also how S. Paule set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself foorth for an example, alledgeth that he had giuen ouer
all things for our Lord Iesus Christes sake, yea and euen the fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which he had of his owne ryghtuousnesse: insomuch that although
men esteemed him as a little Angell, yit notwithstanding he knewe
that it behoued him too bee saued by Gods free grace in Iesus Christ.
And in sted of all his honour and riches: he had suffred so many repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
so many tortures, so many beatings, and so many imprisonings,
that a man would haue said,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yit notwithstanding he addeth, not that I am yit come too my marke,
but I streyne my self foreward, and forget the tyme that is past. For if
I stay vppon the things I haue done alredy, saying, I haue ouercome
so many incounters, I haue delt thus valeantly, I haue not ceassed too
preach the Gospell euery where, I haue wrought in such wyse, that the
frute of my doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I haue bin among barbarus nations, where God and his Gospel were
neuer erst heard of, I haue had a number of lets, and haue ouercome
them all, I haue incountered with thus manie enemyes, and haue got


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23289:88"/>
the vpper hand of them all: If S. Paule say, I had had all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
with him, he had become cold: for it is an easye matter
with vs too shrink away when wee once think with our selues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
I haue doone ynough for my part, now let others marche on in their
aray. And so euery of vs woold take his leaue, when he had some thing
or other, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot not what. But S. Paule sayth, that he forgets the tyme
past, too the intent too cut of occasion of slothfullnesse, which myght
come in his head, and sayeth, that he streyneth him self foreward, and
holdeth his armes ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too atteyne vnto it. And how long tyme did S.
Paule streyne himselfe foreward? Euen too the end. Then let vs
mark well, that our glorie shall neuer bee perfect, that is too say, wee
shall neuer throughly inioy the glorie that wee wayt for, vntill the end.
And therefore it behoueth vs alwayes too take warning of our owne
wretchednesse, too moorne for it before God, and too confesse that
wee be beholden too his only goodnesse for all things. Now then, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
wee fare, wee see that we be reformed vnto newnesse of lyfe by
Gods spirit: and that although wee dwell among vnbeleeuers, &amp; bee
subiect too manie miseries, yea and haue sin dwelling in vs: yit there
is none of vs but he feeleth that the handsells which God hath giuen vs
of his holie spirit, are not vayne nor vnprofitable. If any man alledge,
that before such tyme as Iesus Christ woork in vs, wee haue alredye
some lyfe, as is seene: answer was made shortly this morning: that
forasmuch as all that euer men haue by nature, is not able too bring
them vntoo God, but maketh them too rest vppon this world: none of
it ought too bee made account of, when the heauenly lyfe commeth in
question. Then let men calp their hands at vs on all syds: yit are wee
but dead men, when God layeth the brydle looce in our necks, and
suffereth vs too walk after our owne fancie and lyking. Man may
well haue some reason: but what can it doo so long as it is in the owne
nature? It will fyght ageinst God, and ageinst all truthe. Yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
man, say they, hath a will: howbeeit, that the same will bee
wicked. Trew it is (as I haue sayd alredye) that it hathe no strength
in it. Yit notwithstanding forasmuche as man is wicked and froward,
and hath the cursed roote of rebellion in himself, so as he cannot but doo
euill, he offendeth God willingly. And seing it is so, let vs boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that wee bee in death, till wee bee made partners of the lyfe of
our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Esay. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which he hath receyued, in such measure as he listeth: according as it


<pb facs="tcp:23289:89"/>
is sayd that Gods spirit rested vppon him, and was giuen vntoo him
in all plentie, and that as nowe he must deale it too euery one of hys
faythfull ones. Therefore according as our Lord Iesus Christ maketh
vs too taste of his holy spirit, and according as he strengtheneth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
so are wee quickened in him and with him.</p>
               <p>Now heeruppon he addeth, <hi>that he hath made vs too sit in the
heauenly places vvith our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> This serueth too mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifye
the grace that we haue hithertoo spoken of, yit so much the more.
If he had sayd in one woord, that wee were q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ickened: it had bin
ynough, and it ought well too haue inflamed our hartes to sing Gods
prayses, and too occupye our selues therin, and too apply al our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
theruntoo. But heere is a greater vehemencie, bycause of our
coldnesse and lazinesse. For S. Paule hath shewed on the one syde,
that wee were dead and hild in bondag vnder the tyrannye of Satan.
Alas, these are terrible things. And now he setteth downe on the other
syde, that God hath not only loued vs, but also glorifyed vs in himself,
and that wee bee lifted vp from the bottom of hell, aloft vntoo the
kingdome of heauen, where he hath lodged vs, and giuen vs seates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his Angells. Seing then that wee heare this, needes must wee
bee to much doted, &amp; our witts too much brutish, if we make not in good
earnest too glorifye the inestimable goodnesse of our God, and too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that wee bee so beholden and bound vntoo him, that although
wee should doo nothing else all our lyfe long, but preache the grace
that wee haue felt by experience at his hand, yit it were nothing at all.
And so yee see why S. Paule hath purposely set downe, that wee be
lifted vp too heauen wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h Iesus Christ. And heeruppon wee haue a
very profitable exhortation too gather, which is, that although we bee
heere in the myre, and do but craule lyke poore frogges: yit ought we
to beare this state paciently, for somuch as on the other syde God hath
lyfted vs vp so hygh, euen vs that were nothing, yea and cursed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
too. And therfore whensoeuer wee be fayne too suffer hunger &amp;
thirst in this world, or be mocked by vnbeleeuers, or put to the abiding
of manie outrages, let vs resort too that which is sayd heere: namely,
that yit neuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>helesse wee be set alredy in heauen with Iesus Christ,
howbeeit not in such wyse, that it is apparant vntoo our eyes. For in
this behalfe wee must giue place too hope, and vntoo that which is
sayd in another text,<note place="margin">

our selues quiet, till it appeere at the comming of our Lord Iesus


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23289:89"/>
Christ. Thus then you see in effect, how it beehoueth vs too vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the things that are spoken heere of the diuers state of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
after they bee called too the fayth of the Gospell. But by the
way, we must not imagin an earthly paradyse in this world, where we
shall haue nother trubble nor greef: wee must make our reckening,
that wee shall neuer liue heere at our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ase, but wee must make
roome for fayth, as I sayd afore. And besydes this, wheras the holye
Ghoste auoucheth by the mouth of S. Paule, that wee shalbee lifted
vp on hygh: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suffer our selues too bee oppressed by our enemyes, and too bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maystered
by them with all pryde: we (I say) must suffer these things,
and yit in the meane whyle bee fully perswaded, and throughly resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of this doctrine, that wee for all that shal not fayle too inherit the

                  </gap>mbers, and our Lord Iesus Christ is not gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his owne sake alone. Wee must alwayes repayre too that
principle. Our confessing that Iesus Christ is rizen from the dead,
and gone vp intoo heauen, is not alonly too glorifye him in his owne
person. Trew it is, that first of all it must come to passe,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must bow before him, and that all creatures both in heauen and earth,
yea and euen in hell, must doo him homage. But yit notwithstanding,
the vnion wherof wee haue treated heertoofore, is fulfilled in this, that
Iesus Christ hauing gathered vs intoo his bodie, hath begunne that
thing in himself, which he intendeth too performe in vs, namely when
conuenient tyme commeth. So then, Iesus Christ is gone vp intoo
heauen, too open vs the gate in these dayes, which was shet ageinst vs
by Adams sin: and that is the verye maner of our sitting with him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye.
And therwithall S. Paule sheweth in one woord, what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
In deede this saying shalbee declared more at lenth in his
dew place, where S. Paule himself will treat of it more at large in the
next Sermon. Yit notwithstanding wee may see wherat he amed, too
the end wee may haue a sure and ryght marke too shoote at: which is,
that wee bee saued by grace, and that noman is able too clayme any
thing of his owne. Neuerthelesse it is not ynough for vs too haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in one woord, that our saluation commeth of Gods free fauour,
and too haue felt it also within our selues: but wee must also therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bee taken in loue with the infinite greatnesse of the same grace, by
considering what wee bee, how all euill commeth of our selues, and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:90"/>
that there is no saying nay, bycause our faultes doo too much conuic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vs, in somuch that if God should execute a hundred tymes more rigour
ageinst vs than he dooth, wee could not contend with him, nor dispute
with him, but that wee should alwayes haue this record of our owne
consciences, that wee bee iustly woorthie of death, and that the same is
dew vntoo vs by our desert. Then seeing it is so, let vs hold fast this
doctrine, for wee shall haue profited greatly for our whole lyfe, if wee
once know, that there is not only some one naughtie touche, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
number of euils in vs. Therefore let vs lerne too mislyke of our
selues, and too hate and abhorre our selues, and afterward when wee
bee come too the grace that is shewed vs in our Lord Iesus Christ, let
vs vnderstand, that without that, the diuell should needes haue full and
whole possession of vs, and reigne ouer vs, as he had doone afore. Also
let vs beware that wee profit our selues by such grace, so as it may
serue too put away all our cursednesse. And then let vs assure our
selues, that not only all our miseries shall turne too our benefyte by
our Lord Iesus Christ, but also that he will giue vs such strength, as
wee may well glorie in our state: and although wee bee driuen too
fyght ageinst manie temptations, and that wee bee frayle on our owne
behalf: yit neuerthelesse wee shall ouercome them in such wyse, as wee
shall haue cause too yeeld God thankes by our Lord Iesus Christ,
insomuch as being ioyned vntoo him, wee cannot fayle too come too
the full perfection of all good things.</p>
               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the Maiestie of our good
God, with acknoweledgement of our faults, praying him too make vs

Satan therfore hath wonne much at our handes, when he hath once
perswaded vs, that wee bee able too doo any thing of our selues, or that

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23289:92"/>
And (as I sayd afore) by that meanes the partnershippes which the
world pretendeth too make with God, doo fall too the ground. For
the Papists are driuen too confesse, that without Gods helpe they can
doo nothing, and that they bee too weake too withstand Satan, if they
bee not strengthened by the holy Ghost. They can fynd in their hartes
too graunt, that they cannot deserue aught at all, except God supply
their wantes, and also that they haue neede of the forgiuenesse of their
sinnes. But yit for all that, they cannot abyde too giue ouer their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
but imagin verily that they can partly further themselues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon
they are alwayes buylding of some desert, and although (they
graunt that) Gods grace preuent them at the first, yit they alwayes
mingle therwith some indeuer and good will of their owne, and when
they flee vntoo God for release of their sinnes, they bring him their
owne satisfactions for the same. And so yee see, that the Papistes will
not in any wise freely and wholly yeeld and gyue ouer vntoo God the
prayse of their saluation, but keepe backe some part of it, commonly
the one halfe or more, too themselues. But S. Paule passeth further
here, &amp; sheweth that we doo wrongfully alwayes defraud &amp; bereue God
of his glory, till wee haue forgotten all the false opinions wherwith the
world deceyueth it selfe. Therefore the onely way for vs too glorifye
God, is too acknowledge that wee bee nothing of our selues. And so,
humilitie or lowelynesse is not a feyning or false pretence, as many
suppoze, which thinke themselues too haue contented God by saying
in one woord, that they bee wretched sinners, and as weake as is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but wee must bee fully resolued, that all that euer men imagin in
their owne braynes concerning desertes, freewill, preparation, helpe,
or satisfaction, is euery whit but leazing &amp; trumperie of Satan. When
we once know this, then will we submit our selues as we ought to doo,
&amp; then shall God keepe his estate, as he deserueth, &amp; we also shall yeeld
him such honour as is dew to him. But this cannot be done (as I sayd)
vnlesse all that euer men conceiue &amp; imagin concerning good workes,
wherewith too deserue well at Gods hand, bee vtterly razed out.</p>
               <p>Moreouer let vs mark therwithall, that if wee wil bee partakers
of the saluation that God offereth vs, wee must bring nothing with vs
but only fayth. For (as is sayd in another place) fayth taketh no help
of good woorks. Although it haue record of the Lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. a. 4. 5.</note> yit dooth it not

soules, &amp; to haue an earnest mynd too bee succored at his hand, bycause
it pleaseth him. For what is the cause that our Lord Iesus Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
not a great number, but for that they haue deaf eares when God
incorageth them too come too him? And veryly some of them are so
beastlyke, that they passe not for the heauenly lyfe, so they haue heere
wherof too feede and too drink lyke Swyne, or wherewith too wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
in their owne delyghts and pleasures: as for the spirituall goods
(which wee ought too labor for) they bee nothing with them. Yee see
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the one sort shet God out of the doores, bycause they bee dulled
with the allurements of Satan, and drunken, or rather vtterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with the delyghts of this world, eyther in pomp and honour,
or in riches, or else in whoredome and other loocenesse. And the other
sort think they haue wherwith too make God beholden too them, as
wee see manie hipocryts doo, which cannot giue ouer the vayne self-trust
wherwith they bee swolne lyke Toads. Wherfore too bee short,
let vs marke well this woord fayth, that the pleasures and ease of
this world hold vs not backe from lifting vp our harts vntoo God.
And that is the very way too fasten our anker in heauen. For wee can
neuer haue the sayd substancialnesse of fayth, which S. Paule speaks
of, except wee passe swiftly through the world, and know that our heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and resting place is elswhere than heere: and moreouer shake off
all vayne imaginations that may come in our heads: for they serue
but too turne vs away from Iesus Christ, so as wee may not come at
him, nor he haue any entrance at al vntoo vs. That is the thing which
wee haue too gather vppon that text.</p>
               <p>Now for further confirmation, S. Paule addeth hereuppon, <hi>that

wee neede too seeke no further matter than this present Text, where
he sayth, that wee bee created in Iesus Christ. Here therefore S.
Paule maketh a comparison of the dubble birth that is in al the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
For wee haue all of vs one generall creation, wherby wee liue
in this world: and God createth vs new agein, when he voutsafeth too
giue vs newenesse of life by his Gospell, I meane when he printeth it
in our harts and mynds by his owne secret working: for the word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
were not ynough too doo it. So then, as in respect of our first
creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the Iewes, the Turks, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men, &amp; vs. Wee are al of vs taken out of one Lump, wee are al
the children of Adam, yea wee are all heyres of Gods wrath, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by nature, as wee haue seene alreadie heretoofore. Then if men
examine them selues, and searche what they bee by their first birth:
they shal finde how there is nothing in vs but sinne and wickednesse, &amp;
that the wisedome which wee weene our selues too haue, is but beastly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and that the light whiche wee thinke wee haue too discerne
betweene good and bad, is but stubbernesse and starke spytefulnesse
ageinst God: and so yee see wee be corrupted in all parts of our soule.</p>
               <p>Now then what can wee doo too finde fauour at Gods hand, and too
make him beholden vntoo vs? for if wee can doo nothing but euil, it is
but a kindling of his wrath more and more ageinst vs. Wee bee
worthye of endlesse death alreadie before wee come out of our mothers
wombe: in somuch that although wee perceyue not the sinne that is
in a yong babe: yit hath he the seede of it within him, and God auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that all of vs deserue too bee drowned in the bottom of hell: Then
if the little babe bee so rightfully condemned afore hand, euen ere he
haue seene the light of the world: what is too bee sayd of vs when we
bee come foorth, and doo shewe that wee bee naughtie (in deede) and
that our nature is altoogither sinfull: And when wee bee come to age,
what can we do (as I said afore) to fal to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position with God, so as we
might helpe foreward his grace, and that our so dooing might bee a
meanes too further our saluation? Loe what S. Paule meaneth by
this Text, where he sayth, that wee bee Gods woorkmanship. As if
he shoulde saye, poore creature, thou thinkest too play the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
in this behalfe, by putting thy selfe foreward too alledge some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:94"/>
and that thou art able too begin and too approche vntoo God,
so as he on his syde must bee fayne too bee beholden vntoo thee: When
begannest thou that? If thou say, thou begannest it before thou wart
borne: thou deseruest that men shoulde spit in thy face. If thou say, it
was afterward, betweene the age of seuen yeeres, and the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or thirtie yeeres, at what tyme thou wart inlyghtened with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
thou art on the contrarie part sufficiently disproued, that thou
couldest not haue one drop of willingnesse too doo good, but that all thy
thoughtes and desires were vtterly rebellious ageinst God, and as men
of warre fyghting ageinst his rightuousnesse. Therefore thou hast
doone nothing else but fyght ageinst God, euer since thou wart borne.
Agein, if thou take it too bee from the time that thou wart a little babe,
vnable too discerne betweene whyte and blacke: yit wart thou of the
cursed race of Adam. And so turne thee on which syde thou wilt: and
reason must needes driue thee too perceyue, that thou wart vnable too
doo any thing too Godward, and consequently that all that euer he hath
wrought for thy welfare, ought too be fathered vppon him alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
chalenging any drop thereof too thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Thus wee see now why Saint Paule dooth in this text call vs the
woorke or woorkmanship of God, according also as it is saide in the
Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 79. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 13.</note> that they which were the houshold folke of his Church, were
also his flocke. For there the Prophet sholeth out the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,
whom God had gathered toogither of his owne mere goodnesse,
too set them asyde from other heathen nations. For it is certeine, that
God found none other cause too keepe that linage too himself, or too
preferre them before others, saue only that he of his own mere mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
had them theruntoo. As much is to be sayd of vs at this day. And
that which he addeth, namely that wee were created in Iesus Christ,
ought too touche vs yit the more too the quicke. For there he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the creating of vs in Adam, is but a bringing of vs too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
and therfore that it standeth vs in hand too bee fashyoned
and cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rst too the Corinthians. Yee see then that
this woord create, is ynough too stoppe the mouthes, and too put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the cackeling of such as brag of the hauing of any woorthinesse.
For when they say so, it is a presupposing that they were the makers
of themselues. He that chalendgeth too himself any fredome of will,


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23289:94"/>
and taketh vppon him too haue any meane or abilitie to doo good (of
himself:) it is certein, that his meaning is, too step intoo Gods place,
and too shew himself too bee a Creator. But there is noman which
abhorreth not such blasphemie. The blyndest betles and maddest
bedlems in the worlde, account the woorde <hi>Creation,</hi> as a holie and
sacred thing, &amp; will say, that God is the verye Creator or maker of all
things, and thou Hipocrite confessest the same with thy mouth, and
yit thou doost but lye, forasmuch as thou thinkest that thou hast some
freewil too further thy self too welfare &amp; saluation. And so thou denyest
the first article of our fayth: for thou makest God but half a creator,
So then they will well ynough confesse with their mouth, that God is
the Creator, yea and as farre as the lyfe of this world comes too, they
will say, they holde it of him. But now is there a much excellenter
lyfe, namely which wee hope for, and which wee possesse alredye by
fayth, howbeit that wee inioy it not alredye now presently. And how
much more precious and woorthie is that lyfe wherin wee shallbee
parttakers of Gods glorie, than this wayfaring which wee make in
this world, that is but a shadowe that vanisheth away out of hand?
Now if yee aske the Papistes of whom they haue the (heauenly) lyfe,
wee haue it partly of Gods grace (say they) and partly of our owne
feeewill. Forasmuch then as they father some peece therof vppon
themselues, and thinke too part stakes after that fashyon with God:
wee must conclude that they bee their owne creators. But heeruppon
they will reply, and protest that they neuer ment any such thing, and
that they had leuer dye, than too vtter any such blasphemie. Yea, but
in the meane whyle, which is the thing of greater valew? too create a
mans self too bee a mortall man in this world, or too purchace euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
lyfe? S. Paule telleth vs, that if wee can doo any thing by our
owne freewill and power, God is not fully our creator. But he sayeth,
wee bee his woorkmanship and of his making, yea euen in respect of
the heauenly lyfe: it behoueth vs too beare that alwayes in mynd: for
S. Paule speaketh not of this transitorie lyfe, but of the inheriting of
the kingdome of heauen. Wee see then that the Papistes defye God
in their pryde, lyke villanous blasphemers as they bee. And therefore
for our part, if wee mynde too bee parttakers of the grace which is
purchaced for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, wee must bee rid cleane of
all selfweening, and acknowledge that our beginning too doo well,
springeth of Gods voutsafing too call vs too him, and of his preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting


<pb facs="tcp:23289:95"/>
of vs through his owne free goodnesse. Too bee short, S. Paules
meaning is, that all they which thinke themselues too haue deserued
aught at Gods hand, doo beare themselues on hand, that they bee men
of great abilitie, wheras in deede they bee already dead, &amp; are nothing
at al. What can a dead man doo? And surely wee bee dead (as I haue

that he created the worlde of nothing, it is as much too saye, as that

Now, if wee bee nothing, shall wee bee able too bynd God too gyue

that wee haue all thinges of Gods gift, and of his free goodnesse, wee
must bee fayne too come too this poynt, namely that God gaue vs our

to all men, but only to those whom God hath chozen, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
as wee haue seene alredie, that we were chozen before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the world. Now then this extendeth not generally too all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams
ofspring, but only too so many as are renewed in Iesus Christ.
And therfore it is all one as if S. Paule should shewe, that wee had
neede of a remedie, for somuch as wee bee alredye forlorne and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
at such tyme as God by the meanes of Iesus Christ plucketh vs
out of the dungeon wherin we were. And this serueth too confirme yit
better the thing that we haue seene heertoofore, which is, that wee can
not be faythfull, except God make vs new agein, so as wee hold of him
all things that belong to the heauenly lyfe, and all the spirituall goods
which wee haue. Now seing wee bee created in Iesus Christ, it is all
one as if it were sayd, that all the ryghtuousnesse, all the wisdome, all
the vertue, and al the goodnesse that is in vs, wee drawe it from out of
that fountaine, and that God scattereth them not abrode at aduenture,
but hath put the fulnesse of all things belonging too our saluation, into
Iesus Christ, in somuch that when wee bee once made members of his
bodie,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 16. &amp; Colos. 1. c. 19. &amp;. 2. b. 9.</note> wee be allso made parttakers of all his benefyts, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, wee bee cut of from all parts of our saluation, as though wee
were rotten and stinking wretched carkesses, and that there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in vs but filth, as I haue declared before. Thus yee see what wee
haue too mark further, when S. Paule sayeth, that wee bee not only
Gods woorkmanship, but also created in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now he addeth, <hi>too good vvoorkes vvhich he hath prepared
for vs to vvalke in.</hi> His setting down of good woorkes in this place,
is to shew, what a follie, or rather what a madnesse and frentiknesse it
is in men, too beare themselues in hand that they can bring good
workes on their behalf, as who should say, they had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their sleeues,
or as if they were of their owne growing. For needes must God
haue prepared them (sayth he) and that wee should haue them at his
hand. And it is all one as if he should say, go too, shew heere your
prowesse and vertewes: enter a litle into account with God: seeing
your pryde will not bee daunted, but yee haue all wayes some bristles
set vp still, bring foorth all that yee think may make for yee. Well, say
you, and wee will bring our good workes, as the Papistes are wont to
doo: who alledge in this wyse: what? how now? shall we not be saued
by our owne merites, and by our good workes? And whence draw ye
them, sayeth S. Paule? Haue yee coyned them in your owne shop? or


<pb facs="tcp:23289:96"/>
haue ye some gardin of your owne planting, whence too gather them?
or spring they, I wote not how, of your owne trauel and pollicie, so as
you may further your selues by them? No, but contrarywyse, knowe
yee that God hath prepared them. And is it meete that you should fall
too replying ageinst him, when he hath pityed you, and shewed himself
bountifull towardes you? Is it meete that yee should presume too step
foorth too pay him, as though yee had wherwith of your awne? When
a man hath bin well kept and tended, and his host hath lent him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at his neede, and he hath receyued it at his hand (too pay him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:)
shall he afterward boast, that he hath payd his hoste? There is
an hoste, that not onely is contented too doo his charitie vpon a man,
but also after he hath found hym both at bed and at boord, wyll say too
hym, Hold here wherwith too pay: too the intent it may not seeme too
you, that my charitable dealing hath bin too make an vnderlyng of
you, I wyll receyue payment for it at your hand, yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut yit the same
shall come out of myne owne purse. Nowe, shall he too whom suche
franknesse hath bin vsed, go and say, he hath wel payd his host? Yea,
and with what money? Euen with the same money that was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
his hand. So standeth the cace with those that put forth theyr good
woorkes, too say, that God hath not saued them freely, but that they
them selues were a helpe too it. Yea, but where come they by those
good workes? That was the thing that S. Paule amed at, when he
sayd that God prepared the good woorkes. Trew it is that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
mennes conuersations by the Lawe, wherein he gyueth vs a
certaine rule how too walke according too his will: and it is all one as
if he prepared the way for vs too go in as wee ought too doo. But that
would nothing boote vs, except wee receyued the good woorkes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
at Gods hand. When God commaundeth vs any thing, wee
may well haue our eares beaten with the sound of it, but it will neuer
enter intoo our hartes, for wee bee full of pryde and naughtinesse, and
too bee short, it is impossible for vs too obey God, till he haue softened
our hartes, and vtterly chaunged them.</p>
               <p>And that is the thing which is declared too vs by the Prophets, and
in all the holy scripture. God therefore must bee fayne too make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preparation: that is too wit, when he hath taught vs, and told vs
what is good, and what he lykeeh of, afterward he must reforme vs,
and so guide and gouerne vs by his holy spirit, as there may bee one
accord betweene our life and his lawe. Then vntill such time as God


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23289:96"/>
prepare good woorks after that fashion, that is too say, till he giue vs
them by shewng vs his will, and also make vs to do them by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
wee must needes bee vtterly vnprofitable Now sith it is so, let
vs learne too humble our selues before God, both for that is past, and
also for that that is too come. For that which is past, let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that God hath plucked vs out of the gulf of hell, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
wee were by nature damned, he hath voutsafed too haue vs too bee
his children, and therfore let vs not bee so ouerweening, as too thinke
that wee haue this or that, but let him be gloryfied as he deserueth, and
let vs assure our selues that he hath pulled vs backe from death, to the
intent, that the beginning, welspring, roote, and onely cause of our
saluation, should proceede of his onely free bestowed goodnesse. Thus
ye see in effect, that it is a poynt of trew humilitie, to giue all the glory
of our saluation vntoo God. And for that which is too come, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
too knowe that wee could not stirre one of our little fingers too
doo any good, except wee were gouerned by God, and receyued the
good works them selues at the hand of him, and of his holy spirit. So
then, as oft as wee feele our owne weakenesse, let vs flee too him for
refuge: and when wee haue doone any good, let it not puffe vs vp
with any pryde, but let vs alwayes thinke our selues so much the more
straytely bound vntoo God, yea euen by dubble. He that is yit very
weake, must confesse him selfe exceedingly bound vntoo Gods mercy,
for bearing with him: but he that goeth afore others, and is as a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all holinesse, must confesse himselfe much more bounde vntoo
him. For why? He hath nothing of his owne, he holdeth all things of
God, and of his onely free goodnesse. Wherefore let vs all our life
long walke in such sort, as wee may still from yeere too yeere, from
mooneth to mooneth, from day to day, from houre to houre, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
too minute, continually acknowledge our selues bound vnto God
for the goodnesse which he hath giuen vs of his owne mere mercy, and
let vs thinke our selues beholden too him for all things.</p>
               <p>And let vs marke by the way for a conclusion, that S. Paules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
here, is not to decypher al the causes of our saluation one by one,
but too abate mens lustinesse, that they might not make any bragges,
or any countenance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God is in their debt. Therefore it is ynough
for S. Paule to haue stopped all mens mouthes in such wyze, as they
may not take vppon them too haue aught of their owne. For contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwize
whensoeuer God giueth vs good works, although they bee the


<pb facs="tcp:23289:97"/>
fruites of his mere goodnesse: yit can they not purchace vs any thing
at his hand: for wee must alwayes ground and settle our selues vppon
the forgiuenesse of our sinnes. There lyeth all our rightuousnesse.</p>
               <p>Too bee short, there are twoo things requisite in yeelding God the
prayse that is dew for our saluation: first that wee acknowledge our
selues too haue all things of him: and secondly that wee acknowledge
that all the good workes, and all the good will which he hath giuen vs
already, serue not too purchace vs fauour at his hand, nor for vs too
trust vppon: but (too shewe vs) that he had neede too vpholde vs, and
too burye and forget all our sinnes, and that by that meanes wee bee
iustifyed before him, bycause he acquitteth vs, notwithstanding that
wee deserue too bee condemned a hundred tymes. So then, too be shor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
when it is tolde vs, that there is nother freewill, nor any thing else in
man: it is too the ende wee should learne too gyue all glory vnto God,
and not haue any cause too vaunt our selues any more. And that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
vppon the knowing thereof, wee should vnderstand that wee
should bee in continuall trubble and perplexitie, were it not that wee
bee sure that wee shall alwayes obteine grace and mercy, by comming
too God with teares and lamenting. And how so? Bycause he vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
too acquit vs, and although he could thunder downe vppon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and drowne vs: yit he buryeth our sinnes by meanes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ, and receyueth vs alwayes too mercy.</p>
               <p>Thus then yee see how men ought in all poyntes, and in all caces
too bee confounded in themselues, and too bee ashamed of their owne
leawdnesse, that they may glorifie God: and therwithall ackowledge
that they should alwayes bee in doubt and anguish, but that God dooth
euermore pitie them, and the death and passion of our Lord Iesus
Christ, is the sacrifize wherby wee be reconcyled too him. That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the trew way too vphold and auow God too bee the Sauiour
of the world: &amp; that also is the way for vs to father all things vpon the
grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, as he deserueth: namely by rayzing
and putting quyte away all the glorying which we pretend to haue in
our selues, and theruppon too confesse, not only that all the goodnesse
which is in vs, is of Gods putting intoo vs, but also that he must bee
fayne too beare with our infirmities, bycause wee ceasse not too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
his wrath, till he make that satisfaction auaylable, which was
made by the death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>But now let vs cast our selues downe before the maiestie of our

good God, with acknowledgment of our sinnes, praying him to make
vs too feele them more and more, till wee bee so pulled downe, as there
may bee no more showe of sin in vs: and that in the meane whyle, wee
may neuerthelesse seeke the ayde and helpe of our Lord Iesus Christ.
And that forasmuch as he hath partly inlyghtened vs alredy by his
holy spirit, it may please him too increace his grace in vs more and
more, till he haue communicated it wholy vntoo vs: and in the meane

backe by his secret power, vntill he take vs away out of this world,
and ioyne vs with our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the fountayne of all

The same order keepeth S. Paule
here. For wee have seene this morning,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:98"/>
how he made cleane riddance of all that is in man, that there myght
bee but only one ground woork of saluation, that is too wit, the mere
goodnesse of God. Now hee applyeth the same particularly too the
Ephesians, willing them too bethink themselues of their plyght wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God found them: as if after his speaking of all mankynd, he should
send euery one of vs too his owne experience. And in verye deede, that
which is spoken heere too the Ephesians, concerneth vs also, lyke as
if a man hauing told vs of the forlornnesse wherintoo wee bee tumbled
by Adams fall, should say: Consider also what you were, and after
what sort you liued in all beastlinesse, before such tyme as God called
you too the knowledge of himself. The thing then which wee haue too
mark, is, that S. Paule hauing shewed how that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
too the least, ought too confesse that they haue their saluation
through Gods only goodnesse, addeth another particular declaration,
wherin he sheweth the thing that euery one of the faythfull ought too
knowe in himself. Trew it is that the thing which he hath sayd for that
tyme, would not agree in all poynts too our dayes: but yit shall S.
Paules answer alwayes haue his course, and serue too good purpose.
For although wee haue bin baptized from our infancie, yit come wee
of such as erst were cut of from Gods Churche. For the Iewes were
sholed out from all other nacions of the world, as a people whom God
had ordeyned too himselfe, wee were then all Heathen, (I meane
as in respect of our forefathers,) before the Gospell was preached
too the world. But now agein wee see what confuzion is come vppon
vs, through the vnthankfulnesse of such as were called too the truthe
of the Gospell, and how wee haue strayed away after such a sort, that
wee haue bin as good as cut of from Gods Churche agein. For the
baptim that wee receiued in our chyldhod, stoode vs in none other sted,
but too make vs dubble giltie before God For they that were plund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the superstitions of poperie, and in all the Idolatries that are
committed there, had as good as renounced their baptim, and were
become renegats: and wee can not excuze our selues too haue bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne
vntoo God, seing wee were start away from his obeysaunce.
Therfore it is not for vs too make any boasting, or too seeke any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuce
too couer our wretchednesse withall: but rather too confesse free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that wee were as deadly enemies too God, and woorthie too haue
bin vtterly giuen ouer of him, bycause he had reached vs his hand too
bring vs backe agein too the way of saluation. So then, first wee take


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:23289:98"/>
this text as it lyeth, to apply it to the Ephesians, and afterward looke
too take profit of it our selues. Now then let vs see the contents and
substance of these woords, <hi>Bethink your selues, and remember how
yee were sometyme Gentyles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First he putteth a difference betweene the Iewes, and those whom
God had suffered too walke on still in their owne darkenesse. For it
was a speciall priuiledge that God gaue vntoo Abrahams ofspring,
when he adopted them, too say too them, you shalbee my people whom
I lyke of, as though yee were of myne owne houshold. Those then
which came not of Abrahams lyne, were as good as banished from
Gods kingdome and Church. And he addeth, <hi>in the fleshe.</hi> Not as
he speaketh in dyuers other places, where he vseth that woord in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche:
but too shewe that God had shewed by a visible fashion, how
wretched their state was, and that they needed not any greate deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of wit too perceyue it. For circumcizion (sayeth he) serued as
it were too rid men of their vncleannesse. And furthermore that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was ordeyned of God, too shewe that all the seede of man is
cursed, and that wee cannot bee ryghtly made holy and pure, but by
the cutting of, &amp; putting away of the thinges that wee haue by nature.
Too bee shorte, lyke as nowe adayes wee bee taught by Baptime
too renounce whatsoeuer wee haue by birth: so also was circumcizion
a token to shew how all men were filthy and lothsome, till they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
their owne kynd. Now then, S. Paules meaning is, that the
sayd visible signe, shewed well too all the heathen, that they were (as
yee would say) vnwoorthie too preace vnto God, and that he voutsafed
not to receyue them into the companie of the faythfull. For the Iewes
had not inuented circumcizion of their owne brayne: but (as I haue
sayd afore) God had sholed them out from the rest of the world, &amp; all
was by reason of the priuiledge of his owne mere grace &amp; goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Theruppon S. Paule addeth further, <hi>that they were at that tyme
vvithout Christ.</hi> And this serueth too shewe yit better, that men are
horrible scattered, and can do nothing but runne astraye, till God haue
knit them toogither in the bodie of his sonne, and adopted them too bee
his children. For wee knowe that Iesus Christ is the lyght of the
worlde, and that all ryghtuousnesse dwelleth in him, and that he is our
redemption and lyfe. So long then as wee haue none acquayntance
with him, wee must needes bee as poore blynd men in the darke, wee
must needes bee as good as dead, wee must needes bee naked of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:99"/>
ryghtuousenesse, power, and all goodnesse. And forasmuch
as our freedome dependeth vppon him: wee must needes bee hild vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the tyrannie of the diuell and of sin, till he haue raunsomed vs from
them. For this cause therfore doth S. Paule send vs heere vnder the
person of the Ephesians, too Iesus Christ, too the end, that they which
are not parttakers of Gods sonne, should knowe that it were better for
them too bee drowned a hundred tymes, than too continew alwayes in
that state. And why? For sith wee can haue nother lyfe nor soule health
nor ryghtuousenesse, nor ought else that is allowable, but in Iesus
Christ: it is all one as if he sayed, that wee haue nothing but vtter
naughtinesse and destruction in our selues.</p>
               <p>He addeth thereunto, <hi>the common weale of Israel:</hi> shewing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that all the promises which were made too the Iewes, were groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vppon Iesus Christ. And therefore they that belong not too his
body, are foorthwith depryued of all Gods promises, and cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
any hope of lyfe, but onely by imagination, wherin they beguile
themselues. And verily he addeth, <hi>the instrumentes (or couenantes
and conueyaunces) of the promises:</hi> as if he should say, that God had
not called the Iewes as it were in hudder mudther, but had passed a
solemne conueyance or euidence, which serued too leaue all the world
in condemnation. Therfore forasmuch as God had aduaunced Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
linage, it must needes bee that the rest of the world was so much
the more confounded, like as if some Princes or some Cities should
make a league, all others that are not comprehended in it, are as good
as depriued of the benefite that is conteyned in it. And when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that he tooke the Iewes too bee his flocke, and that he would be
their father and sauiour: he declared also that no part thereof could
come to the Gentiles, whom he had after a sort forsaken, and to whom
he had not voutsafed too shew the like mercy. Finally he sayeth, <hi>that
they had bin vvithout God,</hi> which is the full measure of all mischief.
For what shall become of man, when his God hath so shaken him of,
as there is no accesse for him, nor no comming too him agein? And
that not onely he is forsaken of his God, but also cannot but plundge
himselfe deeper and deeper intoo the bottom of hell, and make warre
ageinst God, as though he were at defia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with him, bicause he is stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
and rebellious ageinst all goodnesse? Thus yee see, that the
thing which S. Paule setteth forth here, too the intent that the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
should profit themselues, by the things that he had sayd this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23289:99"/>
concerning the onely cause of our saluation: is that there is none
other thing for vs too trust vntoo, but onely Gods meere grace.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come too o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r selues. I haue alreadie declared breif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that our fathers were in the same state that S. Paule setteth downe
here. And therefore wee haue no cause too brag of, as oft as we thinke
of what roote and originall wee spring. For if the very Iewes bee at
this day a record of Gods wrath and horrible vengeance, which he
layeth vppon them for their vnbeliefe: is there not much more cause
for too cast downe their eyes, which are but as things borne out of
tyme? For the Iewes are of the holy roote that God had chozen, and
wee bee but graffed intoo it in their steade. If God hath not spared
the naturall braunches,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. b. 16. &amp;. 17. c. 21.</note> what will he doo too vs that haue bin brought
in as it were ageinst nature? Loe how S. Paule exhorteth vs too
lowelinesse, too the end wee should lerne to submit our selues alwayes
too Gods meere goodnesse, and frankly and freely confesse that our
welfare consisteth therin. Also I told you secondly, not onely that
our fathers were straungers to the hope of saluation, bicause they were
not adopted as well as the Iewes: but also that the horrible scattering
which came vppon the whole world, and which reigneth in it still at
this day, ought too beate downe al pryde and presumption, that Gods
grace may shine the brighter vppon vs. Now then (as I sayd) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee bee baptyzed, and haue the badge of Gods goodnesse and
free adoption: yit, notwithstanding we haue bin wretched idolaters,
and were gone away from our Lord Iesus Christ, and the things that
wee had in greatest estimation, turned too our greater damnation, in
steade of being for our welfare. Therefore wee haue good cause here
too bethinke our selues.</p>
               <p>Furthermore for asmuch as wee bee short witted in magnifying
Gods grace, let vs wey well this woord which S. Paule vseth heere
to bring vs to remembrance of the things which wee myght forget.
For when wee bee indewed with Gods grace, and it hath pleased him
too giue vs some good desyre too walk in his feare, &amp; he hath wrought
so in vs by his holye spirit, as men may perceyue that there is some
goodnesse in vs: it maye make vs too forget by and by what wee
were afore, by meanes wherof Gods grace is as good as buryed. Too
the intent therfore that our present plyght hinder not our continuall
praysing of God, and our esteeming of his goodnesse and grace as it
deserueth: let no length of tyme darken the benefites that we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued


<pb facs="tcp:23289:100"/>
of God, but let vs as it were enter intoo examination of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day. And although God haue chaunged our state at this day,
so as wee bee no more the men that wee were afore: yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
let vs beare in mynd, that before God had pitie vppon vs, wee
were as seely sheepe that went astray, and as beastes that are vtterly
lost, and that without the same small beginning, wee had bin damned
ten hundered thousand tymes erst, had not God preuented vs, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs remedie for the cursed state wherin wee were. Yee see then,
that the thing which we haue to consider vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sayd speech, wherby
S. Paule putteth the Ephesians in mynd, what they were afore, is,
that although God had put awaye the thing that shoulde haue made
them ashamed, and marked them afore hand with his holy spirit, so as
they were become as precious perles: yit notwithstanding he will
haue them too bethink themselues, (lyke as in very deede it is, the
frutes of repentance which the scripture setteth downe,) that when
God hath reached vs his hand, and brought vs home agein from our
straying, wee ceasse not too beethink vs of our (former) sinnes, euen
in such wyze as wee may bee sorye, abashed, and ashamed of them.</p>
               <p>Whereas he sayeth, that the Gentyles haue good cause too hold
downe their heades, bycause they were sometyme without assurance of
Gods goodnesse and loue: therby wee bee put in mynd, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a singular benefyte at Gods hand, when wee haue the vse of his
Sacramentes, which are as warran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, that he taketh and auoweth
vs too bee of his household and Church. Trew it is, that if wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
them, wee shall pay deerly for it: but yit whatsoeuer come of it,
when the Sacramentes are put too the end wheruntoo they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned,
it is certein, that they bee as it were inestimable treasures, as
I sayd afore. For although wee haue Gods promis that he taketh
vs for his children, euen from our comming out of our mothers womb:
yit is there nothing but vnclennesse in our flesh. Now then, haue wee
baptim? There it is shewed vs that God washeth and clenzeth vs
from all our vnclennesse, that he pulleth vs out of the confuzion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee were with our father Adam: and that he will haue vs clothed
with Iesus Christ, too bee parttakers of all his goods, as though they
were our owne.</p>
               <p>Wee see then what baptim importeth, and consequently how much
we ought too esteeme this grace of Gods comming vntoo vs in such
wyse, and of his shewing of himself too bee our father after so homely


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23289:100"/>
maner. As much is too bee sayd of the supper. For there it is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs visibly, that Iesus Christ is the trew foode of our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ules, that
like as our bodyes are susteined &amp; nurrished with the bread and wyne,
so wee haue our spirituall lyfe of the verye substance of Gods sonne.
Seing then that our Lord Iesus dooth as it were from hand too hand
shewe vs, that he giueth vs his bodie and blud too bee our spirituall
meat and drink: is it not a thing much more worth than all things that
are too bee found in this world? And herin wee see how malicious and
frowarde most men are: for as touching the Lords Supper, manie
come to it, which rush thither lyke wretched beasts, not knowing why
it was ordeined. Some agein make but a custome &amp; ordinarie vse of it:
&amp; although thei haue bin taught to what purpose it auaileth vs: yit they
do but wring their mouth at it, &amp; all is one to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when it is once past
with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And othersome defyle it euen wilfully. And as touching bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
we se how the world goeth with it. For wheras we ought to think
dayly, &amp; not only once aday, but euery houre of the day, both vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
&amp; also vpon the Lords supper, to confirme our selues the better
in Gods grace: so little dooth any man sett his mynd that way, that if
baptim bee minnistred in the Church, men make none account of it.
Scarsly can one bee found among a hundred, that can fitly tell and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what that signe of our adoption betokeneth. And yit yee see what
disdeyne is matched with that ignorance. Must not God after his
long suffering of vs, and his pacient wayting for vs, be reuenged of
such dishonour, when his grace is so lyghtly esteeemed among vs? So
much the more therfore dooth it stand vs in hand, too marke well what
S. Paule telleth vs heere, when he sayeth, that the Gentyles being
depryued of the Sacramentes which God giueth too his children for
a warrant of his goodnesse and loue, are in miserable taking, too the
end wee may lerne too make much of the priuiledge which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs, not too boast folishly of it, as hipocrytes doo, who abuse Gods
name continewally: but too make vs too fare the better by a thing of
so greate pryce and valew, and too make vs knowe that wee bee no
whit better than they which are as poore hungrestarued soules, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
whom God shetteth the gate still, and too whom he voutsafeth
not tooo impart those pledges of his, wherein he sheweth and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that he will bee our father. Yee see the Turkes haue circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as well as the Iewes, and yit is it nothing woorth, bycause there is
no more any promis of God goyng with it: and yit notwithstanding


<pb facs="tcp:23289:101"/>
wee come of Adams race as well as they. Wherefore haue wee Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
but bycause God intended too shewe himselfe the more pitifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
vs, and too vtter the riches of his goodnesse? Agein, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
will needes bee called Christians, and haue Baptim as well as
wee. And yit in the meane whyle they bee bereft of the holy Supper,
yea and they haue the abhominable Masse, wherein they renounce the
death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ. And what cause is there
why wee should bee so preferred before them, sauing that God would
haue vs too bee as myrrours of his infinite mercy? So much the more
therefore behoueth it vs too walke in awe and warenesse, and too set
store by the things which God sheweth vs too bee of such woorthinesse
and excellencie, that wee may fare the better by them. Wherefore
marke it for a speciall poynt, when S. Paule speaketh heere of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
and vncircumcision.<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. &amp; 6. d. 15.</note> For although he say in other places,
that Circumcision is nothing, (howbeeit that was but bycause it was
abolished, and the vse therof ceassed, as of all other figures of the Law:)
yit notwithstanding, at such tyme as God ordeyned it, and so long as
the Iewes vsed it holily, it was a sure warrant to them of Gods adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if he had clenzed them from all the filthinesse that is in Adams
race, and appropryed them vntoo himselfe.</p>
               <p>After he hath sayd so, he addeth, that <hi>they vvere vvithout Christ,
and vvithout promises.</hi> Here he sheweth that the Sacraments take
and borrowe their force of Gods woord. For if there were nomore but
the bare signes, it were no matter of great importance. If Circumcizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had bin giuen too the Iewes without any doctrine or instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: too
what purpose had it serued? Surely they had bin neuer the better for
it. But when as God sayeth, I am the God which sanctifyeth you, you
shalbee my children, I will receyue you, and therwith all take you for
myne heritage: and on the other syde also I giue my self too you, and
wilbee your lyfe: forasmuch as Circumcizion had such promises, it
was as an inestimable treasure too the Iewes, bicause the foundation
(that is to wit, our Lord Iesus Christ) was layd sure, wheron the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
were setled, and as yee would say, confirmed. That then is
the cause why S. Paule ioyneth heere the common weale of Israell,
and the instruments of Gods promises, and our Lord Iesus Christ al
toogither. Howbeeit in speaking of the common weale of Israell, he
sheweth, that God had chozen one certeyne linage which he would
haue too bee holie: and so was it too bee concluded, that all the rest


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23289:101"/>
were vnholie. In speaking of the instruments of the promises, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(as I haue touched alredie) that wee must not looke vppon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
in it selfe, but wee must direct it too the ryght end of it. It
becommeth vs too knowe wherefore God would haue it vsed among
the Iewes: for otherwyse it is but an Apes toy, as the number of fond
deuotions which the Gentyles had, whereby they hoped too haue had
holynesse: but all of it was but abuse and trumperie, bycause they had
no promis of God. Lykewyse they say now adayes in the papacie,
that they haue many Sacramentes, and therewithall as many murli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes
and gewgawes as can bee: but all that God disalloweth, is
but pelting trash. And why? for there is no woorde that sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them. So then let vs marke well, that too profit our selues by the
Sacramentes, wee must alwayes be taught them by Gods doctrine.
And thereby wee may iudge, that manie are cut of from the Church
of God, who notwithstanding are now adayes thought to bee hyghest
in it. For in the meane whyle where is the instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they should
haue too be partakers of the benefytes that God offereth them? They
will alledge their Baptim, and they will say, they receyue the Lordes
Supper. If a man ask them too what end: they vnderstand nothing
at all, and that is as an vtter abolishing of the power of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.
So much the more therfore dooth it stand vs on hand too
come backe too this poynt, namely too lerne of the Gospell, too what
end Baptim was ordeyned, what frute it yeeldeth vs, and which is the
ryght and lawfull vse of it: and also too consider whertoo the holie
Supper auayleth vs. For if wee haue not Gods woord: our Lord
himselfe telleth vs, that the Sacramentes which we recey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, are as it
were imbaced, and there is nothing but falsehod in them. And lyke as
if a man should set a (Princes) seale to a letter that had nothing therin,
or which had but imaginations and dreames contryued in it, it were an
offence woorthy of death: so also forsomuch as the Sacramentes are
as Seales too warrant Gods promyses vntoo vs, and too make them
of authoritie among vs: if wee separate them from his woorde, it is
certeyne, that wee bee falsifyers before God and his Angells. That
therefore is one thing more which wee haue too marke vppon this
streyne.</p>
               <p>And wee must marke also, that Iesus Christ is set downe with the
common weale of Israell, and with the Sacramentes and promises,
too shewe that it is he on whom all of vs depend. For it is certeyne


<pb facs="tcp:23289:102"/>
that God neuer commeth at men without the mediator. For sith he
hateth vnrightuousnesse, &amp; all men are cursed in Adam: it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
that our Lord Iesus Christ should step in, that wee myght haue
some enterance and accesse vntoo God.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 20.</note> And that is the cause why S.
Paule sayeth also, that he is the <hi>yea and the Amen</hi> of all Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
For there shall neuer be any certeintie of Gods promises with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iesus Christ.<note place="margin">Exod. 24. b. 8.</note> And for the same cause also all things were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Lawe with blud, yea and euen the booke of the Lawe it selfe.
When the couenant was red openly,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 20.</note> and published solemly too the
people, the booke was besprinckled with the blud of the sacrifize, too
shewe that all the doctrine conteyned in the Lawe, and all the promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
wherby God adopteth those too bee his children, whom he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
intoo his Church, must bee confirmed by the blud of our Lord
Iesus Christ. So then, will wee haue the promyses too bee sure and
infallible? Will wee bee assured of them, that wee may freely call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
God, and fyght ageinst all temptations? Wee must resort al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
too Iesus Christ. It is much when God telleth vs with his
owne holy mouth, that he will reserue vs for his owne: but yit must we
needes tremble continually at his maiestie, till wee haue cast our eye
vppon our Lord Iesus Christ, and knowe that God lyketh well of vs
for his sake, so as our sinnes bee buryed, and shall neuer come too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Thus yee see how the promises, the Sacramentes, and all that
euer wee haue, must bee ratifyed by Iesus Christ. Too bee short, (if I
may make an humane comparison, and speake gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without him, wee should continue euermore as men in a swound, and

that there is some certeyne Godhead, and to indeuer to discharge
themselues of their duetie by seruing of a God: but they must also haue

what wee bee. And it may right wel be sayd, that we be without God,
when wee wander away after that fashion in our owne imaginations,
and in our false opinions. And that is the cause why S. Paule sayeth,
that such as haue had a mynd too worship some vnknowen Gods, haue
woorshipped nothing but Idoles and fantasticall imaginations, and
that God belongeth not at all vnto them, and so consequently, that they
were vtterly forsaken of him, lyke as they were become renegates, &amp;
had renounced him before. Somuch the more then behoueth it vs too
trauell and take peyne too knowe which is the God whom wee ought
too worship. I haue told you alreadye, that it is not ynough for a man
too alledge that he hath a good intent, and that he ment too worship
God: that will go for no payment: for God lyketh not of the libertie
that men take too make themselues beleeue this or that. Sith it is so,
wee must present our selues before God with all warenesse, that be
may shewe vs the way too come vntoo him. For else wee shall but go

the holy scripture: it becommeth vs too hold our selues short therunto,
and not too couet too knowe any thing which is not shewed vs there.
What must then bee our lodestarre too knowe God by? Too suffer our
selues too bee taught by his woord, and too bee so discret, as to receyue
whatsoeuer is conteyned there, without geynsaying, and not too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume

to haue that care,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. d. 22. 23.</note> sith we knowe how S. Iohn auoweth, that he which
hath not the sonne, hath not the father. Then lyke as I haue told you,
that bycause God reueleth himselfe in this woorde, it behoueth vs too
seeke him there: so also forasmuch as our Lord Iesus Christ is his liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

God is: but let vs repayre too Iesus Christ, acknowledging that it is
his office too bring vs too God his father, and that it is he by whome
wee must bee guyded, and so shall wee bee sure that wee shall not bee
without God in this world. Now if they that take so much peyne, and

too lerne too magnifie that grace, and too acknowledge what we haue
bin, and what wee should bee still, if God had not shewed himself mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
towardes vs.</p>
               <p>Heruppon a man myght demaund what S. Paule ment by the
woord <hi>VVorld:</hi> for it should seeme that out of the world they were not
without God. Howbeeit, that was too aggrauate the matter so much
the more, by saying that the Ephesians had inioyed the lyght of
the Sunne, all the Elementes had serued them, &amp; they had receyued so
manie commodities of Gods gift in all his creatures, and yit had not
knowen him. For what else is the world but an open stage wheron
God will haue his maiestie seene? Let vs lift vp our eyes: doo not the
Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres, leade vs too him that gaue them
the vertewes which wee perceyue in them? For behold, the sonne is
farre of from vs, and yit he giueth vs lyght. Agein, he causeth the earth
too bring foorth frutes, also wee see the dubble course that he keepeth:
and although he wander now on the one side, and now on the other, yit
notwithstanding he keepeth his compas continually, and neuer foget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
how farre he ought to go on the one side or on the other, as huge a
masse as he is. If a Ball or a Boule were too bee hild vp, it woold
neede some help: but behold, the Sunne hath nothing to hold it vp, but
the secret power of God: and yit notwithstanding he is so huge and
infinite a masse, as exceedeth all the whole earth. Mount he vp, or go
he lowe, turne he, or returne he, on the one side or on the other: yit kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
he his course stil euery day through the whole world, &amp; euery yere
also on the contrary part, and yit for all this he misseth not in any of all
those thinges. Too bee short, when wee behold the skyes, wee ought
too bee rauished with desyre to go vnto God. Agein, when we behold
the thinges that are neerer vs, namely the varietie of the good things
that God bestoweth vppon vs: (wee haue cause too doo the lyke.)
Finally without going any further, let vs but enter intoo our selues.
If a man looke but vppon one of his fyngers, what workmanship and
what goodnesse of God is there? Wee then are in the worlde where


<pb facs="tcp:23289:104"/>
God vttereth such abundance of myracles, wherby it is his meaning,
too bee knowen and worshipped: and yit notwithstanding wee play
the beastes, and go on lyke blockeheades without any vnderstanding,
not knowing the God that made vs and fashyoned vs, euen him that
vttereth and sheweth himselfe in all his creatures both aboue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath.
Is not this ynough then too bereeue them of all excu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, which
play the beastes in their ignorance, lyuing heere but only too deuoure
Gods benefytes, and in the meane whyle repayre not too him, too doo
him honour, or to offer him their seruice? Then is it not without cause,
that Saint Paule addeeth yit further this saying, that such as were
so destitute of the knowledge of the Gospell, were without God in
the world.</p>
               <p>Now thereuppon on the other side, he setteth downe the grace of
God, which they had receyued, too the ende, they should knowe that
it was not of their owne purchace, nor obteyned by their owne pollicy
and abilitie, but that they ought too consider well how greatly they
bee bound vntoo God, for rayzing them vp too heauen from the deepe
dungeons of hell. If God had but lent vs his hand to lift vs vp when
wee were falne but too the ground, and so let vs alone in our owne
state, wee should be beholden to him for it. For when we bee falne,
and some body helpes too lift vs vp agein, wee will cun him thanke, &amp;
so ought we too doo. Behold now, God hath not only lift vs vp from
the ground, but also drawen vs out of the gulf of hell. And his so doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is not too make vs crepe here beneath vpon the earth, or to make
vs too inioye the benefits that he offereth vs here presently: but too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
vs too the kingdome of heauen, as wee haue seene heretofore,
how wee bee put in possession of it alredy by fayth, and are set in the
person of Iesus Christ in the glory that he hath purchaced for vs, for
he is entred into it in our behalf. The seeing it is so, haue we not cause
too magnifie Gods grace so much the more? So haue yee Saint
Paules meaning, in that he sayth, that <hi>novv by Iesus Christ you be
come nere vntoo God, euen you (sayeth he) vvhich vvere farre of
before.</hi> Therefore at a word (forasmuch as the whole, cannot be layd
foorth at this tyme) let vs vnderstand, that whereas men seeme to haue
some worthinesse in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, they cannot but stray away to their own
destruction, so long as they bee separated from God, bycause that by
nature they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer let euery of vs knowe for his owne part, how wee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23289:104"/>
God, and were quite turned away from him, till he called vs
agein vntoo him. When wee knowe this, let vs learne too magnifie
his grace for voutsafing too reconcyle vs too himselfe, and too put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all the enmitie that was betwixt him and vs, and too make vs his
children of his deadly enemyes, assuring our selues, that all this is
done by meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ, too the intent wee should
out of that fountayne drawe all that belongeth too our saluation. And
furthermore let vs consider also, what furtherance wee haue by the
helpes that God hath giuen vs too come too Iesus Christ by, and too
confirme vs in him, too the end wee may haue a resolute and sure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.
As for example, when the Gospell is dayly preached vntoo vs,

before suche tyme as our Lorde Iesus Christ came intoo the

he reach vs his hand too draw vs too him: wee shall neuer knowe

wee bee in thraldom vntoo sin, and God is as it were armed ageinst

vs that wee haue our inheritance there, which cannot fayle vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
it is shewed vs, that wee haue the certeintie of all these things in

God: so heere he addeth a warning for the Iewes, to pull downe their
pryde, that they myght not think themselues too bee better than other
men, bicause God had chozen them. For acording as men are alwayes
giuen to auaunce themselus beyond measure, that people abused Gods
grace, and bare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in hand that the linage of Abraham was as
a linage of Angels. Too bee short, when it was told them, that the
Church should bee vnited togither both of Iewes and Gentyles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception: they thought that God did them great wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
In somuch that it was oftentymes told them, that Gods choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of them, was nother for their vertue, nor for their nobilitie, nor for
any thing else that he found in their persons: but bicause he had loued
their fathers without any desert of theirs. Often tymes therfore were
they warned by Moyses and the Prophets, too chalenge nothing at al
too them selues, but too goe too Gods free goodnesse, too spye out
them selues there, too the ende they myght confesse, that if they had
any prerogatiue aboue others, that was not of themselues, nor for their
own sakes, but bicause it was Gods good pleasure too keepe them to
himself for his owne heritage. And yit for all that, S. Paule sheweth
heere, that the Iewes renounce their own saluation, if they match not
with the Gentiles in true brotherhood. For why: Although the Iewes
were neere God alredye, and had witnesse that he hild them for his
children: yit notwithstanding, the matter hung in suspence til the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Iesus Christ. Then behoued it them too bee knit to
God by the mediator, or else they should haue had no peace in their
consciences. For when men examin themselues, they must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
by and by that God is iustly their enemye. And for proof therof,
what haue wee in our thoughts, in our lusts, in our soules, and in our
bodies, but vtter corruption? Therfore it ought to make vs to quake
as oft as wee thinke what wee bee. But the Iewes had the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and shadowes of the Law, which were assurances of Gods grace


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23289:107"/>
vntoo them. Yea, but if they had stayed there, what a thing had that
bin? For the blud of brute beasts could not scoure away their spottes,
nor set them in Gods fauour. Therefore it stoode them on hand too
resort too Iesus Christ. And that is the cause why S. Paule sheweth,
that the Iewes ought not too too bee so puffed vp with pryde, as too
shet the heathen out of the doores, as though they were not woorthie
too bee of Gods Church. For Iesus Christ is the mediator as well
of the one as of the other, vntoo God his father. In so much, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, all of vs are shet out from the hope of saluation. No man then
ought too despyze his neyghbour in this cace, nor too looke ouer the
shoulder at him, as the prouerb sayeth. But wee ought too imbrace
one another in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of vs from the greatest too the least, should ryghtfully bee cutte of from
Gods Church, but that he of his owne mere goodnesse gathereth vs
too him. After the same maner dooth S. Iames exhort the great men
of this world too glory in their smalnesse,<note place="margin">Iames <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> bycause God hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the blyndfolding that letted them too know their owne wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For wee knowe that men doo wilfully abuse their greatnesse,
and beleeue them selues too bee marueylous wyghtes, tyll they come
too knowe God. Therefore the great men of this worlde haue their
eyes blyndfolded, and that deceyueth them, and maketh them too take
leaue too doo what they liste. Now Saint Iames sayeth, that they
haue cause too glorye of their smalnesse, for that our Lorde discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them too bee creatures out of all hope, as of themselues, and yit
neuerthelesse taketh them intoo his fauour of his owne mercy. And let
the little ones (sayeth he) reioyce in their nobilitie, bycause God hath
exalted them: in somuch that whereas they were but as wretched
woormes, and had nothing but reproche in them, God hath taken them
vp, and made them new creatures. Yee see then that the meanes too
vnite vs as wee ought too bee, is, that euerye of vs in his degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

all men, yea euen as well of them that were mere afore, as of them that

should bee grounded vppon Gods mere mercy: let vs not bee so folish

not yit the pledge that is giuen vs in our Lord Iesus Christ, and
therefore it was needefull that they should bee vphild in good hope,

saying ought too breake off all distrust, when wee bee in dout and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie
whether God will accept vs or no. For seeing wee haue this
record, that Iesus Christ is our brother: what would wee haue more?
So then wee may wel conceyue out of what filth and defylements, yea
and out of what a gulf God hath drawen vs, seing he hathe assured vs
of his fatherly loue, wheruppon our saluation is grounded, yea and
that in the person of Iesus Christ. For wee see how the wretched
papists wote not too which Saint too vow themselues: yea and too
barre themselues of all excuce, so as there may neede none other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
too conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mne them: they make a common proueth of it. For
euen in that one saying that they wote not too which Saint too bow
themselues, they shewe themselues too bee faythlesse and destitute of
all aduyce and stay of themselues, and too bee as stray beastes. For
they haue such a multitude of theyr Sainctes, that they haue made

Mary for their aduocate: they catch holde of Saint Michaell, or
of Saint Peter, for their patrone, or of some other Saint, after as
their superstitious mynd leades them heere and there. Howbeeit, all
that they doo is with vnquietnesse of mynd, and they shall neuer fynde
rest, bycause they haue no woord of God too stay vppon. And when
they fynde themselues hampered in any perplexitie, they bee lyke

the which wee ought not too bee afrayd too suffer ten hundred thousand
deathes, if neede were. And S. Paule saith consequently, that <hi>the Law
consisted in ordinaunces and Decrees,</hi> too shewe that God abolished
not the lawe of good and holy conuersation, when he mynded too call
the Gentyles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:23289:112"/>
that serued peculiarly for the present tyme, and were not giuen
but only too the linage of Abraham. Yee see then what was abolished.
And therefore let vs leaue the figures of the Lawe, as Circumcizion,
Sacrifizing, feastfull dayes, as they were kept then, the difference of
meates, Lyghtes, Perfumes, and all that is set downe in wryting by
Moyses: for all those thinges must bee vanished away at the comming
of Christ: and yit for all that, let vs hold still the Lawe that God hath
giuen vs, which is inuiolable: that is too wit, let vs woorship him
purely, let vs call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, let vs put our trust in him, let vs do him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for all the benefites that he hath bestowed vppon vs, and let vs
hallowe his name. Agein, let vs aduyze our selues too walke in pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of lyfe, and with such conscience towardes our neyghbours, as we
may doo no man wrong or harme: and finally let vs withdrawe our
selues from all the defilements of the world. Heere yee see that the
Lawe which God hath giuen vs too rule our lyfe by, must continew
still: for that is not abolished, but only that which consisted in traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in the figures that serued but for the tyme, and were too haue
an end by Iesus Christ. Now seing it behoueth vs too giue ouer the
shadowes that were vsed, and had their full scope in the tyme of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and the Prophetes: it is much more reason that the Christian
Church should not now adayes bee burdened with mens inuentions.
According wherunto S. Paule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>elleth vs, that we must content our
selues with Gods Lawe, which serueth too shewe vs how wee may
be vnblamable, that is too wit, by walking in ryghtuousenesse, Iustice,
faythfulnesse, and mercy, and specially by calling vppon God purely,
and after a spirituall manner. Marke that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Agein, he sayth that the shadowes of the Law should in these dayes,
not only be superfluous, but also as a curtaine to keepe vs still in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and too let vs from seeing our Lord Iesus Christ, as wee ought
too doo, in the mirror of his Gospell. Therfore let vs conclude, that the
ryghtuousenesse which God requyreth at our handes, is another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of one, than that which the papistes haue imagined: for all the
thinges which they terme Gods seruice, are but starke gewgawes.
Yea and wheretoo serue they all, but onely too deface the peculiar ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue seene this morning, how S. Paul
hath told vntoo such as were erst without
hope of saluation, that they were so much
the more bound vntoo God for his calling
of them too bee of the number of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
seeyng it was not a common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
thing, nor a thing that was looked
for. On the other syde he did also beate
downe all pryde, too the intent that the
Iewes myght not thinke in themselues, that the priuiledge of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was of their owne purchacing, nor vaunt themselues though God
had preferred them before all the rest of the world. And now goyng
foreward still with the same matter, he sayeth, <hi>that wee vvere recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyled,
as vvel the one syde as the other, by the death of Iesus Christ,
and that in so dooyng he hath knit vs toogither intoo one body,
putting all enmitie too death by his crosse.</hi> This serueth too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
better the thing that wee haue seene already. He had sayd that
wee must come vntoo God by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ:
for without him wee bee all a farre of, as well Iewes as Gentyles, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee bee all sinners, and God in an enemye too vs, till his wrath
bee appeazed towardes vs. Now S. Paule sheweth, that that is done
by his bearing of our sinnes vppon his crosse. For it is by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that all our iniquities are put awaye, and it is by his sacrifyzce,
that our sinnes are washt away.</p>
               <p>To bee short, were it not for the death and passion of our Lord I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reckening, who durst open his mouth too excuze himself before God,
or (<hi>looke too</hi>) scape the damnation that all of vs haue deserued? For if
wee should go about too alledge but one poynt, there would bee a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
too stop our mouthes, so as wee should bee driuen too stand still all
confounded, till wee came too the remedie, that is too wit, that Iesus
Christ hath by his death made so full satisfaction for all our dettes,
that wee bee quitted and released. That then is the thing which S.
Paule handleth as now, too the end wee myght knowe what maner
of accesse it is that he speaketh of. For, too preace intoo Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
in cace as wee bee of our selues, were too great a boldnesse. But
when it is told vs, that God wil not lay our sinnes and misdeeds to our


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23289:113"/>
charge, bycause Iesus Christ hath put them all away by his death:
then is it no rashnesse at all for vs too go vntoo God with our heades
bolt vpryght, but we haue a good foundation, and a boldnesse that God
lyketh well of. Therfore as oft as wee haue occasion too pray, or too
fyght ageinst anie temptations, let vs learne too knowe that wee haue
neede too bee incoraged too patience, and too bee asserteyned of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
lyfe, and too repayre all wholly for refuge too the death and
passion of the sonne of God, knowing that vntill such tyme as wee bee
dipped in his blud, and washed by the woorking of his holie spirit, wee
shall euermore bee lothely, and God will iustly shake vs of, and bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a iudge too vs in sted of being our father. And it is not ynough
too knowe that Iesus Christ hath made amendes for vs, yea and that
all things requysyte too our saluation, were fully accomplished and
performed by his death and passion: but wee must also therwithall
receyue the benefyte thereof in such maner as it is ministred vntoo vs.
For what shall it auayle the Iewes, Turkes, and other lyke, that
Gods sonne vndertooke the condemnation that belonged too vs? They
shal rather bee hild dubble giltie, bycause that by their vnthankfulnesse
they bereeue themselues of the benefyte wherof they myght haue bin
parttakers, if they had receyued the promises of the Gospell by fayth.
But the Iewes on the one syde blaspheme our Lord Iesus Christ, the
Turks on the other syde laughe him too scorne, and count him but as
a night ghost. And the Papists labour with tooth and nayle to deface
his power, and too rob him of the greatest part of his graces. These
therfore shall fynde that the death which the sonne God hath suffered,
serueth too increace their cursednesse, and too kindle Gods wrath so
much the more ageinst them. Yea and euen they also which neuer
heard of the Gospell, are vtterly excluded from this treasure.</p>
               <p>And for that cause S. Paule addeth, <hi>that Iesus Christ hath prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
peace to them that vvere neere, and too them that vvere farre
of.</hi> Wherby he sheweth, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gospel is preached, we be dayly
put in possession of the saluation which was purchaced for vs by our
Lord Iesus Christ, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eastwyse if wee lay holde on him by trew fayth
that hath taken lyuely roote in our hartes, too bring foorth good fruite.
Therefore there are twoo things requyred. The one is, that wee know
how that the matter and substance of our saluation is in Iesus Christ:
and the other is, that the same bee declared too vs by the Gospell. And
too the intent wee may bee the surer of this doctrine: S. Paule sayeth,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:114"/>
not that Christ hath sent his Apostles, or set vp a great sort of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
too bring vs such message: but that Christ himselfe is come too bryng
tydings of peace too all men. Nowe it is certeyne that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ hath not executed the office of preaching since his Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
sauing onely among his Disciples, that they myght bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
aforehand too preache euery where the doctrine that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vntoo them. But S. Paule sayeth, that he preached too such
as had erst bin farre of from God. He did not this in his owne person.
Then is it certeyne that S. Paule speaketh of that preaching of the
Gospell, which was doone by the Ministers that were appoynted by
God, and by our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And yit notwithstanding he sayeth, that it was Christ himself that
preached, namely too the end wee should yeeld the greater reuerence
too the Gospell, and hold it as the truthe authorized by God, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
of vs submit himself too it without any geynsaying or replying.
For if wee haue any doubt of it, let vs not thinke that Iesus Christ
shall boote vs any thing at all. Therfore wee must assure our selues of
it, yea and (as wee haue seene in the first Chapter) Gods promises
must bee sealed in our harts by the holie Ghost, who for the same cause
is called the earnestpennye of the lyfe that wee hope for, and the verye
signe, manuell, or seale that God printeth in vs, too the end, that our
fayth should bee in full certeintie. Wee see then wherat S. Paule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this text, in saying that Iesus Christ being rayzed from the
dead, and hauing performed the charge that was inioyned him by God
his father, was our Redeemer, and also the bringer of the same me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

insomuch that he will haue his mouth still open euen too the end, too
witnesse vnto vs, that in him wee shall assuredly fynd all that wee can
wish too bring vs too the heauenly lyfe. Now then must wee not bee
very blocks, if we be not touched too the quicke, at the hearing of these
woords? It is trew that the sonne of God fleeteth not from place too
place, nor is conuersant heere beneath among vs in visible fashion,
nother were that requisite. But yit for all that, the doctrine which
wee preache in his name, ought too haue lyke anthoritie, as if hee

reproch doone vnto him, when the things are douted of that are so wel
certifyed there. The Pope &amp; al the rabble of his Clergie alledge this
for the mayntenance of their tyrannie. But our Lord Iesus Christes
meaning was, too warrant vs the message that concerneth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of our sinnes, wherwith our eares are beaten continually.
For wee shall alwayes hang in a mamering and doubt, if wee bee not
throughly perswaded and resolued, that all thinges conteyned in the
Gospell, are hild of Iesus Christ, who is the infallible truth it self. For
if wee haue an eye too men, wee shall bee euer wauering and doubtfull.
And for proofe thereof, what can they bring vs of their owne growing,
but vtter vanitie and leazing? So then, although our Lord Iesus
Christ abyde still in his heauenly glory, and wee bee absent from him
in body, yea and that it bee a straunge thing to vs, too say, that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in vs,<note place="margin">Math. 18. d. 20.</note> and that wheresoeuer twoo or three bee gathered toogither

must bee fully assured of this poynt, that when the pure doctrine of the

were familiarly conuersant heere among vs. Then too bee short, our

               <p>Furthermore, as wee haue heere wherwith too strengthen vs in
trew constancie of fayth, and too arme vs ageinst all the assaultes and
alarumes that Satan can giue vs: so it is a great shame for vs when
wee bee deafe at the hearing of the Gospell, or let it alone as a thing
hanging in the aire, taking it too bee but as a fable or a thing of no
valew. And yit for all that, most men now adayes doo eyther despyze
the Gospell, or else are so besotted, that they discant of it, as of a tryfle,
or else make but a mocke of it. Some hauing heard Sermons, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
bin taught at some Lecture, or by some other meanes, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce
say, it is possible that this may bee trew: and as for mee, I
wil not say nay to it: but forasmuch as I am no clerk nor diuine, it is al
one too mee, I will let it alone still in his ordinarie course. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will say, Tush, I will hold mee too the fayth of my forefathers:
For it is too daungerous a matter to chaunge. Some agein say thus:
How so? It is a new doctrine, that wee neuer heard of before. And


<pb facs="tcp:23289:115"/>
othersome being not contented with such scornfulnesse, adde outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crueltie, and fight openly ageinst it, in so much that they could find
in their hartes too plucke God out of his seate, wheruppon they fall to
sheading of innocent blud, indeuoring to the vttermost of their power,
too wype away the remembrance of the Gospell. But in the meane
whyle, let vs vnderstand, that whensoeuer the message of our saluation
is set foorth vntoo vs, if wee despyze it, wee shalbee giltie not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
a benefite that was brought vs by a mortall creature, but also
of shetting the gate ageinst Gods sonne, when he came too seeke vs to
our saluation. And therfore too quicken vp our slothfulnesse, and too
correct the cursed stubbornnesse that myght hinder our full and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
yeelding too the Gospell: let vs mark that the preaching therof is
not a thing doone by haphazard, nother doo men come of their owne
selues, as sayeth S. Paule also too the Romanes:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. c. 15.</note> but Gad himself vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteth
vs, and commeth vntoo vs, and our Lord Iesus Christ perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
still the dewtie of a shepeherd, and calleth vs too him with his
owne voyce, bycause he seeth vs too bee as sheepe that go astraye. And
although wee bee peaked asyde heere and there: yit his mynd is too
gather vs togither agein to be of his flocke. Were this well printed in
our hartes, surely wee should bee better disposed, not only to receyue
the doctrine of the Gospell with all humilitie, but also too bee inflamed
with such a zeale and earnestnesse, that the whole world should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison with vs. Too bee short, Gods woord would bee
as sweete as honnie to vs, and more precious than all goold and siluer,
considering that the sonne of God being in the glory of God his father,
doth neuerthelesse make vs to heare his voyce, and that not as one that
speaketh a farre of, or with a sound that vanisheth away in the ayre, or
in such wyse as wee haue no certeine record of the thinges that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:
but as one that commeth and preacheth too vs himself. For
looke what is done by his authoritie, and according to the commission
that he gaue and commited too his Apostles: it becommeth vs too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
it for his sake, as I haue declared afore.</p>
               <p>Moreouer S. Paules intent here, is to prouoke vs too receyue the
Gospell with all obedience, not onely for the worthinesse of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Lord Iesus Christ: but also for the things that are contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Gospell it self: for it is the message of peace, sayth he. Let
vs consider what it is to haue warre with him that made vs and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
vs. If wee haue an enemy in this world, although he be but a


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23289:115"/>
frayle man, and haue no very great credit: Yit will wee bee afrayd
least he shonld practize some pollicie or spight ageinst vs, or reuenge
himself by force. Too bee short, wee would euer bee vnquiet, so long as
we had any enemies in this world. Must we not then needes be tootoo
brutish, seeing wee fall a sleepe when God sheweth himself too bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
vs, and that he is armed too take vengeance vppon vs? If we
considered well what it is too haue warre with God, (as in deede our
sinnes ceasse not to prouoke him to displeasure) we should finde on the
contrary part, what a benefite it is too haue peace and attonement
with him. Now seeing that this is brought vs by the Gospell, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee enter possession of the attonement that was made by Iesus
Christ, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he offered himselfe in sacrifize by his death: it is a
thing that ought too inflame vs in such wise, as too make vs imbrace
the Gospell with earnest zeale, and too giue ouer our whole minde
thereuntoo. So then considering the coldenesse and lazinesse that is
in vs, let vs so much the more thinke vppon this saying, and applye
the same too our vse, namely, first too knowe that the sonne of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuzeth
not too teache vs, and too be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r scholemaster, so wee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
too bee his schollers: and secondly that wee shall haue a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
which is more too bee desired, than all the pleasures, honour, and
goods of the world: that is too wit, that wee bee at peace with God,
and that being sure of his fauour towards vs, wee may haue recourse
and accesse vntoo him, and bee receyued as his children at his hand.
Well ought wee too note that: for S. Paule ment too shewe which
is the trew peace, bycause many men thinke themselues well at ease,
which notwithstanding haue no peace with God. For some are puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
vp with diuelish self weening, as the Monks and Fryers in the
popedome, who perswade themselues that they haue deserued so well
at Gods hand, as there can no fault bee found in them. They then
which ground themselues after that manner vppon their owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and good deedes, thinke that God is bound vntoo them, and they
may well bee luld asleepe, bycause Satan besotteth them with the
foolish self trust which they haue conceyued: and that is bycause they
ame not at God, but haue forged an Idoll in their owne head. And in
good fayth, what are the things that they would content God withal,
but gewgawes and baggagely trifles, as if they would still babes
with them? The Papists must take a sprinkling of holy water, they
must all too be crosse themselues, they must fast this wake, and that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:116"/>
wake, they must gad on pilgrimage, they must forbeare eating of
flesh vpon such a day, they must babble thus many Paternusters, they
must set vp a candle to such a saynt, they must here thus many masses,
they must say thus many meaculpaze. Too bee short, when a man
hath raked them all on a heape, it is certeyne that they be but the scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
and offals of all filthinesse. And yit to their seeming, God is wel
payd with them, as who should say, he were an Idol, or a little babe,
as I sayd afore. Wee see then that none of all those hipocrits that
are so puffed vp with presumption, can haue any peace with God. But
forasmuch as they fetch such windlasses and looke not at God, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skewe,
and though they make countenaunce of approching vnto God,
yit their offring themselues vntoo him is it not with si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>glenesse and
substanciall soundenesse of hart: they do but beguile them selues with
their fond flatterings. Also there are a sort of these scoffers, which
doo but nod their heads when men speake too them of their saluation,
saying, it is ynough, if wee may giue but one good sigh, but let vs not
ceasse in the meane whyle too make frolicke chere, for what a thing
were it too passe all the tyme of our life in such dumpishnesse? That
would doo vs no good, &amp; therfore let vs play the good fellowes. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they fall to vnthriftinesse, some after one fashion, &amp; some after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
They haue a thousand wayes too destruction, and all confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
themselues ageinst God as much as is possible. Therefore for
bycause there haue alwayes bin so many, yea and to many, that bring
their owne consciences a fleepe: S. Paule in this place (lyke as also

that when wee come vntoo God, and must present our selues before his
Maiestie, wee bee sure that he will pitie vs, and not lay our sinnes to
our chage, but receyue vs as his owne children. Then if we intend to
enoye this spirituall peace, which passeth all the goods of the world:
let vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is, first too knowe that wee bee damned and forlorne, and that there
is no hope of remedie for vs, wherby too get out of the pit of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
agein, except wee bee recouered by meanes of our Lord Iesus
Christ. When wee bee so bereft of all vntoward selftrust in our own
deserts, and knowe that wee bee emptie and starke naked: let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
as poore beggers vntoo God: that is the thing that is requisite
for the atteynment of trew peace. And by the way also let vs not

sleepe in this world: bnt let vs vnderstand, that forasmuch as wee
haue no certeyne tyme (appoynted vs,) it is our duetye to summon our
selues euening and morning before God, and too examine our sinnes
throughly, and too bee both sorie and ashamed of them. When wee
haue once learned too make warre thus ageinst our owne vyces, and
too plye it throughly without Hipocrisie and counterfetting: then are
wee in the hygh way too the peace which our Lord Iesus Christ dooth
publish and preache vntoo vs euery day by the Gospell. And that is
the very cause why S. Paule sayeth expresly, that by him wee haue
enterance in vntoo the father. As if he should say, that no vnbeleeuers,
no heathenish worldlinges, no mockers of God, no dullardes which
thinke not of their euerlasting saluation, can by any meanes taste of
what valew the peace is, which wee obteyne by the Gospell, or (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue)
how precious and amyable it is. And why? For they put too
many scarfes before their faces, too keepe them from beyng abashed
at Gods Iustice, and from beyng striken with terrour of their sinnes.
Too bee shorte, they make themselues wilfully drunken, that they
myght haue a senslesse conscience, and they bere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ue themselues of all
vnderstanding, as though they were brute beastes. But when wee
consider that all our welfare consisteth in beyng able too haue all our
recourse vntoo God, and that our comming too him is certeine also,
yea and that the way is open for vs too go thither familiarly: surely
then will wee forget all other things, and long too bee made partta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of our Lord Iesus Christ, and too bee vnited intoo his body, too
the ende that God may receyue vs, and wee call vppon him with full
trust in our necessitie, and settle our selues vppon the loue that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vs, not doubting but that whatsoeuer is offered vs in the Gospell,
is all one as if God vttered his hart among vs.</p>
               <p>Now S. Paule hauing spoken of the preaching of the Gospell,
addeth purposely, <hi>In one Spirit.</hi> He had sayd afore, that wee bee all
knit toogither in the flesh of our Lord Iesus Christ, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that
he tooke our nature vpon him, &amp; by that meanes abolished and tooke
away the cursednesse that was in Adam. Neuerthelesse, the dooing
therof in the person of the sonne of God were not ynough, if the
Gospell wer not as a meane to him. Now therfore for a third poynt,
S. Paule addeth, that wee must communicate all of one spirit. For
although the Gospell bee preached, yit are there manie stubborne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and others so be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>narled in this world, that they thinke no more


<pb facs="tcp:23289:117"/>
of the heauenly lyfe, than doggs and Swyne doo. Othersome agein
are so saped in their hipocrisie, that although God doo call vs all and
allure vs sweetly too him in the person of his sonne, the number of
them that come vntoo God is verye small. For this cause S. Paule
sayth, that wee must haue Gods spirit. For it is certein, that by nature
wee bee variable, and not only euery one of vs will needs haue his
opinion by himselfe, but also wee change euery minute of an houre, by
meanes whereof, wee bee so farre of from beeing all of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
that none of vs abydeth setled in his opinion, from morning to
nyght, except he bee gouerned of God. It standeth vs then on hand,
when wee heare the Gospell preached, too haue Gods spirit to guyde
and gouerne vs, soo as wee may throughly imbrace our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and by him haue accesse too the father. Now therfore wee
must beare in mynd, first that when our Lord Iesus Christ exhorteth
vs by his ministers (according also as S. Paule sayeth in the second
too the Corinthians:) wee ought too bee well dispozed too come vnto
him,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 4.</note> yea and to runne vntoo him, euen with inforcing our selues aboue
all power of man. For (when wee haue doone what wee can) yit
shall wee haue none accesse vntoo him, but all our indeuer shall rather
bee a retyring backe, than a going foreward, vnlesse his spirit guyde
vs. So much the more then doth it stand vs on hand too pray God too
touch vs with his holy spirit, &amp; to cause him to make vs way vnto him,
as is sayd in the eyght to the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15.</note> and as we haue seene also lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
too the Galathians. For there S. Paule putteth a difference
betwixt Gods children,<note place="margin">Gala. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spirit of adoption, wherby wee crye, Abba father. Wee should not
knowe him of our selnes (sayeth he) bycause there is nothing in vs
but infirmitie: and it were too great a rashnesse in vs, too call God
our father. But when God hath once sealed the truth of his Gospell
in vs by his holie spirit, and inlyghtened vs inwardly, so as wee know
it is he that speaketh: and thertoo hath assured vs of his goodnesse
and mercie: then may wee freely and with open mouth crye out, that
he is our father. And soo yee see in effect what wee haue too beare in
mynd, too the intent that none of vs trust too his owne brayne, when
the Gospell is preached vnto him, but that in cosideration of the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and weaknesse that is in vs, wee suffer our selues too bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Gods spirit, which is the chefe kye wherby the gate of paradise
is opened vnto vs. And for that cause also is it sayd, that wee must be
besprinckled with the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </note> as S. Peter ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23289:117"/>
it in his first Epistle. For the same cause also the Apostle in the
Epistle to the Hebrewes sayth,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. d. 14.</note> that Iesus Christ was offred vp in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
meaning that his sacrifyze wherby he purchaced vs ryghtuousnes,
should still be as a vayne thing to vs, if the holie Ghost wrought not in
it by his powre. And S. Paul going forward with the matter that hath
bin declared hertofore, addeth also, that <hi>as vvell they that vvere farre
of, as they that vvere neere hand, had heard the sayd message,</hi> &amp; that
the same is set afore vs also at this day, to the end we myght bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it more and more. And (as I haue sayd alredy) by those that
were neere, he meaneth the Iewes who had had some familiaritie
with God theretoofore, bycause he had acquaynted himselfe with
them, by giuing them his Lawe, telling them that he receyued theyr
linage too be the protector thereof. Howbeeit, that was not too knit
them throughly vntoo him, till he had pardoned their sinnes, which
was doone by the meanes of Iesus Christ. For the Lawe could yeeld
them nothing but terrour and anguish of mynd, &amp; curse them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and sink them downe too the bottom of hell, as S. Paule sayeth in
the third too the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2. Cor. 3. b. 7.</note> and specially in the third Chapter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle too the Corinthians. Therfore it was requisite that the
Gospell should bee added thereuntoo. Now it is certein that Dauid &amp;
the other holy Prophetes, and lykewyse all the kings and the faythfull
that liued vnder the old Testament, had not the Gospel so manifestly as
we haue: but yit in very substance God declared vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he of his
owne free goodnesse receyued them too mercie, for the redeemers sake
in whom they trusted. If the Lawe bee separated from the Gospell,
it not only profiteth them not at all which rest vppon it: but also ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
too beate them downe, and too thunder vpon them, and too shewe
them how dreadfull Gods maiestie is. It is in the Gospell then that
wee haue peace: and therefore it stoode the Iewes in hand too bee
made partakers of that doctrine. And as for vs that come of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles,
wee ought (as I sayd this morning) too acknowledge so much
the better, the dubble recognisance wherin wee stand bound vnto God,
for that he hath voutsafed too make vs fellowes (with his peculiar
people,) vs (I say) that were as things borne out of tyme, and too put
vs in the companie of those whom he had chozen and adopted afore, in
such wyse as the recordes of the Prophets are now fulfilled, wherin it
is sayd,<note place="margin">Esay. 24. c. 15.</note> yee Gentyles and Nations, glorifye yee God with his owne
people: wherby the holie Ghost foreshewed that there should be such

a melodie, that all men should sing Gods prayses, euen as well the
Gentyles as the Iewes, when they were once knit toogither, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from out of the scattering wherin all of vs are, as is sayd alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and as wee haue seene afore.</p>
               <p>Wee see then wherat S. Paule amed, in saying that the Gospell
was preached too all men, as well them that were farre of, as them
that were neere.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 15.</note> And that is it which he treateth of in the tenth too
the Romans. For there he sheweth that wee should euer bee scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and neuer resolued of our fayth, if wee knew not that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospel proceeded of Gods authoritie, &amp; of his vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ordinance. It is not for men (sayeth he) too put foorth them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elues,
except God send them. And God hath begunne too teache the worlde
at all tymes heeretofore,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. c. 20.</note> though not by preaching or wryting, yit by
the onely sight of the world it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

though God haue voutsafed at this time too extend his grace too all
Nations, by making them too knowe that he would bee their father.
Now then, lyke as on the one side, it stoode the Iewes on hand too
knowe howe great neede they had too bee reconcyled too God by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and not too bee deceyued by trusting too theyr birthryght,
or too their Circumcision, or too any of all these shadowes of the Law,
but that it behoued them too flee too the onely meanes that I haue trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of, namely, that God receyued them too mercy, for the eternall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyzes
sake which Iesus Christ offered: so let vs on our syde learne
too magnify Gods goodnesse, seeyng he hath voutsafed too cast vs too
bee of his houshold and Church, notwithstanding that wee were cut of
and banished from it before. And therefore let vs looke too our selues,
that wee let not this benefite vanish away, ne be depryued of it through
our owne vnthankfulnesse. For what excuce will there bee for vs, if
when God calleth vs too heauen in the person of his onely sonne, so as
Iesus Christ telleth vs, that it is he himselfe which commeth too seeke
vs, as oft as it is tolde vs, that God will be mercifull to vs for his sake:
wee runne not apace vntoo him, both hot in zeale, and earnest in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
too shewe howe wee knowe that all our welfare, ioye, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and glory, consist in beyng ioyned too our God? which cannot
bee but through his free goodnesse. Agein, when wee refuze too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue

that God hath bin so kynd vntoo vs, as too bee at one with vs in the

but that wee may bee quickened truely by the grace which God
offereth vs dayly.</p>
               <p>And for that cause Saint Paule concludeth, that they which are
so touched with Gods spirit, to obey the Gospell simply and substanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<hi>are no more straungers, but rather fellovvcit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zens vvith the
Sayncts, and Gods houshold folk.</hi> And this tendeth still too the end
that I haue noted afore: that is too wit, that Gods name should bee
glorified as it deserueth, and that wee should not step lyghtly too him
as wee bee woont too doo. For wee thinke too discharge our selues
with one woord, by saying that Iesus Christ is our redeemer. But
let vs alwayes call to remembrance what wee haue bin, and in what
taking we were, til Iesus Christ drew vs out of the dungeons of death.
For the worde <hi>straungers,</hi> importeth that which wee haue seene heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toofore:
namely that before the Gospell was preached, the Gentyles
were without hope of saluation, cut of from Gods fauour, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
without God in the world: insomuch that although they liued
heere, although they were fed and susteyned by the good thinges that
God gaue them, although they inioyed the lyght of the sunne: yit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
they were without God. And at the same poynt are all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers.
So then, S. Paules rehercing what our redemption was
when Iesus Christ came too find vs, &amp; reached vs his hand to guide vs
too God his father, is too the end that wee should learne to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> yeeld hym
the whole prayse of our saluation. Heeruppon he sayeth, that wee bee
citizens of heauen, companions with the Angelles of Paradise, and
fellowes with the holy kings and Prophets. When there is any talke
of the Prophetes and Apostles, or of any of the Saynctes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
wee haue them in admiration, and good reason wee should so: but
in the meane whyle wee regard not wherfore the holy Ghoste setteth
them before vs. The Papistes make Idolles of them, and (too theyr
seeming) they haue honored S. Paule and S. Peter well, when they
haue decked them with Gods fethers. But contrarywyse it is sayd

                  </gap>ere, that when God setteth foorth the grace that he gaue vntoo them,
it is too the ende that wee shoulde bethinke vs of the benefite that he


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23289:119"/>
bestoweth vppon vs, in that he mustereth vs in their band. According
wherunto the Apostle in the<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. a. 1.</note> .xii. to the Hebrewes, sayth, that they might
to be vnto vs as a great &amp; thicke cloud of witnesses, that we myght fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
their example the more cherefully, and walke on in the way that
they shewe vs. Agein, when God hath made vs too perceyue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
good which he doth vs, in matching vs with the Prophetes,
Apostles, Martyrs, and all the faythfull, let vs go yit further, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider)
that he hath made vs fellowcitizens with the Angelles of heauen.
A man would take great labour for a citizenship, Freedenizonship, or
Burgesship of this world, and yit notwithstanding they be but incoms
of this lyfe: And what is this lyfe of ours? A flyghtfull shadow which
fleeteth away out of hand. Behold, God calleth vs, not only to soiorne
in his Church as straungers, but also too assure vs that he admitteth
and accepteth vs for his children, so as wee may with trew trust, and
as it were with one mouth boldly call vppon him as our father, and
keepe one tune and melodie with all the Saints. That therfore is the
thing which we haue to remember vpon this streyne: which order the
Apostle vseth also in the end of the Epistle too the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Hebr. 12. c. 18.</note> saying,
that we be no more vnder the law, which could do nothing but fray vs,
bycause there was nothing too bee heard there, but thunderings, and
lyghteninges, which were terrible signes of Gods anger. But wee
(sayeth he) are come too mount Syon, where wee heare the sweete
voyce of God our father, who matcheth vs with his holy spirites, with
his Angelles, and with the soules of his faythfull ones, so as wee bee
now of their crew, and may speake vntoo God as it were all with one
mouth, bycause wee haue one common head. This is in effect, the
thing that wee must beare in mynd. And although wee inioy it not as
yit: yit notwithstanding wee bee sure, that by the meanes of fayth wee
may walke through this present lyfe as straungers too the world, and
that God will not fayle too auow vs for his children and heyres: and
that although wee bee yit wrapped heere in many vyces and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yit notwithstanding, all the Saincts of Paradyse doo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
vs for their brethren, and imbrace vs for our Lorde Iesus
Christes sake.</p>
               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the Maiestie of our good
God, with acknowledgment of our faults, praying him too make vs so
to feele them, as we may mislike them more &amp; more, &amp; on the other side

our welfare and saluation: and that the same may plucke vs backe

continually vnto him, is much more for vs than if wee were but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of some Citie of his. Wee see then, that bicause men doo neuer
sufficiently esteeme the spirituall good that wee receyue by our Lord
Iesus Christ: S. Paul ment to shew here, how it is good reason that
we should make more account of the adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby God hath so ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
vs toogither by meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ, that we may
now be familiarly conuersant with him by hope: than by al the whole
world.</p>
               <p>And he addeth another similitude, which is, <hi>that we be builded to be
the temple of God.</hi> Sometymes the holy Scripture sayth, that euery
faithful man is the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, bycause he dwelleth in vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit. But when it is spoken vniuersally of the whole Churche,
then are wee as lyuely stones, and the building is so bound and clozed
toogither, that euery of vs serueth too the perfectting therof. Then is
not the one contrarie too the other. For euery faythfull bodye alone
is the Temple of God, bycause he ought too bee giuen too all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
by the woorking of the holie Ghost, and (as I sayd afore) God
abydeth in vs. Howbeeit for asmuch as wee ought not too bee sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
asunder, but rather to bee knit toogither in vnitie by the bond of
fayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it agreeth very well also, that wee should be named stones, and
that lyke as a building is made of manye stones, wherof there is none
but it serueth too some purpose: so wee should suffer our selues too bee
ioyned too our Lord Iesus Christ by beleef of the Gospell, that God
may dwell in vs, and bee there purely woorshipped, and wee bee fully
assured, that whensoeuer wee call vppon him, wee shall alwayes fynd
him at hand too heare vs, and that when wee bee gathered toogither
in his name, wee shall euermore haue him among vs. That is the
thing which S. Paule treateth of heere, when he sayeth, that they
which had bin heathen men, and cut of from all hope of saluation, were
builded vp by the Gospell to bee made a Temple for God.</p>
               <p>Now we see better than afore, how God will take vs for his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
that is too wit, if wee bee taught purely by the doctrine of the
Gospell, that God auoweth vs for his Temples, that he is contented


<pb facs="tcp:23289:121"/>
too bee worshipped of vs, and that he taketh our seruis in good worth.
Therfore vntill such tyme as wee haue the doctrine of the Gospell too
giue vs enterance too that excellent benefyte which is vtterly vnesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
wee cannot bee called nother Citizens of heauen, nor children
of God, nor belongers too his household. And it is added, as well too
make vs percey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e what reuerence the Gospell deserueth, as also too
shewe vs that wee neede not to make farre iourneis too seeke it. For
God offereth vs the prerogatiue of entring into his house, the doore is
set open for vs, at least wyse if wee receyue the promises that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
Wee neede not too go about heauen nor earth: God telleth vs
and assureth vs, that hee hathe adopted vs, too the intent wee should
leane all wholly vnto him. And so ye see how wee may bee familiar
with him, and he bee ioyned vnto vs.</p>
               <p>But therwithall hee sheweth also where wee should seeke for his
woord. For faythlesse men are so spytefull, that they seeke all maner
of krinks too shift themselues from God. And surely wee see, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
make as though they were willing too serue God, so it myght bee
apparant too them, that it is he which speaketh: but therwithall they
doubt whether the Lawe came of him or no, and whether the Gospell
bee his truth or no. Lo how men would shake of Gods yoke too the
vttermost of their power, by their shrinking aside, and by their starting
holes and shifting. They make protestation with full mouth, that their
intent is too humble themselues vnder him: and yit they knowe not,
nother can they discerne which is his woord. And why is that? Euen
bycause of their malice and vnthankfulnesse. S. Paule therefore too
barre all such tryfling excuces, telleth vs that inasmuch as God hath
spoken by Moyses and his Prophets, and finally by his Apostles, wee
ought too assure our selues, that al that euer is couteyued in the Lawe,
and in the Gospel, is the truthe it self, and that we ought not bee afrayd
too bee be guyled or deceyued. Wee shall heare manie Replyes, for
euery man imagineth whatsoeuer commeth in his fancie. But God
authorized his woord sufficiently, when he published his Law. Agein,
he gaue sufficient authoritie too his Prophets: and finally his Gospel
was ratified and sealed with miracles ynow. Therfore it is not for
vs too say, wee knowe not whether it bee Gods woord or no: For it is
in our mouth, it is neere at hand to vs, insomuch that God hathe vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to feed vs lyke littel babes with it, by sending vs mortall men to
speake it too vs face to face. So then let vs learne first of all, not to sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:23289:121"/>
in the ayre, when the receyuing of Gods woord commeth in question.
Let vs bee contented that he hath giuen vs sufficient record of his wil
by his Prophets and Apostles (and so shall wee yeeld him obedience)
though it hath pleased him too vse such instrumentes of his holy spirit:
for our fayth cannot bee without humilitie, and God taketh a tryall
thereof, in making mortall men too bee the meanes wherby he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth
himselfe vntoo vs. Take it therefore for a principale, that
it must not greeue vs though God appeere not in visible shape, or
though he send vs not his Angells from heauen. For it ought too suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyze
vs, that wee knowe that the Prophetes and Apostles are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
witnesses, chozen and ordeyned too bring vs the message of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
And by the waye Saint Paule sheweth, that there is very
good agreement betweene the Lawe, the Prophetes, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
In deede wee haue seene heretofore, that the vse of the ceremonies
is at an ende: but yit for all that, the substance of them continueth still.
And when God caused the Gospell too bee preached openly too the
woorld, it was not for that he was vnconstant, nor for that he intended
too teache men after a new and straunge fashion, wherwith the Lawe
was nothing acquaynted: for the Lawe and the Prophetes bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
continually too our Lord Iesus Christ. And therby also are wee
put in mynd, too further our selues by all the things that are conteyned
in Moyses and in the rest of the Prophetes. For now adayes there
are some fantasticall folk, which think that for all doctrine, wee ought
too haue no more but the new Testament, and that all the rest is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.
It is trew indeede,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. a. 3.</note> that al perfection of wisdome is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conteyned in the Gospell: but yit dooth it not therfore followe, that
wee ought not too bee edifyed by the Lawe and the Prophetes: for
wee see that the Apostles themselues confirmed their doctrine by their
testimonies. And heere when S. Paule sayeth, that wee must bee
builded vppon their foundation, he sheweth sufficiently, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
things our Lord betooke vntoo them in old tyme, is profitable for
vs at this day, and wee must practize it, and put it in vre. Lykewyse
S.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. b. 12.</note> Peter sayeth, that they serued not only for their owne tyme, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for ours. Trew it is, that they gaue some tast of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and of the good things that are imparted to vs by his meanes:
but yit it is wee that are come too the fulnesse of the tyme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as sayeth
S.<note place="margin">Gala. 4. a. 4.</note> Paule in another place. And the same is also a verifying of S.
Peters saying, that is too wit, that the doctrine of the Prophetes


<pb facs="tcp:23289:122"/>
poynteth at vs, and wee haue more ful fruition and greater fruite of it,
than they that heard it spoken. For wee haue so great a lyght in Iesus
Christ, that the things which were then darke, are now manifestly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and knowen vntoo vs. So then, let vs studie the Lawe and the
Prophetes, knowing wel that they leade vs to our Lord Iesus Christ.
For he is the marke that is set before vs, and wherat wee leuell at this
day,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. a. 4.</note> accordingly as it is said, that Iesus Christ is the end of the Law,
and also the patterne that Moyses sawe on the mountain. It is sayd,
that the Lawe and the Prophetes beare witnesse of him,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. g. 45.</note> and euen our
Lord Iesus Christ himselfe vpbraydeth the Iewes, (telling them)
that forasmuch as they boasted of the Lawe, they were so much the
more blame woorthie and lesse too bee excuzed afore God, and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
was so much the more heynous and vnreasonable, bycause they
reiected him, to whom the Lawe sendeth vs, and too whom the Lawe
would holde vs backe.</p>
               <p>So then, hereuppon wee haue too gather, that too profite well in
the holy scripture, wee must alwayes resort to our Lord Iesus Christ,
and cast our eyes vppon him, without turning away thence at any
time. Yee shall see a number of folk that Martir themselues excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in reading the holy scriptures, they doo nothing else but turne
ouer the leaues of it: and yit at the end of halfe a score yeares, they are
as wel seene in it, as if they had neuer read line of it. And why? By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they doo but roue vp &amp; downe, &amp; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e not at any certeyn end, yea
and euen in worldly learning, yee shall see a great sort that take paine
ynough, and yit all is to no purpose, bycause they kepe nother order
nor measure, nor doo aught else then make a raking toogither on all
sides. By meanes wherof they bee euer new too seeke, and can neuer
bring any thing too perfection, and although they haue gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a number of sentences of al sorts, yit is there no hold at all in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Euen so is it with them that labour in reading the holy scripture, and
know not which is the poynt that they ought to rest vpon:<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. a. 3.</note> namely how
it is our Lord Iesus Christ. For lyke as it is sayd that all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

the thing which wee haue too gather vppon those words of S. Paule,
is, that the Prophets &amp; Apostles were chozen and ordeined to bring vs
to God, by meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ: who is his very image,
and therefore that the onely thing wheron we must settle all our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

               <p>And on the contrary part alos, let vs conclude, that all such as giue
themselues too vayne curiosities, and will needes bee wyser than God
gyues them leaue too bee, must abyde still in confuzion, and in steed of
goyng foreward, go more and more backeward, whereof wee see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  </gap>fore, and it standeth vs in hand too profit our
selues by them. For what is the cause of all the corruptions in the

abundance of vngodlynesse, &amp; of the great store of superstitions which
raygne euery where, but for that men are ticklish in their owne foolish

of Iesus Christ, as it is set downe in the Gospell? So much
the more therefore ought wee too beare well in mynd the thing that is
tolde vs heere: which is, that wee must alwayes set our Lord Iesus
Christ before our eyes, and in our sight, if wee purpose too haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
resting stocke in the holy scripture, and too further our selues
in it. And heerewithall wee see also, that we neede not too seeke heere

               <p>Now had this text bin well vnderstoode, surely the wretched world
should not bee in such disorder, as wee see it is. For what is the cause

                  </gap> men haue deuized so manie wayes of saluation, but for that they


<pb facs="tcp:23289:123"/>
haue not knowen the power of our Lord Iesus Christ, as it is shewed
vs heere? And in good sooth let a man looke vppon all the inuentions
of the Papistes, and he shall fynd that there is no end of their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse:
and yit in the meane whyle they haue as good as forgotten
Iesus Christ, or rather buried him in such sort, as they haue had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of him. And was it not a corrupting and falsifying of Gods

vppon their decrees, vppon the things that men haue inuented

that all perfection is too bee had there. For as for the things that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

they: yea and they bee not ashamed too say, that those things are but
as an Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, and that Iesus Christ forbare too speake of the things
that were more hygh and excellent, so as the holy scripture is but as
a Catechisme for little children, and that too atteyne too the age of
perfection, wee must haue holy Councels, wherin God reueleth the
mystiries that were vnknowen afore. Now seing that the diuell hath
so vtterly bewitched and blynded them, that they haue labored too
thrust Gods woord vnder foote, too the end wee should stray and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heere and there without any good direction: wee haue so much
the more cause too beare in mynde the thing that S. Paule telleth vs
heere, which is, that wee must mislyke whatsoeuer is added too the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture, assuring our selues that God hath giuen such charge too
his Prophetes and Apostles, as he forgat not any thing that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
or expedient for our saluation: and that if wee desyre too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
in his schoole, we must not puttoo any morsels or coluppes of our
owne, nor fall too borrowing of things heere and there, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
too that pure doctrine, but must vtterly mislyke all such dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
yea and abhorre all maner of patching, as leuen that sowreth, and
marreth the whole batch of dowe, bycause God condemneth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men take vppon them too adde vntoo the Lawe and the Gospell,
from the which wee must not in any wyse turne away: for it is not
without cause sayd:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. a. 5. &amp;. 8. c. 12.</note> This is the way, walke in it. And wheras Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ sayeth, he is the way, and the lyght of the world: it is too


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23289:123"/>
the end that wee should abyde in him, without swaruing asyde in any
wyse, eyther too the ryght hand or too the left. Another thing which
wee haue further too consider vppon this text, where Gods doctrine is
spoken of, and the Prophetes and Apostles are named the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of it, is this: that wee knowing what their office is, should not
consent too bee taught by such as God neuer made priuie of his wyll,
and whom he disauoweth, when they go about too adde any one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illable
too the things which he will haue too bee noted and hild without geyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying.
Trew it is, that the Church cannot indure without the dayly
preaching of the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles in it:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. b. 10.</note> and that
all they which are ordeyned too teache, are called Masons, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(and builders) of Gods house. Therefore in that they bee buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Churche, they bee all one with the Prophets and Apostles.
Yit notwithstanding, it followeth not therefore that they may take
what they list of the Lawe, or take libertie too preache their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions:
but they must drawe (their matter) out of the pure fountaine
that is offered vs in the holy Scripture, that wee may bee hilde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
too the simplicitie of the Lawe and the Gospell, and not bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynted
with any wandering opinions in sted of the obedience of fayth,
which contenteth it selfe with the meane that God hath set. Agein,
wheras S.<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

head corner stone: it is not ment, that it is lawful too mingle any thing
with Iesus Christ, as though he shoulde but make some one peece of
the buylding, and the rest bee supplyed by others: but it serues too
shewe that wee must bee buylded vppon him, according as Saint
Paule exhorteth vs in the thirde Chapter of the first Epistle too the
Corinthians, where he sayeth, that no man can lay any other foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than that which is layd already, that is too wit, than Iesus Christ.
Heereby S. Paule dooeth vs too vnderstand, that men cannot set forth
any thing wheron too ground and settle their saluation: there is (sayth
he) none other foundation but Iesus Christ. Agein, wee know his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
extendeth euery where: and therefore all of vs from the most
too the least must yeeld vntoo him, and not forsake the great number
of benefytes which he offereth vs, and which wee possesse by his
meanes.</p>
               <p>But yit shall wee neuer vnderstand how Iesus Christ is our only
foundation,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the forealleged text, where S. Paule sayeth, that he was giuen vs too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:124"/>
bee our wisdome. And not only that, but also he addeth further, that
he was giuen vs too be our rightuousenesse, redemption, and holinesse.
As if he should say, that Iesus Christ is our wisdome, wheruntoo wee
mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t wholy hold our selues, bycause wee may there see, that he is the
welspring of all welfare, &amp; hath in him whatsoeuer is requisite to our
saluation. Then if we once know to what end Iesus Christ was giuen,
and the infinite benefites wherof he will make vs partakers: wee will
forsake all other foode: that is to say, all that euer man setteth afore vs,
shalbee too vs but as vanitie, yea and euen as dung and filth, bycause
wee shalbee fully satisfied with our Lord Iesus Christ. Now then,
that wee may conceyue how he is the foundation of the Church, and
that wee ought too bee settled vppon him: let vs marke that it is by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath reueled himself fully vntoo vs by his only sonne, and
put all thinges intoo his hand which are requisite too our saluation, or
worthie to be desired, to the end that wee myght drawe of his fulnesse,
as is sayd of him in the first Chapter of S. Iohn. And this in effect is
the maner how wee ought too put this text in vre, where it is sayd, that
our Lord Iesus Christ is in such wyse the cheef stone, that he beareth
vp all the whole (building) in the corner: and we knowe that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
weyght of a building lyeth vpon the corner.</p>
               <p>But by the way, let vs marke also, that S. Paule ment not too set
Christ alone in a rowe by himself, and to couch other stones with him,
that should haue maystership and authoritie as well as he: but simply
too shew, that there is no more diuersitie betweene the Lawe and the
Gospell, as touching the substance of them, but that our Lord Iesus
Christ is the end of all, and that wee bee so ioyned and knit togither by
his meanes, that all of vs are made the Temple of God, and belong
by vnitie of fayth too the spirituall building, wherin God intendeth
too dwell. Yit notwithstanding, if our fayth rest not wholy vppon our
Lord Iesus Christ, it is certeyne, that wee cannot bee builded vppon
this foundation. For whereas the Papistes inuent Patrones and
Aduocates too get them fauour at Gods hand, and heape vp a number
of meanes too merit withall: it is all one as if they made themselues
straungers too Iesus Christ. Now whosoeuer turneth away from
him, and it bee but a finger bredth, must needes fall intoo destruction.
for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is the propertie of a foundation too beare vp the whole building.
Now if the buildig bee too wyde, and ouerhang it, it must needes fall
downe. Euen so goeth it with vs. If wee bee not builded vppon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:23289:124"/>
Christ, so as our fayth bee lined and leueled vntoo him, and wee
sticke too him without adding of one thing or other: he must needes
disauow vs for any of his, and cast vs quyte away. And in good fayth,
the Papists &amp; their lyke doo well be wray their greate vnthankfulnes,
by their wandring here and there, and by their adding of new meanes
at their owne pleasure. This wrong and outrage which they doo too
our Lord Iesus Christ, deserue wel that we should tumble them downe
and cut them quite off from Gods Church. Therfore if wee mynd too
inioy the benefite that S. Paule setteth foorth to vs heere, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that our fayth bee so framed too the Lawe and the Gospell, as too
reiect whatsoeuer thinges man shall haue inuented, assuring our selues
that it is the next way too drawe vs too destruction, and that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee grounded vppon Iesus Christ too stand fast vpon him for euer,
vnlesse wee addmit all the thinges that are spoken and witnessed of him
in the Lawe and the Gospell, without making of it Lawfull for men
too adde any thing at all too it. Yee see then in effect, that the thing
which wee bee warned of in these woordes of S. Paule, is, that wee
belong not too our Lord Iesus Christ, ne can bee of Gods Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be by following the pure doctrine of the Lawe and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and by forsaking (as yee would say) all the filth and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that men haue deuyzed by their owne dreames and dotages, how
fayre colour of wisdome soeuer they beare. For they will fynd store
ynough of fyne pedlery, too make folke beleeue that their adding of so
many gewgawes, is not without cause. But howsoeuer they fare, if
wee couet too bee ioyned and vnited too Iesus Christ, we must so abyde
in him, as too make none account of any other thing.</p>
               <p>And therwithall wee see also, that too bee taken for Gods children,
wee must giue our wynds too trew concord. For S. Paule setteth
downe bothe twayne of them heere: and in verye deede, they be things
inseparable, that Christians being taught Gods word purely, should
with one hart and one mynd receiue the things that are so set forth vnto
them, and haue brotherly concord among them, too speake as it were
with one mouth, and too make one pure and simple confession. Then
lyke as hithertoo wee haue seene that we must be builded vppon Gods
pure woord alone: so it is shewed vs heere, that wee must not euery of
vs bee bent too his owne opinion, but frame our selues too the vnitie
of fayth, accordingly as S. Paule speaketh therof in the third too the
Philippians, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ye intend too bee perfect, ame yee all at one


<pb facs="tcp:23289:125"/>
mark, and be yee knit truly toogither in one. For wee know how am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
tickleth vs continually, and euery man would fayne haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
by himself, too set out his owne estimation withall. For the very
cause wherof came al the heresies that euer were, is this pryde so depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rooted in mennes harts, that wheras all of vs ought too bee lerners,
euery of vs will needs bee teachers. And in verye deede he that is to
teach other folks, must not set foorth any thing of his owne, but purely
impart vntoo them the things that he hath learned of our Lord Iesus
Christ. And soo bycause men are so froward, that they couet alwayes
too knowe more than is lawfull for them: therefore they misbehaue
them selues, and euery man would keepe a schoole, too make a showe
of hym selfe. But it is said (heere) that in stead of this dealyng, wee
must bee knyt toogither, that wee may speake all as it were with one
mouth, and confesse that wee haue but one God, and one Father, by
shewing our selues too haue no mo maysters, but onely Iesus Christe.
Neuerthelesse, it is true that such a concord would not bee ynough: but
I haue told you already, at what ende wee must begynne: that is too
wit, at the pure instruction which wee receyue of the Prophetes and
Apostles. The Papistes brag too too much of theyr agreement: and
so may they do ful wel, for the diuel possesseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such wise, that they
be wholly sotted in it. In deede there is ianglyng &amp; iarryng ynough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they snatch one at another lyke Curdogs, when they bee in
theyr own Synagogues: but yit they sticke toogither lyke Burres, in
the mayntenance of all vngodlynesse. We see their diuelish madnesse &amp;
wilful stubbornnes when they reason for the mayntenance of their own
lies ageinst gods truth. But S. Paul sheweth vs after what maner we
ought to agree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely not in dreames &amp; dotages, nor in the things that
men haue put foorth of their own store: but in the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
&amp; Apostles. Now seing that the Papists haue banished the holy
scripture, &amp; although they make cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance to receyue it, doo neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
deface it, yea &amp; vtterly falsifie &amp; corrupt it by their own inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions:
therby we see they be farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their reckening, in that they vant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues with open mouth to bee Gods Church: for seeing they haue not
the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, they haue no marke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the
church at al. Although men were redie to receyue al things that are in
the holy scripture, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without geinsaying: yit if they fal to mingling of
their own fancies therwithall: Christianitie is therby alredy corrupted

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ded. Now, they not only intangle Gods truth with their own


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23289:125"/>
inuentions: but also vtterly ouerthrow al: in somuch that Gods seruice
is vtterly corrupted by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, poore soules are harried to &amp; fro, &amp; our Lord
Iesus Christ is robbed, so as they make but a fantastical co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of him,
&amp; attribute his offices to this man &amp; that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it were the dealing of
some pray or bootie. Forasmuch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we see the papists so malapert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; madly turne Gods word vpsyde downe after that fashion: we may
well conclude, that although they boast the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues neuer so much to bee
the Church, yit God disauoweth them, yea &amp; vtterly abhorreth them: &amp;
that if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> get him not out of that den of theeues, it is impossible for
him to be ioyned to our Lord Iesus Christ. Thus yee see that the thing
which we haue to beare in mynd, is, that to be ioyned to God by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his only sonne, &amp; to be companions with the Angels of heauen,
&amp; brethren of the Patriarks, holie kings, and Prophets, wee must be
banished out of the Hellish Sinagogs that are in the popedome, where
it is apparant that Antichrist reigneth, and that Iesus Christ is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
dispossessed of his right and souereintie. And veryly we see their
cursed presumption, in that they haue bin so bolde as too say that the
See of Rome is the foundation of the Churche. For they abuse these
woordes of our Lord Iesus Christ in the sixteenth Chapter of S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew:
Thou art Peter, and vpon this Stone will I buyld my Church.<note place="margin">Math. 16. c. 18.</note>
Now seeyng that Iesus Christ sayeth, that Peter shall bee buylded
vppon himselfe (that is too say, vppon Iesus Christ:) he meaneth not
too resigne his offyce eyther too him or too any other body: but therby
it appeereth, that among the Papists there hath not bin any reuerence
of the holy scripture, nor any desyre too bee taught, but that all was
one too them, so they myght set vp a tyrannye too oppresse the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of our Lord Iesus Christ, and too make cleane riddance of it, if
it were possible, and that they haue made no conscience of manifest
blasphemie, insomuch that euen little children ought too haue spit in
their faces, considering the grosse beastlinesse that is, and hath bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. And herein also it is too bee seene, howe the diuell hath
raigned in full darkenesse, that Gods woord was buryed, yea and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

a tyme, notwithstanding that it was their ordinary foode. So then,
let vs abhorre all those blasphemies, assuring our selues that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee grounded in but our Lord Iesus Christ, and that when wee bee
once faythfully instructed in him, wee neede not too borrow elsewhere,
bycause he hath brought vs whatso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:23289:126"/>
And it is not meete that wee should doo him so great dishonour, as too
seeke any supply one where or other: but that wee should hold our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
all wholly vntoo him. That therfore is the meaning of the things
that S. Paule speaketh heere.</p>

handfull of men (in comparison of them.) What, (say they) dooth
not Christendome extende through all Europe, Greece, and Affricke?
And yit see how these rascals that haue nother authoritie nor credit,
nor any thing else in them, will needes be counted the Chruch. Yee see
then that the Papists shake vs of with diuelish pride &amp; malapertnesse,
bycause they haue on their syde great pomp, and all manner of riches,
insomuch that if a man go intoo their temples, he is rauished at them,
as if he were in an earthly paradice. But al is not gold that glistereth.
And although their pompe bee able too bleare the eyes of poore ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
soules, whom we see too bee caryed away in deede with such
things: Yit are they all no better but abhomination before God.
And so S. Paule sheweth vs that wee must not spite the Papistes,
though they be very many in number, and greatly multiplyed: for they
bee but a head without a body, or rather but a bumbasted and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
body. Too bee short, that which the Papists terme their Church,
is a very monster. For it hath no head, bycause Iesus Christ hath
not preheminence ouer it, no nor any part or portion in it. Too the
end therefore that wee might knowe how wee should growe: it is sayd
vntoo vs, that wee must grow <hi>vntoo the Lord, and in Spirit,</hi> sayth S.
Paule. Heere he draweth vs backe from all worldly superstitions,
dooyng vs too vnderstand, that they bee but pelting trashe, yea and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dung before God, who abhorreth them.</p>
               <p>Therfore wee must growe in spirit. And verily wee see that the
shadowes of the Lawe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

it ought too assure vs so much the more. But forasmuch as wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
our selues very euill by it: we haue neede too bee incoraged,
as S. Paule also dooth in this text. When wee see the diuell stirre
vp his vnderlinges too execute all tyranny ageinst Gods children: let

it not shake our fayth. And specially if the faythfull indure paciently
al that can be, for the maynteynance of Gods truth which they knowe,
and that they doo also hold out too the end. Without swaruing: that
(as I sayd) ought not too bee lost. And for the same cause dooth S.
Paule in other places say,<note place="margin">Colos. 1. d. 24.</note> he suffereth for the welfare of the Church.
Not that he could purchace them forgiuenesse of sinnes, or any grace
by his death:<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b. 16.</note> but bycause the Gospell is Gods myghty power too the
welfare of all that beleeue, and the further that wee go forward in it,
the neerer it maketh vs too come vntoo God, and vntoo euerlasting
lyfe. S. Paule then suffred for the example of those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had taught

too them had bin in good earnest, seeing he spared not his owne blud

bothe before God and also before man, that he suffred wrongfully, for
executing his office, and finally for seruing God faythfully. Therfore
let vs not think it strange, that on the one syde he calleth himself priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and on the othersyde the Ambassadour or messenger of the Liuing
God, euen as representing his person and dignitie. And it is not for
nought that he addeth the name of Iesus Christ. For imprizonment
generally myght haue bred some euill opinion of him, bycause euill
dooers are punished with it by order of Iustis. But the cace putteth a

imprisonment and death. Now when wee see that for all this he ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not too go through stedfastly, and too ouercome all the assaults
that Satan and the wicked world were able too stir vp ageinst him:
surely wee haue the greater confirmation of the doctrine, which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
at this day too our vse.</p>
               <p>And therfore when wee bee told of Saint Paule, and of the great

needeth. For it is alwayes a more certayne ratifying of the doctrine,
too the end wee myght vnderstand how it is not of the doctrine of any
mortall wyght, but the doctrine of the liuing God, who also strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with inuincible constancie by his holie spirit. Now as this
is well spoken of the persons of Saint Paule: so must it also bee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
further. For God wissed and ordeyned, that the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
should suffer as well as hee. And it is sayd of Saint Peter,<note place="margin">

when he was growen old, he should bee girded after another fashion
than he had bin woont too bee, so as he should bee tyed in streyt bonds,
and bee led whither he would not, at leastwyse as in respect of fleshly
infirmitie, though he had a spirituall disposition of mynd to obey God.
We see then in effect, how Gods seruants suffered, not a two or three
of them, but so as there myght bee as it were a great and thicke cloud
of them, as the Apostle sayeth in the twelfth too the Hebrewes. Sith
it is so: let vs make our hand of such helpes. For it is certeyne, that
God ment too susteyne our feeblenesse, by adding such helpes too his
woord (which ought too bee of sufficient authoritie of it self,) too the
intent it should no more bee doubted of, nor called in question. Thus
yee see how the thing that wee haue too beare in mynd, is that the blud
of the Apostles and Martyrs that hath bin shed too confirme the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Gospell, is as good as a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred seales, yea as a whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of seales, too warrant vs all the thinges fully, which are conteyned
in the Gospell. Trew it is, that our fayth ought too bee grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the authoritie of the holy Ghost: and that although God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a Martyr, too shewe that the truth of the Gospell is firme and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine:
yit it ought too suffyze vs, that it is he which speaketh it. Agein,
wee haue seene heeretoofore, that the truth shall euer bee doubted of,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill the holy Ghost haue sealed it in our hartes. And for that cause is
he called our earnestpennye,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> d. 22.</note> bycause he insureth vs of the heritage


<pb facs="tcp:23289:129"/>
which wee hope for, according too the promise which hath bin pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
so deerely for vs with the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now for the last step, wee must come too the experience that wee
haue in these dayes. For the blud of Martirs is shed still at this day, &amp;
God could well let that the wicked should not runne so vpon the brydle
ageinst the faythfull: he could well chaunge all their mischeeuousnesse
and rebellion: and wheras they bee rauening wolues, he could make
them as sheepe and Lambes: surely he could doo so. But on the one
syde he ordeyneth Satan too driue them and stirre them vp too such
rage, and agein he giueth them licence and leaue too trubble the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
And why? Too the end that wee should knowe what the power of
his holy spirit is, when it pleaseth him too guyde and gouerne vs. For
(as I haue declared alredy) the weaknesse of men is such, that there
needeth but the falling of a leafe from a tree too make them quake, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne
wee knowe that death is horrible of it self. Therfore wee must
conclude, that God vttereth a wonderfull grace, when he strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his seruantes in such wyse, as they bee not dismayed with any
threateninges, nor at the syght of fyre, when the enemyes and tirantes
are not contented with single death, but adde thertoo the most tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
tormentes that can bee deuyzed. Now then when the Martyres
perseuer in such constancie, therin men perceyue that God hath put to
his hand. Wherfore when wee heare that they bee handled so cruelly
for Gods word, and that some, if they scape, are notwithstanding redye
too dye, and othersome knowing their death shall bee precious in the
eyes of the Lord, offer them selues in sacrifize with a cheerful corage:
let vs not suffer their blud too fall too the ground. (I say,) when wee
heare of all these things, let vs beware wee suffer not that thing too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
which God hath ordeyned for our edifying, and for the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of vs in our fayth. For although wee ought too bee (suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently)
instructed by the preaching (alone) yit must it needes be a great
strengthening too vs, when Gods word is not onely preached, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sealed after that fashion. Then is it not too bee called in question,
or too be disputed of, as an vncertayne matter: but they to whom God
hath graunted the grace, and are led so farre by his holy spirit, as too
suffer for his truth: are faythfull wittnesses that their blud serueth too
giue a full sealing vp too his word, too the intent that wee should bee
the better resolued of it. Thus yee see what wee haue to gather vppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this streyne. And although the enemies of the Gospell make a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23289:129"/>
and spit fire, and keepe a great coyle too deface all that
belongs too God: yit let not vs ceasse too gloryfie God alwayes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all the battels which are prepared by Satans pollicie ageinst
the faythful, are turned of God into Crownes and Garlands, &amp; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them to ouercome all things that seeme to make to their vndoing
and destruction. The thing then whiche wee haue yet further too
mark, is this in effect, that we must not bee thrust out of the way when
we see the wycked sorte, and the despyzers of God, and al worldlynges
scorne our simplicitie, at suche tyme as our brethren suffer persecution:
but must consyder that the pryzons where they be kept, &amp; the reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fires are of much more worthinesse and excellencie, than all the
seates where those Iudges sit, that are as Satans vnderlings or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
and as ranke murtherers: yea &amp; more excellent than al seats
of Kings and Princes, though they make neuer so much adoo of their
greatnesse.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon S. Paule addeth, <hi>you also haue heard the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
foorth of Gods grace which was committed too mee, as I haue
written briefly vnto you, according as he declared the mistery ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vntoo me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you may better vnderstand the knowledge which
I haue of the mistery of Iesus Christ.</hi> Here S. Paule intendeth
too proue, that he was ordeyned an Apostle, not as one that had thrust
in himselfe through rashenesse or folly, nor as one that had bin aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by fauour of men, nor as one that had light intoo it by haphazard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but as put in by Gods free goodnesse. And it is not here only that he
stryueth for the maintenaunce of his calling, that is too wit, to shewe
that he was an Apostle sent and allowed of God: but he standeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that poynt in many other places.<note place="margin">Gala 1. a. 1. &amp;. Titus. 1. a. 3.</note> It is trew, that he passed not for
his owne person: but the certeynty of the faythfull depended therupon.
When wee come too heare the Gospell, if wee bee not throughly
perswaded that he is sent of God: surely wee may well conceyue
some wandring opinion, but we shall neuer bee sure, nor haue any rest.
This then must go first: Namely, that such as teach vs bee allowed,
and that wee knowe them too bee imployed of God to our saluation,
and that they bee instruments of his holy Ghost. For otherwise a man
may say, what is he? for there is nothing in vs by nature, but vanitie
and leazing. And on the other side, were a man neuer so well learned
and sound, so as there were nothing in him but substantia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nesse and
soundnesse, yit should he not bee able too assure vs of the forgiuenesse


<pb facs="tcp:23289:130"/>
of our sinnes: it is too great and high a thing too warrant vs attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with God, and that he taketh vs intoo his fauour, wheras there
had bin nothing but deadly emnitie before. If the Angels of heauen
should say it with one mouth, they could not warrant it vs, except they
were authorized of God.</p>
               <p>So then let vs marke well, that S. Paules labouring so much too
shewe that he thrust not in hym selfe too bee an Apostle, but that he
was sent of God, and had that office at Gods hand, and that in all hys
dooyngs he attempted not any thing vppon presumption, or through
rashnesse, but according too our Lorde Iesus Christes choozyng of
hym, bycause it was his wyll too bee serued of hym after that maner:
is not causelesse. That therefore is the grounde that he goeth vppon
in this Text.</p>
               <p>Now he sayeth also, that the Ephesians ought too haue knowen
well the misterie or secret that had bin reueled vntoo him, namely too
the end they myght haue bin sure that he was ordeyned and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too deale foorth Gods grace, and too preach euerlasting saluation
of their soules, too such as had erst bin cut of and banished out of the
kingdome of heauen. And heere wee haue too marke first of all, that
too heare and too vnderstand the things that are preached too vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gospell, is not all that wee haue to doo: but that wee must
mount vp yit a little hygher: that is too wit, that God would haue vs
too bee certifyed of his good will by the record of men. For were it a

let vs marke, that the preaching of the Gospell and our common mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

nor a fancie, or inuention of man, but an ordinance of God, and

that God purpozed to humble the world, and too hold it (as yee would
say) brydled, too the end that wee should lerne too honour his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
notwithstanding that the reasons thereof bee vnknowen too vs,
and the meanes therof hid from vs. God could haue published the
Gospell immediatly vppon the creating of the world, or streight after
Adams fall: but he did put it off by the space almost of twoo thousand
yeeres: and afterwardes agein after the flud, although the world were
renewed agein, yit draue he it of agein. So then there passed a six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene

And when God choze him and all his linage, it was not yit the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
Neuerthelesse God tooke one man in his old age, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie

that foure hundred yeeres more were spent, the Law was published,
howbeit, that was but too Abrahams linage only. The Gentyles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

souerein dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God is extended ouer al the world. These then are
things that could not enter into our conceyt, as I said afore. Therefore
it is not without cause that S. Paule nameth that order of dealing, a
mysterie that had bin vnknowen to al ages, &amp; was reueled in his time.</p>
               <p>But first and formest wee must resolue a question that myght bee
put heere, bycause the Patriarkes were not vtterly ignorant what
should insew, and the prophets bare record of it. For when there is
any speaking, that the Gentyles should bee matched with the people
whom God had chozen and adopted before: it is said, that Moyses fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
and vttered,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. c. 19. 20.</note> and that all the Prophets sayd, that the straungers
should come too woorship God, and too honour his maiestie. Then
was it not a thing vtterly vnknowen at that tyme, as Saint Paule
speaketh of it: but yit let vs marke that all those prophesies ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not too bee darke, bycause the meanes were hidden. It is true
that the hope of the faythfull was, that God woulde one day gather
toogither the world that was scattered after so horrible manner as we
haue seene: but as touching the knowledge of the tyme, that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
and the figures of the Lawe should bee abolished, that God
should bee serued after another better knowen fashyon, that Iesus
Christ should bee as the daysimne of ryghtuousenesse, that men should
content themselues with him, that there should be no mo visible signes
but Baptim and the Lords Supper, too confirme vs withall in all the
ghostly gifts which wee obteyne at this day:<note place="margin">Actes. 11. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yea &amp; euen the very Apostles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues continued still in that

preache the hope of saluation too such as were vtter straungers too it
before. Now when S. Peter was aduertized that God would send
him too a heathen man,<note place="margin">Actes. 10</note> he was so amazed at it, that the heares stoode
vp vppon his head. And how is that possible? God was fayne t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tooke too bee vncleane.</p>
               <p>So then it is not without cause, that S. Paule speakyng heere of
so high and great a secret, saith, it was vnknowen too the Patriarkes
and Prophetes. They had in deede some incklyng of it: howebeit,
that was but accordyng too theyr measure, and vnder shadowes and
figures. There was not then any certayne knowledge, tyll God had
vttered the thing in effect, which he had kept in his owne determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And soothly S. Paule thought it good too repeate the woord My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
or Secrete, too the intent that one of vs should not prouoke ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too bee wylful in opinion, as we bee woont too bee. For if a thing
bee hard, one wyll say, this passes myne vnderstandyng, and another
makes none account at all of it. And by that meanes men turne away
from obeying God, and cast as it were a stumbling blocke in folkes
wayes, so as their way and passage is stopped vp, and none comes
neere Gods truth, which would be euident ynough, so men woulde
giue eare vntoo it. But wee bee forepossessed with this opinion, that
it is too hygh and profound a matter, and theruppon it seemes too vs
that God speakes it not for vs. And that is a cause which maketh
vs too hold scorne of his woord, &amp; to let it alone as a thing that belongs
not at all vntoo vs: yea and the boldnesse and lewdnesse of men is such,
that they condemne all things that mislike them. Here S. Paule
too amend that fault, sayth, that the thing which is vnknowen to vs, is
neuerthelesse full of Maiestie before God. For shall wee take vppon
vs to measure Gods secrets by our imagination? What a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse

wee see, that such as would stoppe the mouthes of all Gods trew ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes,
that they should not speake of the thinges that seeme too hygh
for them, are very diuells incarnate. For what a madnesse is it, that
bycause wee vnderstand not why God hath chozen some, and forsaken
othersome, how God gouerneth the world, that the diuell himself can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doo any thing without leaue, that the wicked are the instrumentes
of Gods Iustice: wee woormes of the earth, and stinking caryons
should take such authoritie vppon vs, as too say, that the thing ought
too bee rased out of the holy Scripture, which not onely was reuealed
too vs by the holy Ghost, but also sealed with the blud of Gods sonne?
Must it not needes bee that they are wholly possessed of the diuel, when
they presume so farre? Therfore let vs abhorre such monsters, &amp; pray
God too lay his hand vppon them, and too shewe that they bee no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>Herewithall let vs mark, that God by that meanes intended too set
the greater glory vppon his mercie: for when in the end he publyshed
the doctrine of his Gospell, then did he vtter the infinite riches of his
goodnesse towardes vs. And although wee knowe not all the reasons
that God had in his mynd, when he deferred and put off the publishing
of his Gospell so long tyme: yit notwithsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

vs too iudge, that he intended too open our eyes, and too waken vs, and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:133"/>
too quicken vp all our wits, too the end that euery of vs should apply
himself the better, too knowe how much wee bee beholden and bound
vntoo him. For are wee better than our fathers? Or when the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
was published through the worlde, were the Gentyles more
teachable than before? No: but it seemed that wickednesse was then
come too his full measure, so as there was nothing but contempt of
God. Now when the world was so diuelish throughout, then came
Iesus Christ, then was the message of saluation brought too all men.
Yea and when S. Paule (speaking to the Corinthians) had told them
that Murtherers,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. b. 9. 10.</note> whormoongers, drunkardes, Theeues, forswearers,
and such like folke, yea which had committed yit more heinous crimes,
should not inherit the kingdome of heauen: he sayth vntoo them, you
also haue bin lyke them: too shewe that the Gospell was not preached
at Corinth, for any vertues that were there, nor for that the inhabiters
had bin more giuen vntoo God, or deserued aught at all: but all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of Gods only free goodnesse. Thus yee see that the secret
which S. Paule speaketh of, is too bee applyed after this maner:
namely that it was Gods will that there should be sin in al men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, the remedie wherof he hath sent by his grace. Lykewyse
also wee in our tyme cannot say, that wee bee better then our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as I tolde you before. For if yee haue an eye too the common
state, there was more faythfulnesse among men a fiftie yeeres ago,
than is now: there was more modest conuersation: there was lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
and superfluitie of pomp: and too bee short, men were not lyke
Dogges and Cattes, as they bee now adayes. It is trew, that they had
alwayes a smatch of their owne nature, which is nothing woorth: but
yit Satan seemed too bee then cheyned vp. But within these thirtie
yeeres, things haue gone from wooorse too woorse, and so farre out of
square, as is horrible too see. And theruppon, behold, Gods grace is
preached, forguienesse of sinnes is vttered, God calleth those that were
a hundred thousand tymes forlorne. Now what can bee sayd too it,
but that Gods will was too giue the greater beautie too his grace and
mercye by such an after deele? Wherfore let vs consider, that the way
too aduauntage our selues by Gods woonderfull secretes, is too reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the thing that wee know not, and too receyue the things that
God vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

regard that our fayth bee edifyed, and too consider whether wee ought

not too bee the more inflamed with the loue of God, for that he hath
voutsafed too sende the Gospell abrode now adayes as it were out of

lyke wretched wandering beastes, and had bin plunged in superstition
&amp; idolatrie, so as wee scarse had any more vnderstanding of religion: he
hath appeered vntoo vs agein, not in person, but by his doctrine which
is preached too vs at this day, which had bin vtterly buried.</p>
               <p>Let vs then haue regard of that: And although the world perceyue
not at the first dashe why God woorketh after so straunge a fashion: let
not vs ceasse therefore too profit our selues by it, nother let vs passe for
our owne state too bee assured of the will of our God: but let vs resort
too the head, that is to wit, to our Lord Iesus Christ, and vnderstand,
that sith wee bee knit vntoo him agein by the Gospell, God dooth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
auow vs for his children: and although wee haue bin the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheddest

let vs not ceasse to hope still that he will call vs too the heritage which
he hath promised vs from tyme to tyme. Therefore it ought too suffyze
vs, that God will gather vs intoo his bodye, yit notwithstanding that
wee haue bin scattered heertoofore, and that he will performe his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
towardes vs, if wee suffer our selues too bee gouerned by our

King: let vs doo him homage willingly, submitting our selues to him
with trew obedience of fayth, not doubting but that he will reueale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too

man take any degree vppon him, but he that is called. Therfore marke
it for a speciall poynt, that S. Paule ment too excuze himselfe of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
by shewing that he did not thrust himselfe in too bee an Apostle,
but had good and sure warrant that God had appoynted him thertoo.


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23289:134"/>
And therewithall also he ment too assure the Gentyles, too the intent
they shoulde receiue the message of their saluation, as proceeding of
God, and not of man. For wee must alwayes bee at this poynt, that
the forgiuenesse of sinnes is too precious a thing for vs too bee assured
of by the authoritie of man. Then must wee bee fully resolued, that it
is God which speaketh,<note place="margin">Math. 18. c. 18.</note> too the end we may conclude, that whatsoeuer
is vnbounde on earth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. b. 9.</note> is vnbounde also in heauen. And forasmuch as
S. Paule had erst bin an enemie too the Gospell, and had persecuted
the Christians,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. b. 13.</note> and blasphemed God: it seemed that that should haue
impeached the receyuing of him for an Apostle, and the yeelding of
such reputation too him as was requisite that he should haue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he preuenteth the things that might bee alledged too bereeue him
of all reuerence, and sayth, that they must not haue an eye too his owne
person, nor too his deseruing, but too Gods aduauncing of him by his
grace, and by a power that is not ordinarye among men. It is trew
that S. Paule dooth alwayes humble himselfe as much as may bee,
that men may the better knowe Gods free be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that also is the rule that wee must holde, bycause God will haue all

                  </gap>pped, and none of vs all too haue aught whereof too boast.
For it is certeyne, that wee shall euermore but rob God of his honour,
if wee confesse not that wee bee beholden too him for all thinges, and
that wee haue not any thing at all of our owne. But (as I haue tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
already) he ment heere too put away all lettes, too the end that no
man myght vpbrayd him, that he was vnwoorthie of so excellent and
great dignitie, as too bee of the number of the Apostles. His intent
then was, to shewe that Gods grace surmounted all the impediments
that could bee in him before. First he setteth downe Gods grace. It
had bin ynough for him too haue graunted God so great prerogatiue,
as too holde all things of him: but he setteth downe twoo wordes m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some man haue sayd:) such condition, and such ought too be in an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:
hast thou such vertew? And so yee see why he was not contented
too set downe simply the gift, but also would needes adde, free bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And afterward he magnifyeth the same gift yit more, saying, <hi>that
God vvrought therein according too the woorking of his povver.</hi>
Too bee short, hee giueth men too vnderstand, that they ought to espye
a singular and woonderfull goodnesse of God in him, and therwithall
a power not ordinarie among men. Those are the twoo poynts which


<pb facs="tcp:23289:135"/>
wee haue too marke.<note place="margin">

sayeth also, that he himself both is, and ought too scrue vs all for a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
glasse, let vs learne too apply the same vntoo vs.</p>
               <p>And first of al, whatsoeuer wee aske of God, let vs vnderstand that
the same must issew vntoo vs from the welspring of his only mercie and
free bountie, too the end wee should forget all selfdeseruing. For it is
the next way too shet vs out of the doore, when wee come vntoo God,
if wee imagin too bring aught of our selues. Mark that for one poynt.
And secondly to amend all distrust, let vs hope that God will doo more
than all our wits can conceiue. For it is not in vs too measure his
infinite power: and therfore whatsoeuer he hath giuen vs alreadye, let
vs think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur selues beholden too his goodnesse for it, let vs doo him
homage for it, and let vs yeeld him the prayse of it, as meete is wee
should. And so yee see, that the thing which wee haue too gather vppon
Saint Paules example, is, that we must with al humilitie besech God
too worke so in vs by his owne mere grace, as his name may bee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
therby, bicause there is no deseruing to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in vs. Also let vs be
out of dout, that his power passeth all our capacitie, so as wee may
euery way giue him place and enterance, and not shet him out from vs
through our vnbeleef. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nowe wee once that? Hath God shewed vs
his mercie and power, and made vs too feele them by experience? Let
vs put them in vre to the vttermost of our power, and let vs not seeke to
deface his glorie, vnder colour that he hath made vs more excellent
than others, as though wee had deserued aught of our selues, but let
vs yeeld him his dew, and that which ought too bee his peculiar
owne.</p>
               <p>And herewithall, too continue his matter, he addeth, <hi>that this
grace was giuen too him, (euen) too him the least of all the Saincts.</hi>
This serueth too expound that which hee had sayd concerning the gift
of grace. Now heruppon wee haue too mark, that if wee intend too
yeeld God that which wee owe him, wee must be vtterly abaced in our
selues. For so long as men fall too parting of staks with God, and
will needs bee somwhat of themselues: it is all one as if they would
set themselues ageinst God, and bee their owne keruers. Too bee
short, God neuer hath his full right, except wee be rid quyte and cleane
of all. Thefore a man cannot discerne how Saint Paule hild al things
of Gods mere grace and free gift, but by considering his (former)
slendernesse, that is too say, by considering what manner a one he had


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23289:135"/>
bin, and what his estate had bin before. And this is a poynt of greate
importance: for wee see how men couet alwayes too reserue somwhat
too themselues. And although they graunt, that God deserueth too be
exalted without end: yit can they not finde in their harts too forgo the
the whole prayse of the thinges that he hath giuen them, but would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fayne be esteemed and had in some reputation for them. Seeing that
wee bee so much giuen to vaynglorie, and that there is not a harder
thing for vs too doo, than too humble our selues with such lowelinesse
as God requireth: it standeth vs on hand too mark this doctrine so
much the more, wherin we see, that God shall neuer bee honored as
he deserueth, till wee be thrust downe vnder his feete, and haue not
any thing wherfore to bee estemed, but bee become lyke wrethed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>And let vs marke also, that S. Paules so dooing, was not a fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
modestie, after the maner of most men, which wil commonly say,
and make as it were a prouerbe of it, O sir, I am the meanest and
least able of all men: and yit in so saying with their mouth, they ceasse
not too haue theyr hartes puffed vp with pryde. In so much that in
very deede, if a man should answere them, I beleeue it wel: they would
bee as hot as a toste, and had leeuer too bee found lyers, than too gyue
ouer theyr selfeweenyng, wherwith they bee so ful fraughted. S. Paul
vsed no such Ceremonie full of vntruth, but protested truely the thing
as he thought it, accordingly as in another place to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

crueltie, seeking to shed innocent blud. There then S. Paule sheweth
well ynough, that there was no counterfetnesse in his confession, and
that his lowelinesse proceeded from his hart. For he would haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

if euery of vs looke intoo himself, and demaunde this question of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
how comes it too passe, that I am made partaker of the Gospel?
how haue I bin brought intoo the Churche? I say, it wee consider

it is not of the order of nature, that God hath so reformed vs and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>And besides that, forasmuch as I must bee fayne too reserue that

there is any speaking of Gods secrets, it is good reason that we should
bee sober, and suffer our selues too bee ignorant in the things that God

Therfore let vs learne too knowe no more than God disclozeth vntoo

by his holy Ghost, as wee may perceyue whatsoeuer he
sheweth vs by his woord. Yee see then how wee ought to bee diligent
and heedfull in receyuing the things that God hath voutsafed too teach
vs in his holy Scripture, and the things that are preached too vs in
his name. But therwithall let vs also tarry till he impart vntoo vs

too knowe more than is lawfull for vs, but let vs bee contented with
that which God sheweth vs, assuring our selues that it is not for any

what is expedient and behoofull for vs, and therfore giueth vs such
lyght as he thinkes meete, in measure and proportion. Thus yee
see in effect, how S. Paule ment that the Gospell was communicated
vntoo him: and also that the Gentyles receyued their part of it by his
meanes, insomuch that all men knew the things that were as good as
buryed from them before, till God brought them foorth to lyght. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse

and are worthie too bee mocked of little children. Yee see

which our Lord hath not disclozed by effect, and that when wee see the

not any thing at aduenture, but had ordeyned it so before. And after
the same manner must wee iudge of the chaunge that was seene at the

And now adayes we see that many are stirred vp with diuelish rage, to
murmur ageinst all Gods dooings, bycause they conceyue not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his purpose, insomuch that thervppon they spew out their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
blasphemies, as who should say, it were not free for God too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues through that villanous pryde, to thrust God as it were
vnder their feete: it standeth vs the more on hand too put this doctrine
in vre, that wee may reuerence Gods secret ordinance, and therwithall
receyue the things that are vttered vnto vs, without geynsaying, as
good and ryghtfull, and doone with such wysdome, as is not too bee
founde fault with.</p>
               <p>And now Saint Paule thinkes it not ynough to say, that God had
his secret purpose hidden in himself: but also sayeth, <hi>that his vvill
vvas, that this vvisdome vvhich is diuers in many sortes, should be
knowen.</hi> This tytle deserueth too bee well marked, where he sayth,
that Gods wisdome is (as yee would say) of dyuers sortes. Not that
God is variable and chaungeable in himself, nor that there is any
snarling or intangling in his deuyces: there is no such thing at all in
God, nother can there bee: but Saint Paules speaking after that
manner, is in respect of our vndersauding. Therfore if wee would
comprehend Gods wisdome, wee should bee confounded and dazeled
at it, bycause it is infinite: and besydes that, it hath things in it which
are able too amaze all our senses, yea and too swallowe them quyte
vp, so as wee should neuer discerne anie thing certeynly, too say, Loe,
this is it. But this had neede too bee layd out more at length, that
wee may vnderstand it, and fare the better by it. Now and then wee
see some looking glasses, wherin wee thinke we behold a hundred, yea
or rather an infinite number of images before vs: and when wee see
them, wee bee at our wits end. After the same manner hath Saynt
Paule spoken heere of Gods wisdome, namely, as giuing vs warning
of the weakenesse and rudensse that is in our vnderstanding, too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
wee should not bee too inquisitiue in serching the things that passe
our capacitie, and the matters that God hath purposed in himselfe.
Then if wee will needes so stye vp hygher than is lawfull for vs, and
thrust our selues foreward with foolish presumption, too bee priuie of
Gods counsell, and too inquyre particularly what he hath determined:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:143"/>
our wittes must needes fayle vs ere wee come halfe way there, and we
shall fynde so many things there, that wee must of necessitie quayle of

the bottome of so great and deepe a gulfe.</p>
               <p>Therfore if a man demaund here, how then can wee confesse God
too bee ryghtuous, wyse, and almyghtie, sith wee bee so daunted at his

too bee some contrarietie (betweene these twoo,) that wee should bee
diligent and heedfull in considering Gods woorks, and yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that our wits are dazeled at the thinking vppon them: the

and which are for our profite: wee shall haue vnderstanding ynough,

in him, too knowe how too call vppon him, to discerne betweene good
and bad, and too walke according too his will. Then if wee giue not
head to our foolish and vnordinate lusts, but herken lyke good scollers
to the things which our mayster voutsafeth too declare vntoo vs: wee
shall in Gods woorks vnderstand all things that are for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our welfare. And that is the cause why it is sayd in the booke
of Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fall too gaging of them too the bottom, there wee shall fynd the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd
gulf which is able too swallow vp all our vnderstanding. Too bee
short, first it is too bee vnderstoode heere, that as well Gods woord,
as his woorks, are vntoo vs woonderfull secrets, and such as passe all
our wit and capacitie. Insomuch that if wee haue an eye to his works,
there are yit further miracles in them too daunt vs withall, than the
things that wee see euery day, &amp; which are in common vse among vs.
Lykewise in the holy scripture, there are somwhat secreter poynts, &amp;
which are not very easye to be vnderstoode. Konwe wee that once wee
haue first of all to humble our selues, and to pray God to inlyghten vs


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23289:143"/>
by his holie spirit, that wee may profit our selues by all his woorks
and woords. And moreouer let vs lerne the things that he sheweth
vs, and bee contented with the measure that he appoynteth vs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
coueting too knowe anie more than that which wee may lerne in
his schoole. Thus yee see what wee haue to beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>Furthermore when wee once haue such meeldnesse, surely our Lord
will giue vs a sure resting poynt: and although his priuities bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
and the doctrine of the Lawe and the Gospell bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
aboue the the reache of the world: yit shall wee bee taught by
them too our welfare and saluation. And so there is no mingling, no
confuzednesse, no intangling for vs, bycause God will guyde vs by
his holie Ghoste, and giue vs wisdome and discretion too knowe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he seeth too bee for our behoof. Mark that for one poynt. But
if wee bee vnteachable or vnruly, and will needs play the looce colts
too serche further than wee haue leaue: surely Gods wisdome wil bee
alwayes variable vntoo vs: that is to say, there wil be such diuersitie
of things, and so manie stoppes in it, as wil make vs at our wits end,
and wee shall abyde as vtterly confounded. Yea and euen the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
shall well perceiue the thing that Saint Paule sayeth heere, that
they may euer bee put in mynd too walke in awe and feare, and not
giue themselues the brydle too much, nor take too much leaue to know
more than our Lord will haue them too knowe. Now then, the dout
which myght haue bin cast, namely how God wil haue vs too bee aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

               <p>Theruppon wee may gather also, that it is a diuelish statelinesse

<pb facs="tcp:23289:144"/>
do ill knowe their owne abilitie. For they imagine that if God bynd
not himself in all poynts too the things which he hath reueled to vs by
his word, he is contrarye too himself, and hath a dubble will, and that
moueth them too gabble after that fashion. But too bee short, Gods
will is alwayes one, and single, and agreable in it self: howbeit that to
our seeming it bee diuers, and haue many kinds of it, as if wee sawe a
hundred sundry shapes which dazeled our eye sight or vtterly dimmed
it. Whereas S. Paule sayth, that Gods wisdome is diuers in many
sorts: it is as if a picture had a thousand coloures in it, so as a man
could not distinctly discerne one from another. Neuerthelesse, S. Paul
in saying so, ment not that Gods wisdome is so wrythed in it self, that

               <p>Now therupon S. Paule applyeth the ground which he handleth,

by Adams sinne, according as wee haue seene heretofore, how it was
Christs office to gather toogither all things that were scattered afore.

is not amisse, in that S. Paule leadeth vs from the one too the other,
by the similitude which he setteth downe heere. Let vs marke well
therefore that all thinges were created in Iesus Christ, when he was
ordeyned too bee head of Angels and men:<note place="margin">Heb. 1. a. 2.</note> yea and that although wee

               <p>Now hauing sayde, that wee bee so created agein in the person of

others, which beyng not able too rid themselues of this text of Saint
Paules: haue thought that the Angels are heere among vs, too bee as
schollers, and to heare the preaching of Gods woord. But that is too
fond and chyldish an imagination: for wee know, that as well the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
as the vse of the Sacramentes, are allotted peculiarly vntoo vs
of God, bycause of our rawnesse. The Angels of heauen haue nothing
too doo, nother with Baptim nor with the Lordes Supper. And why?


<pb facs="tcp:23289:146"/>
For the Angels bee altoogither spirituall. But forasmuch as wee
creepe heere beneath, therefore wee haue neede of such meanes as are
conuenient for our infirmitie, too make vs come by little and little vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God. Therefore the doctrine that is preached among vs, serueth
not for the instruction of the Angels. How then shoulde it bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
that the Angels were taught by the things which they see pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
in the Church? Let vs marke first of all, that although the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

               <p>The Angels then knowe not things yit but in part. Trew it is
that they must not bee mustered in our state and taking: for lyke as
they bee neerer God than wee, so bee they taught more familiarly.

as is shewed vs in the sixth Chapter of Esay, in the vision that is giuen

yit haue they their eyes couered, too shewe that they vnderstand not all

shewe them that they bee but creatures, that they myght therby bee

Trew it is, that the Angels knewe well that Iesus Christ
was the head of all mankind: but how that should bee doone, or at what
tyme, or by what meane, that was hidden from them. That is the
maner wherin S. Paule sayth, that they profited, namely by beholding
our Lord Iesus Christ too shed foorth his grace in that wyse. For it
was not ynough too say, that men should woonder at such a miracle as

and alye himself with those that were erst his mortall enemyes, &amp;
allure them to him, whom he before abhorred. If it had bin sayd, that
men ought too bee astonished at it: that had not bin ynough. But when
as S. Paule sayeth, that euen the Angels fynde it straunge, and are
fayne too maruell at it, seeing how God vttereth so great treasures: it
serueth well too shewe vs, that whensoeuer there is any speache of our
calling, that is too say, of the mercie that God hath shewed vs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting

many men did euen at that tyme magnifye the Angels, too deface the
maiestie of our Lord Iesus Christ: S. Paule sheweth, that although
the Angels bee as it were Gods powers or vertewes,<note place="margin">Psal. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherwith he executeth his woorkes: and although they bee domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that it is only he in whom lyeth the fulnesse of all good things: and
so is he in deede, as is sayd in the same text. And it is a poynt well

adayes among the Papistes, too alledge the vertewes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
or of the Uirgin Marie, or of the Sayntes, too make ydols of

as who should say, that the excellencie which God hath put intoo his

should bee put backe therfore. So then let vs vnderstand, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
can bee sayd or preached of the vertewes and woorthinesse of
the Uirgin Marie, of the Apostles, and of all othe men, yea and of
the Angells of heauen, serueth not too diminish the maiestie of our

offices too bee delt away too this man and too that man. Wheretoo
then? Too doo vs too wit, that vertewes are so distributed to al Gods
children,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. f. 37.</note> as there is none other fountayne of all goodnesse, but Iesus
Christ, who is the (only) party too whom wee must resort, and that
the creatures are neuer the more impayred, though Iesus Christ ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere
them as their head. That then is in effect the thing which wee
haue too marke vppon Saint Paules woordes, where he taunteeh
such as would needs exalt the Angels without end or ceassing. For he
sayth: very wel, I graunt they be powers, vertues, &amp; principalities: but
yit is our Lord Iesus Christ still their head, and they bee so groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <p>Secondly, let vs mark well the degrees that Saint Paule setteth
downe here: wherof the first is, that we must haue fayth. For although
Iesus Christ haue opened the way and passage by his blud,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10. c. 19.</note> too make

kye. Trew it is, that the doore is neere hand, and the opening therof
is easye, when we haue the kye: that is to say, if wee receyue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in trew obedience of fayth. And soo yee se why Saint Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that it is not ynough for vs that Iesus Christ hath layd foorth
the tresures of the infinite goodnesse &amp; mercie of God his father: but
that it standeth vs on hand on our syde, to receyue the same by fayth.
Not that wee dan doo it of our owne power, nor yit that wee can come
vntoo Iesus Christ, or bee partakers of the benefits which he offereth
vs by the Gospel, except wee haue fayth in him. And from beleef we
must procede too trust, that is too say, wee must bee fully perswaded,
that God will alwayes receyue vs, and that wee shall fynd fauour at
his hand, and that although wee bee wretched sinners, and vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
too liue vppon the earth: yit neuerthelesse wee shall fynd him still
fauorable too vs when wee come too heauen. Lo how fayth is linked
with trust. And therof springeth this stoutnesse of mynd or boldnesse,

yit we ceasse not to offer our selues vnto God with our heads vpryght.
And why so? Bycause he looketh vppon vs in the person of his only

wee possesse our Lord Iesus Christ, and by his meanes shalbee led vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too

that our prayers must bee grounded vppon full certeintie. For (as

deceyueth himselfe. Therefore wee must assure our selues by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospell, that God is readye too receiue vs too mercy,

any thing more than Iesus Christ, but he must bee all our treasure, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in him wee haue all things that are requisite too our ioy and

if they can say, I was letted by this
and that (which shalbee nothing at all,)
but the least occasion that can bee, wyll
serue, bycause their seeking alreadye is too shrinke away from God.
And this is too common now adayes. For they that are desyrous too
iustifye themselues, bycause they reiect the doctrine of the Gospell,
will alwayes fynde fault with the causes of offences. O say thy, this
trubbleth mee, this maketh mee too mislyke the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
this maketh mee too forsake it vtterly. All that euer they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
shalbee but tryfles, but yit had wee neede too labour so much the
more, too ouercome all the lettes and stoppes which the diuell indeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
too cast in our way, so as wee may still keepe on our trade and
course. And that is the thing whereat S. Paule ameth heere, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Ephesians not too bee thrust out of the way, but too holde on
still truely and constantly in the fayth of the Gospell, notwithstanding


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23289:149"/>
that they might be offended too see him a prisoner, and as good as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already. Now it is certein, that Saint Paules suffering in
mayntenance of the thinges that he had preached, was not too make
them swarue from Gods pure truth: but contrariwyse he protesteth,
that it was too their glory, so as they myght tryumph aforehand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the inuincible constancie that was giuen him. But (as I
haue sayd already) besydes the thing that I haue touched alredy, there
is such a naughtinesse rooted in our nature, that wee bee well appayd,
if wee can haue any outward colour too shrinke away from God, and
we beare our selues on hand, that we bee quite and cleane discharged.
Howbeit S. Paule spake not this for that one people, but he giueth
heere an instruction that ought too serue vs at this day: which is, that
although the most part of the world bee mad at the Gospel, and fight
as much as they can, too quench the rememberaunce of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and although the faythfull bee persecuted, diffamed and
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: Yit must we not swarue aside, nor be out of hart, considering
that it ought to confirme our fayth the more in our Lord Iesus Christ,
and that wee haue wherof to glory, seeing God holdeth vp his Church
by strong hand, so as it is not vtterly oppressed and ouercome. If the
Gospell were receyued without geinsaying, and with one common
accord, surely we should haue cause to blisse God for it, and there should
bee a melodie betweene heauen and earth, so as both men and Angels
might with full mouth magnifie Gods goodnesse so shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning foorth
vppon all men: But yit the fighting of men ageinst the Gospell, is a
sure recorde vntoo vs, that God is the author of it, inasmuch as they
that are imprisoned for it, and drawen euen vntoo death, ceasse not for
all that too stand stedfastly in it.<note place="margin">2. Kings. 6. c. 16.</note> God then vttereth there a wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
power, and it appereth, that for all that euer Satan can doo, wee
neuerthelesse haue proofe that God is on our side, and fighteth for vs,
and vpholdeth vs by his power. Not that he exempteth vs from
affliction, but he will alwayes giue vs victory, and that ought to suffize
vs. Thus the thing which wee haue too remember vppon this Text
of S. Paules, is, that wee must bee readie too receyue all the alarums
that Satan shall make vppon vs, and that although wee see the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Gospell ill receyued of the world, so as it is not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyzed
and disdeyned, but also hated, and the vnbeleeuers are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with a diuelish rage too destroy it: Yit notwithstanding we must
not beare it the lesse reuerence, for wee must not measure Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie


<pb facs="tcp:23289:150"/>
by the opinions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Put the cace that God were euery where
despyzed, according as most men are in deede so churlish and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that they bee as monsters shaped ageinst kind, yit must not God
loze the right that wee owe him. For notwithstanding the rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of such as would wrap God with them in their iniquities, wee
ought too honour him with all humilitie. Euen so is it also with the
pure doctrine of the Gospell. Although then that the world set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
ageinst it, &amp; many men trample it vnderfoote, so as some mocke
at it, some gnashe their teeth at it, and fires are kindled for it: Yit let
vs still quietly and obediently receyue the things which wee knowe to
come from our God. Thus then yee see how our fayth ought always
too keepe on his way, and that although many practizes and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
bee attempted ageinst the faythfull, and a man shal euery where
heare of nothing but confederacies, threatenings, outrages, and such
other things: yit wee must not ceasse too fight stoutly vnder Christs
banner,<note place="margin">Luke. 21. d. 19.</note> &amp; to possesse our soules in pacience. And heereunto ought this
saying of S. Paules to serue, <hi>that it is our glory:</hi> for our fayth should
bee as good as dead, if God tryed it not. Neuerthelesse when wee see
the faythfull so examined, wee haue alwayes so much the better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the doctrine that is giuen vs of God. Trew it is, that it ought
too bee grounded in heauen, that is too say, vppon the aucthoritie of
God alone, without hauing respect too any creatures. For the very
Angels of heauen were not able too authorize the Gospell: Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
must bee fayne too come foorth for vs too leane vntoo, and then
shall wee neuer bee shaken downe. Notwithstanding, when the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs
sticke not to giue their liues in the witnessing of Gods truth: then
(as I sayd afore) wee bee, or ought too bee the more stirred vp too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the doctrine, and it is as it were sealed vp in our harts. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
then as persecutions serue too confirme the doctrine the better:
therfore S. Paule sayeth, it is our glory, and that wee ought too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
at it, seeing that God dooth so mainteyne and strengthen them
whom he sendeth intoo that battell.</p>
               <p>For it is certeine, that in respect of the frayltie of the fleshe, they
shoulde quayle by and by. But that they get the vpper hand, let vs
mark, that it is Gods dooing, who woorketh after so manifest a fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as wee haue cause too glorifie him for it. Now if when wee bee
trubbled, wee bee tempted too shrink, and too giue ouer at euery brunt
that is put too vs: it is a token that wee haue not the skill too profit our


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:23289:150"/>
selues by the meanes that God giueth vs, too drawe vs to him, and to
make vs sticke too him with trew stedfastnesse. Therfore let vs fyght
ageinst our own weaknesse, and ageinst the naughtinesse of our nature,
that when wee see how the diuell practyzeth too ouerthrowe the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in maner euery where, wee may consider, that God forgetteth not
those that are his, but strengtheneth them in such wyze with his power,
that their fayth getteth the vpper hand, to the end that we shold hope for
the lyke, and that when wee bee at ease and rest, wee should not ceasse
too prepare our selues after their example, that when it shall please
God too reach out his hand vppon vs, and too make vs take our turne
and course, wee may bee fenced a long whyle aforehand, and not bee
possessed with such imagination as some bee, which beare themselues
on hand, that they shal neuer feele any greefe or trubble: but that wee
may alwayes be redy armed to fyght. Herewithal S. Paule sheweth,
that it is not ynough for vs to be only taught: for we should not ceasse
for all that, to be alwayes fretting, and to be as men more than half out
of their wittes, vntill God made his doctrine too take such place, as
wee were touched too the quicke with it.</p>
               <p>Now then, hauing exhorted the Ephesians, he sayeth, <hi>I bowe my
knees before the father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> If exhorting too
the end that euery man myght be of courage, had bin ynough: S. Paul
would not haue added that which he speaketh heere of prayer. But to
the intent too shewe what the Ephesians had too doo: he falleth intoo
the way before them too giue them an example. And therfore let vs
marke, that when wee shall haue had our eares beaten with Gods
woord, to shewe vs our dewtie, and thertoo not only bin instructed, but
also exhorted and spurred forward: yit will there alwayes bee some
sloth, coldnesse and rechlesnesse in vs, so as the doctrine shal stand vs in
smal stead, vntill God touch vs with his holy spirit. And this serueth
too beate downe al pryde in vs. For a number thinke themselues able
too woork woonders, who feele themselues beguyled, when they come
too the pinch. Wee see what happened too Peter. He promised, yea
euen vnfeynedly,<note place="margin">Math. 26. g. 35.</note> that he would not shrinke from his Mayster, though
he should dye for it. Yee see how Peter made a stout brag. Surely
he made it not but of a zeale, which a man would say, is good and holy,
and he ment too haue had the same intent so settled, as too haue shewed
it at the neede: and yit notwithstanding, the stout wordes of a sillye
wenche made him too deny Christ, and he was redy too haue denyed


<pb facs="tcp:23289:151"/>
him a hundred tymes, insomuch that he fell to cursing &amp; banning. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee haue such a looking glasse, let vs acknowledge our owne
weaknesse in Peters person, and (as S. Paule sheweth vs heere) let
vs resort too him that hath all power in him. For it is not ynough for
vs too knowe our disease, vnlesse wee seeke the remedie of it. First of
all then, let vs rid our selues of al foolish opinions, wherwith the world
is imbrewed, as that a man may bee able too ouercome all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by his owne free will: and rather let vs learne too abace our selues
vtterly, knowing that when as God is so gracious to vs, as too teache
vs by his woord, the same is not too inable vs too doo it, but onely too
hold vs the more giltie and conuicted therof, too the end wee should not
make a sheeld of ignorance. Let that bee one poynt.</p>
               <p>Yit notwithstanding, let vs not stay there: but for asmuch as we be
weake of our selues, and Godhath all strength in him: let vs repayre
vntoo him. For it is certein, that he calleth and allureth vs vntoo
him. And therfore let vs not thinke that wee shalbe disapoynted, when
we cast our selues downe so as half dead, or rather as starke dead at his
feete, not doubting but that he will lift vs vp agein. And so Saint
Paule speaking of his praying too God heere, was not alonly too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
that he discharged his dewtie: but too the intent that the same
should serue for an example too all the faythfull, that vppon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their wantes: they myght resort only vntoo God, knowing that
he holdeth vs vp continually by strong hand, and that after he hath
once giuen vs fayth, he addeth also such inuincible constancie, that wee
stand out too the end. This is it in effect which wee haue too beare
in mynd. And therfore let vs take warning, not too trust too our owne
wit, nor too presume anie whit vppon our own power and strength,
when wee come too heare Gods woord: but too desyre our God, that
lyke as he hath voutsafed too haue his woord preached vntoo vs by
the mouth of a man, so he will also speake vntoo vs inwardly, and in
secret by his holy Ghost, that by that meanes the doctrine which wee
haue heard, may take roote, and bring forth profit and fruite. And
moreouer, sith wee see by experience, that God requyreth more of vs
than our power and abilitie can auoord: let vs desyre him too supply
our wantes, according too the example that I haue set downe alredye,
which is, that it is cleane contrarie too our fleshly reason, that wee
should go too death if neede bee, and forsake the world and our owne
lyfe. This is not too bee found in man, if he followe still his owne


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23289:151"/>
reason and will. God therfore must bee fayne too woorke in this cace,
and too remedie our infirmitie. But although that too suffer for the
Gospell, and too go too death as it were with blyndfolded eyes, and
not too bee turned away, nor striken downe for anye thing, bee verye
hard things, and such as passe all abilitie of man: yit will God stand
by vs in such sort, as wee shall ouercome all distresses, if wee arme
our selues with the weapons that he giueth vs: that is too say, if vpon
the knowing of his will, wee being vnable too walke as he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs, doo pray him too giue vs legges, and too strengthen vs in such
wyse as wee may ouercome all. This doone, a man cannot say, that
this doctrine is vnprofitable. For why is it that our Lord giueth vs
those things by his holy spirit, which we haue not by nature? Euen too
make the doctrine auaylable, so as it may not disappoynt vs. They
then which doo slaunderously say, that if wee cannot followe God of
our owne freewill, it were better too forbeare preaching, bycause it is
but lost labour: they (say I) wote not what order God keepeth too as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vs too himself. And experience sheweth well ynough, that the
preaching of the word is but an instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherby God worketh in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
If wee bee fully resolued of that, then shall wee verye well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
that God agreeth very wel with himself, in that he will haue
the Gospell preached too vs, and yit telleth vs, that it should stand vs
in no stead, except it pleazed him too woorke in our hartes by his holie
spirit. Now in saying that the Gospell is an instrument, it is all one
as if a man should say, that a plowman with his Plowgh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

and all other things,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. b. 7.</note> were an instrument, and yit not therfore the cause

and as yee would say, puts the meate intoo their mouthes: so will
God haue vs too receyue our sustenance at his handes. And for that
cause he sayeth, that when the people should bee come intoo the land
of Canaan,<note place="margin">Deut. 9. a. 4.</note> although they should till and manure the ground, yit should
they not say, this haue I gotten with my owne hand, but all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

too his creatures, so as wee bee fed therby. For all the labour of man
can nothing auayle, vnlesse God blisse it. And what then shall wee
saye of the thing that is much more excellent? For is not the foode


<pb facs="tcp:23289:152"/>
of our soules much preciouser than that which serueth but for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
therfore let vs not thinke, that it is ynough for vs to come to a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or too reade (Gods woord) euery man by himself: but wee must
also resort vnto God, that he may giue vs increace. And for the
same cause dooth Saint Paule set downe this similitude,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. b. 6.</note> that he
which planteth, is nothing, nor yit he that watereth, but that it is God
that giueth the increace from aboue. And he speaketh not there of
the laborers of the ground, but of the sowers of Gods woord, and of
such as manure his Church with continuall exhortations. Albeit then
that wee take neuer so great payne: yit shall wee doo no good at all
with our labour, except God woorke with it by his holy spirit. But
when he woorketh with vs, then is our labour auaylable, and then it is
sayd,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b. 16.</note> that the Gospell is the power of God too the saluation of all that
beleeue. For God dooth so vtter the power of his holy spirit, that the
preaching of the Gospell, and the secret and inwarde woorking of the
holy Ghost, are things so ioyned toogither, as they cannot bee separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And so yee see in effect what wee haue too remember vppon that
saying of S. Paule.</p>
               <p>Now hauing spoken of praying, he sayeth, <hi>That yee may be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
in the inward man, by the power of his holy spirit.</hi> Here
he sheweth vs the weaknesse that I spake of afore: for if we perceyue
not our owne neede, we will neuer voutsafe too resort vntoo God lyke
poore beggets. We know that man being left to himself, will neuer
acknowledge his owne pouertie, except it bee proued too his face. To
the end therfore that wee should come vntoo him vnfeynedly, and with
trew lowelinesse: it is for our behof too feele by experience, that we
can doo nothing at all, and that wee bee vnprofitable in respect of all
goodnesse, vntill our Lord haue renewed vs. That is the thing which
Saint Paule intended too make vs too vnderstand. For though all
the world generally doo seeke help at Gods hand, yit is there scarce
one too bee fonnd among a hundred, that dooth it truely and without
hipocrisie. For if a man could serch what is in some, he should fynd
them redye too burst lyke Toads, with pryde and filthinesse, and that
they presume woonderously vppon themselues. They will go seeke
succour at Gods hand, and yit thinke they haue their seeking in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Surely it is too excessiue a leaudnesse, but yit is it a vyce that
reygneth too much. Howsoeuer wee fare, if wee desir God too reache
out his hand too succour vs: let vs lerne first of all too abace our selues,


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:23289:152"/>
and let vs know, that wee haue not sufficient strength of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but that the same must bee fayne too come from aboue, and from
his holie spirit, as S. Paule hath expressed heere. That yee may bee
strengthened (sayth he) by the power of his holy spirit. No doubt but
he maketh comparison here of things cleane contrarie. For so long as
a man can doo ought of himself, Gods spirit needeth not to supply the
roome. But forasmuch as all power proceedeth of Gods free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
therin it is shewed vs, that wee can doo nothing of our selues,
and that all the strength which wee surmyze our selues too haue, is but
smoke that vanisheth away, and a starke illuzion of Satan, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
too holde vs fast in some fond selfweening, too the intent wee
should not repayre too our God, and so be left vtterly destitute. And
besides this, Saint Paule sheweth further, that it is a free bestowed
benefyte, that is too saye, a benefyte that proceedeth of Gods onely
free gifte, too the intent wee should not imagin, that when God suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coreth
vs, he hath an eye too any thing else than our wretchednesse, or
that he dooth it for any good disposition that he sawe should bee in vs.
And that is the cause why he succoreth vs in all our needes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint Paule sayeth heere, that it standeth vs on hande too bee
strengthened by the power of his holy spirit, and that the same is a
free gifte.</p>
               <p>Now he sayeth, <hi>acording too the richenesse of his glory.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it, that he magnifieth the riches of Gods goodnesse so much,
but to beate downe all the fond opinions wherwith men besotte them
selues, in weening too bring, I wote not what, of their owne, and by
that meane too make themselues haylefellowe with God? Therfore
it behoueth vs to beare this thing wel in mind. For S. Paul speakes
too such as had shewed great strength already: but yit was it meete
that God should alwayes haue the prayse of it. They were in great
forwardnesse, and had fought already for the Gospell: and yit Saint
Paule wisheth, that they might bee strengthened. Heerein wee see
that wee bee so farre vnable too begin too doo good, that euen when
God hath set vs in the way, when he hath reached vs his hand, yea and
when he hath continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but turne away his hand one minute, wee bee quite quayled. And so
wee be warned (as wee haue seene afore) that as God is the beginner
of our saluation, so is he the worker of it throughout, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in vs, furtherfoorth than wee bee vphild by him, and by


<pb facs="tcp:23289:153"/>
his holy spirit. And therfore wee ought too bee prouoked too pray
dayly all the tyme of our life. For they that forget themselues, and
fall as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

why? They bee not worthy of it, bycause they seeke it not with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
care. Therefore too waken vs throughly both from our slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and from our rechelesnesse, wee must beare in mind, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God hath called vs into his Church, and touched vs to the quicke,
to receyue his Gospel with trew obedience: the same ought to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vs so much the more too the end. Let that serue for one poynt.
Agein, let vs vnderstand, that God must needs shewe the riches of his
glory, when he increaseth so his holy spirit in vs by degrees. For
must there not needes bee an infinite treasure of his goodnesse, when
he draweth vs so to him at the first sight? In what plight we are when
God chozeth vs and taketh vs too him? He draweth vs not onely out
of a stinking puddle, but out of the bottom of hell. For behold, the
thing that we bring with vs by inheritaunce from our mothers womb,
is cursednesse, and to be as enemies to God, and too haue nothing but
starke malice and rebelliousnesse in us, and too be blynd wretches, and
(at a word) too bee giuen too all euill, so as Satan reigneth ouer vs,
and wee bee his bond slaues, and are hild downe vnder the tyranny
of sinne. Now then seeing that God hath pitied vs, in respect that we
were so miserable creatures: Needes must it be, that he vttered the
great riches of his goodnesse in that behalfe, and meete it is that he
should bee glorified for the same. And (as I haue sayd already) wee
ought too be the better touched therwith, that like as he hath adopted
vs for his children, so wee may shewe our selues willing too take him
for our father. But howsoeuer wee fare, although he haue reformed
his image in vs, yit must he bee fayne too vtter the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and too increace his gifts in vs, and too make vs too go on still
with our course. And it standeth vs so much the more on hand to beare
this doctrine in mind, bycause wee see the worlde hath bin beguiled
with these toyes and opinions, that euery man myght well put foorth
himselfe through his owne freewill, or at leastwyse prepare himselfe
too come vntoo God. And agein, that Gods ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of grace vppon
grace, is, bycause men haue vsed well the grace that he had giuen and
bestowed vppon them before. Now as touching the first poynt, how
is it possible that wee should bring aught of our selues too win Gods
fauour withall? seeyng wee bee lyke poore dead men, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yes? Wherefore let vs learne too father the
beginning, continuance, and end of our saluation vppon God, and too
shim all those diuelish illusions, (which seeme to maynteyne) that God
in adding of grace vntoo grace, hath a regarde how euery of vs hath
deserued it. For contrariwyse S. Paule telleth vs, that in this care
we must haue nothing before our eyes, but Gods goodnesse in shewing
himself so liberall towardes vs, that he neuer ceasseth too doo vs good.
He is not lyke mortall men, which will say, I haue doone thee good
ynough already, content thy self: but lyke as he hath shed out the gifts
of his holy spirit intoo vs, so he is moued too increace the measure of
them, till wee bee come too the full heyght of them, that is too wit, too
full perfection.</p>
               <p>Now hereunto Saint Paule addeth expresly, <hi>the inward man:</hi> for
wee would fayne that God should alwayes strengthen and increace
vs in this world, but in the meane whyle the heaue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y lyfe is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with vs. For some would shewe themselues valiant, and they
bee so rauished in their owne conceyt, that they weene themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es too
bee as Angels, so as men may speake of their deeds of prowesse, and
that they may bee taken for proper men, and purchace themselues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
That is one kynd of strength that men desire. Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre
too increace their substance by merchandyse, or too get riches and
possessions by any meanes howsoeuer it bee. Othersome couet too bee
in credit and authoritie. Too be short, the meanes wherby wee would
haue God too shewe himselfe bountifull towards vs, is in pleasing
our sensualitie and earthly lusts. But on the contrarie part, Saint
Paule bringeth vs too the inward man, that is too say, too the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
lyfe, which is vnseene of vs, sauing that wee haue record of it. For
after the same maner dooth he speake of the inward man lykewyse too
the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. d. 16.</note> saying, that the outward man corrupteth, but yit the
inward man is renewed. What is it then that Saint Paule meaneth
by the outward man? Riches, bodily health, honour, credit, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and (at a woord) all that wee couet of our owne nature. Those are
the things that are ment by the outward man. Now (as I sayd afore)
wee would fayne bee strengthened in those things, but in the meane
whyle we despyze the inward man, that is too say, the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
too the heauenly lyfe. And why? For wee see them not, bycause


<pb facs="tcp:23289:154"/>
wee bee grosse witted, and intangled in this world. Therfore Saint
Paule sheweth vs heere, that if God list too diminish vs too the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
wee must be are it patiently, and he sayeth the lyke in the Text
which I am about to alledge. For when the faythlesse and heathenish
sort which haue their treasure in this world, doo see themselues go too
decay: they sygh and say, alas, where are the armes that I had in time
past? where bee the leggs? &amp; therupon they fall too repyning ageinst
God. Agein, if a man that was riche bee diminished, and God cut
of the things that he possessed: he is in horrible vnquietnesse, and hee
had leuer too bee alredye buryed, than too see his wings clipped after
that fashyon. Agein, they that are led with ambition, and seeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but honour &amp; estimation in the world, if they be once out of their
accustomed credit, they thinke all is lost: But on the contrarie part,
Gods children, which shet their eyes willingly at all the things which
haue a fayre glosse here beneath, and behold the heritage of heauen by
fayth, are not so vexed when they see themselues diminished euen in
eysyght, &amp; that God maketh them to drop away by little &amp; little: they
take al in good worth.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. a. 5.</note> And why? For they haue an eye to the chaunge:
which is, that by that meane God reneweth them, too giue them the
thing that is vnseene, and too make them take corage agein, as though
the kingdome of heauen were hard at hand. So then, the thing that
Saint Paul sheweth vs now, is, that looke as euery of vs is caryed
away with his owne foolish lusts, so would hee haue God too yeelo to
his fondnesse. And contrariwyse, by his praying bnto God to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vs, he sheweth vs, that it must not greeue vs, though wee decaye
as in respect of our bodyes, so wee haue the spirituall cheerelynesse
that maye make vs too drawe neerer and neerer vntoo our God,
and too looke still too the kingdome of heauen, which cannot fayle vs,
assuring our selues, that the bringing of vs lowe, is too the end wee
should bee exalted on hygh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. a. 1.</note> and that although we must go downe into
the graue, yit it is not too perish there altoogither, but too bee renewed
agein. Wherfore let vs suffer our selues too bee so abaced, that wee
may bee set vp agein by the power of our God. And although wee be
poore despyred creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in this world, let vs suffer it patiently, and
therwithall let vs not ceasse too warrant our selues that God will
woork in vs as he promiseth.</p>
               <p>And furthermore let vs mark wel, what S. Paule setteth downe
heere: for he vseth not the single name of God, but sayeth, <hi>The father


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23289:154"/>
of our Lorde Iesus Christ, of whom all kinred is named in heauen
and in earth.</hi> Now hereby hee sheweth vs first of all, how familiarly
wee may go vntoo God, as hath bin touched alredye. And the last

then that wee haue assurance that the gate is opened for vs, wee
may bee bolde too go in vntoo God. And this fayth ingendereth trust
in our hartes, and trust giueth boldnesse. These are the three steppes
that Saint Paule did set downe there. And heere he sheweth vs how
wee obteyne that priuiledge: that is too wit, bycause God hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his heauenly Maiestie too bee worshipped of vs: (for although wee
ought too honour him in that respect, yit would it so astonishe vs, as too
make vs shun his presence as much as wee possibly could:) but also

that wee must call him father. And how
dare men bee so bolde or presumptuous, as to call God their father?
Surely wee can alledge no ryght wherby too clayme any such digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For not euen the Angels haue it, but by meanes of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Then is it vnpossible for vs too pray too God, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
vs, and after the manner which he teacheth vs in his woord
except Iesus Christ bee our aduocate. For on whether syde are the
Angels akyn too vs? shall the Uirgin Mary be found to bee our greate
Aunt or Graundmother? What are the Apostles? Too bee short, wee
must resort too our Lord Iesus Christ, too haue his spirituall kinred,
wherby God avoweth vs for his adopted children. And when wee
once haue that, wee must no more doubt whether God will heare our
prayers or no, seeing wee come not to him vppon a foolish rashnesse, by
presuming vppon our owne naturall reason or selflyking, but with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
too his commaundement. Agein, wee haue his promis,
which can neuer deceyue vs. Contrarywyse all they that thinke too
obteyne fauour at Gods hand by any other meane, doo but run astray,
and haue shet them selues out of the doore already. And therfore there
is now none excuce, but that wee must simply hold the way which the
Gospell sheweth vs, to come vnto God by, that is too wit, in the name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, without adding of any other creature, as we
see doone by the whole world. In deede they that pester vp a throng
of patrons and aduocates, (as they terme them,) hope too bee well
welcome vntoo God. But by what warrant? Who hath promised
them, that God will accept their deuotion, and all that they offer vntoo
him? For it is not in vs too appoynt officers in heauen. In a Court
of Iustice of the world, it myght well bee a matter of course (as they
terme it,) and it myght lie in the power of a Iudge, too giue leaue too
whom he listeth, too pleade mens caces, too the intent there myght be


<pb facs="tcp:23289:157"/>
no confuzion. But if wee will make aduocates at our owne pleasure,
and vppon our owne head (in heauen:) it is all one as if wee would
rob God of his authoritie and souereintie. Yea, and wee must bethink
vs how S. Paule sayeth, that all our prayers and supplications, shall
neuer be aught worth, but vtterly vnprofitable and vayne, if they be not
conformable to Gods word, so as we take our rule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. For how
shall wee call vpon a God (saieth he) whom wee knowe not, at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture?
And how shall we knowe after what maner we should pray,
and what style and speeche wee should vse?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. c. 14.</note> Wee must come too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
not of the things that men shall bring vs of their owne brayne,
but of the things that God commaundeth vs. So then, wee must vse
this modestie and sobrietie, and not speake at randon when wee pray
vntoo God, but simply obey his word. Yea and we know that prayer is
the cheefe sacrifice that God requireth. For whereas it is sayd, that
wee must worship the only one God:<note place="margin">Deut. 6. c. 13. &amp;. 10. d. 20 &amp; Math 4 b. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0.</note> it is not alonly with ceremonies,
as with kneeling downe before him. In deede that is requisite: for it
is meete that wee should honour our God both with our body and with
our mynd, bycause they bee both his. Howbeit in worshipping him,
wee must acknowledge truely that wee hold all good things of him:
and that doo wee in praying too him. For wee come thither as poore
soules vtterly destitute of all thinges that are meete for vs, knowing
that without him wee bee woorse than miserable. It is sayde in the
lawe, that in offering sacrifyze too God, men must not doo any thing
at all of their owne head, but follow his ordinaunce, insomuch that it
was forbidden them too take straunge fyre too vse vppon the aulter:
whereby it was ment in a figure,<note place="margin">Leuit. 10. a. 2.</note> that men should vtterly forbeare all
their owne deuotions, when they intend too offer any thing vntoo God.
Likewyse they were forbydden too offer sacrifyze without salt,<note place="margin">Leuit. 2. d. 13. &amp;. Mark. 9. g. 48.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
too shewe that wee ought too haue a sure instruction, so as all the
offerings which wee offer vp too God, bee sauced or poudered with his
woord: for without that, there will bee nother taste nor sauour in them.
But seeyng that wee now adayes haue the substance and truth of the
figures of the Lawe: whensoeuer wee offer our prayers and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
vntoo God, or yeeld him prayse and thankes, let vs doo all by
our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. c. 15.</note> as the Apostle too the Hebrewes exhorteth
vs. This serueth too finish vp the matter that was begunne this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>And wee must call to mynd what S. Paule told vs this morning:


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23289:157"/>
namely, that in praying vntoo God, wee must not bee giuen too our
wordly affections, but seeke that God may bee glorified, and that the
residue may bee but as an appurtenaunce too it. That is the cause
why he spake purposely of the inward man. For if God should giue
vs the brydle too aske whatsoeuer came in our head, or if wee on our
side should take such libertie: what a thing were it? If he should giue
vs al our owne asking, it would turne to our ruine and confuzion. For
we haue our lusts further out of square, than litle children or sick folks.
And all of vs generally doo by experyence find in our selues, that wee
bee fast settled heere bylowe, and would fayne bee hild continually in
this world: wee hang our heads groueling downeward, and cannot
lift them vp. So much the more therefore doth it stand vs on hand, to
mark wel the thing that S. Paule sheweth vs in this sentence: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that wee ought too pray God to renew vs, and too strengthen vs by
his holy spirit, and too increace his giftes in vs more and more, that
in passing through this world, we may alwayes ame at that mark, and
bee heere but as wayfarers, too the end that our Lord may auowe vs
for his children, and the heritage be kept for vs, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vs, and bought so deerely for vs by the death and passion of our
Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now heereuppon S. Paule inferreth, <hi>that Iesus Christ may dwel
in our harts by fayth.</hi> Wherby he sheweth, that without Christ wee
shall neuer bee made partakers of any one drop of Gods grace. It
is trew, that God hath the whole fulnesse of life, light, rightuousnesse,
and all goodnesse in himself. But where is the head welspring? It
is vtterly hidden, &amp; we shall neuer be able too come at it of our selues.
And if wee think too doo any good by our owne inuentions: it is but
a deceyuing of our selues: wee shall but dig pits continually, yea euen
such pits as are full of holes, and haue no springs of water in them.
Behold,<note place="margin">Ierem. 3. c. 13.</note> the thing that men gayne by following their own inuentions,
is, that they make much trotting vp and downe, and are neuer the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.

the benefits which wee receyue of God his father: therfore S. Paule
sayth, that he must bee fayne too dwell in our harts, that wee may bee
reformed by Gods spirit. And let vs mark, that Iesus Christ hath
the full perfection of all goodnesse in him, not onely in respect that he
is the euerlasting sonne of God, but also euen in his humane nature
which he tooke of vs, and wherein he became our brother, hath he also
receyued all fulnesse, according too this saying of the Prophet Esay,
that vppon him shall rest the spirit of wisedome,<note place="margin">Esay. 11. a. 2. 3. 4.</note> the spirit of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the spirit of the feare of God, the spirit of rightuousnesse,
and the spirit of strength. And too what end? Is it for his own vse?
He had no neede of it: but (as it is sayd in another Text) it was to the
end that he should distribute it vntoo all his members, and wee all of
vs from the most too the least drawe of his fulnesse, not fearing that
fountayne can dry vp. Seeing then that our Lord Iesus Christ dooth
by the Gospell dayly communicate and offer vntoo vs the things that
wee want, and are needefull for our saluation: it is not for nought that
S. Paule hauing shewed that wee can do nothing furtherfoorth than
wee bee vphild by Gods grace: addeth, that God must bee fayne too
dwell in our harts.</p>
               <p>Now vppon these words, wee haue too gather first of all, that God
thinking it not ynough too remedie all our defaultes and misdooyngs,
and all our wantes, hath voutsafed too giue himselfe too vs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his onely sonne. If it were told vs that wee bee restored too the
former state from whence our father Adam fell, that were very much,
and therein wee should haue an excellent record of the goodnesse of our
God: but he hath not onely giuen vs both heauen and earth, that is too
say, all things that are fit for vs both in respect of this flyghtfull lyfe,
and of the euerlasting saluation of our foules: but also he hath giuen
himselfe vntoo vs. And how is that? Euen by giuing vs our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, as is sayd of him in the nyenth of the Prophet Esay. And
all the Scripture also leadeth vs thither, when it sheweth vs how God
giueth himselfe vntoo vs, and how wee possesse him, and haue full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him. And theruppon wee must conclude with that which S.
Paule sayeth, in the eyght too the Romanes, namely, that inasmuch
as Gods sonne who hath all excellence and dignitie in him, is giuen
vnto vs? shal any thing else be withhild fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: Seeing that God hath

knoweth to be for our profite and behoof? Thinke we that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they shalbe
denyed vs? Yee see then that the thing which we haue to remember
in the first place, is, that God hath shewed himself so bountifull too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 57. &amp; Psal. 16. b. 5.</note> that he hath not thought it ynough too put vs in possession
of all his goods, but hath voutsafed too become our portion and cup
himself, as the scripture sayeth, which vseth such similitudes, to shew,
that as a man seeketh his ordinary repast, and is well appayd when
he hath meate and drinke, bycause he is refreshed by it: so must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
vnto God, too haue the trew foode: and wee must hold our selues
contented with him, when he giueth himself so vntoo vs. And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
let vs euer beare in mynd what I haue sayd, namely, that wee
neede not too sore in the ayre, nor too make any farre fetches for the
possessing of God, bycause he hath knit himself too vs in the person of
of our Lord Iesus Christ, and in him we are made partakers both of
him and all his benefits. And S. Paul setteth downe the word fayth,
too shewe vs how deere the doctrine of the Gospell ought too be vntoo
vs. For it is not ynough too haue sayd, that Iesus Christ dwelleth in
vs, bycause wee will alwayes haue our replyes (and say) How may
that bee? For wee cannot stye vp so high. He is in the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and wee bee crawling heere in the world, subiect to miseries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
number. Seeyng then that there is so long a distance betweene
him and vs: howe may he dwell in vs? Now S. Paule addeth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely,
that the Gospel is of such power, as too vnite vs to Gods sonne,
at leastwyse so wee receyue it by fayth: for it behoueth vs too consider
the contentes and substance of the things that are preached vntoo vs,
concerning the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ. It is not onely sayd,
that it was Gods will too haue him offered in sacrifyzce, too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
wee myght bee reconcyled, and all our sunnes bee wyped out, so
as they myght neuer come too account, and (too bee short,) that full
amendes myght bee made for all our sinnes by his death and passion,
and that he was rayzed agein for our iustification, as S. Paule sayeth
in the fifth too the Romanes: not onely those things are sayd of Iesus
Christ, but it is also said, that he is our head, as we haue seene already,
&amp; that we liue of his owne substance, as a tree draweth his sap from his
roote, and that as the head of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sheadeth foorth his power through
all the body, so haue wee a secret vnion, and such a one as is woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and farre aboue the order of nature, bycause that although Iesus
Christ bee in heauen, yit he fayleth not too dwell in vs. And soothly if


<pb facs="tcp:23289:159"/>
the Sunne can so cheere vs vp by his beames without fleeting out of
his place, insomuch as wee see that euery morning wee bee as it were
refreshed and comforted (by his ryzing,) yea and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sicke folkes feele
some cheerlinesse by him though they lye a long in their beddes: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a creature which is not onely transitorie and corruptible, but
also senslesse and vnmoueable of it self, hath notwithstanding such force
and propertie giuen it of God, too reioyce and refreshe vs after that
fashion: what shall our Lord Iesus Christ doo, who is ordeyned too
haue the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelling in him,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. b. 9.</note> and to shed foorth
all the gracious giftes of God his father vppon vs, too deale them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
euery of vs according too his measure, as is sayd of him in the .xiiii.
Chapter of Saint Iohn? Then if wee come too Christ with beleefe in
him, that is too say, if wee receyue the promises of the Gospell: let vs
assure our selues that he will dwell in vs, euen by the meanes of fayth.
But hereof wee shall treate more fully in the fifth Chapter. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
this text could not haue bin vnderstoode, vnlesse I had noted
the thing that I haue briefly touched euen now: that is too wit, that
Iesus Christ dwelleth in vs by fayth, and that our receyuing of him as
he offereth (himselfe with) all his grace by the Gospell, is not alonely
too looke vppon him aloofe, or too haue it tolde vs, that he hath offered
himselfe in sacrifyze for vs once for all: but too the end he should dwell
in vs by the power of his holy spirit, and wee bee knit vntoo him, and
feele that he dooth truely execute the office of a head towardes vs, so
as we bee members of his body, and liue of his proper substance. That
then is the cause why S. Paule added the woord <hi>Fayth,</hi> when he sayd,
that Iesus Christ ought too dwell in vs.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse wee must not go about too plucke Iesus Christ out
of his heauenly glorie, too the intent too bee the neerer vntoo him, as
the vnbeeleeuers doo, who will needs dwell euer still beneathe, and
transfigure God after theyr owne lyking. And wee see what is doone
in the popedome. For there is no God among them, but a sort of
puppets which they call Images and reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berances. And moreouer,
bycause they see well that those are but dead stocks and stones: they
haue made another God, whom they haue shet vp in a box, and too him
they resort as too a liuing God. In deede if they had the supper of our
Lord Iesus Christ according too his institution, in stead of the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Masse which they haue brought in on their owne head, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ woulde bee present among them: howbeeit not as they


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23289:159"/>
imagine. For in the Supper wee doo truely receiue the bodie and
blud of our Lord Iesus Christ, too bee fed of him, and of his owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
so as he performeth the thing which he speaketh by his woord,
namely,<note place="margin">Iohn. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. f. 35.</note> that he is our spirituall bread and drink, and hath wherwith
too satisfie vs too the full. Yea, but yit are the bread and the wyne of
the Supper, as pledges that our Lord Iesus giueth himself too vs, to
the end wee should seeke him aboue after a spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all fashyon. So then,
Saint Paule sheweth vs, that if wee will haue Iesus Christ ioyned
vntoo vs, wee must not bee giuen too our owne beastlinesse, but our
harts and mynds must bee lift vp aloft too seeke him aboue, as hath
bin declared alredie.<note place="margin">Coloss. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. a. 1.</note> It is trew, that he commeth downe too vs by his
woord, and by the power of his holie spirit: but that is too the end that
wee should mount vp thither too him.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit there is one thing more which wee ought too mark well
in Saint Paules saying, that Christ must dwell in our harts. For
manie men haue him in their mouth, yea and also in their brayne, as
they vnderstand him, and they think themselues well discharged, when
they can babble of him: but in the meane while there is no lyuely roote
in them. Then is it not ynough for vs to haue some rouing knowledge
of Christ, or too gaze at him in the aire, as they say, and too bee able
too talk of him with full mouth: but he must haue his seate in our harts
within, so as wee bee knit too him vnfeynedly, and with a trew affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That is the meanes for vs to be made parttakers of Gods spirit.</p>
               <p>And too bee short, wee may see here, that all such as weene too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
aught at Gods hand but by the meane of our lord Iesus Christ,
doo but rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and wander in vayne, and shal alwayes fynd themselues
emptie: insomuch that when they think themselues too bee full fed, it
shalbee but with wynd, that is too say, with vayne and tryfling imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
as I told you this morning. They therefore which deuyze
patrones of their owne head, and surmyze that God will fauor them
for it, and in the meane whyle let Iesus Christ alone: must vnderstand,
that they bee so farre of from obteyning their requests, that God dooth
rather abhore them, insomuch that when they once swarue from the
ankerhold which is set foorth for vs in the scripture, (that is too wit,
from hauing our Lord Iesus Christ for their lodesman) the Angels
of heauen must needs forsake them, and the Saints also, to whom they
behighted themselues, must needs deny them, yea &amp; al of them must set
themselues ageinst them as aduersarie parties. For there is no means


<pb facs="tcp:23289:160"/>
for vs too bee matched with the Angels, Prophets, Apostles, and
Martirs, till wee haue trew concord with them. And how shall wee
haue that? By fayth: that is too say, according too the pure doctrine
of the Gospell. Not that it is ynough for vs too haue our eares beaten
with it: but that wee must receyue the things that God promiseth vs
there, so as wee abhorre all that euer Satan can set afore vs, and haue
none other guyde than only our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath told vs,
that he is the lyght of the world,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. b. 12.</note> and that whosoeuer walketh in him,
cannot stray. But by the way wee must serche and examin our selues
narrowly, that wee take not a vayne cloke vnder the name of Iesus
Christ, as we see manie doo now adayes, which protest themselues to
bee Gospellers. And euen among our selues, what a number are there
which will shew signes greate ynough, that they bee willing too fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
Gods woord? But they think too discharge themselues with
petie tryfles: and when they haue once giuen eare (too the doctrine)
and spoken a fewe good words: then, too their seeming, God is hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound vntoo them. But heere it is shewed vs, that wee haue none
acquayntance at all with him, vntill Iesus Christ dwell in our harts.
And that is the verye meane wherby too bee filled with his benefits,
and too haue his holie spirit dwelling and reigning in vs. For vnlesse
we feare God, and walk in his obedience, so as wee behaue our selues
according too his will, and all our wits and desyres ame thitherward:
it is a token that wee liue after the flesh,<note place="margin">Gala. 5. c. 16.</note> as Saint Paule sayeth too the
Galathians. Therefore wee must shewe by our outward fruites, that
wee bee truly ioyned too Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. a. 5.</note> and that he hath made vs parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his holie spirit.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon Saint Paule addeth further, <hi>that vvee must
bee rooted and grounded in charitie.</hi> This woord <hi>Charitie</hi> or <hi>loue,</hi>
may bee taken as well for the loue that God beareth vs, as for the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
loue which wee ought to beare one towardes another. But the
verie trew and natiue sense of Saint Paule heere, is, that he ment too
haue vs knit toogither. For as he spake heeretoofore of Gods free
loue towardes vs, so now he sheweth how fayth importeth that wee
should haue brotherly loue one towards another. And the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bringeth vs alwayes to that poynt: insomuch that when there is
any speaking of the full perfection of good lyfe: fayth goeth before, &amp;
then comes Charitie next vntoo it. For the end that wee must begin
at, is the vtter abacing of our selues, too the end wee may seeke all our


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23289:160"/>
welfare at Gods hand, and that our seeking of it there, may bee, first
too acknowledge that he giueth vs all things in the person of his onely
sonne: and secondly, too call vppon him too settle our fayth in him, too
flee wholly for refuge too his mercy, and after as euery man feeleth
himfelf bound vntoo him, (as all of vs are exceedingly,) so to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by our thanksgiuing, that he is our rightuousnes, our holynes,
our victorye, our ioy, our glorie, and our happinesse, that wee may
performe the thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g which is sayd in Ieremie, whosoeuer glorieth, let

                     </gap>. f. 24.</note> bycause it is he that woorketh ryghtuousnesse,
Iustice, and mercy. Yee see then that wee must rest wholly vppon
our God, or else all the vertuousnesse which wee seeme too haue before
men, shalbee but filth and dung. Now then, haue wee fayth? Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
must be matched with it, and wee must liue euenly and vpryghtly
one with another, &amp; euery of vs acknowledge thus, I was not created
for my self, nor to seeke myne own priuate benefyte &amp; commoditie, but
for the benefite of my neighbours also. And therfore let vs absteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
al guile, wrong, outrage, and malice, and indeuer to serue eche others
turne, according too our abilitie. That is the perfection of good lyfe.</p>
               <p>Saint Paule hauing spoken alredie of fayth, addeth now, that wee
must also bee grounded in Charitie: as if he should say, wee must not
haue alonly some fit (or pang of loue) as manie men haue: but there
must bee a stedfastnesse and euen holding on in it all our lyfe long. For
a thing may giue a greate blaze, and yit quayle anon after. Behold, a
huge building may be ouerthrowen with one blast of wynd, if it be not
set vppon a sure foundaton. Also a man may set vp a greate tree: but
if the roote bee cut asunder, what will come of it? It must needes fall
downe out of hand, or else if it haue some hold a the one ende for a
tyme, it must needes wither at the heate of the Sunne. Euen so is it
with vs, when we haue a greate zeale which is not well rooted in our
hartes: for it wilbee but as a maske or a gay showe before men. That
is the cause why Saint Paule exhorteth vs purposely too bee groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in charitie, too the intent too correct the vyce of louing, by startes
or fits (as they say) which is too common a thing. Neuerthelesse,
it were a fondnesse too conclu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> therefore, that our saluation were
grounded vppon our good woorkes. For heere he treateth not of the
cause of our saluation, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nly how wee ought too rule our lyfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
wee knowe there is but one onely foundation of the Church, as
S. Paule sayeth in the third chapter of the second Epistle too Cori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:161"/>
and as wee haue seene alredie in this selfsame Epistle, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as Iesus Christ himself declareth in the sixteenth chapter of
Saint Matthew. And which is that foundation? It is Iesus Christ,
and no man can lay any other than that which the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
haue layd, and wee must hold our selues too it at this day, and
euen vntoo the worldes end. And yit may wee not ceasse too bee roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in loue by meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ. When men demaund
what is the cause of our saluation, by what meane wee be brought into
his fauour, and how wee may come vntoo hym, and cal vpon hym with
full trust:<note place="margin">Coloss. 2. b. 9.</note> (wee must answeare) it is, bycause our Lord Iesus Christe
is giuen vs, and it is he in whom the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelleth.
Now wee bee yit farre of from such perfection: Howbeit, forasmuch
as wee bee grounded vpon our Lord Iesus Christ, wee haue a steady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that continueth all our life. So then let vs marke, that Saint
Paule exhorteth vs here too true stedfastnesse, too the intent we should
neuer bee weery of wel doing, though wee haue neuer so many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
too thrust vs aside. For euen such as are best mynded (too see too)
doo neuerthelesse take pritch at it, when men shewe themselues vnkind
towardes them: and when they consider, that for their well dooing men
wyll requite them with all euyll, they bee sore greeued at it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
quite out of hart. And that is a cause why so fewe continue in
the feare of God, and walke as they ought too doo: for it seemeth too
them, that they haue lost their labour in doing well. Agein, there fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
this inconuenience also, that the wicked take occasion too rush
out so much more intoo all maner of harmfulnesse: so that if a man liue
in simplicitie, and beare the wrongs paciently that are doone vntoo
hym: all men wyll bee dooing with him, and euery man would eate
hym vp, as if he were a sheepe among an hundred Woolues. Such
as are easily intreated too giue of their goodes too their neighbours,
seeme too bee set out too the spoyle, and euery man wyll bee catching
al that euer he can from them. When men see so lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de dealings in

say. But contrariwise it is told vs heere, that if wee bee rooted and
grounded in charitie, although men thrust vs aside, and discorage vs
by their vnthankfulnesse: yit wyll wee not ceasse too hold out in well
dooing, bicause wee haue a good and deepe roote.</p>
               <p>And S. Paule hauing spoken so of the good will that wee ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
beare towardes our neyghbours, returneth too his matter of fayth.


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23289:161"/>
And surely the cheef poynt for vs, is too knowe that God auoweth vs
for his children, and that our sinnes are forgiuen vs, so as he taketh vs
for ryghtuous. If wee haue not that, how can we fynd any sweetnesse
in seruing and honoring of him? And how or with what corage can
we pray to him? What prayse can wee offer to him? Too bee short,
it standeth vs on hand too bee certified of the infinite good that is doone
vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, too the end wee may bee rauished in loue
with our God, and inflamed with a ryght zeale to obey him, and holde
our selues short vnder his awe, too honor him with all our thoughtes,
with all our affections, and with all our hartes. The cause then why
S. Paule contineweth this matter, is to prynt it in the myndes of the
faythfull, where their saluation lyeth, and how they may bee sure of it.
And so much the more doo wee see what the wretchednesse of the world
is. For there is none other assurance, than the calling vppon God on
this groundworke, so as a man bee lifted vp by fayth too offer himself
into his presence. But on the contrary part, we see how men haue gone
too worke. And in deede they haue not bin ashamed in the popedome,
too say, that wee ought too bee alwayes doubtfull of our saluation, and
that wee cannot haue a sure beleefe of it. And it is not the ignorant
sort which say so: but all the doctors of their Sinagoges hold it for an
article of their fayth, that wee ought too bee alwayes in a mamering
and doubtfull. And that is euen as much as too cast men vp at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vntoo Satan. So much the more therfore behoueth it vs too
beare well in mynd the doctrine that is conteyned heere, that is to wit,
that when wee once knowe the loue that God beareth vs in our Lord
Iesus Christ, and in such wyse as he hath witnessed it too vs by his
death and passion, and dooth still dayly warrant it by his Gospell: wee
haue the perfect knowledge, and such as shall giue vs full happinesse.
And that is the cause why he sayeth, <hi>too the end yee may learne with
all the Sayncts, what his heyght, &amp; depth, and wydnesse, and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is:</hi> that yee may knowe all this, sayeth he. How now? Ment
S. Paule too make vs Carpenters or Masons, that he speaketh heere
as of the heygth of a buylding? Intendes he to teach vs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> science of
Masourie, that he speaketh thus of wydenesse? No: but he openeth his
owne meaning by &amp; by, saying: <hi>It is the Loue that hath bin shevved
vs in Iesus Christ.</hi> Therfore when wee once knowe how well God
loueth vs, and how inestimable the mercie is, wherof he hath giuen vs
so good a pledge, in the person of his only sonne: wee haue all that can


<pb facs="tcp:23289:162"/>
bee, sayeth he. Let vs inforce all our wittes both vpward and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
let vs stye aboue the cloudes, let vs pierce too the Centre of the
earth, let vs go downe too the bottoms of the deepes, and let vs rake
ouer sea and land, yit shall there bee nothing but vanitie and leazing.
When wee haue ended all our wyndlasses, surely weee may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
discourse lyke folk that are verie suttle, &amp; haue learned the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of manie things: but yit shall there bee no substance in vs.
But when wee once knowe that God is our father in Iesus Christ,
and how that commeth too passe, and by what meanes wee obteyne
so greate a benefyte: that is the thing (sayeth he) whertoo wee must
hold vs. For it is the trew measure of our fayth, they bee the bondes
of it, and whosoeuer couers too knowe more, dooth but go astray, as
though he would wilfully enter intoo a maze, wheroutof he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wynd himself agein. Wherfore let vs hold our selues contented
with Iesus Christ as he is, and as he vttereth himself by his Gospell,
and then shall wee bee filled full, sayeth S. Paule. With what filling?
Euen with the fulnesse of God, sayeth he. As if he should say, Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
folke as wee bee, there is none of vs but he coueteth knowledge,
and it is a naturall desyre which burneth all men. Insomuch that wee
shall see many which consume all their goods, and spare nother their
bodyes nor their lyues. And what too doo? Too get knowledge. Wee
shall see othersome trot from place too place. And what too doo? Too
get knowledge. All men then haue that desyre, some more, and some
lesse, and there is not so ignorant a person, which would not faine come
too knowledge. Now then, seeyng wee bee all inclyned thertoo of
nature: let vs learne which is the trew knowledge. In deede there are
sciences which are behoofefull too passe this world withall, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
it is that men should haue artes and trades, and also the liberall
sciences, as they be termed. All these are good, if they bee referred too
their dew endes. But yit notwithstanding wee must come too the
Science of Sciences: for that is it which will neuer fayle. For when
a man shall haue trotted all the earth ouer, (about other Sciences,)

                  </gap> wyll come of it? It will bee but vanitie, as I sayde
afore. Wherefore let vs not seeke any thing out of Iesus Christ,
but let vs rest wholly there, and not swarue any whit at all from
him.</p>
               <p>And heere wee see first of all, the thing that I haue touched alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
heeretoofore: namely, that if wee knewe wel what our Lord Iesus


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:23289:162"/>
Christ is, wee would easly giue ouer all other things, according as it
is sayd in the third too the Philippians,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. b. 8.</note> that S. Paule counted all
his former high esteemed things as losse and dung, to the end he might
hold himself too Iesus Christ, and that he went forewarde therein all
the tyme of his life, yea and did as it were hold his armes stretched
out too catch it, as he himself protesteth. Yee see then, that the thing
which wee haue too marke heere, is, that when wee once knowe that
Iesus Christ, and the benefits that he bringeth vs, namely that wee
may resort too God in his name with full trust: we shall no more haue
our mynds so vexed with vnquietnesse, but wee shal stand fast and stedy
in pure simplicitie of the Gospell. Howbeit, for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hereof, let vs see how men speake of our Lord Iesus Christ. In
deede they wyll call hym the sonne of God, and they wyll take hym for
theyr Redeemer: but in the meane whyle they wyl make a doale of his
offices, and part them here and there as a pray. The holy Scripture
calleth him the onely Priest, bycause it belongeth alonly vntoo him too
reconcyle vs vntoo God. And how many doo now adayes take that
vppon them? Euen as many Moonks, Freers, Masse Priests, and
Hipocrites as bee in the world: for they sell their prayers, as though
Iesus Christ had resigned his place vnto them. And vnder pretence
therof, they deuoure all the wealth of the world, and in the meane whyle
Iesus Christ is thrust a great way of. Agein, it is sayd, that by the
one sacrifize which he offered once for all, he hath gotten vs grace and
saluation, yea euen for euer, so that his death and passion appeaseth
Gods wrath, bycause that therby we haue full rightuousnesse. But yit
for all this, the Masse is brought in, as though the sacrifize that Iesus
Christ offered in his owne person, were but a bare figure, and that the
thing which the Papists haue inuented, were the only meane (as they
say) too purchace fauour at Gods hand. For the whoremaster goes
thither too pay his raunsome: so does the drunkard, the wicked swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
the looce liuer, the piller and poller, the quareller, the glutton, the
eater vp of his neighbour: all these resort too the Masse for their
raunsome, and beare them selues on hand, that God is well appayd.</p>
               <p>And in the meane whyle what becommeth of the sacrifize of Iesus
Christ? Tush, that must be thrust vnder foote. Agein, it is sayd, that
Iesus Christ is our onely Aduocate, which maketh intercession for vs
vntoo God his father. Yit notwithstanding, in the Popedome there
are whole warreins and Swarmes of Patrons, which euery man


<pb facs="tcp:23289:163"/>
hath forged of his owne brayne. And they bee not contented alonly
with the Apostles and Martirs: but they must also haue their S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher,

And therevppon sprang the ground worke of merits and of all the rest.
Agein,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. a. 6.</note> it is sayd that Iesus Christ is our loadestarre, and the way
wherby wee must come too God his father, and finally too euerlasting
saluation: and yit will they needes haue whatsoeuer commeth in their
owne imagination. O (say they) mee thinks this is good, and seeing
I doo it of a good intent, why should not God take it in good worth?
Thus they make God a pretie fellow to stoope at their appoyntment,
and as a Iacke to creepe vnder their sleeue (at their pleasure.) See
how proud men are, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they once turne away from Gods pure truth
vnto their own foolish inuentions, so as there is not so pure and sound a
thing, which they corrupt not. What is then the cause that all things
haue bin turned vpside down in Poperie? It is for that they knew not
Iesus Christ for such a one as he is set forth in the Gospell, but onely
haue made, I wote not what, a dead and vnauaylable thing of him, and
kept no more but the bare name and titles of him.</p>

of his illuzions and trumperie, and cannot content our selues with

be worse than bewitched, and that the diuel hath made vs stark beasts?

vs, it is not for nought told vs, that wee must rest wholly vppon him,
and hold vs too him, when wee be come thither, bycause he hath the
fulnesse of all goodnesse in him, and therfore wee neede not too bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
too and fro, or too take too greate peyne in seeking the things that
are needfull for vs, nor finally too wander any more abrode, but to stick
wholly vntoo him, as too our perfect and souere in blisfulnesse.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must consider in Iesus Christ, the infinit grace that is
brought vs, and imparted too vs by his meanes. And Saint Paule in
saying heere <hi>the Loue,</hi> sendeth vs too the wellspring. For though
wee knew all Gods secretes, and were priuie too the rest of his will:
what were it, till we were perswaded of the loue that he beareth vs?
For wee see that when any man speakes of God too the vnbeleeuers,
it dooth so greeue them, that they wote not where too become, and it is
but a matter of heauinesse too them, bycause they conceyue nothing
but rigour in him. But when his grace and fatherly goodnesse is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
vntoo vs, as he hath shewed it in our Lord Iesus Christ: then
come we boldly vntoo him, and wee bee no more afrayd of his seate,
but haue familiar accesse to it: and therin he dooth vs an inestimable
good turne, such a one as surmounteth all that euer wee can wish in
this world, according as S. Paule setteth vs it downe heere. And so
yee see what this saying, <hi>the Loue of God,</hi> importeth. And he sayeth
purposely, <hi>in Iesus Christ,</hi> bycause that without him wee could not bee
beloued of God. For let Iesus Christ bee (as yee would say) let alone,
and let vs put the cace that wee thought vppon God, and that wee did
apply all our wits theraboutes, and therwithall that wee bethought
vs of our selues also: what were all this? Wee shall fynd such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
maiestie in God, as shall swallowe vs vp lyke a deepe
gulf. Agein, his Iustice is so perfect, as it wilbee much lesse possible
for vs to stand before it, than for Snowe to abyde ageinst the Sunne.
Now when wee come too our selues, wee must needes see a sea of all
miserie before vs, that is to wit, that our senses are blynd, that wee
bee vtterly vnfurnished of all vertew, that wee bee giuen too all euill,
that wee bee hild downe vnder the thraldome of sin, and that nothing
in vs (no not euen of the excellentest thinges that wee thinke our
selues too haue) which is not lothsome before God. Therfore when
we once know these twoo things, that is too wit, when we haue once
conceyued a terrour of Gods maiestie, and bee drowned in despayre
at the syght of our selues, then let vs afterward go seeke al the meanes


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23289:164"/>
that can bee, and let vs call the Angels too help, and they will come
neuer the neerer vs for all that. Let vs take the Hee sayntes and
Shee sayntes, aud by what tytle can they belong too vs? Nay rather
wee bee separated from them. And agein, will God who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
of all purenesse receyue vs, vs (I say) which are so wretched cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures?
Thinke we that he will intermeddle himself with our filth and
vnclennesse? No: but contrariwyse he must needes abhorre vs. So
then, it is not without cause that Saint Paule hauing spoken heere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of Gods Loue, to the intent wee myght know that he dooth iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hate vs, so long as he beholdeth vs in our owne naturall state: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
immediatly, that the same loue is grounded vpon the bludshed of
our Lord Iesus Christ, too the end that all our spottes should bee
scoured away thereby, and wee bee so clenzed, as wee myght
not bring anye thing hensfoorth before God, which myght displease
him</p>
               <p>And by that meanes are wee discharged and quit of all our dettes,
bycause he hath yeelded perfect obedience. Lo how our stubbornnesse
is doone away, and shall neuer come too account, bycause he offered
himself in sacrifice for vs. Lo how wee be set free from all thraldome,
bycause he hath ouercome both the diuell and death, and sinne, too our
benefite. Lo how wee at this day inioy his victory, and make our try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe
of it. And so wee see briefly, how God hath loued vs in Iesus
Christ. Agein, when we know this, we must vnderstand also, that we
must not make long fetches any more, ne trubble our selues in vayne,
in stying vpward by our fond speculations, or in going downeward
by our fantasticall imaginations, and in the meane whyle let Iesus
Christ alone, as though he were too farre of from vs. For he commeth
neere vs, yea he dwelleth in vs, he will haue vs knit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntoo him, so as
wee should bee his body, and lyuely members of his owne substance.
Sith it is so, let vs learne to hold our selues in such wise vntoo him, as
nothing may turne vs from him. And although we may be tempted
by our owne fancies, too shrinke away from him: yit let vs cut of all
such occasion, and get the vpper hand by fayth. And when wee haue
so doone, let vs vnderstand, that God will still shewe himselfe a louing,
and kindharted father towardes vs, and that Iesus Christ also will doo
the dewtie of a shepherd towardes vs, if wee herken too his voyce, and
rest wholly vppon him, not doubting but that he will preserue vs, so as
wee shallbee safe vnder his protection, as he himself protesteth, saying,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:165"/>
that he will receyue all that are giuen him of God his father,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. d. 37.</note> and so
keepe them when he hath receyued them, as none of them shall perish,
but he will rayze him vp agein, at the last day.</p>
               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the maiestie of our good
God, with acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs
perceiue them more and more, that our miseries may driue vs to seeke
the good things that he offereth vs, euen with trew singlenesse of fayth,
and that we may not wander here &amp; there, in our owne fond speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and gazes, but abyde so settled vppon his word, as it may bee our

as wee may abhorre al the abuses of the world, assuring our selues that
seeing wee haue Iesus Christ for our guyde, wee cannot fayle to come
thither, as he is ascended alredy in our behalf, that is too wit, too the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
heritage which he hath purchased for vs, according as it is
his will, that wee beeing made his fellowheires, should in the end come
too the same perfection wherintoo he is gone afore vs. That it may

his dew praise: yit can wee not discharge
our selues of our dewtie with a free hart,
except wee hope that he will holde on still
hereafter, and shewe himselfe the same too
the ende, which wee haue knowen him too
bee heretoofore. Now, without fayth we
cannot hope, and so is it vnpossible that
God should haue his dew praise at mens handes. Put the cace wee
had found Gods helpe at our neede, and whatsoeuer wee could wishe:
and in the meane whyle wee thinke it was but a sodein brayd which is
vanished away out of hand, and that hensfoorth wee may looke for no
more at his hand, and that it shalbee in vayne for vs too requyre it: it is
certeyne, that wee would come no more at him, bycause wee should bee
pinched and pressed with heauinesse and griefe. Therefore, that wee
may holde out in praysing Gods name, wee must cupple these twoo
things toogither: that is too wit, that on the one syde wee bethinke vs
of the good that wee haue receyued of him, and that on the other syde
wee hope still that he will alwayes bee stedfast and constant in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
vntoo the end, and neuer ceasse to doo vs good. And that is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which S. Paule keepeth heere, saying, <hi>Prayse and glory be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vntoo God.</hi> And how? <hi>vntoo him</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>vvhich is able too
doo all things, beyond our asking, yea and beyond our thinking
too.</hi> Now it is certein, that heere Saint Paule had an eye backe too
that which wee haue seene before, which is, that God did then vtter the
infinite riches of his goodnesse, when he voutsafed too haue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
(which is the message of saluation) published throughout the
world. Neuerthelesse, he quickeneth vp the faythful, to discharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
cheerefully, by telling them that they must not mistrust that
God will withdrawe his hand, as though his shewing of himselfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
towardes them, had bin but for once and away. His meaning
then is, that God will go through with his woorke, and therefore that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:166"/>
wee may giue our selues too the praysing of his name without any stop,
as well in respect of the good that wee haue receyued already, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
beleefe that he will holde on without euer fayling vs. That is the
effect of the matter which wee haue too gather vppon this streyne.</p>
               <p>Now his saying is, <hi>Let glory bee yeelded to God in the Church:</hi>
wherby he sheweth, that it is not ynough that euery of vs doo priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledge the benefites that God hath bestowed vppon him: but
that wee must also ioyne toogither in that mynd. For if the body bee
well at ease, surely no member will bee so addicted too it selfe, but that
it will haue regard of all the rest. Now then, when as God hath made
his Church too prosper, so as the number thereof is multiplyed, and it
is also increaced in spirituall giftes: not onely they that haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
those benefites, must inforce themselues too praise God: but also
all the rest of the body, for so much as it becommeth vs too bee knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with the holy bond, whereof S. Paule will speake heereafter.
That then is the cause why he speaketh purposely of the Church: as if
he should say, that seeyng God dooth so vtter his goodnesse, euery man
ought too bee inflamed too glorify him, bycause that looke whatsoeuer
he dooeth too our neyghbours, wee ought too take it as doone too our
selues. And verily he had an eye heere too that which myght hinder
the praysing of God with one trew consent. For the Iewes had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a certeine disdeyne ageinst the Gentiles, bycause they thought
it was meete that themselues should keepe stil the birthryght, and that
they had wrong, if any of those were made equall with them, which

Paule therefore telleth them here, that inasmuch as God had called

               <p>And he sayeth, <hi>Let prayze bee yelded too God, yea euen for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,

Saint Paule hath treated hertoofore of the grace that serued to guyde
the faythfull too the kingdome of heauen: therfore dooth he of good
ryght say, that men must not only prayse God for once and away, but
also that there is cause too continewe the same, not the lyfe of one man
but throughout all ages. Yea and moreouer S. Paule ment to doo

practyze all that is possible, too wype away the remembering of God,
and too make hauocke in the Church, as the grace of our Lord Iesus

of our Lord Iesus Christ shall bee auaylable, notwithstanding the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie

as would ouerthrowe the whole buylding. And that also is the cause
why Saynt Paule setteth vs downe the name of Iesus Christ. It is

               <p>But let vs come now too the second part. He sheweth that it is not

And that is the cause why he sayeth, <hi>Too him that is able too doo al

<pb facs="tcp:23289:167"/>
wee see heere how S. Paule warneth vs, that if God haue vsed great
mercifulnesse towards vs heeretoofore, wee must not doubt of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
of the same, bycause he is not lyke mortal men, which be fickle
mynded: nother must wee bee afrayd that his fountayne will drye,
when he shal haue bestowed great benefits vppon vs already. Why
so? for he hath such store of them, that the more wee take to our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the greater abundaunce hath he still. Wee see then the meane
too dispoze our selues too acknowledge the good that God hath done
vs, at leastwyse too honour him for them, is too bee alwayes fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
and perswaded that wee shall euer fynd him a father, bycause he
hath promised so too bee.</p>
               <p>And wheras he speaketh of Gods power or myght: wee must not
imagin it too bee an ydle power, as the worldlings doo. They will
graunt well ynough that God is almyghtie: but yit in the meane whyle
they trust neuer the more in him. Too their seeming he takes his rest
in heauen, or else he dispozeth not things in this world, but (at starts)
when he bethinks himself of them. But contrariwyse, when God
speaks vntoo vs of his power, it is, too the end wee should make it our
sheeld ageinst al the distresses, hinderances, and lets, which the diuell
casteth before our eyes, too make vs distrust Gods promises. Lyke
as when it is sayd, that Abraham beleued that God is almightie: it
was not generally and confuzedly, but with an applying of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power too the thing that had bin promised him: which was, that
in his seede all the nations of the earth should bee blissed. Abraham
looking vppon himself, sawe he was a man as fast decaying as myght
bee: He drooped, and (as yee would say) dragged his wings after him:
too bee short, he was hard at deathes doore: His wyfe had bin barrein
all hir lyfe long: she was past the age of teeming anie more, insomuch
that the thing which was told him by Gods own mouth, seemed vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnpossible. And why is it that Abraham dooth neuerthelesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
assuredly,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. a. 3.</note> that God will keepe promis with him? It is, bycause
he had an eye too his infinite power, which is able too ouercome all
lets and hinderances. Wee see then how Abraham applyed Gods
power too his owne behoof, assuring himself, that Gods truthe and his
power are things inseparable.<note place="margin">

                     </gap>2.</note> After that maner also dooth S. Paule
say, that he whom he hath put in trust with his gage, is myghtie. For
he sawe himself too bee a poore and frayle creature, he sawe how hee
was hunted at all hands, (he sawe) that he was shaken of and despyzed,


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23289:167"/>
(he sawe) how the doctrine that he bare abrode, was hated and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he sawe how his lyfe hung as by a threede, and he had such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of trubbles, as were able too ouerwhelm him, yea and finally too
confound him and dispatch him quyte. And how ouercame he all this, &amp;
abode inuincible, yea &amp; euen tryumphed ouer them, being in prison, &amp;
seing himself at deathes doore? How could he haue such victory ageinst
so manie temptations and incounters? It was by knowing that God
was the keper of his soule, whervpon he conceyued his infinite power,
which is able too performe all that he appoynteth. Yee see then, that
Saint Paule imagined not a power in the aire, but knew that God
wrought so in him, as he should neuer fall but vppon his feete (as men
say.) And why? For he had promis of it. Wherfore let vs learne to
put this lesson as well in vre, as it is common in the scripture. The
repeting therof so oft is not for nought. For wee see the frowardnesse
that is in our selues, insomuch that although God haue promised too
keepe vs, yit if neuer so little a blast of wynd come vppon vs, wee bee
dismayed by and by. And howso? Surely if wee yeelded God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that hee deserueth, and acknowledge him too bee almightie (in
deede:) we should boldly defye all that seemeth too bee ageinst vs. And
why? For if God bee on our syde, who shalbee ageinst vs, sayeth
Saint Paule?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 30.</note> And wee see also how Dauid defyeth, both all his
enemyes, and also death, saying: though I should walk in the shadowe
of death, &amp; within the graue:<note place="margin">Psal. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place he saith agein.<note place="margin">Psal. 3. a. 7.</note> Though I were beset round about with a million
of enemyes, yit should I not shrink. And why? for God is
with mee. Were wee then as well perswaded of Gods almyghti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as wee confesse it with our mouth: surely wee should not bee so
soone dismayd, nother should our fayth bee shaken at euery brunt. So
then let vs conclude, that inasmuch as wee bee so weake, and euery
thing of nothing, will scare vs out of our wits: there is nothing but
hipocrisie in vs, and our confessing that God is almightie, commeth
not from our hart. So much the more therfore behoueth it vs too put
this lesson in vre, and too exercyze it nyght and day, that wee may taste
it throughly. And that is the cause why it is so often mentioned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs, for wee take it not too bee a matter of so greate importance.
But when our Lord dooth so often tell vs, that he hath al things in his
hand, that he disposeth of his creatures (as he listeth himself), and that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:168"/>
nothing is able too let his determination, nor the performance of the
things that hee hath promised: it is too the end that wee should yeeld
vntoo his promises, that which they behyght vs: that is too say, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
wee shall seeme too bee at the poynt of vndooing, and the diuell
shall giue vs so whole skirmishes, as we shall see no way too escape,
nor any end of our distresses: let vs think thus with our selues, who is
he that hath spoken it? Who is he that hath promised too bee our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender?
Is it not he that is almyghtie? Could not he with one blast
blowe away all that the diuell practizeth? Though all the world were
ageinst vs, what could it doo, so our Lord voutsafed too maynteyne
our part? After that maner must wee aduaunce Gods power aboue
the whole world, that wee may rest vppon his promises. For (as I
haue sayd alredye) Gods woord, and the power of bringing too passe
the things conteyned therin, are things vnseparable. And wee blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
God, as oft as wee bee in dout and perplexitie, whether he bee
able too performe his defending of vs or no. For sith he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it: out of all doubt he wyll perfourme it, or else should his power
bee shortened, which is impossible. And so yee see why Saint Paule
hath spoken heere of Gods power. And that also is the cause why the
prophets, in speaking of the succour which God hath alwayes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
too reskew the faythfull withall from death, when they bee

made both heauen and earth? This should seeme too bee farre fet. For
the cace is, that I am in some trubble, and haue none other refuge, but
onely Gods pitying of mee, whereof I seeke too bee assured: and he
telleth mee, I haue created heauen and earth. He seemeth too send
mee very farre, and too make mee leape out of Gods blissing intoo the
warme sunne. But Gods telling of vs that he created heauen and
earth, is too doo vs too vnderstand, that it belonges too him also too
rule his creatures, that he hath a care of vs as of his children, that
there is not any thing aboue or beneath, which is not subiect too him,
and that he turneth all things round about, &amp; too and fro as he listeth.
Sayeth he so? Then must wee out of hand apply it too our benefyte,
so as wee doubt not but that his power hath such preheminence, as
he is well able too roote out whatsoeuer seemeth too bee ageinst vs.
And so yee see how yee must alwayes haue the sayde cheyne to tye
Gods promyses, &amp; the truth of the brynging of them to passe togither.</p>
               <p>And S. Paule sayeth, <hi>that he can doo all things aboue our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23289:168"/>
and our thinking.</hi> Not without cause hath he inclozed heere
all that belongeth too our saluation. For he that trusteth in God for
one thing, will not misse too enter into debating, whether he will adde
a second benefite, or a third. That therfore is the cause why S. Paule
will haue vs too looke for all things at the hand of our God. And he
sayeth, <hi>Aboue our asking.</hi> Trew it is that wee must not fall asleepe,
when wee would bee succored and gouerned at Gods hand, or be filled
with his benefites: but if wee beleeue in his woord, we must also bee
moued too pray: for it is a trew proof of our fayth, when wee resort so
vntoo our God.<note place="margin">Psal. 55. d. 23.</note> And for that cause is it sayd, that the faythfull must
discharge all their cares intoo his lappe. For it is the trew record of
it, when at all tymes of our neede, wee resort too him, who will haue vs
too seeke all our welfare in him alone. The faythfull therfore must be
diligent in praying,<note place="margin">Coloss. 4. a. 2.</note> according as S. Paule sayeth in another text,
wher he exhorteth vs too prayer and supplication, and setteth downe
this diligence also, too the intent wee should haue no slothfulnesse too
plucke vs backe. But albeeit wee giue ouer all our wittes too pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vntoo God: yit notwithstanding, considering the necessities that
compell vs too resort vntoo him, God must bee fayne too outgo our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes,
and too doo much more for vs than wee requyre. And for
proof therof, when any (of the faythfull) feeles his owne infirmities,
he will streyt wayes humble himself, and theruppon repayre vntoo
God, and that not for once only, but euery minute of an houre. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
he will resort to him both for his body and his soule, and think
thus: Alas, yit want I such a thing, I must too him agein. Lo how
the faythfull doo throughly sift out the miseries and wantes wheruntoo
they bee subiect, therby too prouoke themselues too pray vntoo God.
But doo not wee think that the diuell hath a hundred thousand wyles
which wee perceyue not? And God must bee fayne too prouide for
them, or else what would become of vs? For although wee feele that
diuerse things doo pinch vs, yit are ther many other things that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
and hidden from vs. So then it will alwayes bee found trew,
that God outgoeth all our prayers, and all our wishes. Mark that for
one poynt. Therfore let vs doo what wee can, and indeuer too resort
continewally vntoo God: and yit therwithall let vs bee fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he must bee fayne too watch ouer vs, and too bee much more
sharp syghted than wee, in espying what wee haue neede of, and the
meanes also that are fit too compasse it to our behoof: all these things


<pb facs="tcp:23289:169"/>
must God bee fayne too looke too. And so must wee cast all our cares
vppon him,<note place="margin">Psal. 55. d. 23.</note> as I alledged afore out of the Psalme.</p>
               <p>And soothly his adding of <hi>aboue our abilitie too thinke,</hi> is too
shewe that although men bee inlyghtened by the Gospell, too distrust
themselues, too walke in feare, yea, and too bee abashed at the syght of
their owne wretchednesse: yit perceyue they not the hundreth part of
it, but must bee fayne too referre the residew vntoo God, and too looke
for more at his hand, than they can wishe. And herewithall S. Paul
sheweth vs, that wee cannot passe measure, in trusting vntoo God, and
in asking him the things that wee haue neede of. In deede wee must
not vse a foolish libertie, too pray too God too giue vs this, or that, as
our fleshly desyre prouoketh vs. For wee must referre our selues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vntoo him: and specially we must in praying, fyght ageinst all our
owne lustes, that wee bee not too importunate in them. And in good
sooth, weee see what hath befalne too such as would needes haue God
too graunt all their demaundes too pleasure them withall. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israell were fed with flesh,<note place="margin">Exod. 16. c. 13. &amp; Num. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were redye too burst: but whyle the meate was yit in their throtes,
Gods wrath and vengeance fell vppon them. It had bin much better
for them, that their request had bin denyed, than graunted. Therfore
when wee pray, wee must not take such libertie, as too say, that God
should bee subiect too our affections and desires, but wee must aske
him the things that he hath promised vs, assuring our selues that hee
will lyke well of our requestes. And (as I sayd afore) let vs not feare
that wee shall bee too excessiue, for wee see that he will doo yit more,
and so had he neede too doo. And let vs not bee afrayd too bee blamed
of any presumption or malapertnesse, in assuring our selues of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
In deede if men warrant themselues more than Gods woord
will beare them out in, or beare themselues on hand that they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
whatsoeuer they imagine in their owne brayne: all such hope
shall doubtlesse bee a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ope. But if wee ground our selues vpon Gods
truth, which is sure and vndeceytfull: let vs hardily reache out the trust
farre and wyde which wee haue in him, and let vs not doubt but he will
performe it too the full, yea, and much more too, as S. Paule sheweth
vs heere. Yee see then, that the summe of the things which wee haue
too remember in this streyne, is, that wee must behold Gods benefites,
not onely those which wee haue had experience of, but also which are
seene through the whole world, that they may moue vs to praise Gods


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23289:169"/>
name, and that there may bee such an agreeable melodie among all
the faythfull, as they may honour God for all the benefites which he
bestoweth generally vppon the whole body of his Church. And agein,
that wee must hope that he will go through with all that euer he hath
once begunne: and that inasmuch as wee haue already felt how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
he is vntoo vs, so that he hath sought vs out when wee were stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from him, and pulled vs out of the bottome of hell: wee must
not doubt but that he will hold on still, and increace the benefites more
and more which wee haue felt already in part: And furthermore that
in praying vntoo him, wee must haue an eye too the great number of
necessities, which moue and constreyne vs too come vntoo him, and
theruppon consider, that he will doo much more for vs, than wee can
wishe, and that wee bee so weake witted, and so vnskilfull, that we wote
not what is meete for vs: howbeeit that he remedyeth the same twoo
wayes, namely, by stirring vp vnutterable gronings in vs, as is sayde
more fully in the eyght too the Romanes:<note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. c. 25.</note> and on the other syde by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
such vnskilfulnesse, so as he taryeth not till wee craue his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
but preuenteth vs through his mercy, notwithstanding that wee
welter in our wretchednesse, and perceiue not the tenth part of the
things that wee want.</p>
               <p>Now heervppon Saint Paule exhorteth the faythfull, <hi>too vvalke
as becommeth their Calling, vvherin they bee called.</hi> This is not
only too the intent they should thanke God with their mouthes, as he
warned them too doo: but also too profit themselues by the spirituall
giftes which they receyue, and too put them too such vse as God may
bee glorifyed by them. For if wee should set foorth all Gods pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and in the meane whyle men could perceyue no zeale of honoring
and seruing him in all our lyfe: it were but a feyning, and such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
were but an vnhalowing of Gods name, when our lyfe were
not answerable theruntoo. Not without cause therfore dooth Saint
Paule adde heere, that men should walke according too the calling
wheruntoo they bee called. And theruppon wee haue too marke, first
that forasmuch as wee bee slowe, and there is euer too much sloth and
coldnesse in vs: wee cannot deuyse a better way, nor which may touch
vs more too the quicke, too make vs go on forewarde in the obedience
of God, than too thinke vppon his infinite mercie which he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towardes vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too the Romanes, intending too win the faythfull too teachablenesse,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:170"/>
and too put their trust in God, setteth before them the mercie that they
had receyued at his hand. As if he should say, that whensoeuer wee
heare of the stone that ought too bee remoued, or thinke vppon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
goodnesse which God hath vsed towardes vs, in that he spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his only sonne, but gaue him for our saluation, voutsafing too
haue him offered vp in sacrifize, too put away the rememberance of
our offences and misdeedes: it ought too clyue our hartes asunder.
Therfore in this text he setteth Gods calling of vs before our eyes.
Truth it is that wee bee sufficiently bound aforehand by nature too
serue and honour God: for wee haue our lyfe of him, and we liue heere
at his cost: and wee see how all his creatures serue vs. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is bond great ynough whensoeuer the ruling of our lyfe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too Gods will, commeth in question. But seeing he thinkes it
not ynough too haue set vs in the world, and too giue vs sustenance for
our bodyes, but also taketh vs too bee his owne children, too bring vs
vp in his Church, which is his house, and vpon his adopting of vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyghteth
vs the inheritance of heauen, and too assure vs of it, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs the pledge that I spake of, that is too wit, our Lord Iesus
Christ: seeing wee knowe that God hath so manie wayes vttered the
infinite loue that he bare vs: ought it not too inflame bs too runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him, too the end that by renouncing our selues more and more, wee
may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeuer too giue our selues so vntoo him, as he may quietly haue
the vse of our whole lyfe, and wee mynd none other thing than the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his name? Yee see then wherat Saint Paul looked, when he
sayth, that he warneth the Ephesians too walke agreeable too the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
wherein God had set them. So then, wee haue too gather vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this text, that to correct the slothfulnesse that is in vs, and specially
to subdew the stubbornnesse that hindereth our pleasing of God in all
poyntes, (for it is certeyn, that all our thoughtes, and all the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our nature are inclyned vnto euill, &amp; doo both draw vs back and
driue vs farre of from the obedience which wee ought too yeeld vntoo

God hath, shewed vs, in making vs parttakers of the spirituall goods

and bitter frute. Let vs beware (say I) that God haue not iust cause
too blame vs now adayes, as well as he did them. For if the people of

God now adayes since the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ. For

that haue wee at these dayes in truth and substance, wee bee

if wee bee vnthankefull, and acknowledge not the good that God

Lord hath drawen vs out, and reskewed vs from the tyrannye of death,
and called vs too his kingdome of lyght, too the intent that wee should
blaze abrode his vertewes, and bestowe our whole lyfe in magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him too the vttermost: according too this present text, where it is
sayd, that wee must walke according too the vocation that God hath
called vs vntoo. Now this importeth a gathering and drawing of vs
out by our selues, as though God ment too make a new world of vs.
And in verye deede the thing whertoo the death and passion of our
Lord Iesus Christ tendeth, is, that we should bee sholed out from the
vnclenenesse of the world. Seeing then that wee bee as it were sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out by our selues, and God hath dedicated vs too himself, intending
too haue vs for his inheritance: let vs learne not too disappoynt him of
his purpose. And if wee bee the children of lyght, (as he sayth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. b. 8.</note>) let vs walke no more in darknesse, as the vnbeleeuers
doo, but let vs make the grace effectuall which wee haue receyued.
That is it in effect which we haue to remember concerning the woord
Uocation or Calling. Too bee short, we shalbee much more blame-woorthie
than the sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie ignorant and blynd soules, if we indeuer not too
hold our selues as it were locked vp vnder Gods hand, and vnder his
guyding. Truth it is, that at this day there is no corner of the world,
but it is so corrupted, as is horrible too see: insomuch that euen they
that haue had no tast at all of the Gospell, but haue bin nuzzeled and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:171"/>
imbrewed continually with superstition, shal not fayle to be iustly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
at Gods hand. And as for vs, it is certeyne, that wee shall
haue a much harder account too make, for that God inlyghtneth
vs with his woord, and wheras other folkes stray and wander in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
he sheweth vs the way of saluation, calling and alluring vs
daylye vntoo him. Seeing then that wee haue such a priuiledge: wee
ought too bethinke our selues well, that wee quench not the lyght, by
thrusting it vnderfoote, and so put away the speciall grace that was
graunted vs, and which God voutsafed too direct vntoo vs, too the end
wee should bee the more prouoked too serue him.</p>
               <p>But by the way wee must marke well how S. Paule sayeth, that
this must bee doone with all <hi>submission and lowelinesse, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience
and meeknesse.</hi> Hereby he ment too expresse that it is not
ynough for euery man too imploye himself too the dooing of his dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
but that we must also reach out our hands eche one too his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and brother, so as God may bee serued with one common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
among vs. Let vs marke well therfore (forasmuch as the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
cannot bee dispatched at this tyme) that S. Paul speakes not
heere too euery man seuerally, but that he comprehendeth al the whole
bodie and companie of the Churche. As if he should say, my frends,
it is not ynough for euery of vs too withdrawe himself and too abstein
from all euill, and too shewe himself well mynded and zealous too liue
in the feare of God, and in all vprightnesse: but wee must also haue a
mutuall care one of another, and bee fully resolued that it is no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of God, if we indeuer not by all the meanes wee can, that others
may doo the lyke. And so wee see heere how it is the rule of all the
faithful (first) that euery man looke too himself, and though all the
world bee mad in doing euill, yit notwithstanding that he which is
taught in Gods schoole, doo hold himself in awe and vnder subiection,
and consider whertoo he is called: and therwithall that if there bee
many of vs, and God haue shed out his grace so as he hath gotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Churche, wee must to the vttermost of our power, seeke to ioyne
with them whom God calleth, as well as vs, so that he which goeth
formest, reache his hand too him that is next him, and say, let vs goe
altogither, and one of vs incorage another, that he which goes faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and hath infirmities in him, bee taryed for by those that go swifter,
and bee borne vp also if neede be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, so as wee may all bee drawen vntoo
God. And this must not onely bee doone in euery towne and village,


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23289:171"/>
but also wee must looke yit further of, and consider that they whom
we knowe not are neuerthelater of the body of our Lord Iesus Christ,
and therfore wee must serue them for looking glasses and examples,
and confirme them so much the more too leade a godly conuersation,
by shewing them the way that they may followe vs. And let vs also
profite our selues, so as if wee see any other men more vertuous, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and constant than wee bee, euery of vs may bee ashamed of it,
and saye thus too our selues: How now? Is it meete that thou
shouldest lag behynd, when other folkes marche on so fast afore, and
runne so cheerefully toowards God? Yee see then that the thing in
effect which wee haue too beare away heere, is that inasmuch as
God hath not called vs eft one man alone, and eft another, as though
he ment too sette vs a sunder, but directeth his voyce too all, and will
haue it serue for a holy bond vntoo all: wee also must aunswer him,
not onely with our mouth, but also with our whole lyfe, and there
must be trew vnitie among vs, and we must indeuer to bring to passe,
that God may bee purely worshipped euery where, and consider that
sith wee bee called all too one inheritaunce, there ought too be a ryght
brotherhood among vs, and that sith wee call vppon God as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it becommeth vs as his children too bee ioyned too our head, that
is to wit, to our Lord Iesus Christ. And when wee bee so ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him, it is certayn that wee shal not bee cut of from those whom he
will haue too bee of his body, nother shall the hand despyze the foote,
nor the foote holde scorne of the hand: but forasmuch as wee knowe
that our lyfe resteth onely in Iesus Christ, wee shal indeuer as much
as wee can too vphold one another, and pray too God too strengthen
vs ageinst all Satans assaults, &amp; ageinst all that he can practize to set
vs at ods, that wee may mainteyne the battell, and with inuincible
constancie followe still the way which God hath shewed vs, vntill wee
attayne too the heritage which he hath promised vs, and purchaced so
deerly by our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the Maiestie of our good
God, with acknoweledgement of our sinnes, praying him to drawe vs
too trew repentaunce, so as wee may bee vtterly cast downe in our
selues, too bee set vp agein too serue him, and that not for one day, but
so as wee may hold out too the end, that as his grace neuer fadeth, so
wee on our side may neuer ceasse too serue him, but according as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
his gifts in vs, so wee also may bee more and more inflamed to

come nerer too him, and too bee throughly knit vntoo him. And so let

for performance hereof, wee haue neede to
correct the vyces that are in vs. For on
the one side wee see how men are well neere
all inclyned too loftinesse, selfsoothing, and
selfweening, whereof by and by breedeth
scornefulnesse. For he that couets too aduaunce himself, must needes
abace his fellowes, too make himself their superiour. Then is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that there should bee agreement among vs, vntill wee haue
rid our selues of this pryde and ouerweening, wheruntoo wee bee too
much giuen. But if wee bee once knit toogither: then will wee also
bee meeke. For what is the cause that wee bee so sterne towardes
our neyghbours, and that there is nothing but rigor and roughnesse
with vs, but for that euery of vs coueteth too ouermayster other? That
then is the cause why there is no gentlenesse among vs. And therefore


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23289:172"/>
S. Paule hath matched meekenesse with lowelinesse: for lowelinesse
is the moother of meekenesse. Last of all, he setteth downe pacience
or sufferance, in bearing long with mens infirmities and vyces. For
if wee will needes serche out by parcell meale whatsoeuer wee shall
see to be amisse in euery man: surely we shall haue occasion to reiect
both great and small: for there is not that man which is not blemished
with some euill. But haue wee once abated the pryde that I spake
of, and thereuppon conformed our selues too meekenesse, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so as wee can fynd in our hartes too bee warned and too beare
with others: and none of vs is so hindred by his infirmities, but that
he can abyde too make account of other men as of his brethren: then
shall the Church by that meane abyde alwayes in good plyght.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon S. Paule addeth, that if wee intend too keepe the
vnitie of spirit, wee must liue toogither in peace. For wee know, that
when any fyre of strife is kindled, euery man would haue his enemyes
drowned in the bottom of hell. So soone then as wee giue the brydle
too our affections, so as wee fall too spyting of this man or that man,
and there groweth any hartburning or grudge ageinst vs: then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth

               <p>And heere wee haue too mark first of all, how Saint Paule in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Lowelinesse, meekenesse, and pacience, warneth vs, that if we

surely they are euer so hygh mynded, as thy wil not be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, except

<pb facs="tcp:23289:173"/>
that vyce, and indeuer too rid our selues of it, which thing wil not bee
doone very easly, for it is a hard battell. But howsoeuer the world go,
wee must not giue ouer, till wee haue gotten so much aduauntage of
our selues, as too knowe that there is nothing in vs why we should be
esteemed, but rather that he which thinketh himself too bee excellentest
of all, ought (by that tyme that he hath sifted and examined himselfe
throughly,) too bee ashamed and abashed at his owne wretchednesse.
And for proof therof, when we haue throughly vewed al that wee
weene our selues too haue, wherwith too win vs any fauour, dignitie
or reputation among men: certaynly wee shall fynd that euery whit
of it is the free gift of God. Now then, so much the more neede haue
wee too humble our selues, seing that God byndeth vs so vntoo him.
What hast thou (sayth S. Paul) too boast of aboue other men,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. b. 7.</note> and to
chalendge as thine own? It is certain that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it thee, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
honour him for it, which thing thou canst not doo, so long as thou
art puffed vp with pryde. So then, considering that al the vertues for
which wee myght bee praysed, are all records of Gods goodnesse, and
that he hath shewed himself a louing father towards vs, in that it hath
pleased him to haue vs come neere him after that fashion: it ought too
make vs cast downe our eyes, and too walk in all meeldnesse. And
if wee compare our vertues with our vyces, surely wee shall fynd
much more wherwith too beate downe our hornes, than wherfore too
set them vp. For when a man hath cast his cards throughly: he shall
perceyue that although he haue some good zele too serue God, yit dooth
he but llmp and halt still in that behalf, and that he hath no vertue in
him, which is not blemished with some spot, so as there is alwaies one
thing or other in him, too put him in mynd that he ought not too bee
proud. Agein, his vyces are euer mo in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber a great way, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
What shall wee then doo, but be ashamed of our selues? For we
doo after a sort defyle the holie things, when wee mingle our owne
deformities in that wyse with the gifts of Gods spirit. And therfore
he that dooth moste excell, hath cause too bee the more lowely, for that
he is so much the more bound vnto God. Yee see then that they which
are esteemed as peerlesse perles, and exalted as little woorse than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
ought alwayes too brydle themselues short, knowing that there
is not so little a blemish in them, which ought not too bee taken for
greeuouser in them, than in such as haue not receyued so great gifts,
ne be so excellent. Besy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s this, there are also vyces in vs euen of our


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23289:173"/>
selues (as I sayd afore): and if there bee any good in vs, God hath
giuen it vs of his owne mere and freebestowed mercie. And therfore
it is not for vs too presume, but wee must impute all euill to our selues.
Hee then that maketh such comparison, will sone beate downe his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerweening
wherwith he was puffed vp or deceyued.</p>
               <p>Now if the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>test sort of al, haue not wherof to vaunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues:
what shall the meaner sort doo, and such as are dispyzed too the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and haue nothing too set themselues out withall? They fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
nature, if they will needes vaunt themselues. Too bee short, a
man shall alwayes fynd this auncient prouerb trew, that he which
knoweth himself best, will esteeme himself least. But wee must passe
yit further: which is, that we must vnderstand how we be not any thing
of our selues, nor can doo aught that is any thing woorth, and that the
good which God hath put intoo vs, ought too serue too teach vs meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
When wee once know that well, then shall wee bee throughly
humbled, say I. And the trew Lowlynesse or humilitie is not too
make a fayre face, or too pretend a myld countenance, as many doo,
who will speake gently and louingly, and looke rufully, and yit for all
that, ceasse not too bee as full of pryd, as toades within. Too be short,
humility importeth such a meekenesse, as pulleth vs downe in our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and suffereth vs not too aduaunce our selues for any degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
nor too seeke estimation aboue our neyghbours. Now I haue
told you, that wee shall neuer bee meeke, nor neuer haue any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and myldnesse in vs, vntill wee bee brought lowe. For pryde doth
euer hold scorne of all the world. And wee see also, that such as are
ouerweening, and stand in their owne conceyt, beleeuing themselues
too bee well woorthy, and too deserue too bee exalted aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
aray, doo therewithall become very straunge, insomuch that men
dare scarce looke vppon them: they thrust away one, and driue away
another a great way of. Therefore wee must haue learned too hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selues, too the end wee imbrace such as are our trew brothers,
specially sith wee knowe that wee haue neede too bee borne with at
their handes. For behold, it is sayd of our Lord Iesus Christ, that he
dooth easely let vs come vntoo him,<note place="margin">Math. 4. a. 1.</note> bycause he himself was tempted,
and made lyke vntoo vs, and that he beareth with our weakenesse and
infirmities, bycause he hath had experience of them in himself. Now
it is certeyn, that our Lord had not any vyce in him, for he is the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring
of all goodnesse. Yit notwithstanding, too the intent that wee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:174"/>
on our syde should not sticke too resort too him familiarly, and too the
end wee should bee heard of God his father for his sake, it is sayd, that
he had compassion on vs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. d. 15.</note> bycause he had felt what man and mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
are, howbeit, without any spot of sinne, as I sayde afore.
Now then, how shall wee doo, if wee haue this foolishe beliefe, that
wee bee throughly perfit? Seeing that pryde is so rooted in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
how shall wee pitie such as wee see in myserie, if wee consider not
first, that wee bee no better woorth than they? So then, let vs marke
well, that too bee kyndharted, gentle, and freendly, all pryde must first
bee beaten downe in vs.</p>
               <p>Furthermore let vs marke also, that kinde heartednesse is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of pacience, and the continuall bringer foorth of that frute: and
that if wee bee too sterne, it is a signe that there is crueltie in vs, and
that wee be as wild beasts. And therby also we be conuicted of pryde
and ouerweening, &amp; that we haue not well learned the Lesson that S.
Paule copyeth vs out heere. In deede wee ought too bee greeued at
the faults of our neighbours, &amp; wee must not feede them by our flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
as the common fashion of the world is. But yit must our zeale
bee so measured, as we must beare with a great sort (for we our selues
also haue neede too bee borne withall) and not bee hastier with other
folkes, then we would that they should bee with vs, but alwayes kepe
this naturall vprightnesse, of not dooing that thing to our neighbour,
which wee would not haue doone too our selues, which is the summe
of the Lawe and the Prophets as our Lord Iesus Christ sayeth. Yee
see then how our zeale ought too bee mingled with kynd hartednesse:<note place="margin">Math. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 12.</note>
for if it bee sauced altoogither with vineger, what will come of it?
There wilbee no taste or sauour in it. Therfore it must haue some
oyle put vntoo it. And so there must bee some temperature in all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
too sweeten them withal, that they bee not ouer rigorous.
Too bee short, S. Paule ment too shewe vs heere, that although we
ought not too bolster out any euill, but rather too be moued with God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zeale to condemne such as deserue it: yit notwithstanding we must
not reiect the weakelings, as though they were vtter reprobates or
castawayes, but labour too winne them too our God, according as
wee haue seene already, that that way ought too bee obserned. For
there are two euill extremities: but looke whatsoeuer God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
by his holy spirite, that will alwayes bee found too bee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans welfare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:23289:174"/>The one of these euill customes, is, that a man cannot be wel ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the world, except he flatter. Who so intendeth to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
himself, must play the blinkard and shut his eyes, when he sees
a number of things in his freends woorthy of blame. And yit in the
meane while is not such silence a secret betraying? For we see,
that they whom wee pretend to loue, are in the high way to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wholly hardened in their naughtinesse: and yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
wheras we ought to waken them, or else too set a looking glasse
before them, that they might behold their leaudenesse, and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it, wee winke at it. In steade of so dooing, euery of vs dooth
cokes other, and cloketh the things that ought too bee sharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked:
insomuch that those flatteries are no better but playsters too
ease the sore, and in the meane whyle to feede the roote of it within.</p>
               <p>The other euill extremitie, is when wee bee so rigorous, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
little fault is ynough too make vs too storme. Sith it is so, wee
shall neuer haue the spirit of meekenesse aforesayd, if wee bee not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and gouerned by Gods spirit (as I sayd afore.) And heerby a
man may see and iudge, that there is a certeyne pryde lurking within
vs, wherethrough we take to much vpon our selues. To be short, there
is neuer any ouer great rigour without crueltie, nor crueltie without
pryde. Whosoeuer dispyzeth his neighbors, setteth to much by himself:
&amp; he that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beare with nothing, but is so terribly sterne, that al sinnes
are (in his opinion) vnpardonable: sheweth also that there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
or humanitie in him. So much the more therfore doth it stand
vs on hand, to beare in mynd that which S. Paule sheweth vs heere,
which is, too forgiue and forbeare. Not that we should allowe mens
vices (as I sayd afore) nor that they should haue leaue too doo euill
without rebuking, but that wee should paciently rebuke mens faults
and bee sory for them, and in so dooing of our dewtie, not forget also
to beare with the frayltie and weakenesse of our neighbours, so as we
shame them not, ne stryke them intoo such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eauinesse, that they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
dispayre, when they see there is no forbearing, nor any forgiuing at
our hands. That then is the thing that wee ought to beare in mind.
And it is the very cause why S. Paule addeth, that men should beare
one with another in charitie or loue. As if he sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uld say, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we bee brothers toogither, there should neede none other rule
than that, too make vs as well kind hearted, as also pacient and lowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And for proof therof he sayeth in the thirteenth of the first Epistle


<pb facs="tcp:23289:175"/>
to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. b. 4.</note> that Charitie hath these three things: First, that it
is gentle and kind hearted: Secondly, that it moueth vs too be lowely
and meeke, and thirdly, that it is pacient, and suffreth al things. Those
are three qualities which Paule attributeth vntoo louingnesse. For
if wee demaund what is the rule of holy life:<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. c. 14.</note> the Scripture telleth vs,
that loue is the full performaunce therof,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. a. 5.</note> bycause it is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and the end and fulfilling of the Lawe. Lo how these Texts
doo teach vs Charitie. Agein, our Lord also intending too conclude
the doctrine of the Law,<note place="margin">Math. 22. d. 39.</note> setteth downe these twoo poynts: Namely
that wee should loue him with all our hart, with all our mynd, and with
all our power and strength: and our neyghbours as our selues. Then
if wee thinke too bee allowed of God, and charitie reigne not in vs,
wee deceyue our selues. The world may like well of vs, but all our
whole lyfe shall bee vtterly lothsome before God, vntill Charitie bee
setled in our hartes, so as shee gouerne vs, and wee tend alwayes vntoo
hir, yea and woorke all our woorkes by hir. Now then, seeing that
loue is the trew perfection of the faithfull, and of all Gods children: let
vs see what it importeth. For if a man brag that he hath it, and in the
meane whyle haue nother lowlinesse, nor gentlenesse, nor pacience: he
maketh the holy Ghost a lyer, who not without cause sheweth, what is
betokened by Charitie or loue. For he hath not set downe the bare
woord, and only sayd, be yee charitable: but he hath also shewed vs
what is ment by it. Namely first of all, that wee must beate downe
this pride which beguyleth vs, and maketh vs dosse with our hornes
ageinst God, insomuch that it were right hard for vs too bee lowely
mynded towardes men, when wee cannot hold our selues meekely in
obedience vnder God. Now then, let vs fyght in such wyse, as all
pryde may bee corrected in vs: and therwithall inforce our selues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
too humilitie, that wee may bee kynd harted and fellowlyke
with the faythfull: which cannot bee doone but by bearing one with
another. The very heathen men had the skill too say, that if wee had
the wit and discretion too see the vyces that are in our selues, we should
bee pacient toward others. For why? I haue neede too bee borne
withall my selfe, and if I doo not the lyke too other folkes, how partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doo I deale? This consideration alone ought too tame vs suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
though there were nother Lawe nor Gospell. Wherefore in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as wee knowe that charitie importeth these three things: let vs
learne too bee pacient, not onely when any wrong is doone vs, but also


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:23289:175"/>
when wee see our neyghbours too bee weake and feeble, and not yit
come too such perfection as were requisite. And though they bee not
so well foreward and settled in Gods woord (as wee would wishe,) yit
let vs pitie them, and with all meekenesse indeuer too vse such correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards them, as nother their vyces may bee nurrished, nor the
parties themselues bee cast in despayre. Thus yee see what wee haue
to mark vppon that streyne.</p>
               <p>Now heervppon Saint Paule inferreth further, that (as I haue
touched heertoofore) wee must keepe the vnitie of the spirit, or the bond
of peace. For he setteth heere the vnitie of spirit, as a marke that is
requisyte in the Church and flocke of God: insomuch that if wee bee
at oddes among our selues, wee bee at oddes with God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
he sheweth vs the thing that wee haue seene breefly before:
which is, that if wee bee not at one among our selues, God disclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vs, and telleth vs wee belong not vntoo him. This vnitie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is a thing that ought too bee much set by now adayes, seeing it
is the meane in respect whereof wee bee acknowledged for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Trew it is that the wicked and the vnbeleeuers haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies,
and are so linked one too another, as there is not a strey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
allyance too bee found in the world. For euen their euill dooings
doo bynd them one too another, as though they were fast sowed toogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
bycause they perceyue themselues too bee hampered, insomuch
that he which hath conspyred in some mischeef with another naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>packe,
will bee afrayd of him, and that feare is as a bond that cannot
bee broken. Howbeeit Saint Paule presupposeth heere, that the
faythfull are at one in God, as he will declare anon. For this cause
he sheweth them how the same vnitie may bee kept. <hi>It is</hi> (sayeth he)
<hi>the bond of peace.</hi> For when a fyre is once kindled, it is not so soone
quencht ageine. Wee imagin that when wee cast our selues intoo a
chafe, wee can come too our selues agein by and by, and all shall bee
whist and still out of hand agein. No: for the diuell dooth so set in his
foote, that the stryfe and contention turneth too a deadly sting, so as
men are inuenimed with it more and more, and although they shewe it
not outwardly, ne cast vp their rage and froth: yit notwithstanding
some hartbyting and hartburning will lurke still within, when there
hath bin anie debate. And therfore (as I sayd) let vs not thinke that
when anie trubble is stirred vp, it wilbee pacifyed so soone as wee
would haue it. In consideration wherof Saint Paule telleth vs,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:176"/>
that the Church shall perishe euery turning of a hand, through that
fyre, if wee continue not in quiet, and shun all stryfe and debate.</p>
               <p>And now he sheweth what maner of attonement or vnion it is that
he hath spoken of, saying, <hi>that there is (but) one God, and one fayth,
and one Baptime: that there is (but) one hope vvheruntoo vvee
bee called: and that there is (but) one God and father of our Lord
Iesus Christ, vvho is aboue vs all, and in vs all.</hi> It was very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
that this should bee added, too shewe that peace shall neuer bee
good nor allowed of God, but rather accursed, vnlesse it haue a good
groundwoorke. For what a peace were it, if wee would now adayes
linke in with the Papistes? Wee should bee fayne too forsake the
pure doctrine of the Gospell, and too bend our selues ageinst God, and
too defyle our selues with all manner of filthinesse and abhomination.
But it were better that the whole world were sunke; and we with it,
than too seeke such peace. As much should wee bee fayne too doo in
respect of the Turkes: for there is none of them both but he seeketh too
wrappe vs in destruction, and too plucke vs away from God. Now
if there bee such attonement among vs, as wee will needes inioy all
that our fleshly lust craueth: what confuzion will there bee? Uerely
oftentymes Gods seruantes are accuzed of conspiracie, and of spyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
malice and stubbornnesse, bycause they cannot fynd in their hartes
too consent too anie wickednesse: insomuch that they which are in any
authoritie and credit, would vsurp any manner of tyrannie too hinder
the preaching of Gods woord, as it ought too bee, and deuyze
what they list of their owne brayne, so that albeeit there bee preaching
still, yit shall it not bee free according too Gods woord. If Gods
seruantes bee driuen too this: needes must we be trubbled by Satan
&amp; his champions: and we shalbe both blamed and diffamed euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
For such folke will alwayes doo their office, in turning good
intoo euill by their false reportes and flaunders. Howsoeuer the world
go, no peace is commendable, but such as doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h so ioyne vs toogither,
as God reigneth ouer vs, and wee become all one in him: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that, it shalbee but cursednesse. And so yee see why Saint Paule
calleth vs backe heere too God, and too our Lord Iesus Christ, and
vntoo fayth of the Gospell and to Baptim, too shewe how we ought to
agree among our selues.</p>
               <p>Now then, wee haue heere twoo poyntes too beare in mynd. The
one is, that in seeking attonement with men, wee must alwayes haue


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23289:176"/>
our eye vppon God, and when wee bee come too it, wee must bee setled
in it more and more. That is a thing which wee must euer haue a
care of. Now in generall it is trew, that peace is too bee desyred,
and that the verye name of it is had in estimation among men. But
yit for all that, wee must not so shroud our selues vnder the shadow of
peace, as too separate our selues from God, that in the end wee make
warre ageinst him, and he proclayme vs too bee his enemyes. And
for that cause it is sayd, that wee must bee at continuall battell with
the wicked. For in asmuch as they serue Satan, they wil not ceasse to
fyght ageinst God and our saluation. And therfore wee must not bee
cold and negligent in that behalf, but zelous in setting our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
them: insomuch that although they bee in honour and credit,
yit let vs abhorre them, as it is sayd in the Psalme: let them be vntoo
vs as stinking and lothsome thinges, and full of filth and vncleannesse.
Though they boast neuer somuch of their greatnesse, yit let vs assure
our selues, it were much better that they were drowned with all their
brauerie in the bottom of hell, than that they should so exalt themselues
ageinst God. Yee see then that we must esteeme the greatest men of
the world, no better than Woormes, when they dare so bend their
hornes ageinst God: and consequently that wee can haue no peace
with them, seeing wee should bee fayne too forsake God for their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
But (as I sayd afore) it were better that the world were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpsyde downe, than it should bee so. Now then if wee knit toogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in God, let vs followe the rule that is giuen vs heere: that is
too wit, too bee so abaced in our selues, as the world may perceyue
by our myldnesse, that there is no more loftinesse in vs too set vs at
oddes. And lyke as kyndhartednesse bringeth pacience, so also let
vs condemne mens vyces, and yit labour alwayes to drawe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
vntoo God, and too win them vntoo him, rather than too set them
of through sharpnesse.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come too the woords that are couched heere by S.
Paule. Hee sayeth, <hi>that we be one bodie and one spirit, as we bee
called too one hope of our calling.</hi> First and formest he sheweth
vs, vppon what condition we bee called of God: that is too wit, that
there should bee such a knot among vs, as myght shewe that wee bee
in very deede the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ. For it is not ynough
for vs to be cast vp togither lyke a heape of stones: but wee must bee
knit toogither with a hartie good will. And lyke as it is sayd, that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:177"/>
there was but one hart and one mynd among the faythfull (in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church:<note place="margin">Actes. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 32.</note>) so must the same appere among vs too at this day.
Saint Paule then in telling vs that wee be one spirit, and one bodie,
meaneth that wee bee made as it were all one man in Iesus Christ.
For Iesus Christ can well fynd in his hart too communicate his name
too all the companie of the faythfull, and that is too the ende too drawe
vs the more too the sayd affection of liuing toogither in concord and
brotherly loue, euen with such attonement as wee may bee brethren,
that is to say, so knit toogither, as the fingers of a hand: for without
that, wee can neuer shewe that wee bee desyrous too atteyne too the
kingdome of heauen. That therfore is the thing which he ment by the
twoo woords <hi>Bodie</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Trew it is, that when Gods spirit gouerneth vs, he reformeth our
affections in such wyse, that our mynds are knit toogither. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the cace stand, Saint Paul ment too declare, that all the whole
bodie of the faythfull is but as one man. For it is not for any man to
put foorth himself there, but wee must bee linked all toogither, euery
man in his office or calling. Too be short, we must be but all as one,
as shalbe declared anone more at length. Forasmuch then as there
is none other too gouerne vs, but Iesus Christ: wee must needs bee
made all as one man in him. And soothly wee knowe that the thing
which was sayd of Adam and Eue, and of all maryed folks and their
wyues, must also bee accomplished in the Church: which is, that the
Churche is bone of our Lord Iesus Christs bone, and flesh of his flesh,
and soo there is a mariage betwixt them. Now if we bee so knit all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
to the sonne of God: it is reason also that we should agree amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
our selues, &amp; that one vnion should extend through al the whole bodie:
for it is vnpossible that our Lord Iesus Christ should reigne ouer vs,
&amp; yit notwithstanding that wee should bee diuyded among our selues,
seing that he is but one. Let that therfore serue for the first poynt.</p>
               <p>Now Saint Paule too stirre vs vp the better heruntoo, telleth vs,
that wee bee called vntoo an inheritance. In saying so, he sheweth
that there is a much holyer attonement betweene vs, than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the (naturall) brothers of this world. For although they bee
borne of one father and one moother, so as they bee but one blud: Yit
notwithstanding, eueryman shifts for himself anon after, and the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
is parted among them, so as the brethren seeme too be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
asunder, and the naturall bond that was among them before, too be


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23289:177"/>
half broken. But wee haue an inheritance that cannot be broken. A
man cannot say, I haue that which belongeth too mee, I will get mee
away, and I will dwell alone by my self. For what is our inheritance?
It is God himselfe. And moreouer the heauenly lyfe, which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, and wherintoo he himselfe
is gone afore vs, too gather vs thither too him. Seeing then that
wee bee all called too one selfsame inheritance, if any of vs shrink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde
from his brethren, it is all one as if he gaue ouer his part in
the Kingdome of heauen. But wee woulde abhorre such a blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.
If a man should demaund of anie of vs whether he woulde
renounce his part of paradyce, it would make the heares too stand vp
vppon his head, I meane euen of them that haue no feare of God at al.
No dout but there are some so wicked and monstrous beasts, that they
will flush out this blasphemie out of their mouth, that they renounce
theyr saluation. But if yee ask it of a man that is well aduyzed: hee
will alwayes abhorre and detest it. Yit notwithstanding, in verye
deede wee go about too shet our selues out of the gate, and too barre
our selues from comming in the kingdome of God, and wee wype
awaye the hope of it that is giuen vs by the Gospell, when wee bee not
knit toogither among our selues. Were this througly printed in our
harts: surely there would bee another maner of freendship and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlinesse
among vs, than there is: and men should see other maner
of meekenesse, meeldnesse, and pacientnesse. Now though wee haue
hithertoo bin misaduyzed, yit is it much better too take warning late
than neuer. Wherfore let vs lerne by this doctrine of Saint Paules,
that whensoeuer we bee prouoked too displeasure, so as wee seeme too
haue some cause too reiect one, too leaue another, and too separate our
selues from him or hir: we must vnderstand, that we haue all one hope
of the kingdome of heauen, and that Iesus Christ who is our head, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs all vntoo him, with this condition set afore vs, without which
wee cannot come at him, which is, that wee must shew truely, and by
our deeds, that wee make account of all such as are partakers of the
Gospell with vs, as of our brethren, and as though they were our owne
flesh and blud, and also that we bee so ioyned toogither, as the fingers
of one hand, as I sayd afore.</p>
               <p>And heeruppon, S. Paule going foreward with the same doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
sayth, <hi>there is but one Lord.</hi> It is certeyne that heerby he
meaneth one God, who hath soueraigne dominion ouer vs, and is our

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
bee at ods. In the Twelfth Chapter of the first Epistle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
S. Paule sayth, that there is but one God, too shewe the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
which wee owe vnto God, specially for graunting vs of his gifts
wherwith too edifie his Churche. But his attributing of souereyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vntoo God in this Text, is too do vs too wit, that we cannot serue
God, vnlesse wee bee at vnitie among our selues. And why? For
although a mortall man be variable, and chaunge his mynd from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
too night: yit will he not haue any discord in his house: if there
be any broyle, or if there ryse any strife, he cannot away with it. And
what shall God doo,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. g. 33.</note> who is the God of peace (as he nameth himself in
the Scripture) seeing he wil haue vs too gather toogither vnder him,
and telleth vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. f. 33.</note> that he sitteth among vs, and that wee bee his house?
Thinke wee that wee can wynd him intoo our troubles, contentions,
skirmishings,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. b. 9.</note> hurliburlies, and heats with vs? Then should he bee
fayne too transfigure himself, and to chaunge his nature. But let vs
not imagine that he will deny himself (as S. Paule sayeth) but he shal
bee fayne too cut vs of as rotten members, and too shewe that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not vntoo him, when he seeth that wee come nothing neere him.
And therfore let vs resort too the sayd souereintie and dominion which
God hath ouer vs, too the intent too alay all strifes and variances that
Satan shal indeuer too rayze vp among vs. For if Seruants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with another, &amp; haue hartburning, grudge,
or such other things among them selues, doo neuerthelesse brydle them
selues for loue of their mayster, and agree agein among them selues:
what shal we do, when as the cace concerneth the pleasing of our God?
So then S. Paule declareth in effect, that when wee bee so wayward
and can beare with nothing, but will fall out for euery small and light
occasion: it is a token, not onely that wee dispyze men, but also that
we rebell ageinst God, and are lothe to yeeld hym any subiection.
Thus yee see in effect what we haue too consider vpon that saying.</p>
               <p>Now he addeth, <hi>that there is (but) one faith, and (but) one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,
and (but) one God, the father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> His
saying that there is but one fayth, is too shew, that wee haue one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
treasure, euen in this world. For he hath spoken already of the
heritage which wee hope for, and which is warranted vs in heauen,
though it bee not manifested too vs as yit. Now what is the pledge
of the endlesse lyfe, but the Gospell? And that haue wee in common


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23289:178"/>
toogither. Seeyng it is so: then if the faythfull should forsake one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
company, surely the Gospell should bee as good as torne in
peeces. For wee must alwayes wey well this woord <hi>One,</hi> which S.
Paule hath couched heere, and so often repeted, in saying, that there is
but one hope of our calling. And how? Hereby he sheweth that wee go
about too breake and disperse the kingdome of heauen, (as much as in
vs is) when wee liue not in concord. It is sayd, that there is but one
God: it is then as it were a heawing of the hope of our saluation in
peeces, when wee cannot suffer God too gouerne vs, and too holde vs
vnder his protection. So now, when he sayeth, that there is but one
fayth: surely it is not long of vs that the Gospell is not torne in peeces
and gobbets, and rent all to fitters, as they say, when we cannot agree
with our brethren, nor beare with them gently and paciently, as was
commannded heeretoofore. That then is the thing whereuntto God
calleth vs.</p>
               <p>Now wee ought too profit our selues by it dubble. The one way
is, by abhorring all diuersities of opinions, and by looking well to our
selues, that wee haue but one fayth in our hart, and but one confession
in our mouth. For if the faythfull doo contrarie one another, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
that they shewe sufficiently, that they haue not the Gospell on
their side: at least the one part must needes erre from the truth of God.
It is trew, that erewhyles it may well happen, that all of vs shall not
conceyue one selfsame thing: and in that cace S. Paule shewes vs a
remedie, which is, that he which is not sure that God hath reuealed
the truth vntoo him, should hold himselfe in quiet, and pray God too
leade him further. But yit in the meane whyle, it behoueth vs too bee
fully resolued of the Articles of our fayth, and too agree so toogither in
them, that if euery of vs bee demaunded seuerally, he may shew, that he
holdeth none other thing, than that which is the generall beliefe of the
Church. That then is the first poynt which wee haue too marke, in
S. Paules telling of vs that there is but one fayth. Howbeit, this
fayth is not one, bycause men haue found meanes in their brayne too
vnite themselues toogither (by it:) for God must bee fayne too bryng
them too it, bycause they cannot come thither, nor abyde in it one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
except God strengthen them in his truth. Then must there needs
bee an interchaungeable bond betweene fayth and the Gospell: that
lyke as the Gospell (wherof God is the author) is but one, so our fayth
also must bee but one. Also as touching the doctrine, it is not ynough


<pb facs="tcp:23289:179"/>
for vs too confesse God altoogither with one mouth: but it must also
teache vs too holde our selues so linked toogither all in one vnitie, as
euery of vs doo trauell too his neyghbours benefite, and consider wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee may serue his turne, and apply our selues faythfully thervnto,
bearing with them that are weake, honoring them that haue receyued
more largely of Gods giftes than wee, and making none account of
our selues, that wee may atteyne too the hyghnesse wheruntoo God
calleth vs, which is, that wee may bee parttakers of his glory, when
wee haue so humbled our selues, and walked in this world with all
lowlinesse and modestie. Thus much concerning that it is sayd in this

By Baptim wee put on Iesus Christe, (as he sayeth in another
place) and bee ioyned vnto him, to be parttakers of his lyfe, and of all
his benefytes. Now there is but one only Baptim, wherin the name
of Iesus Christ is alwayes called vpon, as he is our Redeemer. Wee
bee Baptized in the name of the father, as the author of our saluation:
in the name of the sonne, as of him that hath performed all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
too our Redemption: and in the name of the holy Ghost, by
whom wee bee sanctifyed, too possesse and inioy the incomprehensible
benefytes that are purchaced for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that God dooth so call vs too him by a visible signe: must it
not needes bee that wee bee too froward, lyke wyld and mad beastes,
if wee continew not in such vnitie as he commaundeth? And not
without cause hath Saint Paule matched Baptim and beleef of the
Gospell heere toogither. For he had respect of our rudenesse. Wee
bee so dull, that wee conceyue not spirituall things, vnlesse they bee set
downe agreeably too our nature. Saint Paule spake heertoofore of
hope too Godward: and now bycause we perceyue not the things that
are aboue the world, or doo not easly vnderstand the doctrine: he spake
lykewyse of the vnion of fayth, and of the vnion of the bodie and the
soule. Well (will some man say still) all this is spirituall, &amp; passeth
mans vnderstanding. Yee see then, that the things which he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heertoofore myght seeme somwhat darke, so as wee myght not
fynd such sauour in them as were requisyte. But Saint Paule brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vs backe too the visible signe, wherby God giueth vs an incling
of himself, according too the infirmitie of our flesh. For in Baptim
wee see the water, which sheweth vs that wee bee washed in the blud

                  </gap> wee bee all vncleane,
and vtterly reiected and cursed of God: in the death and passion of our
Lord Iesus Christ, wee bee reconeiled vntoo God his father, and by
that meane are called too the glory of heauen, and renued by the power
of his holy Ghost. Yee see then that wee must needes bee too dull
and brutish, if wee perceyue not the thing that is so visible and opens
For it is all one as if God had set vs forth an image in shape of the
thing that is too hygh for vs, by reason of our frayltie. Too bee short
Saint Paules intent here is not too separate Baptim and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
asunder: but he hath rather added it as a visible mark, to the intent
that if wee at the first brunt vnderstand not the vnitie of fayth, wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
wee bee led by Baptim, he may doo vs too wit, that it is all one as
if God had printed the marke of adoption in our harte, too shewe that
wee bee his: for being once Baptyzed with water, wee doo all heare
Iesus Christ, according as it shewed vs by that visible signe. And
now that Baptin is ordeyned, shall euery man haue a Baptim of his
owne by himselfe: No: but Baptim is alwayes but me. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must haue an eye too our selues, and dedicate our selues too

performance therof we must also be well vnited togither. And by these
woordes of S. Paules, wee may see playnly, that the father, the sonne,
and the holy Ghost, are but one God. For if Baptim bee in such wyse
one, as it serueth too bring vs too an vnitie of body and soule, that is to
say, to a brotherhood that passeth all the allyances of the world: what
shall it bee when wee come vntoo God, of whom Baptim taketh all

               <p>Now too confirme the matter yit better, he sayeth, <hi>that euery of vs
hath receyued grace according too the measure of Christes gift,</hi> or

maner too drawe vs too him: which is, by dealing foorth his giftes in
such wise vntoo vs, as euery of vs hath neede too bee helped and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored
of his neyghbours. For of our selues wee bee so wedded too our
selues, as there is none of vs but he would be as alone, were it not that
necessitie constreyneth and byndeth vs too those whom wee haue neede
of. God therfore too correct the pryde and presumption that are too
deepely rooted in mankynd, hath so delt foorth his giftes by certeyne
measure, as euery man perceyueth well, that he is bound and beholden
too him for the things he hath receyued,<note place="margin">Math. 25. c. 27.</note> and that there is no such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in himselfe that he can forbeare other men, but that wee must

will, as euery of vs indeuer too make the things that God hath giuen
him, auaylable too the profit and furtherance of his brethren: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
bee contented too borrowe of other men, and too suffer himselfe
too bee helped and succored at their handes, according as hee sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
too haue neede thereof. And this serueth too bring vs backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
too the thing that wee haue seene afore, namely, that wee shall
neuer haue agreement among vs, without humilitie and meekenesse.
Wee see then wherat S. Paule amed. He handleth the same matter
in the .xii. Chapter of the first Epistle too the Corinthians. For there
he taketh the similitude of a mans body,<note place="margin">2. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

farre out of our wittes, when euery of vs despyzeth his neyghbours
and is wedded too himselfe. How now, sayeth he? Our members or
limmes haue no particular vnderstanding by themselues: the hande
hath no wit too conceyue by reason what his office is: no more haue
the fingers that are fastened too it, no nor yit the legges, nor the feete.
Then is there not any part of the bodye that hath any priuate vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
too it selfe. But yit notwithstanding, the hand dooth willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledge it selfe bound too serue all the rest of the body, so as it
neuer refuzeth too doo it. If there bee any ache, if there be any disease,
or if there bee any other neede, alwayes the hand is walking from to
syde too thother. Now vp, now downe, and is continually occupyed.
The feete also, without hauing any other vnderstanding, that onely


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:23289:182"/>
a secret selfmouing of nature, can skill too beare vp the rest of the body,
and are neuer looth too doo it or greeued at it. Lykewise the hand dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyneth
not too borrowe helpe of the other members, as knowing full
well, that it is not able too mainteine it selfe alone. Lo what an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungable
companionship there is among the members of a body.
And now hath God so called vs too him, that he will haue vs too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all one in Iesus Christ, as hath bin sayd afore. Dooth it then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
that euery of vs should bee a whole body by himselfe? No: for
wee see on the contrarie part, how God hath so dealt vntoo euery man
his portion, and vntoo all in generall: that it is as a bond too hold vs
toogither in concord, too the intent wee should not bee puffed vp with
so fond ouerweening, as too say, I haue ynough of myne owne, I passe
for no body else. Gods will then is not, that euery man should bee a
whole and perfect body of himself: but that one should bee as a hand,
another as a finger, another as an arme, another as a leg, another as a
shoulder, and another as a foote. Too bee short, God hath so dispozed
his giftes among vs, as wee must needes perceyue, that if euery of vs
will draw alone by himselfe, he shall by and by bee as a rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
bycause he can haue no firme continuance in the whole body, if he
will needes bee separated from the rest of the members. And what
will followe of it? It must needes perishe. Euen so is it with vs. That
therefore is S. Paules meaning, when he sayth, that Gods grace is
giuen too euery of vs.</p>
               <p>Then sheweth he first of all, that if wee haue any excellencie, it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not too make vs proud,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. b. 7.</note> for wee bee beholden too God for it: wee
haue nothing of our owne, as wee haue seene alredie by his vsing of the
same reason, to the intent that no man should presume too much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but walke meekely and soberly, giuing all the glory vntoo God.
So then, he sayth agein, that whosoeuer is most excellent, hath no cause
too exalt himselfe aboue his neyghbours, for he hath nothing of his
owne, but must accknowledge that he hath all of God. And after what
maner? Euen by confessing that it is his freebestowed gift. Yee see
then, that for the first poynt, Saint Paule ment too rid men of the vyce
which they bee too much inclyned too, that euery man myght beware
of exalting himself. Trew it is, that there is none of vs al, but he coulde
fynd in his hart too bee a maister ouer other men: but S. Paule sayth
vnto them, yee wretches, what are yee? What is it that you can claime,
too say, I haue this or that of mine owne? for yee hold all thinges of


<pb facs="tcp:23289:183"/>
the mere free gift of your God. And therfore cast downe your heades
euery one of you, and consider there is none but only God, which ought
too haue all preheminence. As for you, yee must learne too stoope too
him, and too hold your selues contented euery man with his degree, so
as yee labour and indeuer too serue your neyghbours, and al the whole
commonaltie or body of the Church.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit Saint Paule addeth moreouer, <hi>that it is according
too the meazure of Christ,</hi> according vntoo that which I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
that is too wit, that we shal not fynd perfection in any man aliue,
but euery man hath neede too bee succored, and that not only in respect
of this common lyfe. Trew it is, that our Lord sheweth vs aforehand,
how it is his will too hold vs linked toogither, bycause wee would bee
too fleeting too separate our selues asunder. For euery of vs cannot
bee a Baker, euery of vs cannot bee a Husbandman, euery of vs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee a Cutler: insomuch that there is not that man which needeth
not the help of one that seemeth his inferiour, yea and a rascall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of himself, nother could we liue one day in this world, without
communicating toogither. Our Lord brydleth vs in this aforehand,
bycause he sees wee bee as it were harebrayned, and would hardly bee
kept in vnitie. But heere he treateth of the spirituall giftes, wherby
God sheweth that he is a father too vs, and holdeth vs as the houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke
of his Church. Let the perfectest man that is, examin himself
and he shall fynd, that his receyuing of more than other men haue, is
in such wyse, that it is by meazure. Howsoeuer the cace stand, let
none of vs presume too haue all: for it must needes bee, that a man is
too much blynded with pryde, if he bee of that mynd. But when wee
haue our meazure, let vs consider the twoo poyntes which I haue
touched afore:<note place="margin">Luke. 7. g. 43.</note> namely, that he which hath receyued the larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,
is the more streytly bound too imploy euery whit of it too the
common benefyte of the Church. And moreouer that he must helpe
himself by his neyghbours, and consider that he cannot forbeare them,
and therfore conforme himself quietly vntoo them, and seeke no more
but to be as a member of the body, that all of vs may hold on toogither
too our head, desyrous that Iesus Christ may haue such prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
ouer vs, as euery of vs may obey him, and he leade vs too God
his father. And so yee see what Saint Paule ment in speaking of
the sayd meazure.</p>
               <p>Now it standeth vs on hand too marke well how he sayeth, <hi>that it


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23289:183"/>
is in Iesus Christ,</hi> bycause it is he in whom wee be linked toogither.
For (as hath bin shewed heertoofore) what is our spirituall kinred?
Although it spring of God, as of the fountayne of all goodnesse: yit
could it not flowe downe vntoo vs, except Iesus Christ were among
vs,<note place="margin">Ephe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 10.</note> and that wee were gathered toogither by his meane. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
also as wee haue seene in the first Chapter, how it is his office too
gather all things toogither (both in heauen and earth,) that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
asunder before. Then let vs marke, that for asmuch as God
hath not giuen men such perfection, that euery one of vs can lyue of
himself alone, wee must cling toogither in peace and concord: For it
is certeine that God could well haue made vs perfect out of hand, so
as nothing should haue wanted in vs: and that he is no nigard in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
vs with his goods, so farre foorth as he knoweth too bee for
our behoof. Seeing then that there is infirmitie in vs, why dooth not
God knit vs too him out of hand? Why holdeth he vs still in such
weaknesse? Why giueth he vs not an Angelicall power and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
As I sayd afore, he will haue vs to learne too liue warely and
awefully, knowing that it standeth vs on hand to haue him go through
with the thing that he hath begun. And therwithall we must also liue
meekly &amp; gently one with another, and not be so proud as to despyze o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, and too draw aloofe from them, but rather consider that they
may helpe vs, and that there is not so bace a person in Gods Church,
which hath not receyued some thing wherwith he may bee able to doo
seruis too his neyghbours. That then is the thing that wee haue
seene alredye. Agein, if wee thinke that a poore sillie soule hath no
learning too teach vs, and that wee can receyue nothing at his hand:
let vs beware that wee doo not preiudice the grace of God. For it is
certeyn, that looke how many haue anie tast and feeling of the Gospel,
wee haue record, that God dwelleth in them by his holy spirite. For
fayth is the singular gift of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. a. 3.</note> and it is a sure token that God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in euery man, where wee see any feeling and knowledge of the
Gospell. Also it is certein that euerye little drop of Gods grace is
woorthie too bee esteemed, so as there is no cause in this beehalfe
why pryde should hinder our linking toogither, or that wee should not
consider that all of vs are members of one bodie. Let that serue for
one poynt.</p>
               <p>And therwithall on the other syde,<note place="margin">Luke. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. a. 2.</note> let euery of vs looke well to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for wee shal yeeld account of the benefyts that God hath bestowed


<pb facs="tcp:23289:184"/>
vppon vs, and the more a man hath receyued, the more blamed shall
he bee, if he indeuer not too discharge himself of his duetie in seruing
of his neyghbours, as I sayd afore. For the end of all Gods giftes
is alwayes too edifye one another, that Gods Temple may gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, and bee still rered too his full perfection. And so yee see
how wee ought too bestowe the spirituall giftes that wee haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at Gods hand. For the same cause also it is sayd, that such as
know the Gospell,<note place="margin">Luke. 16. b. 8.</note> ought too shewe by the conuersation of their whole
lyfe, that they bee the children of lyght, and not as blynd wretches that
wander in darknesse. Wherfore let vs learne to make Gods giftes
auaylable in such wyse, as he may bee glorifyed by them. And in
that respect is mention made expresly of meazure, too the intent wee
should not alledge for our excuce, that this man or that man gaue vs no
good example. For when it standeth vppon commendation, then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of vs beares hymfelf on hand, and would perswade all the world too
beleeue, that he is very excellent. And yit in the meane whyle wee
consider not, that God hath bound vs dubble, in voutsafing too shewe
so large bountifulnesse toowardes vs, as too set vs in hygher degree
than our neyghbours. Therfore let vs bethinke vs better of it, both
generally and particularly, than wee haue doone. Generally, for that
wee haue the Gospell freely preached heere among vs, and for that
wee ought vniuersally too bee as a burning Cresset, too shew the way
of saluation.<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 35.</note> And particularly, by discharging euery man his owne
duetie, that wee giue no cause of stumbling too our neyghbours, but
rather indeuer too drawe them too vs, which are aloofe from God
and his truth, and also take peyne too confirme and put foreward them
whom God hath set alredie in a good trade, and in the ryght way.
But alas: Men discharge themselues ill of that. For according as
any man hath the excellenter giftes, so will he needes ouermayster
all others, and bee woorshipped as an Idoll: and so in the meane
whyle the vnion is broken, in manner of all handes. And yit for all
that, (as I sayd afore) it is impossible that we should linke toogither
in brotherly concord, but by conforming our selues too such as are of
the Church, as too our owne members. Without that, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for vs too bee truely linked in one, and yit yee shall see that euery
man couets too bee had in estimation. Agein, when it commeth too
the edifying of others, we doo cleane contrarie too that which Saint
Paule telleth vs heere. For in the fourteenth and fifteenth too the


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23289:184"/>
Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. a. 1. &amp; 15. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> he sheweth that wee must deale, as if a strong man should see
another man weake: so little ought he too vtter his strength too the
broozing of his neyghbour, that he ought rather too beare him vp. As
who should say, that if I had a little child to lead, I should breake both
his armes and his legges in running hastily with him. And if another
man that is much stronger than I, would needes tyre mee, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that hee is lustyer than I, by trying his abilitie and force ageinst
mee: is it meete that I should bee cast downe by him? Therfore wee
must (as I sayd) haue a care too fashyon our selues in such wyse too
our brethren, as the stronger sort doo not shoulder their neyghbours
that are feeble and weake, nor vexe them by laboring too ouercrop
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by force:<note place="margin">Ezech. 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 21.</note> ne doo as the Prophet Ezechiell vpbraydeth, namely that
such as abuse their corage &amp; strength after that sort, are as Goats that

too doo, and wherfrom wee bee farre of.</p>
               <p>Also it is certein that the Citie of Geneua ought generally too bee
as a burning Cresset, too giue lyght too such as are yit farre of from

and I beeleeue it. For had the partie bin well aduyzed, surely he would

not our selues too bee blynded after that fashyon by Satan, and so
rocked aslepe, as wee consider not what is told vs here, namely that if
wee haue receyued anie grace or gift at Gods hand, wee must set more
store by it, and put it too such vse, as God may bee glorifyed, and his
Church furthered by it: or else wee shall haue a dreafull account too
make, for giuing cause so of offence too the weake. And it had bin
better that that filthie trash had bin consumed a hundred tymes with
fyre, than too haue bin so brought foorth in open place, in the syght of
all such as lye in wayt for vs a farre of. For of a truthe wee knowe
well ynough that there are manie which watch vs, and seeke nothing
but too spye some cause too speake euill of vs, not only too mocke vs
for our labour, for wee bee woorthie of that: but too blaspheme Gods
name. Therfore if a man haue ouershot himself once, it is good that
he should bee warned of it, that he may take better heede hereafter: and
that wee knowing that God hath bound vs so deeply vntoo him, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
vs, and by dooing vs more honour than we deserue, in voutsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
too haue vs too bee his people, and too make vs glorie of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the pure doctrine of his Gospell, we may profit our selues the
better by it, and bee afrayd least if wee chaunge after that sort, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so rechelesse as too fall too taking of leaue too doo what wee list:
God shewe vs that he is able too take away the things that hee hath
giuen vs, and too dispossesse vs of them when he listeth.</p>
               <p>Now Saint Paule addeth heere the maner how God is so liberall
vntoo vs in Iesus Christ, and yit notwithstanding dealeth the gifts of
his holie spirit too eche man by certayne meazure, &amp; not to euery man
alyke, but as he him self thinketh good. He sayeth, that this was done
<hi>by our Lord lesus Christs ascending vp intoo Heauen.</hi> For then
did hee obteyne souerein dominion,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 9.</note> and the father gaue him a name
which is aboue all names, that all knees should how before him, as it
is sayd in another place. In deede our Lord Iesus Christ receyued al
fulnesse of grace at his comming intoo the world, accordingly as S.
Iohn sayeth in his first Chapter,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 14.</note> that al of vs receiue of him, to the end
wee may haue our fill of the good things wherof wee were hungrie

him without measure, as it is sayd in the same text. And the faythfull,
bycause they be members of the Church, haue receyued therof, and
God hath giuen too euery man his portion, and according too the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his only sonne. But as for him, God hath not giuen him his


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23289:185"/>
spirit by measure. And why? For hee is the head, and euerye man
must take his lyuelines from thence, and he therwithal haue all power
ouer vs. Wherfore let vs bee contented that euery of vs hath his
portion, that wee may walk in feare before God: and therwithall let
vs vnderstand that the perfectnesse is in Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Esay. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>. a. 1. &amp; Luke. 4. c. 18. &amp; Math. 3. d. 16.</note> bycause Gods
spirit resteth in him, and bothe greate and smal must bee fayne too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
too him, with acknowledgment of their pouertie, too obteyne
there the things that they want, and not be ashamed to receyue Christs
Almesse, as they that are destitute of all good things. Furthermore,
although our Lord Iesus Christ shewed himself too bee the only sonne
of God whyle he was conuersant in this world, &amp; proued the same by
his wonders, miracles, and gifts: Yit notwithstanding, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
intoo heauen, he shewed himself too bee the verye partie in deede
which had commission of God his father,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. b. 8.</note> too deale vntoo vs all
things that we haue neede of. And that is the cause why it is sayd in
the seuenth of Saint Iohn, that the holie Ghoste was not yit giuen,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. f. 39.</note>
bycause Iesus Christ was not yit glorified. It is very certeyn that our
Lord wrought euen then by the power of his holie spirit.<note place="margin">Math. 16. c. 16.</note> For when
Saint Peter confessed him too bee the sonne of the liuing God: it was
answered him, Flesh and blud hath not reueled this thing vntoo thee,
but my heauenly father. Too bee short, wee knowe well that there is
nothing but euill in vs, and that the good which God giueth vs, is by
his holie spirit, and that all things are committed too our Lord Iesus
Christ, and that it belongeth too him too deale foorth his doctrine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, according as it is told vs, that it is his office, and that the father
hath giuen him speciall commission too deale his gifts vntoo vs. And
in deede it is a cause also why the Prophet Esay sayth, that Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
rested vppon him, namely too shewe that if wee bee separated from
him, wee must needs perish as it were through drought and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But howsoeuer the cace stand, wee must alwayes come backe
too his poynt, that the holie Ghost was then powred out vppon all the
faythfull, when our Lord Iesus Christ was exalted, as it is sayd in the
other text. So then let vs mark, that when our Lord Iesus Christ left
the world, and was receyued vp intoo his heauenly glorie: it was too
the end that wee should thenfforth inioy his goods so much the better.
And that is also the cause why he sayd too his disciples,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16. a. 7.</note> it is erpedient
for you that I go away, for if I taried still with you, the holie Ghost
should not come. It is trew that our Lord Iesus Christ could well


<pb facs="tcp:23289:186"/>
haue giuen them his spirit whyle he was conuersant with them after
a visible fashyon, as well as he did when he was gone out of the world.
But we must not dispute of this matter after our own fancie:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> we must
vnderstand that our Lord Iesus was humbled for a time, yea and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
emptyed, as wee shall see more at length agein hereafter: but yit
was he receyued intoo his heauenly glory, too the intent he should haue
souerein dominion, and bee so exalted, as all creatures myght stoope
too him. Thus yee see how our Lord Iesus Christes will was to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
himselfe from vs in his body, too the intent wee myght the better
feele his presence through his dwelling in vs by his holy spirit. And
that is the thing which S. Paule treateth of as now, when he sayeth,
that for the same cause, <hi>it is sayd, that he vvent vp, and gaue his
gifts too men, after he had led away his enemies prisoners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this text (which is alledged out of the threescore and eyght
Psalme) sheweth, that God is verily exalted in the person of our Lord
Iesus Christ. In deede in that song Dauid preacheth aud singeth the
praise of God, bycause that beyng stablished King of Israell, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the figure of our Lord Iesus Christ, he had set vp Gods seruice in
his purenesse agein, redressed the great number of disorders that had
bin vnder the reigne of Saule, and finally prospered in a great sort of
victories, insomuch that God had vttered such grace vppon him, as it
appeared plainly, that his kingdome was not the kingdome of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and transitorie man, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t rather that God mynded too haue his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
knowen there. That is Dauids proper meaning. Therfore wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he sayeth, first of all, that God is gone vp, he followeth the common
manner of the speaking of the Scripture: for inasmuch as all things
had gone tootoo much too hauocke in the tyme of Saule: God seemed
too haue bin asleepe. Agein, Religion was as good as beaten down:
and there was such excessiue libertie of dooing euill, that a man would
haue sayd, that God gouerned not that people any more. Dauid then
sheweth a woonderfull chaunge, in that he sayth, that God is gone vp:
that is to say, that he shewed by effect that he had a care of his Church,
that he intented too keepe it vnder his protection, and ment too haue
his maiestie knowen there. That is one poynt. Hereuntoo he addeth,
thou hast led captiuitie captiue: meaning therby, that God had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
his enemyes round about him, of whom there had bin a great
number, which sought nothing else but the ruine and desolation of the
people. Therfore Dauid meaneth that as soone as God went vp, by


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23289:186"/>
and by he brake and bruzed the heads of his enemyes, so as they came
no more too trubble his people, as who should say, they had found by
experience, that all their practizes, force, and assaultes had booted
them nothing at all. Theruppon he addeth, that immediatly also he
receyued giftes of men: too betoken that they which had bin so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
had offered tribute vntoo God, as to their souerein King. Trew
it is, that this was doone in Dauids person. Neuerthelesse it was
Gods mynd too haue his glory shyne foorth in that man, whom he had
so chozen and sholed out, and whom it was his pleasure to haue anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Samuell.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. c. 12.</note> Too bee short, wee see what Dauid ment to declare
in that verse. S. Paule therefore applyeth the same too our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, and not without cause. For looke what was figured in the
person of Dauid, must bee referred too Iesus Christ, bycause he is the
truth and substance of all those shadowes, and wee haue in him a much
more royall performance of the thinges that are mentioned in that
Psalme. S. Paule therefore abused not that text, when he appropryed
it too the onely sonne of God, in saying, that he was exalted vp on high.
For (as he will declare hereafter) Iesus Christ was first abaced, and
afterward exalted. Yee see then, that God tooke as it were a new pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his Souereintie, not ouer all the world, but ouer his owne
people, too the end too gouerne them with their owne good wils. And
afterward he tooke possession of it ouer his enemies too. For in the

end that euery man should doo him homage: but also that he subdewed
the rebells. For there are nother diuels nor reprobates, but they bee
so beaten downe by the myghtie hand of God, as wee may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
that our Lord Iesus Christ is he of whom Dauid was the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
So then, S. Paule telleth vs heere in effect, that although our
Lord Iesus Christ dwell not among vs after the manner of men, nor
wee doo see him with our bodily eyes: yit must wee not therefore bee
separated from him in mynd. He is gone vp too fyll all things, not
with his body, but with his benefites and giftes. For how great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

which thing he sheweth vs by the giftes which he bestoweth vpon vs,
so as wee ought of duetie too bee drawen to the vnion that he hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. This then is the effect of the things which wee haue to gather


<pb facs="tcp:23289:187"/>
vppon this streyne, for as nowe the matter must bee broken of, but it
shall bee gone through with agein hereafter.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer the cace stand, let vs marke for a conclusion, that
Iesus Christ is not so farre from vs now adayes, but that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
by experience, that wee bee knit vntoo him, and that he vttereth
his riches too make vs parttakers of them, and that he fylleth vs with
them as much as neede requyres, at leastwyse according too the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and portion that hath bin spoken of. And therefore let vs labour
too serue our neyghbours, let vs foresee what may doo them good, and
let vs followe the order that God hath set among vs, assuring our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
that although our Lord Iesus is gone vp, yit is he not therfore so
farre of from vs, that he hath forsaken and giuen ouer his Church, but
that he is exalted, too the end wee should honour him by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him for our head. And seeyng we bee members of his body, wee
must serue one another, and not bee so v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lend their hand too such as come lagging after, and haue
much adoo too drawe their legges after them: so as wee may al come
too the perfection wherunto wee bee called.</p>
               <p>Now let vs cast our selues downe before the Maiestie of our good
God, with acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him that we may
bee so touched with them, as wee may yeelde our selues too him with
trew repentance, too our further profyting and strengthening all our
lyfe long, by acknowledging the miseries that are in vs: and that it
may please him so too beare with vs, that in the end hauyng obteyned
releasement of our sinnes, wee may bee prouoked too come vntoo him,
not doubting but he wyll alwayes acknowledge vs for his children,
too make vs inioy the heritage which he hath bought so deerely for vs.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Began this morning too expound the text
of the Psalme alledged heere by S. Paul,<note place="margin">Psal. 68. d. 19.</note>
shewing that all the things which are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
there, agree too the person of the onely
sonne of God. For although he say often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
by way of similitude, that God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vp, when he sheweth himselfe iudge of
the world, and defender of his Church: yit
notwithstanding inasmuch as when our
Lord Iesus Christ was come downe, he
was abaced as one that was beneath all men, and afterward was exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the power of God his father: therin we see most fully, how God
voutsafed too bee abaced, for a tyme in the person of his sonne, and too
bee in a state despyzed before men, and afterward would bee crowned
agein with glory and honour, as the Apostle sayeth of him in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
too the Hebrewes: and that is the cause why S. Paule sayth here,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2. b. 7.</note>
that it behoued him first too descend, too bee so exalted.<note place="margin">Psal. 8. b. 6.</note> But before wee
goo any further, wee must marke that heere S. Paule hath chaunged
the word. For wheras Dauid sayeth, that God <hi>Receyued</hi> giftes and
presentes, that is too say, tribute and homage of those whom he had
subdewed too his maiestie: S. Paule in stead thereof sayeth, that he
<hi>gaue.</hi> And so this is not rehearced as it lyeth in the Psalme: but the
Apostle ment too shew that the tryumph which our Lord Iesus Christ
made when he rose from death, surmounted all Dauids victories, and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:188"/>
all that euer had bin doone in shadowes and figures vnder the lawe.
For it is much more too giue than too take. Also wheras it is sayd in
the Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. a. 2.</note> that God receyued: that was not for himself, nor too his
owne vse: for wee knowe he hath no neede of any thing: but his recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
was too inriche his Churche. And that is the cause why it is
sayd,<note place="margin">a. Mac. 8 f. 28.</note> that the women which neuer stepped out of their doores, shall
haue their part of the pray or bootie.<note place="margin">Psal. 68 d. 13.</note> There therfore Dauid sheweth
that God was not glorifyed for any profit or aduauntage that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on his owne behalfe, accordingly as it is sayd that he is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his owne perfection, for he can nother increace nor diminishe:
but all redounded too the welfare of his Church. For Gods shewing
of himselfe too bee riche, is not by keeping of his treasures vnder dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lockes (as men say:) but by setting them foorth for all commers,
at leastwyse if wee seeke them with trew fayth. And forasmuch as his
riches diminish not, nor yit his liberalitie which he vseth towardes vs:
thereby wee knowe that he passeth all the men in the world. Then if
wee will defyne in one woord how God is riche: it is in beyng liberall
vntoo vs, vsing bountifulnesse, and by alluring vs too him too succour
vs in all our needes and wantes, according too this saying of his by
his Prophet,<note place="margin">Esay. 55 a. 1.</note> Come all yee that are thirstie, and drinke your fyll: yee
shall haue your fyll, not onely of water, but also of wyne and mylk. Too
bee short, he sheweth that they can want nothing, which wayt vppon
him, and put their trust in him. Therfore it is sayd in the Psalme, that
all shall haue their part of the spoyle,<note place="margin">Psal. 34 b. 10.</note> not onely the men of warre, (for
they myght hap too boast that they had gotten the whole pray by their
owne manhood and pollicie) but that the women which neuer stird out
of the house,<note place="margin">Psal. 68 d. 13.</note> and which did nothing but spin vppon their distaues, shall
haue part of the bootie, as though they had gotten the victory. Hereby
(I say) he sheweth, that Gods receyuing of tributes and taxes of such
as he had subdewed too his dominion, was not too increace himselfe
withall, but too make vs parttakers of all the benefytes that belong
too our saluation. And herewithall let vs marke well, how it is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that when God giueth vs his giftes, it is not to the intent that wee
myght father any thing vppon our owne vertue or prowesse: but that
wee should thinke our selues beholden too his mere free goodnesse for
all things. And so must all things bee referred too his glory. For the
more that he bestoweth vppon vs, the more ought wee too bee forward
and ready too confesse how much wee bee bound vntoo him. But the


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23289:188"/>
chiefe poynt is, that wee indeuer too make the giftes that wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
auaylable too the common edifying of the Church: that is too
say, that God may still bee more and more exalted, and the kingdome
of our Lord Iesus Christ increaced and augmented among men. And
so the condition (say I) wheruppon our Lord distributeth too euery of
vs the things that belong too him, and are his owne, and which he
could keepe styll too himselfe, is, that wee should doo him homage for
them both in woord and deede.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come to that whch Saint Paule addeth. He sayth,
<hi>that it behoued Iesus Christ to descend, according also as he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
intoo the lovve partes of the earth, and that therupon he
vvas exalted.</hi> Manie haue made ouer violent glozes vpon this place,
saying that Iesus Christ went downe, not only, into the graue, but also
euen intoo Limbo,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 8.</note> a place forged of their owne brayne. But Saint
Paule speakes simply, namely, (as it is sayd in the second too the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians) that bycause Iesus Christ was abaced, therfore God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exalted him too his ryght hand, and gaue him a souerein domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
too the end that all knees should thensfoorthe bowe before him.
Therfore wheras S. Paule saith, that Iesus Christ was abaced, he
meaneth it of his clothing of himself with our nature, wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
despyzed, without any dignitie, and without any reputation too
the worldward.<note place="margin">Psal. 22. b. 7.</note> According wheruntoo it is sayd in the Psalme, that
he was counted as a woorme of the earth, and not as a man, insomuch
that men tooke scorne too looke vppon him (as sayeth the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,)
and there was nothing in him that men could lyke of.<note place="margin">Esay. 53. a. 2.</note> Yee see
then that Iesus Christ did so submit himself to all reproch, that he was
disfigured,<note place="margin">Marc. 14 g. 65.</note> and men did spit at him, and mocke him, and doo him all
the wrongs that they could, and afterward he was exalted. And no
dubt but Saint Paule hath touched the thing heere which he discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
more at the length in the forealledged place:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 8.</note> which is, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the sonne of God ought too teache vs lowelinesse, and too
make vs walke playnly without taking any thing vppon vs aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. For who are wee? What is our state? When euery
of vs hath sifted himself throughly, what shall he fynd in him too boast
of? Wee haue many things too thanke God for: but too take vppon
vs that which is his, were a villanous trecherie. So is there nothing
for vs too doo but too cast downe our eyes. For behold, the sonne of
God could haue shewed himself in his heauenly glory and maiestie; so


<pb facs="tcp:23289:189"/>
as he could haue made all the world too quake: and yit wee see that
being borne in a stable,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. a. 7.</note> he walked all his lyfe tyme as one vnknowen
and vnesteemed, and in the end was put too death, and that not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
death, but a death that was so reprochfull, yea and cursed of Gods
owne mouth,<note place="margin">Deut. 21. d. 25.</note> that he was hild for accursed before God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles,
too the intent that wee myght be blissed for his sake and by his
meanes.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. b. 13.</note> Seeing then that Gods sonne was so abaced, haue not wee
good cause too stoope lowe? For God requyreth not that wee should
forgo anie thing of our owne, when he exhorteth vs too lowlinesse. And
why? for if wee knew what wee bee, wee would stoope lowe ynough.
Our head was not in lyke plyght when he came downe hither. For
why?<note place="margin">Iohn. 17 d. 24.</note> As it is sayd in the .xvii. of Saint Iohn, he possessed his diuine
glorie and maiestie before the making of the world. And yit for all
that, he voutsafed too abace himself in such wyze (as in the syght and
opinion of men) that too outward apperance he seemed too haue vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuen ouer his maiestie. It is trew that he continued styll in his
perfect state, but that appeered not. And that is the cause why Saint
Paule vseth the woord <hi>Figure or Shape:</hi> he appeered (sayeth he) in
the shape of man. For he meaneth that our Lord Iesus Christes
clothing of himself with our flesh, and his being despyzed and reiected,
were no derogation at all too his diuine essence. And why? for it was
but an outward shape. Then did he continue alwayes vnappayred,
and yit neuerthelesse he was seene too bee vnder all men. Who wyll
then refuze the same state, that wee should not bee lowly after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample?
The fathers that liued vnder the Lawe perceyued alredye
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of our Lord Iesus Christ, who was their head, and yit they had
but verie darke figures. Now then, seeing that Iesus Christ sheweth
vs the way,<note place="margin">Act. 14. d. 22.</note> so as he is entered intoo the kingdome of heauen through
many tribulations, and intoo lyfe by death, and is exalted on hygh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abacing lowe: what excuce shall wee haue, if wee seeing those
things, bee styll puffed vp with pryde, and cannot fynd in our hartes
too walke in meeknesse, considering that wee bee nothing? So then,
wheras Saint Paule speaketh of the lowe places of the earth: he
meaneth the humane nature which our Lord Iesus tooke vppon him
for our saluation, yea euen with addition of all the things that I haue
to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ched. For he shewed not himself as a great prince, nother vsed he
anie pompe or traynes of men too make himself dread in the world:


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23289:189"/>
but (as it is sayd in the two and fortith of Esay) he brake not the broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
reede,<note place="margin">Esay. 42. a. 3.</note> he quenched not the smoking flax, nother was his voyce or
crye hearde in the streetes.<note place="margin">Math. 12. b. 20.</note> Agein, besydes this wee see how he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
reproche, and how he abode it paciently: when he came too his
death, all men seemed too haue conspyred ageinst him. Therfore wee
must adde all these qualities too knowe how Iesus Christ descended
into the lowe partes of the earth. Howbeit, if we compare his diuine
maiestie with our nature, wee may well call all the earth the lowe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
&amp; although Iesus Christ had possessed the whole world: yit had it
bin nothing in comparison of his heauenly glorie. For what are they
which are in hyghest state of dignitie? They doo but craule heere lyke
Frogges,<note place="margin">Esay. 4. d. 22.</note> or (leape) lyke Gressehoppers, as sayth the Prophet Esay.
No maruell than though the whole earth bee termed a lowe and bace
place in respect of heauen. Howbeeit Saint Paules intent here was
too note breefly, that Iesus Christ voutsafed too stoope so lowe, as too
become a mocking stocke too the vnbeleeuers, yea and euen too bee
condemned and esteemed as a man accursed and forsaken of God, all
which things he indured for our saluation. It is good reason therfore
that wee should myldly and without geynsaying receyue Gods hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of vs,<note place="margin">Gala. 6. d. 17.</note> and beare in our selues the image of our Lord Iesus
Christ, by being shaken of, despyzed, and mocked for our simplicitie,
and that no man should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ke vppon him, or chalendge too himself
the things that are none of his. That, is the effecte of Saynt Paules
meaning.</p>
               <p>Now he sayeth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18. g. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>that he is gone vp aboue all heauens.</hi> Wherin we
see that the sonne of God hath not as now the lordship of this world.
For Saint Paules declaring that he is aboue all the heauens, is too
shewe, that the dominion which he hath, is heauenly, and diuine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting.
For the heauens themselues shall passe away,<note place="margin">Math. 24. c. 35.</note> and they
must needs vanish,<note place="margin">Mark. 13. d. 22.</note> as Iesus Christ auoweth with his owne mouth.
Now if the heaues bee snbiect too chaunging, and must bee doone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
too be renewed agein:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. b. 13.</note> if Iesus Christ dwelt in heauen, he should
bee subiect too the same state, that is too say, he should bee frayle and
transitorie.<note place="margin">Iames. 1. c. 13.</note> Then is he aboue all the heauens in his infinite glorie,
wherin there is nother chaunge nor turning about.</p>
               <p>And theruppon he addeth, <hi>that it is too fyll all things.</hi> By this
woord <hi>Fyll,</hi> he meaneth that Iesus Christ is not so locked vp in anie one
place, but that wee may feele him present, and that he dwelleth in vs,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:190"/>
and that he filleth all things. But surely that is not with his bodie as
some haue grossely imagined: but it is with his power, and with his
spirituall benefyts and gifts. Yit neuerthelesse Saint Paules intent
heere is too betoken a presence of Christ, too the end that wee may
knowe that we haue not lost anie thing by his absenting of himself from
the earth, so as he dwelleth heere no more after a visible fashyon. And
why? For he ceasseth not for all that, too execute his power euery
where, and to fyll all things: insomuch that wee haue all things of him
which are requisite for our saluation. That is in effect the verye mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of S. Paule.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs heere put in practize the exhortation that hath bin
touched afore: which is, that wee cannot bee taken for Gods children,
except wee become lyke too him that hath the ryght of the first borne.
Sith it is so: let vs willingly suffer our selues too be abaced, that God
may exalt vs: for by that meane did our Lord Iesus come too his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Agein, let vs apply all our senses to tast throughly what the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God is, in that it hath pleased him that his sonne which was his
image, should bee so abaced. Let vs consider how greate the loue of
our Lord Iesus Christ is, in that he voutsafed to hide his diuine essence
for a tyme, and tooke not vppon him as belonged vntoo him, but did
as it were stoope downe too the syght of the world. Sith wee see this,
let vs consider first of all, how precious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> soules were too the sonne of
God, seeing he voutsafed too stoope so lowe for our saks, and let vs es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme
of the Gospell wherby so greate a benefyte is communicated
vntoo vs, assuring our selues, that if Gods sonne had not come downe
vntoo vs, there had bin no meane for vs too haue come vntoo God his
father. For besyds that wee bee plundged heere in myre, and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
in vs but vtter frayltie: it is certeyne, that we beare as good as
a hell about vs, bycause the diuell is not without cause called the prince
of this world.<note place="margin">Iohn. 16. b. 11.</note> So then, seeing wee bee vnder the tyrannie of Satan
and of sinne, how could wee mount vpward, if Iesus Christ drew vs
not? But first it behoued Christ too come downe hither. And therby
are wee taught to woorship our Lord Iesus Christ alwayes in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which he hath taken of the mediatour: and wheras the vnbeleuers
and vnholie folk take occasion too despyze him, bycause he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed:
let vs honour him still as he deserueth. For wheras his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and maiestie were after a sort darkened for a tyme: that was too
giue the greater beautie too his mercy and louing kindnesse: which


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23289:190"/>
selfsame woord S. Paule vseth when he purposeth too expresse well
what earnestnesse of mynd and care God had, too raunsome vs from
the dungeons of death. And so yee see in effect what we haue too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
vppon the Apostles woords, where he sayth, that Iesus Christ
was so abaced.</p>
               <p>And wheras he addeth, that he went vp aboue all the heauens: I
haue told you alredye in one woord, that it is all one as if he ment too
exempt him from the aray of creatures, knowing that as now hee is
not subiect too any chaunge. And for the same cause is it sayd in the
sixt too the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. b. 10.</note> that he suffered once in dying for our sinnes: but
yit for all that, dyed not (for euer,) bycause he is entred into the lyfe of
God, that is to say, he is made parttaker of the immortall glorie, so as
wee haue iust cause to cast downe our eyes. And bycause wee conceyue
not this so hygh souereintie which was giuen him, let vs honour it, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that euen the Angels of heauen do beare vs companie therin.<note place="margin">Psal. 96. b. 8.</note> For
it is not for nought sayd in the Psalm, that all the Angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
him, when he shewed him self too the world: which text the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
also applyeth to his person in the first chapter too the Hebrews.<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. a. 6.</note>
Herewithall let vs mark, that although Iesus Christ be not shet vp in
anie place certayne: yit he ceasseth not too keepe still the trew nature
of his bodie. For the Papists haue imagined, that although he bee in
heauen, yit he is euerywhere else as well as there: yea and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
they haue their speculations, too shewe how it is no inconuenience
at all, that God should haue his beeing aboue, and therewithall also
bee beneathe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too haue the bodie of Iesus Christ in Almbrye: by reason whereof

of the trwe nature of our Lord Iesus Christ. In defence therof they
alledge, that if it had the propertie of a bodie, it must needs bee in one
place certeine. But aboue the heaueus there is no place, (too speake
after the maner of the philo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there: (ergo (say they) his bodie hath not the properties of a bodie.)
Yis, and wee knowe that the Angels haue no bodies, and yit are they
not euerywhere, for they be faine to go whether soeuer God appointeth
them. Now seeing that the Angels are not tyed too any place, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that their essence is not infinite, but comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in


<pb facs="tcp:23289:191"/>
a certeine measure, though they haue no proportion of members:
why should not Iesus Christ bee aboue all the elements of this world,
yea and aboue all the heauens, and yit not ceasse too bee very man?
Not that he can dye anie more, or bee subiect too anie of our passions
and infirmities, as hee was heertoofore, when he listed too bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in the world: for as now he is quyte rid of all those things: but
that howsoeuer the cace stand, he holdeth stil his trewe nature of man.
And although he bee aboue the heauens: yit let vs assure our selues,
that that distance hindereth not his prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tnesse with vs and in vs.
As how: Wee must mark what hath bin touched afore. It is sayd,
that he filleth all things: yea, but that is with the power of his spirit.
Yee see then that the filling wherof Saint Paule speaketh,<note place="margin">Ierem. 23. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

wee should haue our fill of the benefyts of our Lord Iesus Christ, and
that when wee bee graffed intoo his bodie, and made one with him by
beleef of the Gospell, then may we assure our selues that he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
which neuer dryeth, nor can neuer bee emptyed with drawing,
and that in him wee haue, all varietie of good thinges, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Now then, if Saint Paule had ment as the papists haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and as is maynteyned now adayes of manie ignorant and wilfull
persons, namely that Iesus Christ filleth all things with his humane
nature: surely hee would not haue forgotten it: but he letteth it alone
as an absurditie. Wherfore let vs mark well the the twoo sayings
that are set downe heere: that is too wit, on the one syde, that Iesus
Christ is gone vp aboue all the heauens, and yit notwithstanding that
he ceasseth not too fyll all things. It is sayd, that he is gone vp aboue
the heauens, euen to the end that we should not be tyed too this world
and too our fleshly fancies, when we intend too resort too Iesus Christ:
but that wee should lift vp our mynds on hygh,<note place="margin">Math. 6. b. 9.</note> and seeke him there by
fayth.<note place="margin">Psal. 115. a. 3.</note> Insomuch that when the holie scripture sayeth, that God is in
heauen, it intendeth not too assigne him some peculiar place. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is farre differing, and altoogither vnlyke, betweene God in his
spirituall essence, and Iesus Christ in respect of the bodie and humane
nature which he tooke of vs. For when we speake of God, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
lay this ground, that he hath an infinite essence which filleth al
things,<note place="margin">Esay. 66. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 1.</note> so that heauen is as his royal throne, &amp; the earth is his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole.
Not that he hath any feete, nor any seate to sit on: but it serues to
shewe that there is no distance so farre or wyde, that can conteyne the
maiestie of God, which is infinite, as I sayd. That is a thing which


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23289:191"/>
wee must beare in mynd, when God is spoken of vntoo vs. And why
then is it sayd, that God is aboue al the heauens, and why dooth Saint
Paul speake after the same maner here of Iesus Christ: It is bycause
that wee bee dull and earthly, that if God should not tell vs that he hath
his temple &amp; palace in heauen, we would tye him too euery pyller, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
stone, too euery waterspring, too euery tree, &amp; (too bee short) too e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing that wee see. Therfore too correct such vyce, our Lord say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
too vs, mount vp, mount vp aloft: as though he lifted vs by the
chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>es, and sayd, wretched beasts, why seeke yee too see mee here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neathe.
What intend yee too lyken mee too? Assure your selues, yee
must bee conueyed vp aboue all the world, when yee think vppon me
and my maiestie. Therfore yee cannot woorship mee, except yee bee
rapt vp aloft, and consider that I am incomprehensible. Lo how the
scripture speaketh of him.<note place="margin">Luke. 11. a. 9.</note> And when wee say, Our father which art
in heauen: it is too the intent wee should lift vp our mynds vntoo him,
as he calleth vs at all houres. Not that wee must imagin as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
doo, who think too please God with their much babling, and with
their vsing of many Ceremonies, which may haue a gay glosse to the
worldward: I say, wee must not think too please God so: for let vs bee
sure, that that were a transfiguring of God, to make him lyke our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
but wee must rather bethink vs, that in sted of hauing our mynds
weyed downe to the world, wee must stryue to lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp on hygh. And
as for Iesus Christ, it is sayd, that he is aboue al the Heauens, euen in
his humane nature. And how is that? Being God in respect of his
essence, he is equall too his father, so as he filleth all things: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that he hath put on a humane bodie, he is aboue the heauens, so
as he is not in the world. And it is too fond a grosnesse too say, Why
then, and are not the twoo natures so knit togither, as they cannot bee
put asunder? All this is trew: but yit dooth it not followe, that they
cannot bee distinguished. So long as wee remayne alyue, our soule
and bodye are ioyned toogither: and yit it doth not therfore folow, that
the soule is not of another nature than the bodie, or that they cannot be
distinguished. Euen so is it with Iesus Christ. If a man demaund,
why then? Is not our Lord Iesus Christ all whole with vs, according
as he is our head and mediatour, and hath gathered vs too him in such
wyse, as wee liue of his owne substance? Yis, he is with vs al whole,
if wee take him in the person of the mediator. But if a man demaund,
is euerye part of him among vs, which is in himself: No: nother is it


<pb facs="tcp:23289:192"/>
requisite that he should anie more bee so conuersant among vs, as too
bee subiect too the suffering of anie thing, but he must bee quyte and
cleane exempted from all that geere. And that is the cause why the
Apostle telleth vs,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 27.</note> that he is appered once, and that hensforth we wayt
for him. And so yee see what wee haue to consider vppon this saying,
that Iesus Christ is exalted aboue all the heauens.</p>
               <p>Now let vs go backe agein to the woord fyll: for therein Saint
Paul sheweth vs, that the souereintie of our Lord Iesus Christ hath
no boundes too bee locked vp in: but that it reacheth euen vntoo vs.
Therfore (as I haue said twyce alredy) our Lord Iesus Christs filling
of all things, is by his power. For he is not a King after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of those whom wee see in this world. They be subiect to hunger &amp;
thirst, they bee subiect too diseases and other things: so as they must
haue officers at euery stones cast, or else they shal not be obeyed. They
then are fayne to doo their affayres by other men, which they cannot
doo by themselues, and too borrowe helpe at other folkes handes. But
it is not so with Iesus Christ: for he reigneth not by force of armes,
nor after the manner of worldly prynces. Now then? He reygneth
by his spirit, and by the meane of his woord. And by that meanes
are al things fylled with him,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. a. 9.</note> euen by the Gospell. Saint Paule sayth
in the first too the Corinthians, that wee communicate with him. And
too that end also dooth God call vs day by day, namely too make vs
parttakers of his only sonne. And how may that bee, vnlesse he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
his power vntoo vs? Now truly, in this cace it standeth vs on
hand to haue more than our senses can receyue. For the power of our
Lord Iesus Christ caryeth with it a woonderfulnesse aboue all our
vnderstandyng, as Saint Paul wyll shewe yit agein hereafter. For
when he hath sayd, that Christ is the head of the Church, and as it
were a husband (which is all one personne with his wyfe:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. g. 35.</note>) he cryeth
out, It is a great misterye or secret, betweene Iesus Christ and his
Church. If it bee a secret, surely than can we neuer atteyne too it by
our own mother wit, nor by our owne conceytes. And therfore wheras
Saint Paule sayeth, that he filleth all things: let vs assure our selues,
that in sted of common reason and common opinion, wee must haue
the experience of fayth, if wee intend to knowe how Iesus Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in vs, and too bee perswaded of it, as hath bin sayd therof alredie.
Howsoeuer wee fare, let vs not thinke that anye distance can separate
vs from the sonne of God. And why? For his dominion extendeth


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:23289:192"/>
hygh and lowe, and therfore wee shall feele that he is in vs, and wee in
him, that wee shall be made all one toogither, yea euen too bee ioyned
vnto God his father, and too be brought too the perfection that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in Saint Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. d. 28.</note> where he sayeth, it is expedient for you, that I go
my way, for my father is greater than I. Our Lord Iesus Christes
meaning there, is not too make himself inferiour too his father as in
respect of his diuine essence: (for wee knowe there is but one God)
but he taketh vs there, too lift vs vp according too our rudenesse and
infirmitie, as if he should leade vs pace by pace, and step by step, lyke
litle chilldren. After that manner then dooth he ioyne vs too God his
father, tyll wee bee ryghtly transformed intoo his glorye, whereof
wee inioy part alredye by the Gospell.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. d. 12.</note> For wee see not yit but
as it were through a glasse, and darkelye, as Saynt Paule sayeth

               <p>Now it behoueth vs too honour well this King,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. c. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in deede, yea and euen his owne bodie. Seeing he dooeth vs such
honour, let vs looke that wee bee so much the more inflamed with the
loue of him, and consider that Iesus Christ beeing exalted abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the heauens, is also iudge of the worlde, yea euen too call vs too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
not only of our outward deedes, but also euen of all our
thoughtes. And therfore let vs walke in his feare and obedience,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. g. 52.</note> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
our selues, that when the Trumpet soundeth at the last day, we
must all appeere before him.</p>
               <p>And further let vs consider also, that he filleth all things in such
wyse, as it is to the ouerthrow of all our enemyes, and to the brydling,
or rather too the fettering of them, so as they cannot hurt vs, doo what
they can. Therfore according too that which is conteyned here from
out of the Psalme, it is very requisite, that he should be aboue, too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
the vpper hand of our enemyes: for else what would become of
vs? And in deede let vs consider what they myght bee able too doo,
hauing infinite hostes too ouerthrow our saluation continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
For the diuell is not as a mortall man: he hath such force, as is
terrible out of measure. What myght he doo, were it not that Iesus
Christ filleth all things? yea euen too shewe that he hath power both
ouer Satan, and ouer all his vpholders, insomuch that practyze they,
prepare they, and turmoyle they what they can ageinst the Churche,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:193"/>
yit shall they neuer bring their enterpryze too passe, bycause Iesus
Christ holdes them (at the staues end,) as it were with his foote vpon
their throte. Yee see then the kingdome of our Lord Iesus Christ
was giuen him, with full warrant, that wee shall euer bee defended by
his strong and inuincible hand, bycause he hath taken vs intoo his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
euen he that is exalted aboue all the heauens. And that also is
the cause why Saint Paule sayeth expresly,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 12.</note> that all knees shall bowe
before him, as well of creatures in heauen, as of creatures in earth,
yea and euen of creatures vnder the earth. Now when wee heare that
the Angelles stoope too our Lord Iesus Christ: let vs vnderstand,
that he applyeth them too our seruice, so as they bee our keepers, and
watch too defend vs ageinst Satan. And seeing that that charge is
committed too them by our Lord Iesus Christ who is their head: wee
ought too bee well assured of our saluation. And so yee see how wee
ought too put this text in vre. Moreouer, let vs walke so vnder the
obedience of our Lord Iesus Christ, as wee may feele that he fylleth
vs in deede, (as I sayd afore) bycause he is aboue all things, through
all things, and in all things. This was spoken of God his father,
howbeeit wee knowe that Iesus Christ is the meane whereby God
dwelleth in vs. Wherefore let vs bee his trew Temples, and sith
that he beeing the welspring of all purenesse, voutsafeth vs the grace
and priuiledge too dwell in vs: let vs indeuer too keepe our selues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vntoo him both in bodie and soule. For if wee giue our selues too
our owne vncleannesse, it is all one as if wee went about too driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the sonne of God, who cannot bee intermedled with our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and filthinesse. Not that wee can bee cleere from all spot and
blemish: but that wee must not delyght in them, but rather fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
them, and labour more and more too fashyon our selues after the
purenesse that is in our Lord Iesus Christ. And lyke as he sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself in our behalf: so also let vs bee holy, namely by the grace
and power of his holy spirit, &amp; let the same holynesse be consecrated by
the doctrine of the gospel,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. c. 17.</note> as is sayd of it in another place. Now then,
as touching this fylling, yee see that in somuch as wee knowe that our
Lord Iesus Christ holdeth the diuelles, and all the despyzers of his
maiestie fettered in subiection: wee may assure our selues, that he
dwelleth verily in vs, and that the same is peculiar too vs, bycause he
hath chozen vs for his Temples, and intendeth too shew that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
which he hath taken vppon him with mankynd, is proper to


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23289:193"/>
vs in respect of the humane nature, and also in respect of his spirit, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he maketh it too take place in vs: and not only that he is man
(styll) as he was: but that there is yit more, that is too wit, that wee
be bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh: not that we bee created of his
substance, but that by the power of his holy spirit he maketh the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his body and blud too flowe downe vntoo vs, wherwith we be
fylled: insomuch that wee haue there not onely meate too eate, but also
drinke too drinke, so as there is sufficient too content vs withall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicionally
that wee consider the benefites wheruntoo he allureth vs,
and which he offereth vs, and will haue vs too inioy, so wee bee not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our owne vnbeleefe.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with

the quicke with a trew knowledge of our selues and of our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that wee may bee so cast downe in our selues, as wee may resort

and affections, which hinder our vniting vntoo God, and wee continue
in the hope that is giuen vs, vntill that beyng taken our of this world,

betwixt him and vs, as in respect of
the absence of his body out of the world: but
yit doo wee finde him alwayes present by
the power of his holy spirit, and by that

S. Paule sheweth, that this maner of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
is too the intent that euery faythful man, should with al lowlinesse

our Lord too bestowe vppon those whom he hath set in his Church too

he ment it not) but that he hath distributed them by measure.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12 b. 11.</note> And in
very deede, the order which he hath set in his Church sheweth it. For
all are not Prophetes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12 d. 17.</note> all are not Teachers, all are not Euangelistes.
Then dooth it follow, that Christ intendeth too distribute his giftes
by certeine measure. And theruppon wee haue too conclude, that he
which presumeth of himself, and surmizeth that he hath all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite:
dooth foully deceyue himself twoo wayes. For there is not
that man which hath receyued such perfection, but that he hath neede

On the contrary part, the meaner and the ignorant sort, must not enuye
them that go before them in lerning and wisdome, bycause it is Iesus
Christes will, too haue it so, and so must it bee, seeing he will haue his
Church gouerned by the meanes of men. Now then wee see wherat
the Prophet amed: namely that wee should so suffer our selues too bee

               <p>Now S. Paule in saying, that <hi>our Lord Iesus Christ gaue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

them selues about it, and were not tyed any certein place. And
why? For their commission reached further. Yee see then that the
Apostles had charge too go too and fro, and had no resting place: that
is too say, they had not the charge of any seuerall Church commited
vntoo them, so as they myght say, heere will I abyde. As much is too
bee sayd of the Euangelistes: for they went about the world too, except
it were when they were called particularly too some place. After that
maner had Timothie bin chozen for a tyme: howbeeit for as much as
he could yll bee forborne in the office of an Euangelist, he was fayne
too shift his place,<note place="margin">Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was alloted too the Ile of Candie. Trew it is that he was not yit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toogither
settled there: but yit was he fayne to hold him to that church,
howbeeit that he was remoued too and fro, according as the present o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
and neede requyred. And heerin wee see how these leaud
folk which would peruert all order of gounerment, and seeke nothing
but confuzion, doo spyte God, in saying that a man must not tary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in one place, but followe the example of the Apostles. But
that is a flat mocking of Iesus Christ, as wee see by this text. Yee see
then how wee haue too marke, that the Apostles were as Trumpets
too proclayme the Gospell euery where, and that they had Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listes
in lyke charge with them, too beare them company. But yit in
the meane whyle there were Prophetes also, which were conuersant
more in one place than in another, after as it pleased God to distribute
his grace. Yit neuerthelesse there were of them in euery Church,
according as wee see that in the Epistle too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Barnabas ordeyned of them euery where, and also how he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Titus &amp; Timothy to cause the churches to be so prouided, as they
myght alwayes haue some Shepherd too guyde them: for otherwyse
there would bee nothing but disorder. Now then sith wee see that the


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:23289:196"/>
choyce of Ministers and Shepherdes was made by the authoritie of
Iesus Christ, and they had as it were their place appoynted them, too
say, Thou must looke about thee heere, as if a man were set in a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke
or in some Tower to keepe it, when it were in any dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
euery man to keepe his place, and not to couet too gad heere
and there, but too hold him self bound too the place where he is. This
(say I) is the thing which wee haue too marke, when S. Paule spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of such a varietie.</p>
               <p>Too bee short, let vs learne that our Lord Iesus knewe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
was profitable for the welfare of his church, and that he shewed
it in hauing a care that the faythfull myght not want anie thing, but
that they myght haue sufficient and conuenient meanes too draw them
too the kingdome of heauen. Now a dayes wee haue no more the
office of Apostleship (as I told you before:) nother haue wee anie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Euangelistes: but yit for all that, God dooth neuerthelesse
drawe vs vnto him, and giue vs all helpes that are meete for vs. In
deede he chastyzeth our vnthankefulness, and bycause he sees his word
despyzed, he giues vs the things with a wet finger (as they say,)
which wee should haue more fully, if wee had such zele to them as were
requisyte. Yit notwithstanding let vs not thinke our state too bee the
worse, bycause wee haue none Apostles now adayes: for it were more
than needeth. It was ryght necessarye, considering the confuzion
and disorder of the popedome, that God should stirre vp men which
were not chozen according to the order of the Church: but yit he gaue
them grace, and they serued his turne. But now that there is order
set both heere and elswhere where the Gospell is preached: wee must
come backe too the thing before alledged, namely that when God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs such Shepherdes as labour too guyde vs faythfully, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vntoo
wee haue Teachers also, which are able too mayntaine the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the doctrine among vs, and too strengthen vs in the pure truth
of the Gospell, and too withstand all sectes and errours: wee must
vnderstande that that grace ought too bee so esteemed, wee must not
grudge ageinst God. Moreouer it is very certeyne, that if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
were receyued with such reuerence and earnestnesse, as it deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth:
God also would bee more bountifull on his syde. Wheras wee
see now so fewe good Preachers, yea &amp; that there step vp a sort of dirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daubers
woorse than naught, and farre leauder than the Moonkes in
the poppedome, which are as redie to preache Mahomets Alcoran, as


<pb facs="tcp:23289:197"/>
Christes Gospell, so they may keepe their liuings styll: and when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes
those, wee see also a sort of drunkardes that haue no more zeale
than Swyne, but are as mastiues that barke not, ne neuer open their
lipes but too confound lyght and darknesse toogither, that all things
myght be put out of order: Let vs vnderstand that God executeth
iust vengeance vppon the despyzing of his Gospell. For let vs see a
little what the humilitie and submission is which men yeeld vntoo
God for all their hearing of the sound of this doctrine, and for all his
setting vp of the scepter of his Gospell, to shew that he is mynded too
reigne ouer vs. Wee see that most men could fynd in their hartes
to haue no religion at al. Agein, they that make fayrest countenance,
would yit full fayne that the Gospell were styll but a shadowing place
of Ceremonies. And howsoeuer the world go, they bee loth too beare
anie yoke, they cannot abyde too bee rebuked for their vyces, but they
would haue a beastly licenciousnesse: condicionally that they myght
doo what they list, they would bee contented that the Gospell should
bee preached, as who should say, they would graunt it vntoo Iesus
Christ by composition and couenant. But in the meane whyle, all is
but hipocrisie, and they cannot so conceale their counterfetting, but
that the world dooth well see that they bee as shamelesse as harlots.
For doubtlesse, a man shall find more religion and feare of God in the
popedome, than among those that are in the places where the Gospell
is preached. But the mischeef of all mischeeues is, that a sort of these
naughtipackes step vp intoo the chayre of truth, of whom some are
drunkardes, some whoremongers, and some blasphemers: and too bee
short, there is such wickednesse among them, as is horrible to see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sith
wee knowe this, let vs cast downe our eyes, and condemne the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
and rebelliousnesse that is in vs, as the cause of all the
disorder that wee see. But howsoeuer the world go with vs, yit if our
Lord bee so benificiall too vs still, as too haue his doctrine preached
too vs: therin wee haue a sure and infallible token, that he is neere at
hand with vs, and that he seeketh our saluation, by calling vs vnto him,
as though he spake with open mouth, and that wee sawe him personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before vs. Then can we not fayle nor bee deceyued, in assuring our
selues that Iesus Christ calleth vs too him, and that he holdeth out his
armes open too receyue vs, as oft as the Gospell is preached vntoo vs.

               <p>And herwithall let vs still haue an eye too that which I sayd afore:
which is, that they too whom God giueth most of his grace, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that by that meanes they be the more bound to imploy them selues
in the place that our Lord hath assigned them too, and wheruntoo it is
his pleasure too appropriate them. He then that hath knowledge, must
not exalt himself for it, but consider that he is a better too the whole
bodie,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. b. 14.</note> and (theruppon) examin well how he may serue too the glory of
God, with the things that he hath put him in trust withall, and make

therof is common too all men, and that although God haue committed
it too his custody, and will haue him too bee the keeper of it: yit must
he not hold it as a treasure, locked vp in a hutch: but impart it abroade
to such as want it, and haue neede of it. Herwithal also let vs keepe vs
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enuying of those whom it is Gods will to honour after that fashion,
that there bee no spytefulnesse in vs too say, Why, and is it meete that
such a one should bee preferred before mee? For in so dooing wee spyte
God. And therfore let euery of vs knowe his owne state and degree,
and not stand in contention with our God, assuring our selues that the
thyngs which he hath ordeyned in his Churhe, are doone by vnreuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
iudgment. Wherfore let vs abhorre these madbraynes, that
would take away the order which wee see too bee grounded vppon the
authoritie of the sonne of God. There are, that thinke the preaching
of the Gospell too bee a needelesse thing, and that it serueth as it were
but for little children, and that they them selues haue the holy Ghoste
(at commaundement,) too reuele things too them from heauen euery
minute of an houre. But it is certeyne that the Diuell blyndeth
them in that ouerweening, and men knowe that he had wonne the
goale, if the meane of our saluation were abolished and taken away.
For lyke as S. Paule sayeth, that the preaching of the Gospell must
serue too make the Church perfect,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. c. 21.</note> that wee may bee brought too the
kingdome of heauen: so on the contrary part, when there is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doctrine or Shepherd, the diuell must needes so ouermayster vs, as
wee shalbee scattered asunder, and nothing shall remayne but ruine and
destruction. Seeing then that this order is not of men, let vs learne


<pb facs="tcp:23289:198"/>
too submit our selues vntoo it, and let all of vs both great and small
without geynsaying, suffer God too guyde vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that meane, seeing it
hath pleased him too appoynt it. Also wee see how Gods children are
called the children of the Church. And S. Paule sheweth that our
Lord Iesus will reigne ouer vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. b. 8.</note> with condition that his woord bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in mens mouthes. He sayeth not, that the Angels shall come to
reuele vntoo vs the things that God will haue vs too knowe: but he
sayth, that wee must vnderstand Gods will by their meanes which
haue the charge and office too tell it vs. For lyke as in the tyme of
the Lawe, it was sayd,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. b. 7.</note> that the Priestes were Gods Angels, and that
men ought too inquyre at their mouth: so now also God will not haue
vs too flitter in the ayre after our owne fancies, but too go too the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
which is open for vs when wee list too drinke. If a man would
go seeke the head and welspring of a fountayne (I meane as it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the earth) and would hold scorne too drinke vntill he had found it:
would not men take him for stark mad and besyde him self? Yis that
would they. But behold, God hath prouyded for our infirmytie, in
that he will not haue vs too make to long wyndlasses too be taught
his woord faythfully. For he maketh the welspring too come home
too vs, which was hidden and farre of from vs, I say, he maketh it to
come home too vs as it were by Cundites, so as we neede doo no more
but open our mouthes too receyue it. Lyke as when there are fayre
Cundites that runne with continewall water abundantly, men will
come too drawe at them for their needes: so was it our Lordes will
that his woord should bee set foorth vntoo vs, by his ordeyning of men
too bee the instrumentes of his holy spirit. Then seeing it is so, let vs
learne too hold vs too it: and if wee will bee taught of God, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the doctrine that is preached to vs by the mouthes of men. This
say I, is the thing that we haue too remember vppon this text, too the
intent wee bee not so foolish as too say, Why hath not God giuen mee
such grace or gift? Why is it his will too vse such meane? Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our selues with this, namely, that his ordinance ought too suffize
vs, and that if wee will needes fall too reasoning of the matter, wee
shall euer bee put too shame, bycause there is is no wisdome but only
his good will. Also let vs mark that which is sayd immediatly in this
text: namely that it is Gods will that there should be order of ministery
or Seruice. As if it were sayd, God could well bring vs too perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by him self, without any other meane or helpe: Howbeeit for as

much as he will bee serued by men, and he applyeth them too such vse,
as he maketh them ministers, so as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceyue that the prayse of our
saluation is alwayes dew to him, &amp; that all goodnesse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of him: it
behoueth men to submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues therto. But here it might be thought
straunge why Saint Paule in sted of speaking of the giftes of the
holy Ghost, bringeth vs vntoo Offices. For he began with this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
namely that our Lord Iesus Christ gaue giftes according too the
measure which he knoweth to be fit for vs, and that in dyuers maners,
by meanes wherof he filleth all things. Now to confirme this he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>that there are Apostles, Shepherdes, Teachers and Euangelists.</hi>
It should seeme that S. Paule dooth not well continew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he processe of
the matter that he treated of. But heere wee haue too note, (as wee
see also more largely in the first too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. a. 4. &amp;. 13. a. 2.</note> that for as much
as our Lord Iesus hath stablished the order that wee haue spoken of
alredye, and contineweth the same still in his Church, so as it is his
will that there should bee Shepherdes, Prophetes, and Thechers: he
dooth also furnish them out of hand with the things that are requisite
for the executing of their office. For he dealeth not after the maner of
men. Wee for our part may chooze one man to bee in office of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
and another too bee a Preacher: but in the meane whyle wee
cannot giue them that which is requysite for them. For wee cannot
make a new man of him that is aduaunced too honour: but he must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
still the same that he was for all vs. Also when it commeth too
the election, euery man giues his voyce. Uery well, he that is chozen
shalbee officer: but yit in the meane while, he shall continew still the
same he was before. In lyke cace is it with Shepherdes. Wee may
well chooze a man, and he shall perchaunce proue a beast. For wee
cannot cause him too bee qualified as he ought too be. But when men
are of Gods owne choozing, so as he beareth the whole sway: then are
the giftes ioyned inseperably with their charge.<note place="margin">Math. 4. c. 18.</note> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Iesus
choze his Apostles, he choze sillie fisherme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; such as were vnlearned,
&amp; yit did he serue his turne with them for the publishing his of Gospel:
howbeeit not too teach as yit, but too go abroade as his herawltes, too
giue warning that the King was come. But when he intended too
send them foorth too their office for adoo, he sent them the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Actes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. a. 4.</note>
shewing therby (as is sayd in many other textes,) that all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the welfare of the Church, must needs come of his free gift,
bycause it is well kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wen that all things proceed of him, too the end


<pb facs="tcp:23289:199"/>
that all prayse should be giuen vntoo him. Then is it no maruell that
S. Paule speaking heere of the diuersitie of giftes, and of the measure
that it hath pleased God too deale too euery man, dooth send vs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
too the offices. As if he should say, It is not without cause that
God distributeth not his giftes in alyke too all. For he will not haue
all men Shepherdes, or Prophetes, or Teachers, or Apostles, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelistes:
but he calleth whom he thinkes good, and therin tryeth
our humilitie, and therfore if wee bee willing too bee subiect too him,
let vs not sticke to take al authority in good woorth, which is grounded
in him, and vppon his ordinance. Now it is so, God letteth many men
alone in priute state, and in the meane whyle choozeth whome hee
thinkes good too preache his woord. Therfore men must hold them
there.</p>
               <p>Furthermore let vs mark, that if men proceede too their elections
with the feare of God, and seeke too obey him: surely he also will
shewe by effect, that they whom he hath called too teache, and to whom
the charge of ruling the flocke is committed, shall not bee destitute of
his power, but that he will furnish them with all things requisite, as
experie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce sheweth wel ynough, and it is witnessed vntoo vs, that if
wee meete toogither in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Math. 18. c. 20.</note> (so it bee
truely and vnfeynedly) he will be in the mids of vs. Thus yee se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
what wee haue too beare in mynd. Yit notwithstanding wee see that
the papacie hath so contryued men and framed them too their owne
Lure, as they bee vtterly gone away from the order of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and from the maner of gouerning the Churche, which was
knowen of the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Let vs looke backe agein to the thing that Saint Paule treateth of
heere. His meaning is too bring vs too the vnitie afore mentioned.
Therfore he will haue vs too bee of one accord, too link toogither like
brethren, and too shoote all at one mark, as hauing but one head which
knitteth vs all toogither, so as there bee nother enuy, nor ill will, nor
sects, nor aught else that may deuyde vs. Now too bring vs heruntoo,
he sayeth, <hi>that there is (but) one God, and one Lord, too whom all
Souereintie is giuen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. b. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and that there is but one Baptime, and one
Fayth, and that vvee bee called al too one inheritance.</hi> After the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, hee addeth that Iesus Christ (for the better ratifying of that
vnitie) would that one man alone shold teach the rest, &amp; that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
should giue eare too him, and therwithall that all of vs as well he


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23289:199"/>
that speaketh, as they that heare him, should haue one selfsame fayth.
For asmuch then as all of vs cannot bee Apostles, Teachers, and
Prophets: he hath chozen some of vs too bee in that state and office, to
the end wee myght bee brought too the sayd vnitie, and Iesus Christ
bee aknowledged for our head, and all of vs bee gathered toogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him. Lo how S. Paule speaketh of it.</p>
               <p>But now if there had bin anie cheeftie or supremacie, so as it had
bin Gods mynd too haue assigned a seate in this world, the Bishop
wherof shoulde haue had superioritie ouer all the Churche, and
his Commission haue reached so farre, that his souereintie must haue
taken place euery where: surely Saint Paule would not haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it, or else if he had, it had bin a very fowle fault. Spake he by the holy
Ghoste, and yit left he out the principall and most conuenient poynt of
his matter? (No:) and therfore if there were no more but this only
text, surely it were ynough too confound the shamelesnesse of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
when they say, there must needs bee an vnderhead in this wrold,
and that bycause Iesus Christ is gone out of this world, therfore hee
must needs haue a Uicar. But it is certeine that Saint Paule ment
too shewe the thing which wee haue seene in other texts: which is, that
Saint Peters Apostleship extended not vntoo vs. For he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
peculyarly too the Iewes,<note place="margin">Gala. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 8.</note> as is declared in the second too the
Galathians. But howsoeuer the cace stand, wee see heere the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall
order, which wee must keepe, and wheruntoo wee must hold vs,
if wee mynd too be subiect too our Lord Iesus Christ. And that is
not to haue a Pope: but that euerye Churche haue his Shepherds and
Teathers, according too their neede, acording too the number of the
people, and according as the place requyreth: that when wee bee so
knit intoo one bodie of a Churche, wee may haue a lawfull gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which it is vnpossible for vs too forbeare, by reason of our rawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and the weaknesse of our fayth, in respect wherof it standeth vs on
hand too haue the remedye which our Lord Iesus Christ hath giuen
vs, that men may hold themselues too his saying and authoritie. That
is it in effect which wee haue too mark vppon this streyne.</p>
               <p>Agein, Saint Paule procedeth afterward too shewe vs the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
benefyte which wee haue by such order, and the fruite that wee
reape of it. For (as I haue touched afore) men are so hygh mynded,
that euery one would bee a Lord. Therfore there is nothing better
than too knowe that God woorketh our welfare by ordeyning this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb facs="tcp:23289:200"/>
of gouernment, namely that there should bee Shepherds to teache
vs. For it is as a fyghting ageinst our owne saluation, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee play
the stubborne fooles, and will not lyke of the thing that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
for our souerein welfare. Truely if there were no more but
this, namely that God hath so willed. Wo woorth him that dares
checke ageinst the maiestite of his maker. Yit notwithstanding the
worlde seeth our naugtinesse: and although wee graunt it too bee
good reason that wee should obey God, yit can wee not fynd in our
harts too do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it willingly and with a free hart, except wee see immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
before our eyes, that it is for our profit too doo so, and that Gods
intent was not alonly too humble vs vnder him, but also too aduaunce
vs therwithall, by willing this order too bee kept. And so yee see
wherat Saint Paule amed heere. For it is not ynough for vs too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
the thing that God commaundeth, or too tremble at it, too the
end too doo it half perforce, and half of good will: but wee must go too
it with an earnest desyre. And how may that bee doone? By know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is for our profit. Now sith wee knowe it is so, and specially
that it standeth vppon our saluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wee ought well too apply all
our wits vntoo it: Or else our vnthankfulnesse wil bee the lesse tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when wee fall too thrusting away of the thing that God affereth
vs, not so much for any respect of himself, as for our profit. That then
is the thing which Saint Paul intended, in saying, that the preaching
of the Gospell and the appoynting of men expresly too that purpose,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 14.</note> is
too linke vs toogither, that there myght bee no dissension among vs.</p>
               <p>And on the contrarie part Saint Paule declareth also, that all fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall
persons which reiect common order, and would bee so spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
as if they were rauished aboue the Clouds: are separated from
the bodie of the Churche, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d therwithall renounce God, by reason
wherof they ought to be euen abhorred, and shumed as deadly plages,
bycause they set dissension in the Churche. For bee wee neuer so desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of vnitie, yit shall all that wee can doo bee in vayne, if wee hold
vs not too the thing that Saint Paule speaketh heere, that is too say,
that our Lord Iesus intended to knit the knot fast and sure in his owne
bodie. And therfore if any man say, he wil withdrawe himself from
the obedience of the Churche: it is all one as if he would cut asunder
the senewes of a bodie. I pretend peraduenture too loue some bodie,
&amp; yit notwithstanding cut asunder the senewes of it euerywhere, so as
the whole bodie being disioynted and dismembered, falleth in a swond,


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23289:200"/>
and finally rotteth quite away. Euen so standeth the cace with vs. For
wee should link toogither, and God hath prouyded verye well for it.
As how? By giuing vs Prophets, Teachers, Shepherds, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists.
Now if wee reiect them, what else is too bee sayd, but that
wee bee mynded too breake asunder al the vnitie which our Lord had
appoynted too bee among vs? To bee short, Saint Paule sheweth
heere, that all such as doo not submit themselues too the doctrine of the
Gospell, and yeeld reuerence too the minister therof, are deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
of Gods people, and seekers of their owne confusion, &amp; therfore
that men ought too shun them as woolues, bycause they bee vtterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
inasmuch as they procure the ouerthrowe of the Churche, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyze
God in the things that were well ruled, and forsake the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all good things.</p>
               <p>Too bee shorte, Saint Paule addeth immediatly after, <hi>that it
is the edifying (or building vp of the bodie of Christ.</hi> And this
serues also to make those yit more abhorred, which wil not yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to this spirituall gouernment that our Lord Iesus hath allowed
of. For the bodie of our Lord Iesus ought too bee precious vntoo vs.
In deede it had bin ynough if he had sayd, <hi>the Church.</hi> But by vsing
this honorable tytle, Saint Paule sheweth vs, that it is too beynous
treason, for vs too seeke too rend the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ in
peeces. Now it is so, that it cannot be builded vp, that is too say, it
cannot bee brought to perfection, nor continew in good plyght, but by
meane of the preaching of Gods woord. So then if wee bee willing
that God should be honored and serued, &amp; that our Lord should quietly
haue his royal seat among vs, to reigne in the mids of vs: if we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be his people, &amp; to liue vnder his protection: if we couet too bee
builded vp in the him, &amp; to be ioyned vnto him, &amp; to continue in him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the end: to be short, if we desyre our saluation: we must learne to be
humble schoollers in receyuing the doctrine of the Gospel, &amp; in herke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the shepherds that are sent vs, as if Iesus Christ spake too vs
himself in his own person, assuring our selues that he wil allow of the
obedience &amp; submission of our fayth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we herken to the mortal men
vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth that charge. Therfore let vs shew the desyre which
wee haue that God should be honored, &amp; also the desire and care which
we haue of our owne saluation, &amp; of the common welfare and edefying
of the Churche: which thing will then come too passe, when all of vs
both great and small doo giue our consentes, that Iesus Christ shall


<pb facs="tcp:23289:201"/>
haue his instruments wherby too speake vntoo vs, and drawe vs vntoo
him. Which order if wee obserue, he will so blisse vs therby, as wee
shall haue cause too glorifie him, for that wee shall see how it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bin his will too procure the saluation of our soules, and that he
is euer at hand with vs, and will so woork, as wee shal not want any
thing that is for our behoofe or profit.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fal downe before the maiesty of our good God, with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of our faults, praying him to make vs so to feele them,
as we may be cast down in our selues, &amp; seeke nothing else but to be set
vp agein by him, &amp; that our Lord Iesus may haue such preheminence
ouer vs, as we may honour him as he deserueth, that wee beeing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

thing that we see: a man myght say, that we ought in deede to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme

thinke themselues too know, &amp; which they haue imagined without any

the knowing of the sonne of God, too the end to defyne the better what
the woord <hi>Fayth</hi> importeth. For it runneth roundly ynough in mens
mouthes: and euery man will say he beleeueth: but in the meane while,
if these men which vaunt themselues with full mouth too bee as pillers
of the Church, and as good catholikes as may bee, (as the world sees
well ynough,) bee demaunded what faith is: they stop short of it. They
will say perchaunce, it is too beleeue in God: (yea:) but the Turkes
and Papistes will say so too: and yit for all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Turkes, bycause they know not what beleefe is. As much is too
bee sayd of Papists. And wherin differ wee from them, wee (I say)
that call our selues Christians? In knowing that God hath sent vs
Iesus Christ too leade vs vp hygher, so as wee bee sure that bycause
he is our father, he will not lay our sinnes too our charge, but recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs intoo his fauour through his owne free goodnesse, accepting
vs for ryghtuous, when wee condemne our selues by trew repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and seeke all our welfare in Iesus Christ, acknowledging that
there is nothing in vs but vtter cursednesse. Yee see then that our Lord
Iesus Christ is the very marke or whyte wherat wee ame. If a man
should shoote in a long bowe, or in a Crosse bowe, or in a Gunne, and
haue no mark or white before him, but should discharge at aduenture,
now this way, now that way: what a shooting were that? Euen so
standes the cace with al them that ame not at our Lord Iesus Christ.
For they doo but roue, and intangle them selues in many a pecke of

               <p>Now Saint Paule addeth yit further, <hi>that the same is for the age
of perfection, and for our true accomplishment.</hi> Wherby he doth
vs too wit (as I haue touched alredy) that so long as wee liue in this
world, wee must still growe and go foreward, knowing that there are
still manie infirmities in vs, and that wee bee not yit come too our
full greatnesse. Yit is it not therfore too bee sayd, that wee bee litle

<pb facs="tcp:23289:204"/>
the yeeres aboue twelue, before there bee yit discretion and skill
to gouerne our selues, in which tyme wee must still profit more and
more. And when a man is come too the age of fortie yeeres, then is
he is his cheefe state. For by that tyme he ought too haue some trade
both of bodie and mynd, wheron too stay and rest. Not that wee must
not profit still euen at threescore yeeres: but I speake of the similitude
that Saint Paule setteth downe heere. First therfore he sayth, that
wee must herken too the Gospell, till wee bee come too full age. And
when is that? At our death, sayeth he. For heere wee must not
count our yeeres after the manner of men. After a man is once past
fiftie, too all seeming he decayeth both in his senses and in his wit,
But Saint Paule sayth, that wee shall neuer bee at our full growth,
till wee bee rid of this bodie. So then, the spirituall age of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
is when they bee gone out of this world. But now let vs see what
manner of ones wee bee, since wee beganne too profit in the Gospell.
Wee bee lyke a chylde that is halfe a man. He is past fifteene yeere
old, or perhappes past twentie: &amp; yit he ceasseth not to learne styl day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for he hath needde of it, and he is sure, that although he haue studied
(a good whyle,) yit is he not come too the last step, he hath not gotten
so settled and stayed a iudgment as were requisite. Howbeeit, it may
well come too passe, that a child of twentie yeeres shall haue all the
sciences at his fingers endes, wherein he hath bin trayned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed:
but yit shall he bee neuerthelesse lyght headed for all that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall he haue the skyll too apply them too his vse, bycause he is
not yit rype: for he is but lyke greene Corne, or lyke as when a vyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
makes a fayre show of a good vintage, but the grapes are not yit
rype. Euen so is it with that age. And for that cause Saint Paule
sayth by a similitude, that as long as Christians are alyue, although
they were threescore, yea foure score, or fyue score yeeres old, yit must
they bee still lyke children, not too chyldren of wit, but too young strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
which are of age to profite,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. a. 1.</note> and doo willingly submit and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselues too bee gouerned, bycause they knowe well they bee
not yit of rype discretion. Neuerthelesse Saynt Paule telleth vs,
wee must not bee lyke lyttle babes that haue yit nother wit nor discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. b. 20.</note>
nor can scarsely yit discerne betweene good and bad.</p>
               <p>First and formest therfore wee must beare this lesson well in mynd,
that when wee haue seene and tryed neuer so much in the world, and
traueled from place too place, and bin exercyzed in manye affayres:


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23289:204"/>
though we thinke our selues to be the politikest in the world, yit are
wee not so wyse, that wee neede to learne no more. And why? For
heere the cace concerneth Gods wisdome, which passeth all the wit
of man, and wee may bee commended ynough and too much of the
world, and yit wee shall know things but in part,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. c. 19.</note> and therfore let vs
not deceyue our selues. Therfore away with this fond ouerweening,
too thinke our selues wyse ynough, (I spake euen of them that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too teathe others) and let vs continew scollers still. For although
Iesus Christ haue appoynted certein too bee as leaders and guydes
too shewe other men the way: yit dooth it not follow, that they bee so
wyse, that they must not bee learners as well as the rest. For he that
speaketh, must take instruction by it himself, and a man shall neuer be
meete too declare Gods will vntoo other men, except he himself learne
dayly.</p>
               <p>The thing then whiche wee haue too beare in mynde, is, that
wee must bee throughly perswaded, that if wee profit not our selues,
wee go lyke Seacrabbes. For they that go not foreward in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of saluation, vaunt they neuer so much of their being taught in
Gods schoole, doo vndoubtedly go backe. And therfore let vs beware
in any wyse that wee fall not asleepe, or stand still at a stay, as though
there were no more too bee learned. And let vs consider that our lyfe
is lykened too a way, and thervppon learne too go foreward still, and
too gayne alwayes some ground, and too spurre and etch foorth our
slouthfulnesse and slowenesse, so as it may from day too day appeere,
that wee haue gotten some knowledge more than afore: eyther by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
better the things which we thought too haue bin through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
printed in our myndes, or by conceyuing some other poynt by other
folkes instruction, which was vnknowen too vs afore. So then, let
vs increace the hoord of that treasure from day too day. And if olde
folk bee so much the carefuller too gather goods, as they drawe neerer
too their graue, bycause they see themselues too bee weake, and too
haue neede of succour, and are alwayes afrayd to bee destitute of mans

               <p>Yee see then that the meane too put this doctrine of Saint Paules
in vre, is first too humble our selues in such wyse, as no man take more
vppon him through vayne selfweening, than belongs vntoo him, but
that wee will keepe on our way aduyzedly, assuring our selues that we
bee not yit come too our wayes end. And that is the cause also why
Saint Paul sayd,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. c. 12.</note> that he looked not backe to the things he had doone
alredye, but foreward vntoo the things that remayned. Saint Paule
had made a greate iorney, and taken much peyne for the Gospels sake:
he had bin taken vp afore into the third heauen:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. b. 4.</note> and there he had heard
and seene secret things, which it was not lawfull for him to speake of
among men. Yee see then, that he was as a man that had bin
taught in the schoole of Angels: and as in respect of men, he had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all the other Apostles: and yit for all this, he sayeth he streyneth
himselfe forewarde, and laboureth too atteyne too the marke
wherat he amed. Now if Saint Paule spake so: what ought wee too
doo, which are yit as it were but at our Apcie? Then as concerning
this full rypenesse of age, let vs assure our selues that wee cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
new and dayly instruction, vntill wee bee quyte rid of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of our flesh. Untill wee bee departed out of this world, wee
must suffer our selues too bee guyded and gouerned lyke teachable and
meeke young folk, and wee must beeleeue good counsell, assuring our
selues that wee haue neede of it. Therfore Saint Paule attributeth
that (full rypenesse of age) too our Lord Iesus Christ, as if he should
say, that men beguyle themselues through their owne fond rashnesse,
by beholding themselues in them selues.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. d. 21.</note> For know we once what Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is, wee shal perceyue full well, that there are yit manie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
in vs. He is called the wisdome of God his father, he is
called his euerlasting woord,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. a. 1.</note> he is called his image. And all this is
too the end that wee should learne of him, and behold Gods glorie in
his person, which otherwyse were inuisible vntoo vs. But now, can
wee comprehend Gods infinite wisdome? Can wee atteyne too the
vnderstanding of Gods glorie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. b. 7.</note> so as wee may haue the full syght of it?
Alas wee bee farre short of it.<note place="margin">Coloss. 1. b. 15.</note> Therfore whensoeuer wee be tempted

which is, that Saint Paule setteth downe as it were three
ages. The first is, as a Chyldhood. And which is that? It is before
we haue anie instruction at all, when wee be yit as it were half beasts,
without discretion too discerne Gods truthe. And there bee many such
children in the world. At what age? Euen at three or fouer score

naughtinesse: but yit he sayth, that wee must not bee babes in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
and that is the thing which he rehearseth agein in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
text. Then condemneth he such as are babes in vnderstanding,
that is too say, which are so doutfull and wauering, that they bee sure
of nothing: they knowe not what fayth too bee of, nor what God too
woorship. Now I told you that the world is too full of such babes,
which harden themselues in their brutishnesse and ignorance. And
in good sooth, how manie shall a man fynde which are so throughly
settled in Gods truth, as they cannot bee made too daunce after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mannes pype, as Saint Paule speaketh of them heere? For if
it bee demaunded what the Gospell is, some will answere, it must
needes bee a good thing bycause God is the author of it: but in the
meane whyle, too bee able too yeelde a reason of theyr fayth, is no
poynt of their skill, but they harden themselues in their ignorance,
yea and couet too bee as lyttle babes styll. Othersome can well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
skill too yeeld an account, in such wyse as a man woulde deeme
there were some good roote of fayth in them: and yit for all that, if
there come but one blast of wynd, yee shall see them in such perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that they wote not any more in what God they beleeue. For if
there ryse vp any heresyes or stumbling blockes, the most part of
those that spake woonders afore, are so wyndshaken as too saye,
How now? There were neuer such opinions heard of: and what
meaneth this? Which may a man holde for the best? But in so doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they shewe well ynough, (as I sayd afore) that they neuer strey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselues, ne tooke any great payne too go forwarde, that they
myght no more bee so wauering.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, besydes this lykening of men vntoo babes, Saint
Paule setteth downe yit other similitudes, saying, <hi>that such folkes
are as reedes that are shaken vvith euery vvynd,</hi> or as a boate that
floteth vppon the waues of the sea, or of some Lake. In deede this
belongeth not too little babes: but Saint Paules intent was also
too shewe howe wretched their state is, which are not throughly
grounded in the Gospell. For is there any greater wretchednesse
than too bee floting, and as it were wauering at euery wynde,
and too haue no steadinesse at all in the matters that concerne our
saluation? If wee were threatened euerye minute of an houre,
where through wee were so scared, that wee were in continuall fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23289:206"/>
and trembling: had wee not leauer too bee dead out of hand,
than too linger after that sorte, and too dye a hundred tymes aday?
But now, wee stand vppon the euerlasting saluation of our soules:
and wote not where too become in that cace? Shall there bee no stedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs? S. Paule therefore ment too shew vs this thing, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
too redresse the slothfulnesse or rechlesnesse whervntoo wee be too
much giuen.</p>
               <p>And too pricke vs foreward yit dubble: he sayeth, <hi>that vvee must
not bee subiect too mens Cousinage.</hi> He vseth heere a woord that
is taken of dyce playing. For wee knowe that they which make a
trade or occupacion of that craft, must haue store of siyghtes, for there
is no faythfulnesse nor trust in it. In deede it is sayd, that a man
shall see the tryall of ones wit and disposition by playe: but it is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
also that all Dycers are deceyuers, insomuch as there is not the
simplest of them, but he would haue the cunning too beguyle those
that playe with him. In deede all are not so cunnyng as too shred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men of their goods by their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eyghtie conueyance: but yit for
all that, wee see it is the generall and vniuersall propertie of that play,
too bee guylefull. And it is not so in that game onely, but welneere
in all other. Saint Paule hath set downe heere but one kynde, but
experience sheweth how the cace standeth, yea and euen lyttle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ought too beare it well in mynde. And whereas I call them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
children, I meane not such as hang vppon the dug, but these lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Cockchickens that are tyed too swordes, and are so pert fellowes, &amp;
weene themselues to be men, when they ought to haue a rodde yit half
a doozen yeeres longer, and yit for al that doo take snuffe at it, if a man
kepe them from beyng deceyued. For if all games were set at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:
surely there woulde be store of Cousiners euerywhere. And a
young heyre shoulde no sooner come too a dozen yeeres olde, but he
should haue a newe lyuerie on his backe (as they say:) for he should
fynde Cousiners ynow, which would take him by the hande, too picke
his purse, and keepe him good companie till he were quyte shred of
all that he hath. Now then although Saint Paule speake heere of the
stedfastnesse of the fayth of the Gospell: yit borroweth he the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of the common lyfe, and of the thinges that are seene day by
day. His saying then is, that vnlesse wee haue a well settled fayth, so
as wee bee fully purposed and determyned too walke in Gods truth
euen to the end, &amp; to stand inuincibly in it: we be but little children that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:207"/>
are subiect too euery mans cousinage, &amp; we shall alwayes fynd Cousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and deceiuers, that will robbe vs &amp; spoyle vs, &amp; we neuer perceiue
it, so as wee shall woonder how wee become poore. In the same ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

haue great neede too bee well fenced. For when wee bee out of feare,
euery of vs falles too reueling, we take no care, wee keepe no watch.
But if there bee warre, so as wee bee threatened: then (wee think) it
behoues vs too keepe good watch, &amp; wee stand vppon our gard. If wee
dout of any afterclappes, then we bethink our selues, least we be taken
napping. Saint Paule therfore telleth vs heere, that there will bee
nothing but cousining, and that we shal fall into Satans snares euery
minute of an houre, if wee watch not warely. And why? For among
whom are wee conuersant? What a sort of Cousiners are there in the
worlde? There will euer bee leaud companie which shall seeke the
ouerthrowe of our fayth: there will euer bee scoffers, heathenish folk,
and other makebates, which would fayne haue all things go too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

themselues, and desyre no better liuing, as they say. For this cause
Saint Paule sheweth vs, that if wee labour not stoutly too profyte in
Gods woord, wee shall surely bee caught and caryed away at euery
hand, and fleete too and fro, and bee led by the bill, and runne about
lyke little chilldren, so as wee shall haue no discretion at all. Then
if wee bee not well aduyzed, euen they that are the forewardest of vs,

                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:209"/>And he putteth truth foremest, purposely, bycause our linking too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
would not boote vs at all, vnlesse Iesus Christ were the bond of
our concord, and that God alloweth it, bycause it is grounded vpon his
woord, Saynt Paule then ment heere too put a difference betwixt
vs, and the heathen and vnbeleeuers. For all men will graunt well
ynough, that there can be nothing but hauocke among men, when they
bee lyke too Dogges and Cattes: and it hath bin knowen for a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
principle in all ages, in all Countries, and among all people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that euen the heathen folke, and such as knew not what trewe
religion meaneth, haue simply commended and esteemed the benefyte
of concord and agreement toogither.</p>
               <p>But yit they buylded without foundation. And therefore Saynt
Paule beginneth at Gods truth: As if he should saye, wee must not
only linke in one among our selues: but God must also go before vs,
and wee must obey him, so as wee must bee gathered toogither vnder
him, and he sit ouer vs, and wee must leuer chooze too bee at defyance
with the whole world, than too slip away from him. Thus yee see
that the thing which wee haue too marke vppon this text, is that God
will not haue vs too bee knit toogither without knowing how or why:
but he will haue vs too agree too woorship and serue him, and too put
our whole trust in his infinite goodnes, so as Iesus Christ be our head,
and we all members of his bodie through the power of fayth. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
that when wee once knowe how wee haue a father in heauen
which hath adopted vs too bee his children, and that Iesus Christ
hath voutsafed too take our flesh and substance vppon him, too the
intent that wee should bee flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone: the
same should moue vs too loue one another, too bee carefull ech for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
saluation, and too helpe one another according too the abilitie
that God gyueth vs. According wheruntoo it is sayd in the Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 133. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

that the freendship of brothers is a leeuesome thing. And afterward
the Prophet bringeth vs too the oyntment that was powred vpon the
Priests: as if he should say, that men hauing no more but euen their
moother wit, may perceyue that there is not a more leeuesome thing
in the world, than too liue in peace and amitie. Howbeit therewithall
he declareth the order of it, after the same maner that it is shewed vs
heere by S. Paule, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayth, that the sayd brotherhood must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>crated
and dedicated to the name of God. For the annoynting of
Aaron and his successors, was in such sort, as the oyntment did sheade


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:23289:209"/>
downe vppon the whole body, and vppon the garment of them. Now
therefore let vs marke, that if wee intend too linke toogither well, wee
must drawe vntoo God, and our linking must bee allowed of him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse,
wee may well haue fellowship toogither, but it shalbee but
a cursed felowship, and the end of it can neuer bee but vtter confuzion.
Wherefore, that wee may rule our lyfe well, let the end that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at, bee too cleaue vntoo the truth. Ryght necessarie is this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for vs now adayes. For the Papistes accuse vs, that wee haue
trubbled the world, &amp; that the debates that are now adayes, doo spring
of our fault: inasmuch as heretoofore all was deade, euery man sayd,
Amen, too them, and there was no disputing. In deede there was no
great trauell spent in seeking God or the saluation of men. Now then,
too cast the Diuell out of the possession that he had gotten, it behoued
vs too vse great vehemencie, according as it is sayd, that he will neuer
giue ouer his place, except he bee inforced. Therefore it stoode vs on
hand (as yee would say) too thunder and lighten, too waken the world,
that was so falne asleepe, and after a sort bewitched. For inasmuch
as the vnbeleeuers are extremely stubborne in stryuing ageinst God,
and cannot abyde that the truth should take place, but vpholde theyr
lyes with diuelishe wilfulnesse: that is the very cause why there is so
much trubble and warre in the world now adayes, I meane for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Now the Papistes would laye the blame in our neckes: but let
vs see who is in the fault. For wee desyre that euery man should doo
homage vntoo God, and that both great and small should submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
too his woorde, and that there should bee one trew vnitie of
fayth, so the simplicitie of the Gospell go before it and guyde it. These
are the things that wee seeke: and the Papists fynd fault with it.</p>
               <p>Yit notwithstanding, there is none other thing too bee found in
our doctrine, but that wee would fayne that there should bee a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
betweene men and Angels too woorship the trew God, and too
follow his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord, which is our trew rule, to the end there should be no
corruption in his seruis. On the contrarie part, the Papistes would
maynteyne all their abhominations and errours, and cannot indure
that Iesus Christ should haue his preheminence. For they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
him of all his offices, and made as it it were a bootie of them.
They haue an infinite warrein of Hee sayncts and Shee sayncts, too
whom they giue the tytle of their Aduocats: saying, that by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
they obtein fauour at Gods hand for such as pray vntoo them.


<pb facs="tcp:23289:210"/>
Moreouer in all the rest of their doctrine, there is nothing but it is
peruerted, yea and falsifyed. And besydes these errours and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions,
the Papists are also so spytefull, as too bend themselues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ageinst God, &amp; to spit out their madnesse, yea and to indeue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> too
wype away the rememberance of Iesus Christ by fyre and swoord.
What should wee doo in this cace? There is no compounding with
them, but by renouncing of Gods truth. But wee know what order is
taught vs heere by the holie Ghoste. For Saint Paule could well
haue sayd io one woord, Agree, my freends. But he sawe well hee
should haue spoken but one half, and that his doctrine also should haue
bin misconstrewed: and therfore he sayth, <hi>Let vs bee knit toogither
in the truthe,</hi> and let vs rather gyue ouer all the frendship of the
worlde, and procure the anger of all vnbeleeuers, and of all such
as rebell ageinst God, than swar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e one whit from it. But if wee
seeke too bee at good agreement in the truthe, and none of bs bee wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too himself, but rather euery of vs procure the welfare and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his neyghbours: that is the concord which ought to be among
vs.</p>
               <p>The thing then which wee haue in effect too remember vppon this
streyne, is, that on the one syde we must beware of confederating with
Gods enemyes,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om. 12. d. 18.</note> that wee stryke not sayle (as they say) too please
them. For although it behoue vs too seeke too haue peace and vnitie
with all men, as neere as wee can: yit is Gods truthe alwayes excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and wee must make more account of that, than of all the world.
And in deede they that will needs gartify creatures, and in the meane
season turne away from Gods truth (as much as they can:) shall bee
alwayes vnhappie. Wherfore let vs euermore abyde stedfastly by
our God, and hold vs vnder his yoke, and not shrink away in any wyse,
but rather defye the whole world, yea though there were no man too
hold with vs. That is one poynt.</p>
               <p>Agein, if the world may bee wonne too obedience, and wee bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too doo so much as too drawe one or twoo too consent in one fayth
with vs: then must wee put our indeuer and labour theruntoo. For
wee must shun these twoo extremities, namely of offending God, and
of turning away from his pure woord, too purchace mens fauor: and
also of being so hygh mynded and full of statelinesse, as too trust euery
man to himselfe, and to let others alone, and too passe for no man but
himselfe: for these are two euill extremities which wee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23289:210"/>
of. But let vs learne too ioyne these twoo things as insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
namely that wee yeeld God trew obedience through fayth, by
holding our selues to the pure simplicitie of his word: and agein, that
therwithall we despyze not our neyghbours, but indeuer to win them,
that they may submit themselues quietly (vntoo God), and by that
meanes al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of vs both greate and small may speake as it were with
one mouth, through the holy Ghoste reigning in our harts, and all of
vs haue the knowledge that hath bin spoken of, namely that God is so
the authour of our saluation, that he hath also shewed himself a father
towards vs, in adopting vs, and in voutsafing to haue vs to be al of his
household: Which cannot bee, except wee liue all in good concord,
bycause he is the God of peace. And although wee should bee driuen
too fyght ageinst the whole world: yit let vs bee of good comfort, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Angels of heauen are our companions in cleauing vnto God.
Should wee then in these dayes separate our selues from an infinite
multitude of men, which presume vppon their riches, their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
their pomp, their credit, yea &amp; their wisdome? (Yea: and let vs
esteeme euery whit of it but as trashe, and for our owne parte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they call vs Schismatikes, count vs but as the ofscow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the world: let vs hold vs contented, in that wee know that the
Angels of heauen, the holie Patriarks, the Hrophets, the Apostles,
and the Martirs agree with vs: and too be short, that all Gods cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
people from Abell too his present day, doo beare vs sufficient
companie. And so may wee despyze all that shalbee layd too our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche,
when wee haue Gods truthe and the mark wherby wee knowe
our selues too bee his children. For inasmuch as God cannot deny
himself, he will continew alwayes with his Church, wherof we bee a
parcell, if shee sticke vntoo his woord. Let that therfor bee one
poynt.</p>
               <p>But in the meane while also let vs not forget to seeke peace to the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must haue the same doctrine of peace in our thoughts and in our
harts, and indeuer as much as is possible, too bring them too the vnion
of the Gospell, that are separated from it as yit: so that if they which
haue bin as it were stark mad ageinst God, doo yeeld themselues as
lambes and sheepe of the flocke: wee must bee redye to receyue them.
Let vs then bend our selues too that, and not bee giuen euery man too
his owne profite, but assure our selues that sith God hath knit vs
toogither and bound vs one too another: euery of vs ought too imploy
himself too the vttermoste of his abilitie, and according too his owne
measure, too drawe his neyghbours with him, so as we may be ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>And for the same cause also dooth he adde, <hi>that wee should grovve
in all things in him that is our head, that is too vvit, in Iesus

stand so much in our owne conceytes, as too thinke our selues too bee

               <p>And wee see by experience, that this was not spoken for nothyng.

the Starres haue their bryghtnesse: yit must the Sunne shyne aboue
them, and men must knowe that it is he by whome wee haue the trew

leuelled alonely at him. That then is the cause why Saint Paule
addeth expressely, that Iesus Christ must bee our head, and wee
growe in him, and resort vntoo him, and set ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is he which furnisheth it with substance and lyfe, according too the
measure and portion of euery member:</hi> &amp; that when this is done, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the body is well proportioned: howbeit that loue must reigne among
vs, or else there shall be nothing but confuzion: insomuch that if there
bee greatnesse, it will bee ouer huge, so as it shall not bee a naturall
body, but rather a monster. Nowe in saying that wee receyue our
growing of Iesus Christ, that it is he of whom the knitting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
proceedeth, and that it is he also by whom wee bee maynteyned in
life: he sheweth vs our vnthankfulnesse, in that wee yeeld him not the
honor which he deserueth. For must it not needes be that we are tootoo
leaud, when the sonne of God giueth vs all things, and yit wee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeue
him the honor which he requireth, for shewing himself so bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
towards vs? He desyreth not that we should yeeld him any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
nother can we, nother is it needfull: but yit he will be glorifyed.
Now then seeyng wee bee so inriched by him, and wee notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
doo fall too robbing him of his honor, so as he is defrauded and
bereft of it: must it not needes bee that wee bee woorse than diuelish?
Wherfore let vs mark well wherat S. Paule amed: for he intended
heere too reproue the worlde of too leaud an vnthankfulnesse, for not
yeelding our Lord Iesus Christ his dew honour, in somuch as he is
not exalted among vs, nother doo wee thinke vppon him, nother doo
wee place him in chiefe souereintie, that all men myght doo him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
And therwithall he sheweth also, that wee bee almost out of our
wittes when wee honor not Iesus Christ, ne exalt him as wee ought to
doo. For there is not that man which dooth not naturally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ouet his
owne profit. Now then, in forsaking of Iesus Christ, we seeme to haue
conspyred &amp; sworne our owne confuzion, that we might be bereft of all
his grace, &amp; be as rotten members without strength. For he is as the
head of a mans body, &amp; as the roote of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to thrust it into the belly, that men myght not see it: what profit should
the whole body haue by it? Euen so standeth the cace with all such as
would diminish the glory and maiestie of Gods sonne, and lessen his
power, and not acknowledge to what end he was sent of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
namely, that they should seeke all their welfare, and all the partes
of their saluation in him: for it is as much as if they would put downe
their head. But S. Paule telleth vs, that there must bee no knitting in
the body, but that which commeth of the head. For whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth all?
Beholde, the veynes conuey nourrishment euery where through the
whole body, and the senewes hold the bones togither, and giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing:
but yit must all these thinges haue their roote in the head. So
then, if we will needs despyze God in diminishing the glory of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne, surely all will turne to our confuzion. Iesus Christ can wel y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
forbeare vs: but we must needs perish wretchedly like rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions,
if he giue vs not whatsoeuer belongeth to our life. Thus yee see
what S. Paule ment too shewe vs.</p>
               <p>Hereunto he addeth, that there is a certein measure in euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
&amp; that the furnishment therof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the head, so as it sheadeth
through the whole body, howbeit (sayth he) <hi>that is in measure.</hi> When
he sayth, it is in measure, he doth vs to wit, that al the excellencie which
we can see heere, is no derogation to the perfectnesse that is in Iesus
Christ. For there are twoo reasons too bee marked. The one is, that all
that is in man is vnperfect, &amp; therfore that we must resort to our Lord
Iesus Christ, that he alonly may abyde vnimpeached, &amp; not bee ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with other creatures. The other is, that the measure &amp; portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
is in euery member, is not there as hauing his peculiar seat there. For
what could the hand doo, if it were not continually nurrished &amp; mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
by the head? The bond that holdeth altogither must needes bee
maynteyned from thence. Also the naturall heate &amp; mouing must come
from thence, insomuch that the hand shoulde wither euery minute of an
houre, &amp; rotte away, if the head wrought not continually. The like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
is betweene Christ &amp; his Church. For if wee consider well what
is in men: though we admitted one too bee like an Angell: yit hath he
but his measure still. And why? To the intent that Iesus Christ should
not be bereft of the honor that belongeth vnto him. Seeing then that
euery of vs hath his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as hath bin shewed afore:) it is good reason
also that euery of vs should stoope, &amp; not lift vp our hornes too take any


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23289:213"/>
thing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which God reserueth to his only sonne. That is one point.</p>
               <p>Agein, let vs vnderstand, that the same measure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of free gift,
as hath bin shewed alredy: &amp; yit is it not without cause that S. Paule
repeteth it heere agein. For wee see the foolish presumptuousnes of
men, how euery man would be a lord: &amp; we would faine rod God of his
right, to the end to be aduaunced &amp; esteemed our selues. Therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
that loftinesse, and to clenze vs of such vyce, S. Paule putteth vs
in mynd once agein,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. b. 7.</note> that we haue nothing which is not giuen vs. And
therfore we must resort too this which he sayeth in the first too the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians:
Who art thou? Haste thou made thy selfe so excellent by
thyne owne cunnyng? Hast thou any thing which thou canst cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge
as thine owne? No: it is God that hath aduaunced thee so: and
therfore humble thy self. His meaning then is, that all the whole knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
&amp; all the whole furnishing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the head. For it is not ynough
for vs that wee were once created &amp; shaped, but it standeth vs on hand
to haue our members still mainteyned in their plyght. That therefore
is the cause why S. Paul addeth the word furniture, or sheading down,
as if God should shead downe his inworking vppon the head, and the
head shead fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rth the same inwoorking throughout all the members.
And that is it which S. Paul ment, in saying that Iesus Christ is our
spirituall head, who hath receyued all fulnesse of grace, according too
the first chapter of S. Iohn, where it is sayd, that it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him not
for himself alone: but for vs also which are his brethren. Seeyng it is
so, let vs vnderstand that al the grace which we haue receyued of God,
is creeped into vs by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ, and that
wee haue the full furnishing of it throughout also by him. Trew it is
that the sayd strength or inwoorking passeth through euery member,
and in comming from the head, it shal be in the shoulder, before it bee
in the arme, and afterward in the arme, before it be in the hand: but yit
for all that, shall the arme therfore glory in it selfe, and giue the hand
no part with it? No: but his receyuing is to impart it vntoo the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew
of the limbes, and all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the head. Agein, shal not the hand
on the one syde, giue of his power backe agein too the arme (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
syde? Yis:) for euery member knowes his owne office, that is
too say, euery member hath naturally an inclination too serue all the
rest of the bodye, as though God had giuen them discretion and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
too say, thus it must bee. They be bound vntoo it, and knowe
the neede that eche of them hath of others helpe.</p>
               <p>Trew it is, that my hand cannot iudge any thing, but yit hath God put


<pb facs="tcp:23289:214"/>
such an indowment &amp; disposition into it, that it desireth nothing rather
than too imploy it self to the seruice of all the rest of the body. Also the
foote doth his dewtie without intreating or bydding, as though God
had imprinted such a discretion in them (as to consider) that all of them
receiue their power from heauen, and that the things which they haue
receyued, must be fitted thervntoo.</p>
               <p>Now if a man shoulde demaunde, Is euery man then alyke and
equall in the Church? Saint Paule, in speaking of portion and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
meaneth not that God hath distributed lyke portion too euerye
member. For the legge is not the eye: and yit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>euerthelesse, the leg,
according too his qualitie, hath that which it needeth. And for the same
cause also Saint Paule sayeth, that the members should bee so knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,
as they myght make vp one whole body through loue, and by
that meane haue euerye one wherewith too bee contented. There
are then twoo things which wee must marke: namely that Gods gifts
are diuers, and that some are much more excellent than other. For the
Eye is an excellenter member than the foote, and wee see also how it
is had in honour: and the mouth is more than the leg. Marke it then
for one poynt, that there is such diuersitie, that our Lord exalteth and
honoreth whom he listeth more than others. There are both great and
small in the Church, and all must not bee teachers and Prophets. But
yit this diuersitie letteth not, but that euery member hath his desyre,
and that which is meete for it, so as the foote enuyeth not the hand, nor
the hand the foote, no more than any of them both enuyeth the eyes.
Too what purpose should it serue the hand too haue syght? It were a
thing which not only could doo it no good, but also should doo it harme.
If euery member had al offices in it self, surely the bodie should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
and come to nought. So then the hand hath his perfection in
that which belongeth vntoo him, I meane in his degree: and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
the foote. Howbeit S. Paules meaning is, that it ought too suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyze
vs, that the Church bee edifyed in common<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures
bee inriched with Gods giftes: the same redoundeth partly
vntoo vs. And on the other syde, if wee haue receyued a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of grace: wee bee the more bound too imparte the same too such
as haue neede of it. That therefore is the thing which Saynt Paule
meaneth too set downe in this text, saying, that if the knittyng bee
after that manner, the bodye shall bee well buylded and made vp.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:23289:214"/>And heere wee see how he contineweth his matter, which is, that
wee must be so linked toogither according too the doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
as Iesus Christ may reigne ouer vs, and wee knowe that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father hath giuen vs him, with condition that wee should all
linke toogither vnder him, and maynteyne a brotherly vnitie among
vs. But yit afore all things, wee must bee subiect too him that hath
all souereine dominion, and consider that for asmuch as the heauenly
father hath set him in that degree, wee must all ame at him, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
in his obedience vntoo the end. And therwithall let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that that cannot bee doone, without loue, that is too say, vnlesse
euery of vs rid himself of the cursed affection of seeking too much our
owne profit. For in deede it is easye too perceyue, that that affection
dooth so blynd vs, that it makes vs too despyze our neyghboures. So
much the more therfore dooth it behoue euery of vs too indeuer too
giue ouer his owne ryght, and too knowe that God hath not so distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his giftes, that euery man may bee a world or a Church of himself,
but that for asmuch as euery man hath neede of his neyghboures, the
same is the very meane wherby he will hold vs toogither. And that
ought also too prouoke vs so much the more too doo what wee can one
for another. Although then that there bee but one fountayne from
whence wee drawe all spirituall giftes, namely euen our Lord Iesus
Christ: yit notwithstanding, God maketh the fulnesse of the grace
which he hath put in Iesus Christ, too flowe foorth as it were by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles,
that wee may receyue euerye man his portion, as is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for vs. And so yee see in effect what wee haue too remember
heere.</p>
               <p>Now were this doctrine well put in vre: surely all the trubbles
that are now adayes in the world, would soone bee appeased, and there
would no more bee so many bickerings and disputings: but wee should
easly agree all toogither. For Ambition or Uaynglorye is the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all heresyes, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men will needes exalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, they must
needes therby thrust downe Christ if they could. Agein, whence
spring Superstitions, but of this, that men knowe not the inestimable
benefytes that are brought vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, and are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offered vntoo vs in him by the Gospell? This hath made the world
alwayes wanton and wandering after his owne lusts: this hath made
men too forge so many patrons and aduocates: this hath made men
too aduaunce their owne deseruings: this hath made folke too deuyze


<pb facs="tcp:23289:215"/>
so manye satisfactions, so many meanes wherwith too please God,
and so many new seruices: namely for that they were not contented
with Iesus Christ, and all for want of knowing what manner a one he
is, and that when wee once haue him, he ought too suffyze vs, and wee
too hold our selues too him, bycause the father hath so gloryfyed him,
as wee ought of duetie too doo him homage, and too honour him as our
souereyne King. For asmuch then as wee see the wretched vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
to be scattered here &amp; there, by reason that they turne away from
Iesus Christ: we haue so much the more neede to be warned to hold vs
simply to his obedience, &amp; to know that all our welfare commeth of
him, &amp; (therfore) that we ought to returne to him to yeeld him his dew
honour, &amp; therwithall put our whole trust in him, &amp; that too the intent
we may so doo, we must consider that there is nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

vs euen vntill he haue brought bs to his perfection, that is to say,
to the perfection which we hope for by him. And for this cause was
the holy Supper left vs, as a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berance that our Lord Iesus Christ
is he in whom we must wholly seeke all things belonging to the lyfe
of our soules. For (there) we professe, that he is our nurrishment, euen
to satisfye vs to the full. And therfore the cause why wee come (thither)
to eate &amp; drinke, is to put vs in mynd that we haue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Iesus Christ, not
the halfe of our lyfe only, but the whole of it: &amp; that when wee bee fed
with him, we must content our selues with him, &amp; not seeke one droppe
nor myte (as they say) elsewhere. After this maner then must wee now
come to the holy table: that is to wit, after the examining of our owne
sinnes, when we once know that wee bee nothing: wee must seeke by
what meanes God calleth vs to him, and how we may keepe our way
thither, euen tyll we be perfectly knit vnto him: namely (by knowing)
that Iesus Christ is giuen vs, and that in him we haue all that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooffull
and wanting in our selues. And therfore let vs so esteeme our
Lord Iesus Christ, as wee may take him for our very sustenance, and
as our fayth (as I haue touched afore) be not haled away to roue heere
and there, and finally to vanish quyte away, but may so rest vpon him,
as we may know that there is nother rightuousnesse, nor holinesse, nor
merit, nor power, nor aught else in our selues, but that wee shall fynde
all in him, &amp; that we cannot be parttakers of him, but wee must also be
parttakers of all the goods that he hath receiued of God his father.


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23289:215"/>
Seeing then that all the good thinges which God hath put intoo our
head, are communicated vnto vs by his meanes: let vs learne to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selues, &amp; not to clymb in such wise, as he should be defrauded of
his honor, but confesse simply and without feyning, that looke whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is giuen vs through his free goodnesse, he mainteyneth &amp; preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it, &amp; moreouer increaceth and stablisheth it in vs more and more.
Furthermore let vs marke, that wee cannot possesse the goods of our
Lord Iesus Christ to take any profit by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, except we first inioy him.
And that is the cause why he giueth himself vnto vs. And thinkes it
not ynough to giue vs some part and portion of his rightuousnesse, of
his desertes by the sacrifyce of his death and passion, of the obedience
that he yeelded vnto God his father, &amp; of all the giftes which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
fully of God his father, (I say, he thinkes it not ynough to giue vs
some part and portion of them) in his Sacraments: but he sayth, I am
yours, possesse yee mee. Then is it not ynough for vs too go seeke our
wants at his hand, that he may impart them to vs: but (wee must also
consider,) first of all, how he offereth himself vntoo vs, and sayeth, Lo
heere my body which is deliuered for you, lo heere my blud which shal
be shed for the remission of your sinnes. And this is doone, too the ende
that wee should know, that he dwelleth in vs truly by his holy spirit, &amp;
that wee liue by his owne substance, &amp; that it is not sayd heere without
cause, that the knitting of the bodye commeth of hym, and that he
is the furniture thereof, and that forasmuch as wee want the grace
and giftes that belong too our spirituall lyfe, wee must drawe them
out of that fountayne. And if we resort to him with perseuerance in the
fayth of the Gospell, wee shall feele our selues more and more streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
and stablished in all grace, euen till he haue rid vs of all our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
&amp; infirmities, too make vs inioy his heauenly glory with
him.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs so too feele
them, as wee may be sory for them: and therwithall too worke so in vs
hereafter, as wee may from day too day bee clenzed of all our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and vyces, more and more, and that our Lord Iesus Christ,
who is the welspring of all purenesse, may so shed foorth the grace of

lyke as it woulde smally boote too sowe

that Saint Paule haue heretofore shewed

they were conuerted too the fayth of our Lord Iesus Christ, had liued
a certeine tyme in ignorance, and bin giuen too all naughtinesse and
leaud lyfe, euen too the vttermost. Yit notwithstanding, Saint Paul
setteth it downe heere in generall, that all they which haue not bin

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23289:216"/>
the very roote that commeth with them from their moothers womb,
euery man hardeneth more and more, tyll they fall intoo such excesse,
that they become as monsters, and appeare no more too bee creatures
fashyoned after the image of God. Yee see then that in effect Saint
Paules intent is, that after he hath declared Gods stablishing of his
gouernment ouer vs: Now too the end that our walking in this world
should bee too go vnto God, and too the heauenly lyfe, wheruntoo he
calleth vs: he sheweth that wee shall neuer obey him, nor bow our
necke too receyue his yoke, vntyll wee haue chaunged both our dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and mynd, and forsaken our selues, by cause wee be vtterly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>And so there are twoo parts in the instruction that is giuen vs.
The one sheweth vs wheruntoo God calleth vs: and the other, that
wee must fyght ageinst our owne sinfulnesse, and vtterly imprison
our selues, that wee may become teachable too receyue the doctrine
that God setteth out for vs. Howbeeit for asmuch as that is hard too
doo: Saint Paule thinks it not ynough too giue vs single warning:
but also cyteth vs, and after a sort setteth him in seat of Iustice, before
whom wee must yeeld an account, too the intent too moue them and
quicken them the more too whom he speaketh. For it is no small
thing to make men to renounce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, considering how euery man
sootheth himself, and beleeueth that he is able to woork wonders. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he bee saped in naughtinesse, yit thinks he that he hath some
vertues in him. Yea and although wee haue our faults proued too our
faces, yit will wee labour too cloke them through hipocrisie, and too
set some fayre colour and glosse vpon them, or else we will maynteyne
them wilfully, and neuer yeeld our selues giltie, though our shame lye
open to the whole world. To be short, it is a very hard incounter, when
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must as well lay down all the wisdome which he weened himself

affections, that he may bee subiect vntoo God, and haue nothing in
him self that shall stryue ageinst him.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. b. 7.</note> For our flesh is too too stout in
that behalf: and wee heare how it is sayd in another text, that all a

                  <note place="margin">Gene. 6. a. 5. &amp; 8. c. 21.</note> yea euen at the tyme that
the world had the greatest soundnesse that euer it had, that whatsoeuer

naughtinesse and rebellion ageinst God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So then, it was requisite


<pb facs="tcp:23289:217"/>
that greate vehemencie should bee vsed in this behalf: and therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
dooth Saint Paule vse it, saying that he not only teacheth, but also
cyteth them too whom he speaketh, too the end they may knowe that
they bee as it were in Gods presence, and that it is not for them too
fall asleepe in their vayne selfflatteries, but that as the diuell hath
manie allurements too beguyle vs, so on the contrarie part, Gods
woord must inlyghten vs: and that although wee forslowe too consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our vyces, and had leuer too conceale them: yit wee must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that it is more for our profit to come too reason, and too examin
throughly what is in vs. That is the cause why Saint Paule myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too exhort the Ephesians too chaunge of lyfe, setteth downe this
adiuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; kind of witnesse bearing, as though he were present before
Gods iudgment seate. If there bee any couenanting betweene man
and man, this solemnitie and Ceremonie of swearing, will moue them,
and cause them to bethink themselues well what they promis, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
if they bee not quyte out of their wits. Howbeeit, heere is not
some Notarie too take notyce of their othes, and such other customes
as are among men, to ratify the things that they agree vppon among
themselues: but heere is Saint Paule, who standeth in the behalf
and person of Iesus Christ, from whom hee hath authoritie, not only
too requyre vs, but also too summon vs too make our account,
if wee indeuer not too discharge our dewtie: yea and he telleth vs, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is not for vs too let slip the things that he sayeth, nor too heare them
with deaf eares, bycause God is present too punish our rechlenesse in
despyzing his woord. Sith it is so, let vs learne too leaue flattering
of our selues, as manie doo, whom wee see too pretend deafnesse: and
whatsoeuer cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenances they make, they continew alwayes the same
they were afore. Wherfore let vs mark well, that God thinking it

vs, that he wil not suffer such contempt of his woord, when wee

vntoo vs, too giue vs a warrantyze of our saluation.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come too the effect of that which is conteyned heere.
Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>Bee not as the rest of the Gentyles are.</hi> I haue
told you alredye that they too whom he wryteth, were for a tyme quyte
giuen too all naughtinesse, and without the feare of God. For euen
from their cradle they had bin brought vp in all maner of Idolatrie, &amp;
yit they thought themselues well discharged, when they had doone


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:23289:217"/>
some sacrifyze too their puppets. Like as at this day in the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they that play moste murlimewes, are counted most holie: and
they think themselues out of Gods dette, so they haue once doone a
sort of pelting tryfles. For that cause dooth Saint Paule send the
Ephesians too this similitude, saying, that if they looke vppon the rest
of the Gentyles, there they may see in what plyght and taking they
weere, before God had gathered them intoo his Church. Prye vppon
your selues there, (sayeth he): for there shall you see your owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
before such tyme as God reached you his hand, and drew you
out of the dungeon of vnbeleef wherin you were plunged, you differed
nothing at all from them. Now then at leastwyse yee ought too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the grace that hath bin graunted you, that it may bring foorth
fruite in you</p>
               <p>By the way let vs marke, that in vsing this speech, <hi>the rest of the
Gentyles,</hi> Saint Paule comprehendeth heere al mankynd. For he
speaketh not of twoo or three men only, nor of any one nation, nor of
some countrie: but he sayeth generally, that all they which had not bin
trayned in the Gospell, were blynd wretches, as wee see. Too bee
short, he sheweth what maner of ones wee be, vntill God haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vs with his grace, too the intent wee should not cast this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
away, nor beare our selues on hand, that we be exempted from
all the things which we shall see hereafter. Therfore too the end wee
surmyze not a priuiledge too withdrawe our selues from the common
aray of men: Saint Paule hath heere knit all Adams children toogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as it weere in one bundle. For in all mankynd there is nothing
too bee found but leawdnesse and corruption. Heere therfore are two
poynts which wee haue too mark. The one is, that heere as it were
in a looking glasse, wee should behold what our owne state is, so long
as God giueth vs the brydle, and letteth vs follow our owne swindge.
Mark that for one poynt: and I will lay it out more at large anon.
The other is, that when wee see the enormities which are committed
through the whole world, &amp; that men bee so shamelesse in euil dooing,
or rather altoogither bewitched, and some so besotted, as a man can by
no meanes moue them to learne too feare God: when wee see (I say)
on the one syde such stubbornnesse in men, and on the other syde soo
grosse and beastly senslesnesse: let vs learne to spy our selues there, and
too consider that God did vs a singular good turne, when it pleased
him too touche vs too the quicke, that his woord myght preuayle in


<pb facs="tcp:23289:218"/>
vs. For wee differ nothing at al from the woorst and most disordere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

see then what wee should haue bin if God had not pityed vs. And this
ought too touche vs wel too the quicke, that the grace which God
hath graunted vs, bee not darkened and quyte quenched in the end, so
as wee bee quyte and cleane bereft of it. After this manner therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ought wee too apply this text too our instruction, where Saint Paul
setteth other men before vs, which haue not yit bin inlyghtened by the
fayth of the Gospell, but are let alone: that by comparing our state
with theirs, wee may consider how mercifull God shewed him self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vs, in drawing vs out of such a dungeon, too the intent that wee
should bee the diligenter in giuing our selues vntoo him.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he sayth, <hi>VValk no more hensforth as they did in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of mynd.</hi> By this woord <hi>Hensfoorth</hi> or <hi>Hereafter,</hi> he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
too shame such as trayned in the Gospell, if their lyfe proue not
that they haue not mispent their labour. For too what purpose are wee
called too the fayth of our Lord Iesus Christ, but too separate our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
from the stumbling blockes of the world? Therefore wee must not
excuze our selues by our bringing vp in euyll custome, nor by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
that myght allure vs too leaudnesse, nor yit by that there is
nothing but frowardnesse round about vs: for seeyng that God hath
adopted vs too bee his children, he wyll haue vs to lyue therafter. And
therefore let vs marke, that fayth importeth such a reforming of our
selues, as our lyfe bee cleane chaunged. And for the same cause is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and too much, and wee may be maruelously fyne headed: but that shal

say, vntill wee leade a newe lyfe.</p>
               <p>Besydes this, wee haue too marke heere, that after Saynt Paule
hath spoken of the vanitie of mynd, he addeth, <hi>Blyndnesse of mynde,
or Darkenesse of vnderstanding:</hi> and lastly he sayeth, <hi>Blyndnesse or
Stubbornesse of hart.</hi> This blazing of men after this sort, serues
well too put them quyte out of conceyt. For when the Philosophers
spake of the excellencie and woorthinesse that is in mans nature, they
did alwayes set downe Reason as an ouerruler: Next hir they did
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselues, and make a serching and a turmoyling (for things). Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23289:218"/>
that manner did they make as it were a Courte barre, too the
end too make man iudge of good and euill. It should seeme then that
Saynt Paule heere abaceth men too much, when he sayth, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath nothing in it but vanitie, vntruth, and deceytfulnesse: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
that all that euer men can conceyue, is but a maze of vayne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and that they doo but ouerthrowe them selues more and more, as
if a blynd wretch should wander abroade in the darke. Yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the holy Ghost is the only competent iudge too giue sentence
of the things that are in vs, least wee myght thinke our selues too haue
wonne the goale by flattering of our selues, according as he told vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that men haue theyr eyes so blyndfolded with the fond opinion
which they haue conceyued of their owne woorthinesse, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee ashamed and confesse their owne leaudnesse. That was the
cause why the Philosophers did alwayes magnify the nature of man,
and yit notwithstanding experience sheweth the cleane contrarye: for
the vanitie that is in them is apparrant. But they wyted that vppon
mens negligence and rechlesnesse, so that if men would aply all the
senses of nature throughly, too knowe what is good, they should bee
as little Angels. They imagined so: but that was for want of boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yng
them too the bottom. For they neuer wist what God is: and
that made them too discharge themselues so lyghtly toowardes him:
insomuch that euen they which disputed most cunningly of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
and had a hygher vnderstanding than the common sort, and
(too bee short) were esteemed the wyzest men in the world: could not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
neuer come neere the truth of God: and whensoeuer
his seruis came in question, they were so graueled, that they turned all
things vpsyde downe. And so the wisedome of the world will not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uffer vs too come too the heauenly lyght: for it is a speciall gifte of
God, and not too bee found in our selues. Yee see then that euen the
greatest men of skyll deceyued themselues: and that is the cause that
men fall asleepe in this fond opinion wherto they were to much incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
afore. Yea and we see that this foolish or rather diuelish ouerwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place euen among the Iewes, insomuch that they haue
alwayes bin of opinion, (as men are now adayes in the popedome)
that they haue freewill. Trew it is that the Papistes will graunt
more than the heathen folke, namely that wee be corrupted by original
sin, howbeeit their meaning is, that notwithstanding the infirmitye
which is in man, yit there abydeth some remnant of goodnesse in him,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:219"/>

Too bee short, such as will needes iudge according too their naturall
vnderstanding, say, that men are as sound &amp; vncorrupted, as Angels.
The Papistes being conuicted by so manye recordes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  </gap>e from our originall,
and that there are manye vyces in vs: but yit is that no let (say they)
but that we be still half cleane, and are able to do good of our owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
when wee bee once humbled before God. To be short, they make
such a partnership betwene God and men, that they say in deede, that
wee haue neede too bee inlyghtned from aboue, too atteyne too fayth:
but yit that wee haue some lyght in our selues, and God maketh vp
that which wanteth. Agein, they will say, that lust dooth so reigne in
vs, as it is ryght hard for vs too submit our selues too God, but yit that
wee must labour too doo it, and are able too doo it, so that God ayd vs
and reache vs his hand. This is the Concurrence (as they terme it)
(that is too say, the matching or marrowing toogither) of Gods
grace, and of the goodnesse that remayneth in man, though wee bee
corrupted. But (as I sayd) let vs rather herken too that which God
himself, euen he which only is the competent Iudge hath spoken of it
by vnrepealable sentence, which is, that all they which follow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, and the things that man hath of him self, are blynd wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And what shall then become of Reason? For although men
think that it serueth too giue them lyght, and too shew them the way:
yit is it certeyne that it dooth but alwayes tumble them intoo the pit:
and wheras they weene themselues too bee well aduyzed, they shalbe
stark beasts. And the cause why this is told vs continewally, is too
doo vs too vnderstand, that God must bee fayne too reforme vs, not by

               <p>And heere a man myght ask a question: if men (I meene those

let vs mark, that all the vnderstanding and discretion which is in vs,
and all the iudgment which it is possible for vs too haue, serueth too

must he beare the sentence of damnation about him in his hart, (as

whether he will or no, so as he shall say, I am giltie in this thing and

not too leade them in the way of saluation, but only too make them so
much the more giltie before God. For as touching our affections,
it myght be sayd, that there are many which liue honestly and without
blame, though they neuer tasted of the Gospel. Yeamary, but in the

and no dout but that all such as haue not bin reformed by Gods spirit,
shall still feede a sea of wicked, froward, and malicious lusts within
them. And therfore let vs not stay vppon the outward showe,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. b. 7. &amp; Psal. 7. c. 10. &amp;. 44. d. 22. &amp; Iere. 17. b. 10. &amp; 1. Iohn. 5. d. 20.</note> but let
vs mark how it is not for nought that God chalengeth the searching
of mens hartes as his peculiar office: and therfore that must bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
vntoo him. Also let vs call too mynd how Saint Iohn in his
Epistle sayth, that we see not all the sinnes that are in vs, but that God
who seeth farre more cleerly, is the Iudge therof. Howsoeuer the cace
stand, when men haue doone the best they can, yit can they not rid their
hands of condemnation, when they come before the heauenly Iudge,

then let vs note, that vntill God haue visited vs, and is come vntoo vs,

sciences and knowledges, sauyng in the chiefe: that is too wyt, of
commyng vnto God. In this all haue fayled, they haue all wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
away, and there was nothyng but fasehoode and deceyt in their
cace. And the further they indeuered too thrust themselues foreward,
so muche the deeper dyd they plundge them selues intoo the myre.
Wherefore let vs note, that although the light shyne (as it is sayd in
the first chapter of saint Iohn:) yit notwithstanding wee beyng dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
conceyue it not. Saint Iohn sheweth, that euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng
God separated men from beastes, imprintyng his image in
them, and gyuyng them discretion too discerne betweene good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll.
The lyfe of man then serues not onely too eate and drinke, but
also too consider that wee haue a better lyfe, and that is, too haue some
order and common pollicie here beneath, and too vnderstand that there
is a God which ruleth all.</p>
               <p>Loe here the lyght that was before Adams fall. And this lyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bydeth
yit styll, but yit it shyneth in darknesse, and the darknesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
it not, but rather quencheth it quite and cleane out. So
then if wee haue any small insight or ame, let vs consider that it is but
as a little spark, which passeth and vanisheth away out of hand. But
in the meane whyle, as concerning our owne nature, that wee should
bee able too haue regard of goodnesse, or too seeke it, followe it, and
continew in it: it is vtterly vnpossible. And why? For our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is stark blynd.<note place="margin">Psal. 94. b. 11.</note> To be short, there is nothing but vanitie in vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
too this saying, that God perused the thoughts of men, and
sawe there was nothing but vanitie and leazing in them.</p>
               <p>Now too expresse this yit better, Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>that they
had their vnderstanding darkened, and vvere straungers too the
lyfe of God:</hi> wherin he cutteth of the occasion of all excuses that men
can make. For they will replye continually ageinst God, and though
they bee condemned, yit will they alwayes haue the last woord, (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:)
what can I doo with it if there bee nothing but vanitie in mee,
seeing that God created mee so? why made he mee not otherwise?
But Saint Paule telleth vs heere, that wee haue our vnderstanding
ouercast with our owne darknesse. And why? Bycause the lyght is
quenched by the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is come vpon vs in Adam. To be short,
S. Paul sheweth vs here, that we must keepe our mouthes shet, when
the scripture bewrayeth that we bee both ignorant, blynd, and brutish.
We must not think to further our cace by alledging that god ought to


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:23289:220"/>
haue made vs otherwyse: for the euill proceedeth of Adams fall, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not only he was bereft of the good that he had receyu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, but all
wee also were impouerished in him. And lyke as he that for feyteth
his goods, must beg and his children to, so must wee also also in our
penurie and pouertie consyder still at this day, the misfortune that is
come vppon vs through the fault and offence of our first father. Thus
yee see how Saint Paule hath heere disappoynted all starting holes,
that men are woont too set afore them, too shewe themselues too bee
ryghtuous and innocent before God. For whence commeth the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our mynd in that wee bee both blynd and ignorant? Euen of
our beyng in darknesse, and by darkening of the lyght that God had
put intoo vs in our first creation. And forasmuch as this is a harde
matter too brucke, S. Paule bringeth vs too the lyfe of God: and that
is too laugh too scorne all the tryflyng imaginations that men haue
contryued too maynteyne their owne Freewill, Reason, and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For (as I haue sayd already) the bookes of the Philosophers
are full of such stuffe. In the Popedome there is bickering still at
this day for Freewill, as though all were mard, if man had not some
good selfmouing and abilitie too prepare himselfe too receyre grace,
and were made fellowe with God, and could make the grace effectuall
which is offered him. By which reckening men shall not onely bee
hayle fellowe with God (if they may bee beleeued) but of better abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
than he, so as he shall but adde some little portion too them. But
S. Paule sayeth, that wee may well bee alyue in our opinion: but as
in respect of God, wee shall not fayle too bee as dead carkesses, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
euen as rotten and stinking carions. Then let not men take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them through their foolish ouerweening to haue reason, wisedome,
and freewyll: but if they would fayne knowe their owne state, let them
lyft vp their eyes and consider that theyr liuing must bee the lyfe of
God, and not the lyfe which euery man fancyeth heere too himselfe. S
Paule in the seuenth too the <hi>Romanes,</hi> confesseth that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
alyue for a tyme, namely, before he had bin conuerted too the pure
doctrine, bycause he was full of hipocrisie, and possessed with such
pryde, that he thought himself too bee as a little Angell. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
Bycause Gods lawe had not yit sifted him throughly.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 9.</note> But when I
once entered intoo my selfe (sayeth he) and knew what it was too lust:
then did Gods Lawe wound mee too death, and I perceyued that the
lyfe which I had lyued afore, was but death, and that I had made my


<pb facs="tcp:23289:221"/>
selfe too beleeue woonders, taking my selfe too bee that which I was
not, as fooles doo, which beleeue that they bee Kings and Princes,
when in the meane whyle lyce eate them vp, or else they starue for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and cold. So then, Saint Paule confesseth that before he was
conuerted, he was alyue too his owne seemyng, and he tryumphed at
it: but when Christ had once humbled him, and made him feele what
Gods iudgment was, then he gaue ouer that lyfe, and sawe well that
it was but a death.</p>
               <p>Lykewyse he sayeth now, that although wee bee alyue in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the world, so as men clap their hands at vs, and magnyfye our
vertewes, and that wee our selues also are besotted with the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
it is nothing at all, but wee must go vntoo God. Now wee
shall fynd that God hath a speciall lyfe which he reserueth and keepeth
as layd vp in secret for his children. For albeeit that he make his
daysonne too shyne both vppon good and bad, and shewe himselfe lybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
towardes all without exception. Yit dooth he not scatter abrod
the things that serue for his chozen, according too this saying of this
Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. f. 20. 21</note> Lord how great is thy goodnesse which thou hast layd vp in
store for them that feare thee? It is as a treasure that thou hast
hoorded vp for them. So then whereas Saint Paule speaketh heere
of Gods lyfe: he sheweth that in lyuing according too our nature, wee
haue not our lyfe of him. Whence then? Is it not God that hath
created vs? Is it not he of whom wee haue our beeing and mouing:
as it is sayd in the seuenteenth of the Actes. Then is our common lyfe
of God, in asmuch as he is our maker: but in asmuch as he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the chozen, and in asmuch as he is the father of his children
whom he hath adopted: this lyfe which is common both too good and
bad, is not named Gods lyfe, but mans lyfe: God letteth it alone in
his plyght. And which then is Gods lyfe? It is, when vppon his
choozing of vs, he sheweth vs the way of lyfe and saluation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth
vs by his holye spirit, so as Iesus Christ dwelleth in vs by
fayth, (as wee haue seene afore) and vttereth his power in vs, causing
our old man to be crucifyed with him, yea &amp; euen buried too, that wee
may bee rayzed agein, euen too bee separated from all vncleannesse of
the world, that wee may not resemble the vnbeleeuers, who are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prisoners vnder the tyrannye of Satan, and are driuen and haled by
him, and giue ouer themselues too all euill. That is in effect the cause
why S. Paule hath spoken too vs here of Gods lyfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:23289:221"/>And now, that wee may the beteer bee wakened and receyue this
exhortation vnfeynedly: let vs not deceyue our selues any more with
the opinions that euery of vs may conceyue in our owne head, nor yit
with the iudgment of men, which oftymes doo prayse and commend
the thing that is nothing woorth. Uerilye wee knowe how our Lord
Iesus Christ sayeth in Saint Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 16. d. 15.</note> that the thing which is hygh and
excellent afore men, is vtterly lothsome before God. Too the intent
therefore that wee may no more bee deceyued by them, let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that vntyll God haue made vs new creatures, and begotten vs
agein by his holye spirit, wee bee blynd in our vnderstanding, wee
haue nothing in vs but vanitie, and wee bee vtterly ignorant, yea and
starke beastes. That is in effect the thing that wee haue too beare in
mynd. Wherfore as oft as wee fall too our accustomed byase, and
followe our owne fancie, let vs learne too cyte our selues beefore
God, and too wey wel what is ment by the lyfe that he reserueth as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
too himself. Not that it serueth for none other but himself, but
bycause he bestoweth it vppon none but his owne children. For ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is that he sheweth himself to haue chozen vs, as wee haue seene in
the first chapter.</p>
               <p>Now heerupon he setteth downe immediatly the hardnesse of their
hart: not a single hardnesse, after the maner as wee take hardnesse: for
the (greeke word betokeneth a thickenednesse (or muddinesse) as when
a peece of wyne that was very well fyned, is so trubbled, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
all Lees, and groweth thicke (and muddie lyke a puddle,) so as
there is no more cleere licour in it. Euen so Saynt Paule sayeth
that the hart is thickened, when it is so blynded and hardened by that
meane, as it cannot yeeld too the obeying of God, and that then there
is no cleerenesse in it, but all is trubbled lyke a puddle. And this word
Hart, doth in the holy Scripture betoken now and then, all the lustes,
lykings, and will of man: and sometymes also his vnderstanding.
But for asmuch as heere Saint Paule hath put a difference betweene
a mans vnderstanding, and his mynd, and his Hart: we may wel think
that he ment too adde the will, togither with all the scannings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings
which wee make (in our selues) about the iudging of good
and euill: and finally the whole vnderstanding which wee haue, and
the reason that reigneth in vs. Saynt Paule therfore ment in effect
too shewe, that man is so corrupted in all partes of him through the
sinne of Adam, as there is nother wit nor wil, but it tendeth wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:222"/>
euill, and is vtterly saped in it. And therfore lyke as erst he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the beastlinesse that is in vs: so now also he sheweth that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
bee as blockes, and cannot bee quiet too follow our God whither soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he calleth vs, but that wee be stubborne, and haue stiffe neckes
which cannot bowe, as Moyses also vpbraydeth those that rebelled
ageinst God, (telling them) that they had a necke of yron or brasse.
And euen such are wee too of nature. And for that cause is it sayd in
Ezechiell,<note place="margin">Ezech. 36. f. 26.</note> that God will chaunge the hartes of them whom he will
haue saued, so that wheras they were stonye before, he will make them
fleshye. This similitude sheweth well, what is in vs tyll God haue
wrought an alteration in vs. For wee haue nothing but hardnesse:
which is as much as if the holy Ghost should say, that wee bee Gods
enemyes, and refuzers of al truth, vntill God haue softened vs, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the crabbednesse and stubbornnesse, wherethrough w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e cast
vp our rage in such wyze ageinst God. Too bee short, all our lustes
are as men of warre marching in battell, to let God that he should not
reigne and execute his power and superioritie, which he ought to haue
ouer vs. Lo what our nature is. Now let vs go brag of our owne
freewill, and of our reason: as wee see these wretched Papistes doo,
who are euer harping styll vppon that stryng. But let vs learne too
humble our selues with a good will, and (as I sayd afore) let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that Saynt Paule blameth mens nature, shewing that all of vs
from the greatest too the least, are plundged euen too the bottom of
hel, vntyll God plucke vs backe agein. And therwithall let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
all the enormities that are doone through the whole world, and
conclude, that we our selues should doo as much, if God shewed vs not
his mercie, and let the same stirre vs vp too brydle our selues, least
wee ouershoote our selues at some tyme: and seeing it hath pleased
God too drawe vs vntoo him, let vs not turne backe agein too med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the leawdnesse of the vnbeleeuers. And no wonder though
they stumble, &amp; tumble and reele too &amp; fro, for they haue no lyght to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them by. But our Lord shyneth vppon vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by his woord, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs eyes by his holy spirt: and therfore let vs eschew too bee lyke
them, as S. Paule exhorteth vs heere.</p>
               <p>Heereuntoo he addeth the toppe of al mischeef: which is, that men
go astray after their owne kynd, continew in going outward from
woorse too woorse, and foade themselues with flatterie, wherby they
cast their consciences into such a sleepe, as they feele no more anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23289:222"/>
or griefe: and that is the hygh way too make them vtterly past
recouerie. Now first of all, let vs learne heere too preuent such venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of God, which ought too make vs quake. And when wee heare
that such as abyde styll in their owne nature, and ouershoote themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
so farre as too bee without scruple of conscience, and too become
as brute beastes, voyde of discretion, too be moued eyther with lyfe or
death, or with any maner of feeling of their owne soule health: let vs
a Gods name walke in feare and awe, and bewayle our sinnes euerye
houre early and late, that wee bee not hardened after that fashion. For
wee see how they that growe beastly after that sort, doo gather such a
hard hartednes, as a man cannot bow them, after they haue once got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
such a boldnesse in giuing themselues vntoo euyll. Thus as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the first poynt, let vs bee ryght well assured, that God reuengeth
himselfe after a terrible manner, ageinst all such as foade themselues
in their vyces, and take inordinate leaue too doo what they list, so that
in the end they become brutish, euen as Asses and Dogges.</p>
               <p>And now for the second poynt, if God vse such rigor towards those
which were neuer yit trayned too the Gospell: what will he doo to vs,
when he shall haue shewed vs the way of saluation a long tyme, and yit
wee continew still lyke those that neuer tasted of good instruction? Do
wee not thinke that the punishment shal bee more horrible and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vppon vs? Lyke as when S. Paule declareth in the first too the
<hi>Romanes,</hi> that God gaue men ouer intoo disordinate and shamefull
lustes, so as they were vtterly past all shame: he speaketh expresly of
the heathen and vnbeleeuers, who had none other knowledge of God
than by the skyes and the earth, and the creatures: they had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helpe than that great booke, wherby too glorify God, and yit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they did it not, therefore are they condemned after that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
But now can wee haue no such excuce as those sillie soules had:
wee cannot say wee be not able too discerne what is good, bycause we
were blynded by Adams sinne and there is nothing but vanitie in vs:
for God hath giuen vs his woorde,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. v. 105.</note> which is iustly called a lampe too
guyde vs by: wee haue the Gospell, where our Lord Iesus Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
that he is our guyde: and yit for all this, if we will needes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
God wilfully, by disaulling the doctrine of saluation, whereas
wee should followe it, (of which sort there are many euen at this day,
who seeke too wallowe in all leaudnesse and disorder, and despyze God
openly) what shall become of vs? Wherefore let vs learne too walke


<pb facs="tcp:23289:223"/>
in the feare of God: and let vs marke well, that Saint Paule hath
not without cause set downe here the toppe of all mischief, of purpose to
shewe vs therby what wages God will pay too all such as yeeld not to
him in dewe tyme and place, but rather take libertie of all naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as though they were scaped out of his handes. Let vs then be
afrayde too ouershoote our selues so farre: and then although we haue
wandered farre afore, God can skill well ynough too drawe vs to him.
Let vs bee afrayde least God should execute the sayd vengeance vppon
vs,<note place="margin">Prou. 29. b. 14.</note> as wel as vppon them, according too this saying of Salomon, that
when the wicked man is come too extremitie, he despyzeth all: that is
too say, he regardeth nother lyfe nor death, but flingeth foorth lyke a
brute beast.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs quake at such threatenings, for feare least God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
them vppon vs, when wee cannot abyde too bee rebuked for our
vyces. And contrariwyze let vs practyze the doctrine of Salomon,
where he sayeth,<note place="margin">Prou. 28. b. 14.</note> happie is the man whose hart pricketh him &amp; quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him vp nyght and day. Let vs learne then too bee our owne sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitors,
and too touche our selues for our vyces: and when wee enter
intoo them, let vs bee abashed at them, and cast downe and condemne
our selues, vntill God haue releeued vs with his mercy. After that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
must wee put this doctrine of S. Paules in vre, too the end, that
when God hath once knit vs too him by the meanes of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and giuen vs lyfe: wee may take good heede that that lyfe bee
not defaced and quenched in vs through our owne leaudnesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse.
Agein, that beyng mynded too continew in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
may learne first of all too humble our selues, (for it is certeyne
that humilitie will cause vs too resort vntoo God:) and secondly, that
our humilitie bee matched with warenesse, so as wee bee not rechlesse
too flatter our selues, but that through the same warenesse wee streyne
our selues too the vttermost too fyght ageynst all our vyces and lustes,
tarying our Lordes leyzure vntyll he rid vs quyte and cleane of them:
&amp; in the meane whyle let vs alwayes win somwhat of our selues, bee it
neuer so lyttle, so as it may continually appeare, that our Lord Iesus
Christ woorketh in vs, and maketh his grace too preuayle, by causing
vs too goe foreward in goodnesse: that wee may (say I) bee so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
as wee may growe more and more, vntyll God haue taken vs ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this world.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with

acknowledgment of our sinnes, praying him too touche vs so too the

sinne of Adam, that we discerne not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
good and euill, Howbeeeit that is
not perceyued at the first blush: but if yee
looke into the whole course of mans lyfe,

                  </gap>ed in the Gospell, and the lyfe of the
ignorant and blyud wretches, which neuer wist what God or his will
is. That is the cause why he addeth, that wee ought too keepe a farre
other trade, wee (I say) that are trayned vp in Iesus Christ. As if he
sayd, that such as haue not the lyght of God, straye heere and there,
and no maruell though they doo so, for they be blynd, and wander in
darknesse. But seing that God hath inlyghtened vs, and wee haue
Iesus Christ the daysonne of ryghtuousenesse shyning vppon vs: what
a shame is it if wee bee mingled with those that haue no direction at
all? Then is there no excuce for vs, if wee will alledge the heathen.
For so little can their exawple serue too lessen our sin, that it shall dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our condemnation. And why? God setteth them before our eyes
as looking glasses, wherin too behold what wee our selues and what
our nature is, of all the whyle that wee bee vngouerned of the holy
Ghoste. On the contrarie part we haue our Lord Iesus Christ too
shewe vs the way of lyfe. And it is not for nought that he hath sayd,
that he is the lyght of the worlde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. b. 12.</note> and that whosoeuer walketh in him,
cannot stray:<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. a. 6.</note> and agein, that he is also the way, wherin a man cannot
go amisse. That then is the cause in effect, why Saint Paule addeth,
that it is not so with vs, for wee haue lerned Iesus Christ. And how?
<hi>Yee haue herd him,</hi> layeth he. And his setting downe a those woords,
is of purpose too cut of all occasion of making of shrouding sheete of
ignorance. For men are loth too bee counted fooles, except it bee
when they should come too accounting with God. But then they
would fayne scape by saying, I am a silie idiot, I am not able too bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie
my self in so manie matters, it is vnpossible for me too set my mynd
vntoo that. Yee see then how wee can well ynough acknowledge our
ignorance, when wee bee called and cyted too make our reckening
before God. Agein, another sort will say, that the Gospell is too
hygh and deepe a thing for them. Saint Paule answereth vntoo all
this in one woord, saying, that we haue heard Iesus Christ. As if he
should say, it is long of none but of our selues, that wee haue not bin
well and dewly instucted, seing that the Gospell hath bin preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs. For why? There God sheweth him self, so farre foorth as
is expedient for vs. Then is there sufficient learning in the Gospell,
and it is not for vs too alledge our owne rawenesse, no more than our
darknesse: for God dooth the dewtie of a good and faythfull shcoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayster.


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23289:224"/>
Too bee short, if wee continew still in our beastlinesse, after
we haue heard the doctrine of the Gospell: we must blame our selues
for it: for surely it is not long of God, who knoweth what is meete
for vs. And that is the cause also why Saint Paule protesteth,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. a. 3.</note> that
there is no veyle in his preaching, but that men myght there see Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, if they were not blynded by Satan with vnbeleefe, too goo
away intoo destruction. Howsoeuer the cace stande, wee coulde not
fayle on Gods behalfe too bee guyded and gouerned as is meete for
vs, if wee gaue diligent eare too the things that he sheweth vs in the
Gospell.</p>
               <p>And he dooth yit so much the more aggrauate the leaudnesse of such
as profite not in Gods schoole, when he addeth, <hi>that they haue
bin taught,</hi> not as though it had bin sheweth them what Iesns Christ
is, for once and away, and that they had had but only some small tast of
it: for then myght it seeme that their ignorance were excusable. But
seeing that our eares are continewally beaten with it from day to day,
and wee haue bin confirmed and furthered in the fayth, and yit wee
abyde styll in our beastlinesse: that is vtterlye vnexcuzable. For he
hath shewed heertoofore, that if all this boote vs not, but that notwithstanding
mens stirring of vs vp early and late to come vnto God, and
theyr offering of the foode of lyfe vntoo vs too feede vs withall, so as
wee haue bin confirmed in it from day too day, too the intente wee
should not want any thing: wee bee styll at our Apcie lyke yong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,
and knowe not what the rule of good lyfe is: wee can blame
none but our selues, nother can wee say, that wee bee silie ignorant
soules, or that God speaketh vntoo vs in too darke a language, or
that wee haue not bin trayned vp in the knowledge of the truthe.
All this is dispatched by that which Saint Paule telleth vs heere,
which is, that God hath not ceassed with the preaching of his truth
vntoo vs once or twyce: but that he hath ordeyned the Gospell too bee
preached (continually,) that wee myght be confirmed in it all the time
of our lyfe: and that the thing which wee did not conceyue or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
at the first, should bee repeted vntoo vs, and layd foorth more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
in a knowen tung, too the ende wee myght haue the larger
confirmation of it: and that if wee profit not for all his calling of vs
too him without ceassing, wee see our vnthankfulnesse too apparant,
in that wee knowe not Iesus Christ after wee haue had our eares bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
so long tyme with the Gospell. And this is spoken vntoo vs: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:23289:225"/>
let vs learne too recken the tyme well.</p>
               <p>When such as haue knowen Gods truth from their chyldhood, do
come too mans state, let them thinke thus with themselues: I ought
too bee a great teacher (as the Aposte also sheweth in the Epistle too
the Hebrewes:<note place="margin">Hebre. 5. d. 12.</note>) it is now a fifteene or twentie yeeres ago since I came
too age of discretion: so as a number of men are still behynd mee: and
it is God himself which calleth mee: for the preaching of the Gospell
vntoo mee is not by chaunce, but therby God sheweth the care that he
hath of my saluation, and the loue that he beareth towardes mee.
Seeing then that I haue heard the Gospell so long tyme without ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
or myght haue done, if the fault were not in my self: must I not
needes looke for a terrible condemnation, when I continew still in my
beastlinesse? Agein, let such as haue bin sometyme in darknesse, and
afterward are inlyghtened, thinke thus: It is now a yeere, fyue, ten,
or more ago since God opened myne eyes by his woord, and drew mee
out of the dungeon wherin I was, in which if he had left mee styll, I
had bin a wretched forlorne creature: and now that he hath voutsafed
too inlyghten mee with the knowledge of his truth, which is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a thing, should I bee rechlesse in the hearing and receyuing therof?
Agein, on the other syde, God pitying my rudenesse, applyeth himself
as much as can bee too my capacitie, insomuch that he dooth euen lisp
(as yee would say,) too shewe mee his secretes after a sweete and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
fashyon, as if one should feede a little babe, and chawe his meate
too him, too the end he should haue no more too doo, but too swallow
it downe: and shall I notwithstanding continew a dullard still? Then
let vs marke well all these things, and beare well in mynd these words
of S. Paule, where he sayeth, not onely that wee haue heard of Iesus
Christ, but also that wee haue bin taught him, bycause that through
Gods goodnesse the Gospell was not preached vntoo vs, for one day
and no more: but hath ringed a long tyme already in our eares.</p>
               <p>And wee haue too marke, that S. Paule speaking of the doctrine of
the Gospell, matcheth Iesus Christ with it, according as it hath bin
tolde vs heretofore, that the thing which God sheweth vs in his word,
is the knowledge of Iesus Christ, as who is also the end and substance
thereof. Therefore let vs marke it,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. a. 4.</note> to the intent we wander not when
wee would faynest profyte in Gods woorde, but may haue alwayes a
certeine marke too ame at. For wee see a number that haue turned
ouer the Scripture leafe by leafe, and are able too make great report


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23289:225"/>
of it. But in the meane whyle they wote not what the effect or pith of
it is: for their amyng is not at our Lord Iesus Christ. So much the
more behoueth it vs too marke well all the textes wherein it is she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vs, that when wee once knowe the benefytes that are brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs by the sonne of God, what power he hath, and what treasures
he vttereth towardes vs: then wee haue the trew vnderstanding of the
Gospell. But without Iesus Christ wee haue nothing. And verily
wee ought too be the more prouoked theruntoo, by the example of those
which name themselues Christians, and yit notwithstanding wote not
too what Sainct too vow themselues, as they say. As for example, see
how the Papistes gad vp and downe without any certeintie, and are
as Reedes that bend with euery wynd. And why? (Bycause) there is
no stedfastnesse but in our Lord Iesus Christ, and they bee iustly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for not seeking of him. For although they bee neuer so stout in
their owne imaginations: yit must they bee fayne too knowe in the
end, that the things which they haue buylded and forged in their owne
heades, are nothing. And therefore (as I haue touched already) let
vs vnderstand that Iesus Christ is the shooteanker wherunto God the
father calleth vs, and that wee must not bee drawen from him for any
thing, but apply all that wee haue vntoo him. And that is the cause
why S. Paule dooth in Gods name and authoritie, exhort and warne
those agein which haue heard Iesus Christ, and bin taught of him by
the doctrine of his Gospell.</p>
               <p>Furthermore he saith, <hi>If yee haue learned him well, according as
the truth is in our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And this is set downe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
bycause there are a number of fickle headed folke and fantasticall
fellowes, which make great protestation with full mouth, that they
bee Christians, as though they had deuoured the whole Gospell: and
yit haue nother wisedome nor discretion in them. And would God
that examples therof were not so ryfe now adayes in the world. But
if a man should demaund euery of them, whether they would not haue
the Gospell: yis, what else, say they? That runnes roundly with
them without any stop: for saying is good cheape. But let a man
examine the most part of them how they haue profited, and he shall
scarce fynd one among a hundred of them, that knowes in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
what belongeth too Iesus Christ. Too say, that men may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
eate flesh vppon frydayes, and too mocke at all the superstitions
of poperie, and to say, that they be but gewgawes and tryfling things.


<pb facs="tcp:23289:226"/>
that they can do with ease. But in the meane whyle if a man aske them
what it is to be regenerated, what pacience is, what newnes of lyfe is,
&amp; what it is to be fashioned agein after the image of god: there the most
part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil shew, that they neuer tasted of the truth of the Gospell,
but did but only guibble about the barke of it, &amp; neuer came at the very
substance of it. And this is not now adayes only, for S. Paule sheweth
wel, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his time many folks abused the name of Christ, &amp; wold
needes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for great Christians, &amp; yit neuer wist what the sonne of
God was. Wherfore let vs mark wel what is said here. For it is as if
S. Paul should find fault with himself: not that the things which he had
spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> needed any amendment, but too giue the sharper check or rebuke
to such as did so falsifie Christs name, &amp; wickedly abuse his Gospel, by
making it a cloke for their wickednes. S. Paul the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as it were to bethinke himself better, sayth, yea for sooth, but I
pray God ye haue learned him. As if he shold say, I speak indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
to al such as haue heard the pure doctrine of God. Howbeit forasmuch
as a great sort wil wrest &amp; wring the things that are told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; take but
only some patch of matter, I wote not what: therfore haue they not any
good foundation to buyld vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To be short, they haue no roote of fayth.
And yit for al that, haue they once but fidled ouer, I wote not what: by
&amp; by they be great clearkes, to their own seeming. And therfore looke
wel to it (sayth he,) that ye make not a vayne protestatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, least ye be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
of falshood before God &amp; his Angels: &amp; that the name of Iesus
Christ which ought to be holy too you, be not taken in vaine: and that
wheras enery of you boasteth himself to be a Christian, yit notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ye know not to what end Iesus Christ was giuen of God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor how we be made parttakers of him, nor what our redemption
is, nor how wee may inioy all his benefytes. For if yee knowe not
these: it is certein that all this bragging of yours shall cost you ryght
deere, for that you haue with full mouth protested your selues too bee
Christians, and yit notwithstanding knowe not which bee the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of your Christendome, nor to what ende to apply them. This in
effect is the thing that wee haue too remember vpon that streyne.</p>
               <p>Behold, Saint Paule telleth vs heere, that if wee haue bin tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

blynd wretches groping in the dark, but that wee should knowe the
ryght way of saluation. And in especially, seeing wee be dayly exhorted
too come vntoo him, and he giueth vs meanes to further vs more and
more in the fayth: let vs bee verye ware that we vnhallow not so holie
a thing, as is the truth of the Gospel, &amp; the pure doctrine of God. But
wee vnhalowe it, if we know not too what end God hath giuen it vs,
and that wee must beare it in mynd. For I haue told you alredy,
that manie fantasticall persons will pretend christianitie wel ynough,
but yit for all that, there is no substance nor roote in them. Therfore
let vs looke well that wee knowe whertoo wee bee called, and that
God bee not disappoynted of his intent, when hee dooeth the office of
a schoolemayster towards vs, but that wee consider how he sheweth
vs the way of lyfe and saluation: and lyke as he is a good and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
teacher, so let vs bee lyke schollers vntoo him.</p>
               <p>But let vs come now too the truthe whereof Saint Paule spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
which is (sayth he) <hi>that yee put of the old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with earthly lusts, euen according too the conuersation that
yee haue led heretoofore.</hi> He expresseth yit better that all they which
vaunt themselues too bee the disciples of Iesus Christ, and yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
leade a lawelesse lyfe, and doo but giue occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in the Churche, are falsaries, as if a man should bring forth
a counterfet deede. Wherfore let vs mark that it is a cursed trecherie
when wee say wee intend too bee Christians,<note place="margin">Titu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 1. d. 16.</note> and professe it also with
our mouth, and yit notwithstanding go from the thing in our woorks
which wee protest in our woords, as sayeth Saint Paule in another
place. For he that taketh leaue too doo all euill, and yit wil bee taken
too bee of the number of Gods children: it is certeyn that he denyeth
Iesus Christ in his whole lyfe, how much soeuer he confesse him in
woords. Therfore let vs bethink our selues, and consider, that if wee
meane to bee allowed of God, wee must learne too rid away our old
man. And by that woord the scripture meaneth al that we haue of
nature. For wee knowe there are (as yee would say) twoo welsprings
of mankind, that is too wit, Adam, and our Lord Iesus Christ. Now
as in respect of our first birth, wee come all out of the welspring of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and are corrupted with sinfulnesse, so as there is nothing but
frowardnesse and cursednesse in our soules. It standeth vs then on
hand too bee renewed in Iesus Christ, and too bee made new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And for that cause dooth <hi>the old Man</hi> betoken all that wee haue


<pb facs="tcp:23289:227"/>
by birthryght from our fathers. Now then, if a man bee let alone in
his first state: surely he shalbee but a blynd wretch full of rebellious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and spyte ageinst God. Too bee short, he shall tend all wholly
vntoo euill, for wee bee altoogither saped in it. That is the thing that
is ment by the old man, least wee should think that Saint Paules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was too rebuke but only the vyces that are apparant before men:
lyke as when men will rebuke one that hath played the vnthrift for a
tyme, they will say he must cast his old skin. But heere Saint Paule
passeth yit further: which is, that our likings are vtterly vntoward, that
there is not one drop of goodnesse and vprightnesse in vs, that all our
thoughts are wicked, and that all our desyres and affections are rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
ageinst God, and ageinst his will and iustice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, wheras he speaketh of vnclothing or putting of: it is a
similitude ryfe ynough, (wherby is ment) that wee must giue ouer all
that is of our owne, and cast it quyte away, that wee may bee clothed
agein with other ornaments, as he wil adde anon after. And here we
see, that there are twoo partes in ruling our lyfe, and in comming
vntoo God. The one is the forsaking of our selues, and the other is,
that wee bee gouerned by Gods spirit. For needs must all that is our
owne bee layd downe, before God take in hand the guyding of vs.
And why? For our thoughts and Gods doctrine, our affections and
the commaundements wherby God will haue vs too bee ruled, are as
fyre and water. Therfore all that is of our owne nature, must bee cut
of, before God doo gouerne vs. And that is the cause why wee must
begin at the forsaking of our selues: which also is the verye order that
Saint Paule hath followed in this text. Wee must (sayeth he) put of
the old man.</p>
               <p>And secondly wee haue too mark, that Iesus Christ was sent vs too
the end that we should be repayred after the image of God. It is trew
that he hath reconcyled vs to God his father by his death &amp; passion, &amp;
that the sheading of his blud washeth vs from all our filthynesse, and
setteth vs free from damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and endlesse death, and that his offring
of himself hath made full satisfaction for vs: insomuch that if we resort
to Iesus Christ for remission of our sinnes, God of his own free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
accepteth vs for ryghtuous, bycause he passeth not what we bee,
but buryeth all our faults, and ceasseth not to fauour vs as his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
notwithstanding that wee bee wretched sinners. This benefyte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
wee by Iesus Christ. But yit must wee not separate the second


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23289:227"/>
poynt from it: which is,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 16. &amp;. Coloss. c. 19. &amp; 2. b. 9.</note> that wee must bee sanctifyed by his holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
according too this saying, that he hath receyued the fulnesse of all
grace, too the end that all of vs should drawe out of him. And Esay<note place="margin">Esay. 11. a. 2.</note>
declareth that spirit of wisedome, the spirit of iudgment, the spirit of
vpryghtnesse, and the spirit of the feare of God rested vppon him. And
was that for any neede that he himselfe had? No: but too the intent
that wee should receyue that which wee want, according too the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that it pleaseth him too deale vntoo vs, as wee haue seene heretoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And that is the cause why S. Paule in the second too the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
sayeth,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. b. 9.</note> that he became poore too the intent too fyll vs with his
riches. Then if wee desyre too be receyued too mercy at Gods hand,
by the death and passion of his onely sonne, and too haue our sinnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputed
to vs, bycause he hath made discharge and payment for them:
let vs learne also that he is giuen vs too make vs holy, too the end we
should bee gouerned by his holy spirit. So then, if wee intend too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
too rule our lyfe well: wee must forsake our selues and fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
our owne nature. And agein, wee must note also that there is
no Christianitie in vs, nother can wee any skill of the sonne of God, or
of his power, or of his office, vntyll wee knowe that wee ought too bee
repayred by him accordyng too the image of God. Those are the two
things which wee ought too marke well. Trew it is that this deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
well too bee layd foorth more at large: Howbeeit too the intent
that the whole may be knit toogither in one linke, let vs note briefely,
that wee can neuer bee allowed of God, nor neuer doo him any seruice
that he may lyke of, vnlesse wee enter intoo the sayd battell of offering
force and violence vntoo all our thoughtes and affections, too subdew
them as prisoners too the obeying of god, and too kill them quyte and
cleane. So much concerning the first poynt.</p>

For wee knowe that men are not willing too bee rebuked, that is too
say, they bee loth too abyde it, and would rather bee spared: insomuch
that when any warning is giuen them, they coulde fynde in their hart
too put it farre from them. On the other syde wee bee so newfangled,
that if a man tickle vs not in the eare with some new thing, wee doo as
it were despyze and disdeyne it. As for an example, if a man speake
too vs of walking in the feare of God: who knowes not that, say wee?
Let him go preache that too little children, will many a man say. And


<pb facs="tcp:23289:228"/>
why? Bycause it seemes too them too bee but lost tyme too speake of
things that are so well knowen too them. But dooth it therfore follow
that they bee familiar and in vse with them? (No:) for as for them
that say, doo not wee knowe well ynough that God must bee loued, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored,
and serued, that we must absteyne from Theft, Extortion, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Deceyt, Blasphemie, Whoredome, and all other such things: are
they not the greatest despyzers of God and of all ryght dealing? Yis:
but let vs herken what Saint Paule telleth vs heere. Go too (sayeth
he) I exhort you too put of the olde man. If yee saye you haue it not:
aduyze your selues well, and consider what you were at the tyme that
God drew you too the knowledge of his Gospell: that is too wit, that
yee were as folke lost and vtterly forlorne. So then, assure your selues
it is not for naught that I exhort you too ridde away the olde man: for
yee bee not quyte stripped out of him as yit. It was as a dubble gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
about you before, and therefore yee must bee fayne too labour the
earnestlyer as nowe too laye away the residew that remayneth of it
styll.</p>
               <p>Agein, on the other syde, he telleth them also, that it must not greeue
them too bee exhorted, as though the thinges that are spoken of were
sufficiently knowen too them, (specially) seeyng that experience she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that they neuer knew how too order their lyfe. For too knowe
that it behoueth vs too doo this or that, is not all that wee haue to doo:
but wee must also shewe that our lyfe is well acquaynted with Gods
doctrine. Then if it bee perceyued by our fruites that wee haue such
roote in vs, so as wee can skill too frame our selues wholy too Gods
will: then may it bee sayd, that we bee well learned. But if our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
lyfe bewray vs too haue bin as stray sheepe, or rather as vtterly
peaked away after our owne lustes, and that there remayneth yit styll
a smatch of the same, that wee bee not so well clenzed as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site:
let vs bow downe our eares and herken willingly too the thing
which wee see too bee profitable, yea and needfull for vs. And so Saint
Paule spake not alonly for the Ephesians, but also for vs all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Wherefore as oft as it seemeth vntoo vs that wee coulde well
forbeare the often putting of vs in mynd of one thing: let vs examine
our lyfe, and if wee fynde not our selues yit throughly rid of the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that wee bee told of: let vs abyde too bee taught more and more,
assuring our selues that it is not ynough for vs too haue the doctrine of
God swimming in our brayne, but that it must bee well settled in our


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23289:228"/>
hartes, so as our lyfe (as I sayd afore) may answer for vs, that wee bee
learned in good earnest.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule hauing spoken of the old man, sayth, that <hi>he is
corrupted according too the lustes of errour and deceyt.</hi> In say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is corrupted, he compareth the agednesse of our soules
with the agednesse as wee see it in our bodies. When a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
too old age, he becommeth weake in respect of strength both of
bodie and mynd: he forgoeth all his lustinesse and hangeth his wings.
too bee short, he is as good as half dead: for his age dooth so abate
his corage, that he must looke styll towardes his graue, which way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
for him. And Saynt Paule taketh a resemblance hereof in the
old agednesse of the soule. Now I haue told you alredie, that (too
put away) the old agednesse of the soule (or the old man,) is too forsake
our owne nature, bycause it is altoogither cursed, and wee bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with vs from our moothers womb, that is good and cleane.
Therefore if wee bee geuen too our owne imaginations, and followe
our owne fleshly reason, and giue the brydle too our affections: then
is the soule in his old agednesse. And Saynt Paule sayeth, that by
that meanes it is corruppted, that is too say, there is no lyfe of God
in it, as wee haue seene heretoofore. Let vs vnderstand then that we
be corrupt, so long as wee continew in our old man, that is too say, so
long as wee continew styll in our owne state and nature. No doubt
but wee will thinke our selues too haue lyuelinesse ynough: but that
is but a madnesse, and all the maystries that wee trye shalbee but too
breake our neckes, vntyll wee haue forsaken and giuen ouer both our
thoughtes and our lustes. And that is the cause why Saynt Paule
speaketh purposely of the desyres and lustes of deceyt. For he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that men are so blynded, as they discerne not how the diuell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth
them by the intycementes which he setteth afore them. For
whosoeuer is not touched with trew feare of God, will let himself
looce: and if a man say too him, vnhappye creature, wilt thou vndoo
thy self so? He will answer, No. For it seemeth not too him that he
serueth the diuell. And why? For they that are bewhitched with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
illuzions after that sort, doo so cleaue vntoo him, that they bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
starke doltes and dullardes. Too the end then that wee learne
too flatter our selues no more in our owne conceytes, nor too fall
asleepe theruppon: Saynt Paule telleth vs that our lustes are full of
deceytes: as if he should say, when you take your se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good cace, and yee haue all your owne wishing, and fortune (as yee
terme hir) smyleth vppon you, so as yee prosper in all things euery
where, and yee want nothing: behold, al your felicitie is but falshood.
Too bee short, Saynt Paule ment too warne vs heere, that wee
ought too suspect our selues in all our desyres. Therefore if a man
intend too rule his lyfe well: he must first and formest mislyke of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and consider that all that euer he imagineth of his owne conceyt,
is but an illu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of Satan, wherwith he deceyueth and beguyleth
himself, and that as many as are of them, are but as snares too intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
him on all sydes. When wee once knowe this, we shall haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
greatly, not only for one day, but for all our lyfe longe. And
for asmuch as wee see such a number of wretched soules cast awaye
themselues vppon hope of some profit, which they haue imagined of
their owne head: let vs beware that wee hold not the same trade, that
is too say, that wee follow not our owne good intentes, as men terme
them. For wee shall but throwe our selues headlong intoo destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if wee followe the way that our owne nature dryues vs too. And
why? For all our owne lustes and lykings are deceytfull. Then is
there none other shift, but too laye asyde the reason which wee weene
our selues too haue, toogither with all the intycementes of Satan
and the world, so as euery whit of it bee cast away, and wee well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
knowing that the sweetenesse of them serueth but too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyle
vs the sooner, that wee myght not perceyue the deadly poyson
which is hid vnderneath. Thus in effect wee haue too beare in mind,
how S. Paule telleth vs, that vntyll such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yme as we haue learned too
denye our selues, and too holde our selues as prisoners vnder Gods
woorde, yea and too rid our selues quyte and cleane from the thinges
that wee haue of our selues and of our owne nature: we wote not what
Christi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nitie meaneth, wee knowe not whertoo the Gospell tendeth,
nor too what ende it is preached. For it is not ynough too haue put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the old man for once: but wee must profit in it more and more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
too the warning that is giuen vs heere. And in good scoth,
S. Paule had taught the Ephesians, and they had receyued his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
and yit neuerthelesse he exhorteth them along tyme after, as
wee see. Hereby he sheweth vs, that it is for vs too invre our selues to
pacience all our lyfe long. Although then that wee haue alredy strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
greatly too thrust all our affections, all our lustes, and all our ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
vnder foote: yit shall we neuer haue so ouermaystred our selues,


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23289:229"/>
that wee shall bee throughly reformed. And therefore it standeth vs on
hand too giue all our indeuer theruntoo, and too labour for it all the
tyme of our lyfe. And so in fewe woordes yee see the stoutnesse which
wee must haue too forsake all our owne lustes, and all our wicked
thoughtes.</p>
               <p>And heereuppon wee must proceede too the second poynt, which is,
that wee must bee renewed. For it is not ynough that men mislyke of
themselues, and hate their vyces in shunning of them: but wee must
also frame our selues too Gods will, according too this saying: Hate
euyll,<note place="margin">Psal. 34. c. 15.</note> and doo good. So then, the things that S. Paule hath spoken
hithertoo, are as a preparatyue too set our lyfe in good order: lyke as
when a man intendeth too haue a good crop in his feelde, he must first
stubbe it, too rid away the brambles, bushes, and euyll weedes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
plow it and harrowe it, and then sowe it, and so will fruite
spring of his labour. Therefore if wee purpose too beare fruite vnto
God, and bee desyrous too order our lyfe in such wise as his name may
bee glorifyed by it: wee must first cause our selues too bee stubbed, for
wee bee full of naughtie affections, which are as thornes and thistles,
and therefore must bee cut away and plucked vp by the roote: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
wee must bee tylled, so as the plow passe vppon vs: that is to
say, when our Lord maketh vs too feele his Iustice, wee must bee so
sorie that wee bee so giuen too naughtinesse, as it may bee as a good
tylth too vs at Gods hand. That is the thing which Saint Paule
dooth hithertoo.</p>
               <p>Now he soweth the good seede, too the ende that God may gather
the good fruite which he requireth of vs, that is too say, that he may be
honored at our handes, and that wee may shew that wee doo in verye
deede thinke our selues beholden too him for all thinges. That is the
cause why he speaketh next of beyng renewed in mynd and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
that is too say, that we must bee reformed in all things through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and bee so chaunged, as men may perceyue that wee haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forsaken our selues, but also that God reygneth in vs without geyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stryuing,
and possesseth vs both in our affections and in our thoughts,
according as he deserueth ryght well that wee should bee giuen all
wholly vntoo him.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs so too feele
them, as it may make vs too bee sory for them, and too walke roundly


<pb facs="tcp:23289:230"/>
away in the path wherein he hath set vs: and that too bring the same
too passe, wee may consider too what end our Lord Iesus is sent vs, so
as the things which he hath doone for vs, may not bee lost and perishe
through our leaudnesse and carelesnesse, but that wee beyng renewed,
may learne so too serue our God in holynesse and ryghtuousnesse, as
wee may well shewe how great account wee make of the most noble
and excellent redemption which he performed, in that he spared not
his onely sonne for our sakes. And so let vs all saye, Almighty God
heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

this be not perceyued openly: yit will there euer be some secret hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
lurking, which is ynough &amp; to much to condemne vs before God.
Yee see then that the thing wheruntoo wee must inforce our selues, if
wee purpose too please God, is that being rid of all our owne conceits
and affections, wee get vs a new guyde, that is too wit, Gods spirit:
according wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>untoo he vseth a lyke maner of sentence in the twelfth
too the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. a. 2.</note> in speaking of Christian lyfe. It behoueth vs too
bee transformed, not only in our affections which are sinfull, as euery
man may iudge: but euen in the thing which seemeth faultlesse, that
is too wit, in the Reason that wee haue spoken of. Too bee short, wee
must bee sacrifyzed, or else our lyfe will bee alwayes vnholy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.
And this sacrifyzing is expounded by Saint Paule in the text
before alledged, to be the laying away &amp; mortifying of al that we haue
of our selues. Our trew perfection then is that fyghting ageinst al that
is of our owne nature, wee suffer our selues too bee gouerned by Gods
spirit, so as it may bee perceyued that wee bee vtterly chaunged. For
it is not ynough that our lyfe haue some honestie too the worldward,
so as it may bee commended and had in good reputation among men:
but also ambition and all other vyces that ly lurking within vs, must
bee clenzed away, and our Lord must haue the guyding of vs.</p>
               <p>And for that cause also doothe he adde <hi>that we must be reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
too God, namely in trew rightuousnesse and holinesse.</hi>
Lyke as heertoofore he had condemned the old man, which (as I
haue told you alredie) is all that euer wee bring from our moothers
womb: so now he sayeth, that wee must bee new creatures. And for
the same cause dooth he send vs too the example of our Lord Iesus
Christ in the sixth too the Romans, saying, that wee must bee crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and dye with him, namely in respect of the old man, and also bee
fashyoned lyke too his rysing agein, too walk in newnesse of lyfe. It
is trew that he vseth other woords there: howeeit all commeth too
one, which is, that lyke as our Lord Iesus is the second Adam, so
must he bee as a patterne too vs, and wee bee fashyoned after him and
his image, that wee may be lyke him. Now surely this wil not come
too passe of our owne nature: but yit is not this exhortation more than
needeth, bycause that when the holie scripture bringeth vs too our
Lord Iesus Christ, it meaneth not that wee should bee as blocks of
woode, but that wee should come and offer our selues too God that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:231"/>
he may woork in vs. And in very deede, these twoo things agree v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well: that the power which is in vs should come of God: for it is he
that moueth vs vnto good, it is he that bringeth vs to it, it is he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs both the wil &amp; the abilitie to performe the wil, as we haue seen
in another text.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 13.</note> And yit God worketh so in vs, that of his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
the good works that are done, are called ours. And in good sooth,
when we be so led by him, wee go. And it is not too bee woondered
at, that Gods goodnesse stretcheth so farre, as too make the things
ours which are his, and whereof he only deserueth the prayse. For
wee call the bread that wee eate our owne, though wee haue it but by
tytle of gift. For although men take payne for it: yit could it not stand
them in any stead, but through Gods free blissing. Then looke what
is giuen vs, wee call it our owne. Euen so S. Paule exhorteth vs too
put on the newe man, not that wee can doo it of our selues, for Iesus
Christ must bee fayne too clothe vs with his ryghtuousnesse, as well
as make vs parttakers of the giftes of his holy spirit. And I praye
you what is ment by putting on of the new man? I haue tolde you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
that it is the vtter chaunging of vs both in our thoughts and in
our desyres, and (too bee short) in all the partes of our soule. Now is
not such an alteration the speciall woorke of God, and the gift of hys
holy spirit? Saint Paule therefore meaneth not that wee can doo any
thing as of our owne power: but yit that euery of vs ought too streyne
himselfe too followe whither soeuer he calleth vs. And therewithall
he warneth vs that all our lyfe is very daungerful vntill wee chaunge,
and that the newnesse appeere in vs.</p>
               <p>Now Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>that the nevve man is created after
God and his image.</hi> And therin he confirmeth the matter which I
go about too touch: that is too wit, that although wee streyne our
selues too the vttermost that wee can, yit can wee doo nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee bee preuented by Gods grace. Which of vs can bee his
owne maker? Wee knowe that that honour must bee reserued vntoo
God alone. But heere the cace standeth vppon a new creating.
That therefore cannot bee in mans will, nor yit in his power. And
Saynt Paule also hath dispatched that doubt and scruple, in saying
that the newe man is created of God. As if he should say, my frendes,
In dede ye ought not to abuse the grace that is offered you by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
but yit for all that, assure your selues that when yee haue strey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
your selues what yee can, too dedicate your selues too Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23289:231"/>
yee can doo nothing furtherfoorth than he woorketh in you by his
holy spirit. According whereuntoo he sayeth in another place, that
we doo woorke our owne saluation,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 12. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> euen as though we could doo som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of our selues: but yit he addeth, that it must bee in feare and
trembling, that is too say, with putting away of all presumption,
knowing that it behoueth vs too depend vppon another: and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the reason, for it is God (sayeth he) which giueth both the will
and the abilitie too performe it, and all of his owne free goodnesse.
After that manner then must wee indeuer our selues. But yit must
wee not therfore conceyue a vayne ouerweening in the meane whyle,
as though we had some shift, and were able on our owne syde too doo
neuer so little without Gods grace: Saynt Paule exhorteth vs rather
too feare and warenesse. And why? For seeing wee bee as weake
as may bee, and not only that, but also starke dead, and as good as
rotten caryons in all caces of our saluation, &amp; haue not so much as one
good thought of our owne: seeing (I say) that wee haue all at Gods
hand,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. b. 5.</note> and that he must bee fayne too woorke it by the power of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirite: let vs learne too walke in humilitie. And moreouer, let
vs not ceasse too make his grace auaylable, assuring our selues that
his woorking by his power shalbe alwayes in such wyse, as the prayse
must euer redound too him alone, and no drop of it remayne ouer too
our selues. Yee see then what wee haue too remember vppon this
speeche, where Saynt Paule sayeth, that the newe man is created.
Yea verily, and therin he sheweth how wee bee falne from our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
and from the state whertoo wee were aduaunced by Gods grace
in the person of our forefather Adam. As if he sayd, that Adams fall is
vntoo vs as a spirituall death, wherby wee bee cut of and cast awaye
from the number of Gods creatures. And not without cause dooth
God so oft vtter this dreadfull saying,<note place="margin">Cene. 6. b. 6.</note> that he repenteth him that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he made man. For therin he detesteth the corruption and sin that
are in vs. Not that God hath any humane passions in him: but too
shewe vs that he vtterly mislyketh vs, vntill his image bee renewed in
vs.<note place="margin">Gene. 1. d. 31.</note> It is sayd, that God looked vppon all that he had made, and all
was exceeding good and faultlesse. But when our father Adam was
once falne, and had made himselfe a straunger to the fountayne of life:
by &amp; by he was stripped stark naked of all goodnesse. For beyng sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from God, what could he be but vtterly forlorne, &amp; past hope of
recouerie? Shall wee fynd eyther lyfe, or ryghtuousnesse, or holinesse,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:232"/>
or soundnesse, or vpryghtnesse out of God? No: Yee see then that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
was as it were cut of from the aray of creatures: he was not
woorthie too bee reckened euen among the Frogges and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the earth. Brag wee as much as wee list, that is our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
wee beare a greater curse of God, than is in all the Lyce and
Fleas, and in all the woormes of the earth. That is the cause why S.
Paule sheweth vs, that God cannot acknowledge vs for his children,
vntyll his image bee repayred in vs: which thing is doone by this
newe creation.<note place="margin">Iohn. 11. c. 25.</note> For lyke as Adam drew vs all downe, and plundged
vs with himself in the gulfe of death: so are wee created new agein by
God in the person of our Lord Iesus Christ. And for that cause doth
he name himselfe the resurrection and lyfe. For wee must ryze agein
in him, if wee wyll liue in deede. Which thing cannot bee, except wee
haue first bin deade, as was declared more at large this morning.
Therefore wee ought too haue this reason alwayes with vs, that wee
weene not our selues too bee rightuous, or too make our lyfe allowable
before God, but bee euer fully resolued and perswaded, that God wyll
take nothing in good woorth at our handes, but that which he knoweth
too bee his owne. For as I sayd, without him, there is nothing but
euill. For by that meane was his image defaced in vs by Adams
sinne: and therefore it standeth vs on hand too bee made new ageyne
in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now he sheweth vs how that may bee doone, saying <hi>in Ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and holinesse.</hi> By the woorde Rightuousnesse, he meaneth
soundnesse and vprightnesse, so as we liue with our neyghbours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deceyt, &amp; without malice or harme dooing, yeelding too euery man
that which is his. Now when such a soundnesse reigneth in vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal
wee shew by our deedes that we be fashioned agein after Gods image
in ryghtuousnesse. But it is not ynough that men haue their ryght, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
God also haue his. For too what purpose is it for vs too bee no
theeues (towardes men,) and yit to be traytrous towardes God? or to
absteyne from stealing away our neighbours goods, and in the meane
whyle to rob God of his honor? Therfore must ryghtuousnesse be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with holynesse. For the twoo tables of the lawe are inseparable.
And vnder the woord <hi>Holynesse,</hi> S. Paule comprehendeth all things
that belong too the seruing of God. The newnesse of our lyfe therfore,
is this: namely too walke purely before God, too eschew all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and vncleannesse, too separate our selues from all the defylementes


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23289:232"/>
of the world, and too offer our selues in sacrifyzce vntoo God: and (on
the other syde) too walke soundly and vprightly with our neighbours.
The performance of these two things is all that is requisite to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of a Christian life. Now it is certein that Gods lawe hath not
taught vs by halues, what wee haue too do, but God hath there shewed
vs a right rule, wherunto there may bee nothing added, nor aught ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from it. For in those two poynts is all our rightuousnesse contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
namely that God bee honored in all feare and reuerence at our
handes, and that we serue one another without doyng any harme. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
forasmuch as men are inclyned pitiously too feyning, and do euer
thinke it ynough to set some faire countenance vpon the matter: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dooth S. Paule adde <hi>Truth.</hi> As if he sayd, that wee may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for the holyest folk in the world, and yit neuerthelesse be condemued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, if we be not clenzed from all hypocrisie, so as God may bee
our witnesse and iudge, that wee bee not dubble mynded, nor haue any
bumbasting in vs, but that we go on in right meaning simplicitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. So then, although our hands be cleere from theft, extortion, &amp;
all other things that are ageinst charitie, if we haue lusts lurking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs, surely we shal bee still vncleane before God. Not without cause
therfore doth S. Paul adde the word <hi>Truth,</hi> notwithstanding that he
had comprehended the whole perfection of our lyfe, in the two former
poyntes. For it is bycause we would alwayes content God with some
gay outward showe, according too the vanitie and leazing wherwith
wee be fraught. Therefore it behoued this too bee added, that lyke as
God is a spirit, so must wee also bee faythfull and trew before him. For
he abhorreth all dubblenesse of hart, which the scripture termeth Har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and Hart. If wee fall too making of partitions, and keepe some back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe
behynde: all that euer commeth from vs, must needes bee fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
and corrupt, as springing from an euyll and infected fountayne.
Then if wee desire too haue our hartes allowed of God, the fountayne
must first bee scoured, and truth must reigne in vs. Nowe wee see in
effect wheretoo it behoueth vs too apply all our indeuer as long as
wee lyue heere beneath. For, too boast our selues too bee Christians,
and not too consider on what condition Iesus Christ is our head, and
hath knit vs vntoo hym: is a turnyng of all thinges vpsyde downe,
as hath bin sayde this morning. Then looke what manner a ones
wee couet too bee counted and esteemed among men: the same must
wee bee before God and his Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:233"/>Therefore wee must fyght ageinst our owne vyces, vntyll all that is
of our owne nature bee doone away. Not that that can bee doone in
one day: but that wee must go towardes it continewally more and
more. And further let vs assure our selues, that our Lord Iesus
Christ is giuen vs for a patterne and example: and moreouer, that it
is his office, too reforme vs so by the spitit of God his father, as wee
may walke in newnesse of lyfe, and become Gods creatures, and as
all that euer wee haue drawen from the corruption of Adams sin,
may bee quyte clenzed away. Therwithall let vs consider also what is
the pith of the things that God alloweth, &amp; which is the rule of good
lyfe: namely first too honour and serue God, and afterward too walke
(neyghbourly) one with another, indeuering too doo good too such as
haue neede of vs, and absteyning from dooing all manner of euyll and
harme. This doctrine were easie ynough too conceyue, so wee were
not vtterly peruerted by our wicked affections. And soothly, there is
not that man which is not a great Doctor in preaching vntoo other
men: but yit as cleere and apparantly knowen as these things are, no
man can apply them too his owne vse. Yit shall there bee no excuce
for vs, when wee shall be fayne too come too account before the great
iudge. Wherefore let vs beare this doctrine well in mynd, yea and
let vs gyue good heede too it, seeyng it is so yll put in vre through the
whole world.</p>
               <p>Among the Papistes there is talking ynough of Gods seruice,
and of liuing holily: but yit the world seeth how those wretched soules
stand buzzing about a sort of pelting tryfles: and that for all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaboring
of themselues, they bee neuer the forewarder, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the further of from God. And what is the cause of it? Euen this:
that euery man of his owne head deuizeth a rule too his owne liking:
and in the meane whyle God speaking familiarly and without any
darkenesse, is not heard at all, but men doo rather giue themselues to
the things that cannot auayle them. As for vs although wee haue the
lyght of the Gospell, and can say that the superstitions of Papistrie
are but trifles: yit are wee neuerthelesse farre of from this doctrine.
And if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should sift our lyues, where is this trew holinesse? Where
is this Ryghtuousnesse? For as for the Gospell, most men take what
they like of it, and tread Gods truth vnder their feete as oft as they
li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t. Too bee short, yee shall fynd that they which brag most of their
reformation now adayes, are vnholy and vncleane people, yea and


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:23289:233"/>
(for the most part) euen Dogges that barke ageinst God, despyze his
truth, and rayle at his woord, vnlesse it be when they let it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they thinke it nother heere nor there. That is the holynesse of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that would bee counted now adayes great Christians and pillers
of the Churche, insomuch that they would make themselues greater
than God, if they could: yea and although they bee but woormes and
woormes meate, yit ceasse they not too blaspheme so farre, and to cast
foorth their thunderboltes and madnesse, as too say, that men shall
speake as they will haue them, or else they wyll conquer God for it.</p>
               <p>And as touching the sayd Rightuousnesse, where shall a man fynde
it? Euery man sayes, there is nothing but deceyt, nothing but craft,
nothing but forswearing, extortion, outrage, and violence. Euery man
complaynes of his neyghbours, and his neyghbours of him. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the cace stand, we see that Rightuousnesse is as good as banished
out of the world. And therefore inasmuch as the name of Iesus Christ
&amp; of his Gospel is so shamefully vnhalowed by such as abuse it falsely:
wee haue so much the more neede too remember what S. Paule sayth
heere: namely that God will disclayme vs, vntyll we beare his mark,
and bee created new agein in Iesus Christ. As how? Too bee truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap> or (as I haue sayd already) though wee were esteemed as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
yit shall our hypocrisie bee alwayes lothely before God, if wee

too imploy our selues too the seruing of God, and too the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of our neyghbours.</p>
               <p>Now heeruppon he deuydeth this doctrine intoo seuerall poynts,
applying it too particular exhortations. For first he sayeth, <hi>that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man must leaue lying, and speake the truthe to his neyghbours,
bycause wee bee members all of one bodie.</hi> Not without cause doth
Saint Paule heere lay foorth things particularly, which he had erst
spoken generally. For wee would alwayes shift our hands of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that it myght vanish away in the aire, and not come at vs. Not
that Gods speaking too vs in generall myght not suffyze vs, if wee
were teachable as wee ought bee, too receyue instruction at his hand:
but bycause we bee so snarled in our vanities, that if God doo but say
generally that wee must bee reformed according too his image, and
vtterly renounce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> selues: it toucheth vs not at all, but wee let it
passe. Therfore is he fayne too decyfer it by parce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>meale, as if hee
should make an anatomie of our thoughts and affections, and bring too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:234"/>
lyght the vyces which wee would fayne hoord vp in huthther muther.
That is the thing which Saint Paule goeth now about. He had sayd,
that it behoueth vs too bee reformed after the image of God by our
Lord Iesus Christ, who is the new man, and the head wheruntoo wee
must be lyke fashyoned. Now if he had gone no further than so: that
doctrine had bin receyued without geynsaying, but in the meane whyle
no man had fared the better by it as by a lyuely instruction. But now
will hee speake of whoredome, of Theft, of deceytfulnesse, of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
of hatred, of hartburning, and of the suttle flyghts that passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
neyghbour and neyghbour. When things are thus layd
foorth by particulars, men are the more wakened: and although euery
man shrink back &amp; inuent excuces, &amp; deuyze shifts: yit, wil we, nyl we,
we must needs feele some hartbytings in vs. That is the order which
Saint Paule keepeth here. Wherfore let vs make well, that it is
not ynough for vs too haue bin taught our dewtie in one woord, and as
it were at a glaunce: but God had neede too warne vs, and too shewe
vs flatly as well the vyces wherto we be subiect and inclyned (of our
owne nature:) as also the vyces whertoo the diuel draweth vs by his
temptations and wyles. To be short, God must be fayne to guyde our
hands, our feete, our eyes, our eares, and our mouthes: he must bee
fayne too make vs see that wee may ouershoote our selues in this sort
and that sort, too the end wee may bee well armed on all syds, that the
diuell fynd not any gap open, nor bee able too make any breache intoo
vs. That is it which wee haue too beare in mynd, too the intent wee
take not our selues too be so able folks, as that the once hearing of a
matter is ynough for vs. For wee shall woonder too see how the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
will neuerthelesse ouerreache vs many wayes. And therfore let
vs bee well ware that wee giue good eare too all the warnings that are
giuen vs, bycause it is not any whit more than needeth.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as Saint Paule had spoken of truthe: he sayeth,
<hi>Put away lying, and speake euery man the truthe.</hi> He setteth the
woord <hi>Truthe</hi> in another sense heere, than hee did afore. For in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
holinesse and ryghtuousnesse truthefull, he ment that there ought
too bee no glozing nor disguyzing, but a ryght meaning simplicitie,
that when God looketh as a witnesse intoo our harts, he may fynde
no dubble dealing in vs. After that maner was the word <hi>Truth</hi> taken
afore. Now he speaketh of the truthe that ought too reigne among
vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when wee traffik or bargaine one with another. Then must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>


                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:23289:234"/>
bee faythfull and trustie in all our businesse and dooings, and we must
vse no wyles nor deceyt. And yit that is not ynough: but wee must
mark, that this truth wherof Saint Paule speaketh, is such a playn
dealyng, as wee lay open all that is in our hart, if neede requyre, and
in any wise go not about too get other mens goods too vs by suttletie
and craftinesse, nor too profit our selues by another mans losse. And on
the contrary part, vnder this word <hi>Lying,</hi> he comprehendeth not only
the lyes that are made in speache, as when a man sayeth, that whyte
is blacke, as for example, if one should aske a man the pryce of a thing,
he would sell that for a crowne, which is not woorth a shilling. Saint
Paule speaketh not of the Lyes that are so grosse &amp; farre out of square,
that euen lyttle children are able too condemne them: but by the name
of Lying, he meaneth all manner of counterfetting and cousining, and
too be short, all the pollicies and shiftes that men haue, and wherein
they glory. Looke what the world termeth wisedome or policie: that
dooth Saint Paule call flat Lying. And why? For a man is not
counted too bee wittie now adayes, except the can filche and deceyue, I
meane by bywayes &amp; couert co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyances, which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal not perceyue.
But this ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re is woorse than the picking of a chest, and the breaking
a sunder of the yron woorke, too get away the money, or than the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of a man, when a theefe commes with a naked swoord too cut
a poore wayfarers throte. Therefore these politike murtherers, which
will needes be counted honest men, may disguyze themselues as much
as they list by their hypocrisie: but yit are they called (heere) both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuers,
and theeues and murtherers. Not that they appeere so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men: but God who seeth deeper than wee doo, will iudge of their
dooings as they bee in deede. And what shall men gayne by excuzing
themselues? (Nothing.) Then is wee marke this geere well, we shall
see, that in speaking of Lyes, S. Paule condemneth the things that
men make most account of, as suttletie, and wittinesse, and skill to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
a mans selfe in all companie. For (the world sayes) a man must
hold with the hare, and hunt with the hound: he must beware that hee
bee not ouerraught: and he must alwayes preuent rather than be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.
The fashion of the world then is, that euery man stand so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
his gard, as he haue his nettes ready too intrap other men, and to
intangle them a hundred times ere they bee aware of it. But Saint
Paule sayth, wee must vse such a soundnesse and playne dealing, as
wee must speake truthe one too another. And he bringeth vs backe too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:235"/>
that which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> after, too another purpose: namely, <hi>that
wee bee all but one body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, let vs come too our owne members. If my one hand
should play legierdemayne, and conuey all things too it self, too the
hurt of the other: if my foote should conspyre ageinst my legge, or if
my bellye could woorke some pretie slyght ageinst my stomacke:
what a thing were it? Now then, if wee bee members of our Lord
Iesus Christ, is it not a separating of our selues from his bodie, when
wee vse such fyne shiftes and pretie slyghtes, notwithstanding that
they be not condemnable afore men? No doubt, but wee will protest
ynough with our mouthes that wee bee Christians: but whatsoeuer
wee pretend, Iesus Christ will not bee misfashyoned after our fancie.
Lyke as he is but one: so will he haue vs to be all one in his bodie, yea
euen with this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euery of vs serue his neyghbours: which
cannot bee doone, except all counterfetting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee first put away, as wee
see that the hand dooth yeeld it self simply too the seruice of the rest of
the body: and lykewyse the foote and euery other member dooth his
dewtie. If anye one bee in daunger, the rest will not sinke asyde,
but all imploy themselues too succour it. (Among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) there is
no profer of deceyt, but all cling toogither, according too the order of
nature. Euen so ought wee too proue our selues too bee the members
of Iesus Christ by lyke playne dealing. Saint Paule then applyeth
too this particular exhortation, the thing that he had spoken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
namely, that if wee bee clenzed from all hipocrisie and fayning
before God: wee will shew it in our whole lyfe. For when wee haue
too doo one with another, wee will vse no guyle, but walke playnly.
That is for one poynt. And therof springeth another: which is, that
wee must not prouoke or anger one another. For wee see that if a
man but moue vs a little, by and by wee bee in in a chafe, and our
passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are so excessiue, as there is nother reason nor measure with vs.
And when men are so caryed away, they doo so forget themselues, as
nothing can wey with them, vse what perswasion yee can. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint Paule sayeth, that if we be not quiet one with another, wee
cannot bee knit intoo the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ, and (besydes
that,) as much as lyeth in vs, we deface Gods image in vs, by giuing
head so too our passions too chafe after that fashyon, and too bee so
hot one ageinst another. Now it should seeme by al lykelyhod that he
ment to take this common saying as drawen out of the fourth Psalme:


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23289:235"/>
not that he alledgeth the Psalme too report the naturall sense of it:
but too apply it too his owne purpose. For wee may well take ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
textes of Scripture, and apply them too dyuers things, howbeeit
without altering of any thing in them, and yit notwithstanding they
shall abyde in their naturall sense styll. Euen so, too the end that S.
Paules saying myght bee the better receyued: he sayeth, <hi>Bee angrie,
and sin not,</hi> as though it had bin a common saying, and so well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
as it had bin taken almost for a prouerb. Now, Dauid vseth a
woord which signifyeth properly too chafe and storme: howbeeit that
was in rebuking such as persecuted him wrongfully, bycause they
were hardned in theyr malyce, and forepossessed with so great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
rage ageinst him, that they made no conscience too oppresse
him. Forasmuch therfore as he sawe such wilful stubbornnesse in his
enemyes, he sayeth vntoo them, Bee yee angrie, and yee shal not sin.
Whereby he dooth vs too wit, that the cause why they were so caryed
away with rage ageinst him, was, that there was nother feare of God,
nor honestie, nor conscience that could hold them backe any more, but
that they were become as wyld beastes. And that is the cause why he
sayeth, Bee angrie: that is too say, Enter a little intoo questioning
and reasoning with your selues: examin what yee bee dooing: and
then will yeee not sin any more. If euery of you will go intoo his
chamber, and bethinke himself aduyzedly: yee shal perceyue, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thertoo
yee haue bin driuen by diuelish rage. Now this doctrine is
ryght necessarie for all men, bycause wee see what headinesse there
is in vs, insomuch that wee haue no sooner conceyued any toy in our
head, but that by and by without inquyring of Gods will, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
asking counsell at his mouth, as the Prophet Esay exhorteth vs
too doo: wee take the thing that wee haue conceyued,<note place="margin">Esay. 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a. 2.</note> for good, and
will needes subdewe all men too our lyking. And therefore the cause
why wee ouershoote our selues so much, is, that wee enter not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
examination of the matter with our selues, that wee myght dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene the good and the euill, euen by yeelding God his due
authoritie, in giuing eare with all reuerence and modestie, too the
things that he sheweth vs by his woord. Then haue wee neede too
bee angrie, that is too say, too bee greeued with our selues, and too
complayne of our selues, that wee sooth not our selues as wee haue
bin woont too doo. If wee doo so, wee shall not sin: that is too say,
the great malapartnesse that is so deeply rooted in vs, will soone bee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:236"/>
abated: for wee shall abhorre too fyght ageinst God: and if our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
get aforehande with vs, God will set in foote ageinst
them, and say, how nowe? will yee make warre ageinst mee vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares?</p>
               <p>Now heeruppon Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>Bee yee angry, and sin
not.</hi> As if he should say, my frendes, what maketh you too storme so
one ageinst another? For if neuer so little a fault bee committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
you, yee bee streyte in a chafe, and would rend vp heauen
and earth too bee reuenged of the offence, and yit in the meane season
yee haue matter ynough too bee offended euery one with himself.
Neuer go from your owne persons too seeke cause of anger: for how
many wayes offend you God euery day? Yee ceasse not too prouoke
him early and late. And yit if one touche but the tip of your finger,
yee are by and by in a pelting chafe. And what is the cause therof, but
that (as it seemeth) yee haue conspyred with Satan too tormente
your selues so? You beare your selues on hand yee shall bee well in
quiet when yee haue reuenged the wrong that hath bin doone vntoo
you. But it is a cursed quietnesse, when men are so at rest, by being
reuenged vppon those that haue offended them. The way then too
asswage all these wicked heates, is for euery man too thinke with
himself, that he shall surely haue ynough wherfore too bee greeued
with himself, and too bee angrie with himself, and too bee reuenged
of himself.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. c. 10. 11.</note> According wheruntoo, Saint Paule in the second too
the Corinthians, declaring what trew repentance is, alledgeth the
sorinesse which wee conceyue vppon the knowing of our sinnes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the said sorines bringeth with it a greef, which suffereth vs not
to be in quiet and rest, but maketh vs to fall to stomaking ageinst our
selues, in consideration of the terriblenesse of Gods wrath which wee
haue prouoked ageinst vs, and yit notwithstanding suffereth vs not
too ceasse too bee still of good hope, by resting vppon Gods goodnesse
and mercie. Therfore if one bee once come too the poynt that they
can bee angrie with themselues, when they knowe they haue sinned,
and seeke not too bee reuenged of their enemyes, but rather are redie
too doo them good, and doo pray for them: that is a good exercyze,
and euery man ought too spend himself in that battell: for surelye
they bee good and holye passions, when a mans anger proceedeth of
a zeale too Godward, and of a loue that he beareth towards him.
And if wee doo so: that is too say, if euery of vs bee greeued at his


<pb n="218" facs="tcp:23289:236"/>
owne vyces: certeinly wee shall neuer fynd leysure too be at emnity
with other folkes, or too spyte our neyghbours: but if wee haue a
trew zeale too Gods honour: vndoubtedly wee will forget the
offences that are committed ageinst vs, and not bee so hastie as
too say, I will mayntayne myne honour or honestie. For wee shall
haue another greater and woorthyer let too hold vs backe: that is too
wit, the reuenging of the fault which wee our selues haue committed
ageinst God, and whereby he hath bin dishonored as much as in vs
lay, and the forgetting of the offence that hath bin committed ageinst
our selues. Thus yee see in effect what wee haue too consider vppon
this, where Saint Paule sheweth vs, that men must turne their eyes
away from the occasions which they may conceyue too bee reuenged
of others. For if a fly doo but come ouerthwart our eyes, wee bee by
and by in a spytefull choler, in so much as there needeth no more too
make vs fall out with euery body that doth any thing which mislyketh
vs. So then let vs learne to forsake our selues, and to thinke euery of
vs vppon our owne faultes, that wee may bee so displeased with them,
as it may rid away our cholericknesse, wherethrough wee fall too
fyghting ageinst God, and make vs too bee angry at the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of vyces whertoo wee bee too much giuen. That is the thyng
which wee haue too remember in the first place. And as touching the
second poynt, wee will delay it vntill next the Sunday, at which tyme
it shall by Gods leaue bee discoursed at length.</p>

looked well too himself and too his owne

our wrath vppon such as offend vs.
For wee bee so wayward of our selues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy,
that a small thing will put vs out of
pacience. And therfore the fault that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man committes ageinst vs, be it neuer
so little, will alwayes set vs in a chafe.
And why? Bycause wee take too much leyzure too looke vppon other
mens faultes, and in the meane whyle forget our owne. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
then which is set vs downe heere to keepe vs from being so soone
and so lyghly offended at other mens faultes, is, that euery of vs enter
intoo himself, and vexe and chafe himself there, when he sees himself so
wretched as all of vs are.</p>
               <p>Now after that Saint Paule hath shewed that it were much better
and more for our behoof too bee bee greeued at our owne vyces, than
at euery small occasion, when men behaue not themselues too our ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
he addeth theruntoo, <hi>Let not the Sunne go downe vppon
your anger.</hi> We must not vnderstand by this, that S. Paul ment to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
such as are soone angrie, &amp; soone appeazed: for it is a vice worthy
of blame. And although it bee more excuzable than the feeding of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleazure
which turneth too rancour or hatred: yit notwithstanding we
cannot bee so soone pacifyed, but that wee shall haue offended God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye
with our choler. For wee heare what is sayd euen by the mouth
of our Lord Iesus Christ:<note place="margin">Math. 5. d. 22.</note> namely that if wee shewe any signe of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleazure


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23289:237"/>
at all, and it be as it were but by grunting betweene the teeth
wee bee alreadye in daunger of hel fyre before God. Wee shal not
neede too haue giuen any blowe, nor too haue doone any open wrong
wherby wee myght bee brought before a Iustice: if wee haue but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offended so farre as too haue conceyued any pritch, there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuce
for vs. And therfore when Saint Paule forbiddeth vs too feede
our anger, he dooth not vtterly iustifye them that are gentle and easye
too bee reconcyled, and will soone forgiue: for they bee blame woorthie
alredie, as I sayd afore. But he proceedeth here by degrees, as if
he should say, my freends, if euery of vs thought vppon his owne
sinnes, it is certeyne that wee should bee moued too mislyke of our
selues, bycause wee prouoke Gods wrath ageinst vs: and he that hath
a lyuely feeling of his owne faults, will arme himself therwith ageinst
himself. For wee ought too haue a zele too Godward, as though wee
were his attourneyes, and that zele ought too procure vs too condemne
euill whersoeuer wee fynd it. But Anger is alwayes at our elbowe,
yea and it dwelleth in vs, so as wee shall neuer bee so perfect as were
too bee wisshed, so long as wee bee in this world. (Yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
howsoeuer the cace stand, let vs beware that wee suffer not our
selues too bee possessed with inordinate passions. For if wee conceyue
any hartburning, and go too bed vppon it: surely wee shalbee poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by and by, and the mischeef wil not bee espyded so easly. It is all
one as if a man that felt him self alredye attached with infection of
some disease, should linger in his miserie, and by all meanes possible
eschewe the phisicion, and runne as farre backe from him as he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
coulde, if he woulde offer too come too him: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
when he would haue remedie, it is too late, bycause the disease
is settled, &amp; hath so ouergrowen him, that phisick cannot stand him in
any stead. Euen so is it with the man that is angrie, and contineweth
in it without purging of the malice from his stomacke: certeinly it is
as if a man had some inward and vnespyed disease, which groweth so
strong, as afterward it becommeth vncurable. That is the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
which Saint Paule hath set downe heere. First he sheweth vs
how wee may bee faultlesse before God, in respect of anger and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:
that is too wit, by thinking euery of vs vppon our owne faults,
too condemne them, and too bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That is a holy Anger, and such a one as God allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th of. And yit


<pb facs="tcp:23289:238"/>
notwithstanding, forasmuch as wee bee ouerweake, if wee commit a
fault, at leastwyse let vs not dubble it: and though wee haue offended
God, let it not make vs too multiply choler ageinst him, least the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
get possession of vs, and wee cannot afterward abyde too bee
brought backe agein intoo the good way, but our passions doo so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayster
vs, as they make vs too followe them without end or measure.
In any wyse let vs beware of that.</p>
               <p>That also is the cause why he sayeth, <hi>that wee giue place too the
diuell, when the sunne goeth downe vppon our anger.</hi> It is
trew, that wee haue no sooner tripped, but that diuell hath alredy had
power ouer vs: howbeeit he is brydled in such wyse, that if wee
bethink vs of our faults, and amend them, God suffereth him not too
hold vs captiue as prisoners. But when we be so farre ouerseene as to
take pritch, and to lyke wel of our owne testinesse, and therupon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
a number of fancies too rancle inward more and more: (I say)
if wee bee at that poynt: wee haue giuen Satan entrance, he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
possession of vs, and afterward it is out of tyme for vs too wish too
returne: for the mischeef is rooted so deepe, and growen so strong,
that medicines can not doo any more good, as I haue shewed alredy.
Now we see S. Paules meaning. And therfore let vs put this doctrin
in vre. The first poynt wherof is to examin well the euill that is in vs,
that we may be angry with our selues, and euery of vs be as a foe too
himself, as driuen by a zeale to Godward, to hate &amp; abhorre our owne
vyces. Let that be the first thing that we bestowe our studie vppon and
then shall we haue wherupon too occupie well our chafing and choler,
&amp; we shalbe no more so hasty to take pritch ageinst such as haue doone
vs some wrong, but wee will rather beare with them that haue fowly
offended vs, bycause wee shall haue buzinesse ynough too serche out
our owne imperfections. And (as I sayd afore) wee shall the easlyer
beare with other mennes misdealings, when wee perceyue our selues
blame woorthie so many wayes, not towards mortall creatures only,
but towards the liuing God. For what are wee that wee should keepe
such a stirre for euery wrong that is doone vs, seing wee craue forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at Gods hand euery day (as necessitie also constreyneth vs) of
the offences which wee haue committed ageinst his maiestie, and
wherthrough we haue broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ryghtuousnes? The very meane ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to appease al wicked &amp; excessiue cholericknesse, is that euery of vs
be greeued &amp; angry with him self, bycause he sees him self subiect too


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23289:238"/>
so many infirmities, or rather so many sinnes and vyces.</p>
               <p>And for the seconde poynt, if wee chaunce too stumble and fall
through fraylty, that wee bee not so hild backe by the feare of God,
but that wee be faultie before him: let vs beware that wee doo not
harden and foade our selues in our euill dooing, but as soone as wee
feele anye vnmeasurable mouing in vs, let vs step before it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer
too represse it: let vs vse violence in that behalfe too subdew our
passions that carye vs so away, making vs too skirmish so ageinst
God and our neyghbours. Thus must wee fyght manfully too brydle
all our cholleriknesse. Or else if any excesse haue escaped vs, let vs
come back agein and bethink our selues better, and let vs rid it away
quickly, assuring our selues it is as a disease that requyreth speedie
remedie, or else it will ouergrowe in such wyze, as all succour shall
come out of season. Let vs think vppon it.</p>
               <p>Now if Saint Paule had sayd no more but thus: my freends, let
not the Sunne go downe vppon your anger, for if rancour doo once
settle, it will not bee easly put away: it had bin much, and that war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ought too haue suffyzed vs. But the threate which he setteth
downe with it in that he sayeth, <hi>Giue not place too the Diuel,</hi> ought
too make the heares stand vp vpon our heads. Some in deede haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it too bee spoken of the enemies of the fayth, which seeke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of slaundering it: but it is easie too bee seene by the woords
them selues, how hee intended too warne vs of a thing which wee
ought too bee more afrayd of, and which will scare vs woorse: that is
too wit, that the diuell getteth as it were the maystrie and dominion
ouer vs, when wee feede any grudge and hartburning ageinst our
brethren. Now then, which of vs wil not quake for feare, when he
heareth of his subiecton vntoo Satan, as if he were in his bonds lyke
a prisoner? And yit for all that we take no heede of the things that are
told vs heere. For S. Paul hath vttered Gods sentence, which is, that
if wee pursue our anger and hartburning ageinst such as haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs, it is all one as if wee wilfully passed an obligation too Satan,
too bee hild as thralles vnder his tyrannie. So much the more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyre
dooth it stand vs on hand too bethink our selues aduyzedly, that if
that vyce cannot be througly amended at the first brunt, wee may at
lestwyze bee well ware that it doo not so settle in vs, as that we cannot
bee set at one agein, or that wee should pursue our quarells, or that
men should not bee able too wey with vs, vntill wee haue taken some


<pb facs="tcp:23289:239"/>
reuendgment. Let vs take heede (I say) that wee enter not intoo such
bondage of Satan. And euen for that cause is it sayd, that when men
doo fret and chafe after that fashion, of one diuell there are made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wayne. And why? For God is alredy offended at my neyghbour for
dooing mee wrong, and if I also fal to stomaking of the matter on my
part, &amp; will needs requyte him with the lyke: the diuell hath won vs
bothe. I ought too pitie the soule that is after a sort stayed away al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye,
and in the hygh way too perdition: I ought too seeke too bee
at one with him agein, and too salue the sore as much as is possible:
now if I also do let the reynes looce, and cast my self intoo Satans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lauerie through the cursed libertie that I take: then getteth he the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hand of both parties. So then, let vs beare this threatening well
in mynd, whereby the holy Ghost ment too waken vs throughly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
euery of vs myght stand vppon his gard, too beware of taking pritch
or stomacke at thinges, least afterwarde wee conceyue such hatred,
as may so harden vs, that there shall bee no more meanes too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaze
vs.</p>
               <p>Now hereuntoo S. Paule addeth another warning (as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
already,) wherein he rebuketh the common vyces that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
too the rule which our Lord giueth vs, too the intent wee should
lyue as Gods children, knowing wheretoo wee bee called. And nowe
he speaketh of the Deceytes, Robberies, and Extorsions that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
when euery man is too much wedded too himselfe, and hath no
conscience of other mennes harmes. <hi>Let him then that stole</hi> (sayeth
he) <hi>steale no more: but rather let him labour vvith his handes too
doo the things that are good and profitable, and vvheriwth he may
succour such as haue neede.</hi> Now wheras S. Paule speaketh heere
of theft, he meaneth not such theeues as men punishe with whipping
or with hanging: but all manner of slyghtes and craftes that are vsed
too get other mennes goods by euill practyzes, as extorsions, brybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and all other lyke things. Although then that such things bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out, or else that they which are most giltie of them, bee not accuzed
before men, bycause they can skill how too cloke their misdooings: yit
dooth S. Paule call them all theftes and robberies. And why? For
the Prophets and Apostles spake not the ordinarie manner of speeche
that is vsed in Courtes of Iustice on earth: but had an eye to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seate of God. For the thing that may bee excuzed, yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
well iustifyed before men, shall not fayle too bee condemned


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23289:239"/>
there. For God seeth much cleerer than mortall creatures. Agein,
fauour or parcialitie may beare sway oftentymes in Lawe matters:
so as there shal be cloking, dissembling, and couering, and the Iudges
shall lyke well ynough too haue a napkin tyde afore their eyes, that a
man may haue some starting hole too scape out at. They may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
lyke well ynough of such thinges: but it is not so with God.
Wherefore let vs marke well, that the forbydding of vs too steale, is
not as the publishing of some statute lawe that belongeth too temperal
policie: but wee bee called before the heauenly iudge, who discouereth
the things that are hidden from men, and condemneth all wicked co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse,
as theft, whereby we bee moued too seeke our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
too much with the hinderance of our neyghbour. Too bee short,
vnder this woorde theft or stealing, S. Paule comprehendeth all the
wicked practizes, that are vsed too deceyue other men withall: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
all extorsions whereby men are fleeced of their goods and bereft of
their substance. Now then wee see that there are Theeues too bee
found of all degrees. For there is not that man which is not buzie in
gryping too himselfe, I meane of them which are not reformed by
Gods spirit. Although a marchant man bee counted of good wealth,
yit will he haue store of fetches and policies still, and they shal bee as
nettes layde for the simple sort and such as haue no experience, which
perceyue them not. In lyke cace is it with Handicraftes men: for
they haue the skill too counterfet their woorkes in such wyse, as men
shall bee deceyued by them. Agein, as touching the pryce, there is no
trusting too them, al is one too them, so they may sell their wares, for
they thinke that all is lawfull for them. Lykewise doo laborers and
husbandmen. Too bee short, there is no state of men wherin there are
not infinite faultes, and extorsions too bee seene, so as euery man would
gayne and make himselfe strongest. If yee looke vppon the rich, and
vppon such as lyue of their Rentes, it is yit woorse. For they flea off
the skinnes of the inferiour people, and of such as are vnable too resist
them. And yit before men (as I sayd,) all of them doo iustifye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
howbeeit, that is bycause they knowe not that God hath soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
heere his trumpet, too summon them before him, ne consider what
manner of perfection and purenesse must bee brought vntoo him. So
much the more therfore dooth it stand vs on hand too try, not onely all
our outward deedes, but also all our our wicked affections, wherby wee be
tempted too inrich our selues b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yond reason and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:240"/>And Saint Paule sayeth purposely, that he which hath stolne,
should steale no more: too shewe that there ought too appeere such a
chaunge in our lyfe, when God hath once brought vs home too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his Gospell, as wee may no more resemble the wretched vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers
which walke in darknesse, but consider that our Lordes
inlyghtening of vs, is with condition, that wee should become newe
creatures. And herewithall wee see the thing that I haue touched
alredy: namely that S. Paule speaketh not of the common theftes
that are condemned and punished afore the world: for then should it
follow, that all had bin theeues which had bin conuerted too christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
But (as I sayde afore) he vseth the woorde Steale, purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too make vs too abhorre all craftinesse, malice, suttlenesse, and
catching of other mens goods the more. For if it had bin sayd (but
thus:) vse no more craft too deceyue men, nother take yee leaue too
pull the things to you, that are none of your owne: he had not touched
them so much too the quicke, which flatter themselues, and seeke too
haue some couert to cloke their vyces withall. But when as he sayeth,
Steale no more: it is to the ende that wee should thinke thus with our
selues: Alas, albeeit that I would fayne excuze my self, and too my
seeming it were not doone amisse of mee, and men haue bleared eyes:
yit must I not rest vppon that. For in the meane whyle my faultes
shal not fayle too bee registred before God, and I must bee fayne too
yeelde an account of all things that haue not bin doone according
too vncorrupte equitie and ryght, and I must bee taken for a theef
before God, notwithstanding that all the world haue quit mee.</p>
               <p>But now let vs see howe well this doctrine is put in vre. A man
shall fynd that they which are conuerted too the Gospell, take most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
too doo euill. It should seeme that a number haue learned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else by the Gospel, but to buzie themselues about pretie slyghtes
too intangle other mens goods. For there are too bee seene, which
vsed greater simplicitie in the tyme that they were blynd wretches,
and knew nothing of God, and of the pure doctrine of saluation, for
they had at least wyse some vpryghtnesse and playne dealing too the
worldward. But they haue so profited backeward in Gods schoole,
as they bee farre wylyer than they were before, in making theyr
owne aduauntage, and in taking more libertie, and in bearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
on hand that all thinges are lawfull for them. And therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
they bee so shamelesse in facing and bolstring out their dooinges,


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23289:240"/>
that they doo but make a pot at it, and beare themselues on hand that
they haue great wroong doone them, when they bee blamed for the
things that are apparantly knowen too all men, and whereof euen
little children may bee iudges. So much the more then are wee too
bee condemned, seeing that Paule telleth vs heere, that although
wee enriched our selues by Crafte and Extorsion, and made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
too rake other mens goods too vs, before wee had good tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
yit at leastwyze wee should bee well aduyzed too walk more
vpryghtly with our neyghbors, now that we be inlyghtened by Gods
word. Yee see then that the thing we haue to beare in mynd vppon this
text, is, that our Lord Iesus Christes doctrine ought to rule vs in such
singlenesse, as euery of vs may forbeare his craftinesse and suttleties.</p>
               <p>Furthermore forasmuch as a number excuse themselues, saying,
How shall I doo then? For I haue no trade too liue by, vnlesse I
may follow still myne owne maner of dealing: Saint Paule sayeth,
<hi>Let them labour.</hi> Let him that would make it excuce, that he hath not
wherwith too fynd him self, except hee may deceyue and defraud: let
him (sayeth Paule) giue him self too laboring with his hands. As if
he sayd, that mens dispensing with them selues vnder colour that they
should then fast, and indure many miseries and penuries, is a tryfling
toy before God: All those allegations are nother heere nor there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, sayeth S. Paule. For if any bee afrayd that he shall want:
let him not forbeare too labour. Marke that for one poynt. And heere
let vs learne too leaue these self soothings, wherwithall a number of
folkes doo bring themselues asleepe, who when they haue sayd, what
shall I doo? Doo beare themselues on hand that Gods mouth is stopt,
and that he dares no more come nygh them: and they will needes bee
so priuiledged, that too their owne seeming they bee quyte and cleare,
if they can alledge for themselues, how then? Whereof shall I lyue?
What shall I doo, if I follow not my woonted trade? It seemeth too
vs that God is shet out of the gate, and that he hath no more authoritie
too condemne vs, when wee haue once alledged those thinges for our
selues. But that is but folly, sayeth S. Paule. Wee should rather
scratch vp the earth with our nayles, than offend God by dooyng
wrong too our neyghbours. The thing then wheruntoo he sendeth vs
backe, is, that when a man is growen riche, and hath lyued a long
tyme at his ease by fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing and stealing: that is too say, by prety fyne
slyghtes and conueyances, that are ageinst equitie and right: let him


<pb facs="tcp:23289:241"/>
not bee ashamed too abate his countenance, and too labour for the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his liuing. Albeeit that he haue erst doone nothing but sit stil,
and gotten his liuing by deuyzing mischeefe: yit let him not bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
too labour and to take paine for his sustenance. Too bee short,
Saint Paule sheweth vs heere, that all vnlawfull gaynes must bee
left by such as call themselues Christians, and wil bee taken so too
bee. And this warning is as needfull for vs now adayes, as euer it
was for any. For besydes that, wee must absteyne from all suttletie
and deceyte, when God once calleth vs too bee his children, and
will haue vs too maynteyne a brotherhood among our selues: many of
vs also must giue ouer our trades of liuing. For what a number of
meanes too liue vppon, are there in the popedome? But when wee
come before God, let vs alwayes remember this definitiue sentence
which I haue set down: namely that we consider how the cace concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
our not answering before an earthly Iudge, but before him which
seeth all things, and before whom there is no cloking of any thing.
Therfore let vs thinke well vppon it, seeing there are so many meanes
excuzable in poperie, wherwith as good as a fourth part of the world
is maynteyned, and yit are all of them not only vnauaylable, but also
abhominable before God. For first of all there bee Priestes and
Moonkes, and all the rabble (of Cloysterers.) Secondly there
are there hangers on which liue of them, and are as it were their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
men, which haue some geyne by them, and doo skum of some
part of their fatte by one meane or other: vnder which Couert there
lurketh a very long tayle that is turned in and out like a Maze. Agein,
there are a great sorte too bee seene, which giue themselues all
wholly too things that are nothing woorth. Trew it is that in this
darkenesse of theirs men see not very well: insomuch that black (as
yee would say) is turned intoo whyte. But yit howsoeuer the cace
stand, there is no placard for men in this behalf, but euery man must
haue an eye too this, that like as hithertoo I haue filched &amp; polled to
get my liuing: and haue exercyced some wicked practize or other,
which God, condemneth by his woord: seeing I had defyled myself
in eating the bread which came not too mee lawfully from the hand
of God as it should doo, according too my asking of my dayly bread
of him, but by filching here and there: I must now hensfoorth chaunge
my copie, and learne too labour in such wyse, as I may truly say, that
the things which I haue, doo come too mee of Gods blissyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23289:241"/>
is the thing which wee haue too remember vppon this lesson of Saint
Paules. And it behoueth vs to put it so much the better in vre, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that theeuerye is more ry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e now adayes in the world than euer
it was, and yit notwithstanding a number of men doo flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
still in that behalf, bycause the belly will needes haue the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deele.
When a man hath whereon too liue (say they) and all things
necessary besydes: it is good reason that he should not exempt himself
from Gods woorde: but that wee should starue for hunger, what order
were in that? what rigour were it? Forasmuch then as wee bee so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
too seeke too bee prouided for, by hooke or by crooke, without
regarding what is lawful or vnlawfull: let vs thinke the better vpon
the things that S. Paule telleth vs heere.</p>
               <p>And he proceedeth yit one degree further in this chaunge, which he
inioyneth vnto all the faythful: which is, that he telleth them they must
not only absteyne from defrauding of other men, and from polling
them of their goodes: but also indeuer too succour such as haue neede.
Although then that it seeme ouer rough vnto vs too absteyne from all
euill, and that in sted of liuing at our ease, as we haue bin woont to do,
and of hauing many commodities,) wee should bee fayne to scratch
our liuing out of the earth with our nayles (as they say) and too labour
with greate peyne and trauell, yea and too fare verye hardly: if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
(say I) that this seeme ryght hard: yit must wee go further,
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue wherwith to get our liuing without vsing of wicked
practizes, wee must now and then spare somewhat of that which God
giueth vs through his blissing, too releeue the needie withall. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs not looke whertoo wee bee inclyned, but let vs consider that
of our owne nature wee bee so froward and wedded too our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
that euery of vs will needs bee alwayes well stored, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as wee haue so little regard of them that are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of our Lord Iesus Christ aswel as our selues, we must take paines
to inforce our selues to do them good: for that is a labor that will bring
vs too another. Wee must (say I) inforce all our affections, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon
imploy our selues earnestly and vnfeynedly, that wee may bee
able too protest that the bread which wee eate, commeth too vs from
Gods hand, and that wee bee susteyned by his goodnesse, as if it were
by a father that cantleth out euerye of his children their pittance. Then
let vs bee at that poynt. And moreouer, let vs not think it ynough too
absteyne from all craftinesse, and from wynding in of men by our


<pb facs="tcp:23289:242"/>
fetches, and from catching of other mens goods: but let vs labour
too doo good with the little which wee haue, and too succour such as
haue neede.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit Saint Paule addeth heere yit one circumstance more,
which deserueth to be wel noted: and that is, that he will haue vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<hi>in the thing that is good.</hi> And why addeth hee that? Let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a number of trades, Crafts, or occupations there are in the
world, which serue for nothing but corruption, and to toll in pence, as
they say. Truly men are not aware of it. And why? Bycause all
men are contented, that such as haue wherwith, should bee prodigall,
too the intent that their money may flye abrode. Agein, such as (too
their owne seeming) cannot get their liuing otherwyse, are inuenting
of newe deuyces euery day, too angle the money out of fooles purses,
and of such as are so giuen too lyghtnesse. Agein, they that haue
wherwith, will needs set out themselues, and bee braue too the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
And that is the cause why the occupatons and trades which
serue but for pompe and superfluitie, and for I wote not what nyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and allurements, and alonly too prouoke folke too leaudnesse,
will needs make men beleue that there is nothing amisse in them. But
Saint Paule hath therfore set downe a distinction heere. For it is not
ynough when a man can say, Oh, I take peyne, I haue myne occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
or I haue such a trade: that is not ynough: but hee must see
whether the same bee good and profitable for the common welth, and
whether his neyghbours may fare the better by it. For ought not this
too be the end wherto all trades, occupations, and states doo tend, and
whertoo they ought too referre themselues: namely, that euery man
looke too imploy him self in some thing wherby he may doo good?
And for the same cause are wee lykened too the members of a bodie.
Now then,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. b. 12.</note> as who should say, that the hand should imploy it self too
the delyghting of some other member, which notwithstanding should
receyue harme by it. By that meanes all the bodie should go too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in asmuch as we must alwayes haue before our eyes,
that in what calling soeuer wee liue, God must go before vs, as if hee
called vs too him, and wee followe the way that he sheweth vs by his
woord: surely he will neuer allow of any trade or occupation, which
is not beehooffull and seruisable too the whole common welth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downding
also too the profit of all men. Therfore if a man vse a trade
or occupation which is too no purpose but to breede offences, or too


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:23289:242"/>
bee sotte men in their delicate delyghts, and too marre them vtterly, or
else too set out pomp excessyuely, as though men purposed euen in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyte
of nature, too make hauocke of the good things that God hath
giuen vs: it is certeyne that all those thinges are without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of godly vocations or callings, and that God dooth vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
them. Thou mayst well say, I haue trauelled in this or that: yea
but thou hast serued the diuell. For lyke as the diuell hath his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
so hath he also his seruantes. Wee see how such as are gyuen
too superstition, doo martir themselues without end or ceassing, &amp; are
(as yee would say) starke mad vpon them, and as good as out of their
wits. And oftentimes the scripture also vseth the same comparisons,
too shew how the diuell casteth men quite out of their boundes, when he
once possesseth them. Yee see then that many men torment themselues
without reason: yea, but yit are they the diuels martirs. Lykewise
there are a great number that shall haue taken much paine in some
trade or occupation, too get their liuing: &amp; yit if a man looke too what
purpose it serueth, he shall fynd it to be nothing but infection &amp; filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; that it serueth but to nurrish pride and superfluitie. To be short,
it is an open prouoking of God, and a wasting and misspending of the
things that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with commaundement to vse them soberly
&amp; stayedly. No maruell therfore though S. Paule haue set downe this
distinction. And therfore let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looke diligently to himselfe, and
when fathers are mynded too set theyr children too any trade or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation,
let them not looke (as the common custome is) which may
bee most gaynefull: but let them match these twoo thinges toogither,
namely, when they haue considered by what trade their sonne may best
get his liuing, and prouyde for himselfe and his household, when he
commeth too bee maryed: (therwith let him also looke) that he serue
his neyghbours turnes, and that the vse of his craft or mysterie may
redounde too the common profyte of all men. The thing then which
fathers must haue respect vntoo in setting their children too trades
and occupations, is not too bee forepossessed wyth regard how they
may most gayne, but howe they may alwayes bee hylde in order,
that they swarue not one way nor other. For when our lustes do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
so carry vs away, that wee can no sooner spye a little gayne, but wee
bee by and by snatching at it: it is all one as if wee shooke handes
with Satan, yea and these thinges become as hayted hookes that he
casteth for vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:243"/>And lyke as a hungry fishe will soone bee taken, and the foode that she
raught at, costeth hir full deere: so fareth it with these intycementes of
Satan. When men haue no further forecast, but thus, ho, such a man
gayned well by such a trade, and great profit may bee made of it: he
steppeth too it at al aduenture, and neuer makes bones at it, too scan
or consider whether it bee ryght or wrong: but (as I sayde afore) is
choked or euer he come too that consideration. So much the more
therefore dooth it stand vs on hand too marke well what Saint Paule
sayeth heere: namely, that when men bee desyrous too get their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
they must bethinke themselues aduyzedly, and not beare with
themselues in dooyng of things, bycause they be customably doone of
others, and no fault found with them among men: but consider that
they haue too doo with God, and that it is he before whom wee must
make our account.</p>
               <p>Agein, let vs haue good eye too the thing that is told vs heere, that
is too say, too the succoring of the needie. For Saint Paule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
too warne vs in one woord, that our Lord in setting poore
folkes before vs, intendeth too trye what wee bee, namely, whether
there bee kyndnesse in vs, or whether wee bee cruell lyke wyld beastes,
And it is a thing also that ought too moue vs too compassion. And
for the same cause, when the Scripture speaketh of dooing almesse,
besydes that it vseth the woord mercie, it sayeth also, that our bowels
ought to be moued when we see our brethren in neede. Yee see then
that the syght of our neyghbours necessities, ought too prouoke vs too
liberalitie, and too releeue them. Let vs not tary till they cry out for
hunger, nor tyll wee bee inforced, nor tyll shame compell vs: but let
euery of vs thinke, hath this man neede? Hath God se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him before
mee? Hath he made mee too knowe it? It is ynough. For it is euen
as much as if he summoned mee, and sent me his Receyuers or Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers,
too take vp his reuenewes. Lyke as they that haue Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
and Rentes, send their men to demaund them, and gather them
vp: so our Lord requyreth of vs, that wee should pay him his tributes,
that is too say, the homage money that wee owe him, in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the things which wee possesse, come from him, and euen of
his meere free gift. He sendeth vs nother Shreefes nor Serieantes,
but the poore, and that ought too suffyze vs, for they bee his trew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuers:
and that is, too the ende we should not be looth to giue them.
The cause why their necessitie is set before our eyes, is too the end wee


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:23289:243"/>
should bee touched with pitie and compassion, and theruppon bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned
too doo good. So then, let vs marke that the summe of the
things heere spoken, is, first that wee should forsake all manner of
trades too lyue by, which are not agreeing too Gods woord: assuring
our selues that wee shall alwayes bee taken for theeues before him, if
wee vse any wicked trades, and that although wee haue good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that our calling is good and lawfull: yit must wee vse it in such
wyse, as there bee not any rauening, craft, or deceyt in it. Marke that
for one poynt. Agein, let vs vnderstand, that there is no excuce for vs
before God, insomuch that although wee alledge famine, pouertie, or
necessitie: all that will not serue too acquit vs, but that wee must set
our hand too labour, that wee may earne our lyuing lawfully, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
too profit our selues by other mennes losse. Finally, besydes as
it were the bynding vp of our handes from dooyng any man wrong,
and from vsing any pretie shiftes &amp; slyghtes too get other mens goods:
let vs haue a regard too doo good. Yea and let vs haue a speciall care
too succour such as want: howbeit so as it bee with the thinges that
God hath giuen vs of our owne. For those are the offerings and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
which wee must make vnto him, in acknowlegment of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefytes.
And wee knowe that Almesdeedes are called Sacrifyces.
Therfore when wee doo them, wee must protest with an vnfeyned and
trew meaning hart, that wee come too doo homage too God for the
things that wee hold of him. And if there bee any theft in our hands,
it is certaine that our sacrifyzes shall bee vncleane, &amp; our almesdeedes
shall bee turned intoo lothsomnesse. Then let euery man beware that
he doo not pill and poll with the one hand, too giue of it anone after
with the other: but let euery of vs haue both our handes cleane. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let vs haue a dubble hart, but labour with all vprightnesse to earne
our lyuing in such wise, that if God send vs any profit by it, wee may
take it as his free gift. And in good sooth, Moyses also forbyddeth vs
too father any peece of our gayne vppon our owne running,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. d. 17.</note> or vppon
the labour of our handes: for God will haue vs to bee beholden to him
for all. Therefore when wee doo any almesse, let it bee with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
not onely with mouth, but also in hart and deede, namely, that
according as our Lord hath shewed himselfe liberall vntoo vs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vppon vs, and giuen vs ouer and aboue wherwith too serue our
owne neede, wee bee willing too doo him homage with it: and let vs
shewe in deede, that wee intend not too keepe too our selues the things


<pb facs="tcp:23289:244"/>
that he hath giuen vs, but doo put them too the vse whertoo he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
them, that is too say, too the releeuing of those that haue neede
of them.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs feele them
better, so as wee may bee sory for them, and aske him forgiuenesse of
them, and profit more and more in his feare, that beyng withdrawen
from our fleshly affections, wee may continue in his feare and loue, too
the intent too profit more and more in the keeping of his holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.

cause sayd in another place, that euill woords corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners.
Though wee weere neuer so modest, chaste, cleane mynded,
and giuen too good: yit if wee admit wanton talk, it perceth euen too
the bottom of the hart, and wee bee atteynted with it before wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
it, insomuch as it marreth vs vtterly. And in very deede if a
woman giue eare too the messages that are brought hir, tending too
seduce hir: a man may well say shee is a harlot alredie, and the thing
it self is manifest ynough. Then is it certein that all vnchaste and
leaud speeches, are baudie tricks: and although the parties that are
so giuen too casting foorth of such leaud talk, doo it not alwayes of that
mynd: yit of what intent so euer they doo it, Satan is the author of it.
And (as I sayd afore) if such vnchaste and looce talk haue full scope,
needs must wee bee poysoned out of hand, and the mischeef haue his
course. And therfore not without cause dooth Saint Paul forewarne
vs, that <hi>no Vncleane speeche,</hi> or (as I sayd afore) <hi>no filthie speeche
proceede out of our mouth.</hi> And on the contrarie part he setteth
downe, that wee haue sufficient matter too talk of one with another:
that is too wit, too edifye, that men may fare somwhat the better by
our communication. Accordingly as euen the heathen men can say,
that it dooeth one good too bee in such a mans companie. And why?
For he shall euer heare some good sentence, and he neuer goes from
him without carying away of some good. And it is nature that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

and another the other, and that in stead of receyuing good, a man shall

therfore which wee haue too beare in mynd, is that our Lord will haue
all the partes of vs too serue too dooing good, and specially our tung,
so as the drift of all our talk bee too edify. As for example, one hath
neede of Counsell, another of warning; another of rebuking, and
another too be put in mynd of some thing, or else to be taught, bycause
he is vtterly ignorant: and agein, it extendeth too all things in this
present lyfe. Trew it is that the principall thing which wee haue too
looke vntoo, is too teache the ignorant, and too shewe them the way of
saluation. Besyds that, if any man misbehaue him selfe, so as he bee
negligent and slothfull, he must bee spurred foreward by good exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
and if he bee vnruly, hee must bee shamed, (as much as lyeth
in vs,) that it may bring him backe tooo the seruis of God. Agein, a
man must comfort such as are in heauinesse, and giue counsell too such
as are in distresse, too the intent they fall not intoo despayre. Too bee
short, wee must indeuer too hold backe the poore s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ules that should else
go too destruction. And of all others that is the principall benefyte.
But yit if wee see a poore man that is lyke too bee deceyued, wee must
giue him some warning of it. And when we bee once come too that
poynt, it is certein that wee shall giue our selues continually to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte
and behoof of our neyghbours, yea euen infinite wayes, as well
in respect of the bodie as of the soule.</p>
               <p>And let vs see nowe whether wee haue not sufficient ground and
matter too woorke these things vppon. Wee cannot go one step,
but wee see how one hath neede too bee spurred, another too bee rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the third too bee comforted, and another too bee taught. If wee
hold our toungs at all this, and care nother for the bodyes nor for the
soules of them that are linked too vs, and with whom wee ought too
be vnited as the fingers of a hand: is it not an open dispyzing of God,
when wee imbace the naturall vse of our toung in such wyse? And


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23289:245"/>
therefore let vs keepe vs from marring of the thing that wee ought
too set so much store by, namely the meane which wee haue too glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
God, by making confession of our fayth, and by calling vppon him,
and also by seruing our neyghbours turnes after so manye sortes,
as I haue shewed alredye. And so the first poynt which wee haue
too marke in this streyne, is the lawfull vse whereuntoo God
hath ordeyned our toungs, and how they ought too bee applyed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereuntoo.</p>
               <p>Now if wee ought too procure the furtherance of our neyghbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs
saluation, and also their temporall benefyte and welfare: what a
thing is it if wee seduce them by our disorder, and vtterly quenche
and put away all feare of God in them? When wee serue Satan by
our looce talk, when wee labour too deface all honestie, when wee
moue men too a beastly lyfe: is not such defyling of our toungs an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
peruerting of the order of nature? Then let vs learne so too occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
our selues in good and necessarie talke, as wee eschew the defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of our selues with wicked communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are as baudes
trickes of Satan, too corrupt such as were well dispozed too serue
God. And so wee see that looke how manye looce speeches passe in
the worlde, so many spirituall poysonings are there (as I sayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
too corrupt good manners. And although wee cannot be made
to beleeue it: yit is it certein that it is proued sufficiently ynough, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by experience. Howbeeit let vs not bee as fooles that will not learne
but by great harme: but rather let vs yeeld too that which is told vs
by the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>And heereuppon wee may gather, that it is not too bee thought
straunge, though the world bee now adayes giuen too all leaudnesse.
For it seemeth too bee no euill at all too vse iesting and scoffing talke,
insomuch that men would make a vertewe of it, and fynd no bones at
all in it. Lykewyse wee see a great number of iesters and scoffers,
whose drift is too put away all shame, that men myght let themselues
at raundon, and become vtterly shamelesse. Wee see this too much
in vse, and therefore no maruell though wee gather the frutes of that
wicked and cursed licentiousnesse, which is too much suffered. And
heereby wee see also, what is too bee thought of all wanton (and
baudie songs, and of louemakings. If a young mayd vse (as it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
too commonly) too sing foolish songs of loue: shee will bee made a
whoore, euen before shee knowe what whooredome is. And so is shee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:246"/>
(imboldened and) inhardned too all vnshamefastnesse, and the diuell
getteth possession of hir before shee knowe what chastitie meaneth,
and how horrible a thing it is to put foorth hirself too such leaudnesse,
and too breake hir fayth and troth which shee shall haue plyghted,
when shee comes too mariage. Before a mayd can bee able too dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
all this: shee shalbee vtterly mard aforehand, if shee acquaynt
hirself with leaude songs. And it is wonder that this mischeef can
not bee redressed. Whereby it appeereth, that Satan laboreth in
that behalf, and streyneth himself too the vttermust, knowing that he
hath vs at a great aduauntage, if he may so sowe his cursed cockle,
too corrupt our good manners. For surely if the diuell wrought not
in it, wee myght more easly deale too dispatch and rid away all those
ribawdries and filthinesse out of rememberance, which are as deadly
plagues, as I haue sayd afore. But it is impossible. For though
there were sorer punishment for it than there is: yit both wyues and
maydes had leuer go too prizon, and too bee taken for harlots, than
too correct that vyce, which is the corrupter of the whole world,
and too brydle their cursed toungs, which serue for nothing but too
infect all things with that filthinesse. Yit notwithstanding, wee shall
haue the lesse excuce after such warning, and as for them that stop
their eares, and wil needes harden their hartes ageinst the holy Ghost:
they shalbee driuen too yeeld an account, not only for offending God
so many wayes, but also for poysoning of folkes soules after a sort,
which is a thing much more heynous and horrible, than if they had
murthered their bodies. They that doo but poyson beastes, shalbee
driuen out of the world, and they deserue it well. And what shalbee
doone too them which not only slea the bodie with their poysons, but
also make assault vppon the soule, and ceasse not too corrupt all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and all feare of God, yea and all honestie (as I sayd afore) by
their leaude talke.</p>
               <p>Yee see then that the thing which wee haue too remember in this
streyne, is that in asmuch as God hath appoynted our toungs too
such vse as wee haue heard, that is too wit, too the seruice of our
neyghbours, and too the benefyting of them both in bodie and soule:
wee must imploy them diligently thereuntoo. And therefore let vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all things keepe vs from infecting of those that were inclined too
serue God, and from thrusting them out of the way by casting foorth
such speeches before them as may coole their goodnesse, &amp; prouoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ush say they,
God passeth much for this. Agein, othersome come not too such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,
but yit will they lessen their faultes, so as they shalbee but
veniall sinnes with them. Othersome doo cloke all things: and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
generally will say, Tush, wee must not bee so carefull, God
will not haue vs too liue so sadly, for what a thing were that? It
should not bee lawfull for vs too laugh within a whyle. And their
speaking after that manner, is too burie all feare of God by little and
little. Yee see then that manie sortes of such folke, yea many mo
than needeth, doo shew themselues too much: and they bee as manie
recordes, that leaude woordes are poysons too murther mennes
soules withall. And therefore let vs stand vppon our garde in that
behalf. And first of all (as I sayd) let euery man beware that he
speake chastely, and vse none other than honest speeche. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
let vs shun all them as diuels, which iest out the matter after
that fashyon, notwithstanding that for their mirthes sake they bee
welcome too vs, and sometymes also fare well of free coste, (O, say
wee,) He is a good fellowe, he will make all the companie merrye.
Now whereas men are desyrous too haue such folke, too tickle their
eares by casting foorth their iestes and daliances, and such other lyke
things: let vs learne too shet them out of our doores. For wee would
not willingly hold vp our throte too a dagger, when wee sawe it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en:
nother would go seeke one too murther our bodies. And why
then doo wee long sore too haue our soules murthered, which is much
woorse? Wherefore let vs eschew such folkes as can doo nothing but
quenche and put out the feare of God in vs, and make vs shamelesse
and hard harted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bereeue vs of all honestie, and shamefastnesse,
for feare least God pay vs the wages that wee deserue, for hauing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quayntance
and familiaritie with such people: and therefore let vs doo
our indeuer that such plagues may not reigne among vs. Bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
(sayeth Saint Paule) speaking of such scoffers,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. d. 33.</note> which
serue but too prouoke our lustes, too bereeue vs of all remorse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
too abate the feare of God in vs, and too abuse vs in such
wyze, as sin may delyght vs. Beware (sayeth he) that none of you bee
deceyued by lying woordes, bycause it hath bin a common thing in


<pb facs="tcp:23289:247"/>
all ages. And therfore let vs put Saint Paules counsell in vre, and
not onely let euery of vs keepe good watch that he bee not surpryzed:
but also let vs haue a care too keepe other folkes from beeing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after that fashyon. That is the thing which wee haue too remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
heere.</p>
               <p>And wee see what he sayeth, namely that wee bee weake ynough,
yea and too weake: yea and so saped in euill, as is horrible too see:
and therefore when wee couet too record still some newe lesson (of
leaudnesse,) and are quickened and spurred vp by others, is it not as
if a drunkard hauing well stuffed and filled himself alredy, euen till
he bee redye too burst, should seeke still too prouoke his appetyte, that
he myght drinke and lade in wyne newe agein? So then, is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man sufficiently giuen too euill of himself, though there were no
leaude songs nor vnthriftie talke at all? But when the diuell fyndeth
any gap open, and can drawe vs further too naughtinesse by his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
so as he can harden vs in it: I pray you doo wee not giue him
the vpper hand of vs, so as we be wholy at his pleasure, that he may
driue vs and drawe vs whither he listeth?</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon S. Paule addeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>that vvee must not greeue the
spirit of God, wherwith vvee bee marked and sealed ageinst the day
of our Redemption.</hi> Heere is yit one declaration more, which ought
too touche vs neere. Trew it is, that the things which haue bin spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ought well of good desert too bee throughly mynded. For what
a thing is it for vs too peruert the order of nature, by applying our
tunges too the cleane contrarie, which God hath appoynted to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and too the benefyte of our neyghbours? And agein, too bee gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of infecting all men with our filthinesse, of peruerting those that
were giuen too the seruing of God, and of prouoking those persons
vntoo beastly vnshamefastnesse, that had some shame and honestie in
them? Should not this moue vs sufficiently, if wee were not tootoo
blockish? But S. Paule telleth vs of a thing that ought too scare vs
yit much more. <hi>Greeue not Gods Spirit</hi> (sayeth he.) And why? For
wee bee marked with it (sayeth he) and it dwelleth in vs, and sealeth
the hope of our saluation in our hartes, and it is also the seede of lyfe,
which wee haue too warrant vs our euerlasting saluation. Now it is
certeine that when wee take such libertie both too doo euill and too
speake euill: it is a fyghting ageinst Gods spirit as much as in vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and a choking of the lyght which he hath kindled in vs, &amp; a taking


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23289:247"/>
of the brydle in our teeth too doo all naughtinesse. And that cannot bee
doone but too his griefe. This is the thing which S. Paule intended
too say heere.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit let vs marke first of all, that he speaketh heere after the
common maner of the holy scripture. For wee knowe there are no
passions in God. It is the propertie of men too bee sorie and greeued:
God is vnchaungeable. Notwithstanding, bycause wee conceyue
not the hyghnesse which is in him, and that his maiestie is so infinite
as wee cannot come neere it: therfore vseth he that similitude, euen for
our rudenesse sake. Therfore when as it is sayd, that God is prouokod
too wrath, it is not for that there is any moodinesse in him: but too
make vs hate the euil, bycause we fyght agenist God in transgressing
his lawe, and that is all one as if wee would prouoke him too anger
through our spytefulnesse. The scripture then meaneth not too make
God subiect too any chaunge, when it sayth, that he is angrie or sorie:
but it leadeth vs too our owne dooings, too the intent that our vyces
should displease vs so much the more, and that we should euen abhorre
them. And heere Saint Paule speaketh not only of Gods anger, but
also sayth, that the holy Ghoste is sorie or greeued. And why? Wee
bee not Gods children (as he speaketh of it in the Epistle too the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,)<note place="margin">Rom. 8. b. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
except his holy Ghoste dwell in vs. For are wee woorthie
by nature, too bee mustered in such aray as too bee fellowes with the
Angells? wee (I say) which are but rottennesse, and moreouer cursed
in Adam, and chyldren of wrath? Howbeeit, God by his holy spirit
calleth vs too this inestimable honour and dignitie of beeing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
so as wee may call vpon him as our father, and haue familiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
vntoo him.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15. &amp; Gala. 4. a. 5.</note> That therfore is doone by the holy Ghoste: and for
the same cause is he called the spirit of adoption: For the inheritance
of heauen belongeth not too vs, but in respect that wee bee Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Wee bee not so of our selues and by nature, as I told you: and
therfore it followeth that it commeth of Gods freebestowed goodnesse.
Now hee sealeth vp all this in our harts by his holy Ghoste: and that
is the cause why it is sayd, that wee haue a mortall bodie. The thing
that is ment heerby, is not only our feete, hands, skin, bone, and flesh:
but that there is a lump of corruption in vs by reason of the dwelling
of sin in vs, which bringeth nothing but death. For haue wee liued
any tyme? wee go away intoo dust and cindre, and there is not that
man which seeth not himself alredye beeseeged with a hundred deaths,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:248"/>
considering the diseases and infirmities wheruntoo wee bee subiect.
Agein, age makes vs to stoope, so as we perceyue a long whyle afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
how we be summoned too come too our graue. Seeing then that
wee perceyue such a number of deathes all at once toogither in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and a much greate dungeon in our soules: how should wee hope
that God would take vs vp intoo his kingdome? But Saint Paule
sayth, that the spirit is lyfe. If there bee but one grayne or one spark
of the spirit of our Lord Iesus Christ in vs: let vs assure our selues
that wee shalbe parttakers of his glorie: for it is sayd, that he is ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
agein from the dead, and hath gotten the vpper hand of it by his
holy spirit. After that maner are wee quickened with him, wayting
till wee bee deliuered from all the corruptible nature that compasseth
vs about. And now S. Paule sayeth, that wee bee sealed by the holy
Ghost,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 22.</note> as is sayd of it, in the first chapter heertoofore, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
besyde, as in the second to the Corinthians. And this similitude
is very fit. For although Gods promises ought to be of sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
&amp; to haue ful credit with vs of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: yit notwithstanding,
such is our misbeeleef, that wee cannot giue credit too them, nor rest
vppon them, till they bee confirmed, and warranted vntoo vs, so as wee
may say, behold, it is euen God himself that speaketh. But what for
that? On the one syde we be forepossessed with distrust: &amp; on the other
syde we be alwayes doubtfull and misgiuing, and cannot rest vpon the
things that are told vs in Gods name. By reason wherof his promises
are alwayes vnauaylable, vntill he print the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our harts, which thing
he dooeth by his holie Ghost. For as a peece of euidence is made au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical
by setting too of the seale: so God warranteth his promises
of our saluation in our harts, by signing and sealing of them there with
his holy spirit. That then is the cause why it is so often sayd, that
Gods spirit sealeth vp the inheritance of our saluation in our harts.
And for the same cause also is he named the earnest penny, in another
place.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 22.</note> For when a bargain is made, although there bee no present
payment seene, yit if an earnest penny bee giuen, the bargayne is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and the chapman cannot say afterward, tush, I repent mee of
my bargayne, and I will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>forsake it: nother can the other say, I fynde
my selfe deceyued and ouerseene, and therfore I will rather keepe my
wares styll: but eche of them is bound, the one too make the money,
and the other too deliuer his wares. Euen so is it sayd, that Gods
spirit is the earnest penny of the lyfe of our soules. And why? For


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:23289:248"/>
(as I sayd) God byndeth himself vntoo vs in respect of our infirmitie,
whertoo wee bee too much inclyned. In deede it is not for that he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs any thing: but wee haue so much the more cause too magnifye
his goodnesse, in that he is so free harted as to bynd himselfe willingly
vntoo vs, wheras he oweth vs not any thing, and vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>safeth too assure
vs of it, bycause he seeth vs so feeble and weake. Lyke as when hee
sweareth: it is not for that he on his owne part needeth too adde any
thing too his single woord: for he himselfe is the truth, and the thing
that commeth of him must not bee doubted of. It myght seeme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the othe which he maketh is superfluous, and that he dooth
but abuse his owne name. (No:) but he dooeth it bycause he seeth vs
weake, and that wee haue neede too bee hild vp many wayes, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
bycause he seeth vs giuen too misbeliefe, and therefore that he
must bee fayne too remedie it. So then, whensoeuer God sweareth,
therin he stoopeth vntoo vs for pitie of our wretchednesse: and the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ratifying of his promyses in vs by his holy spirit, is euen by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is impossible that wee of our selues should beleeue him, and
wee could not bee sure of the thinges that he promiseth vs, to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, and too ouercome all the temptations of the world, vnlesse
he vsed that meane. And therefore wee haue so much the more neede
too beare this text in mynd, where S. Paule sayth, that the holy Ghost
sealeth in our hartes.</p>
               <p>And hereupon wee may gather a good lesson to humble vs withal:
namely, that wee shall neuer yeeld God the chiefe honour that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth
at our handes, except he himself drawe vs too it, and giue vs
grace too discharge it whithall. The thing that he requyreth aboue
all other, is, that his woord haue all authoritie ouer vs, and that wee
yeeld it such reuerence, as he may no sooner speake, but wee shall
by and by answer, Amen: that is too say, as there may bee a ryght
(or full) accord betwixt them. That is the obedience of fayth, which
is the cheef sacrifyze that God requyreth. But contrariwyse, on
our part there is nothing but replying ageinst Gods woord, wee bee
full of lustes: and although wee seeme not too make vtter resistance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
him, and too play the mad bedlems as many doo: yit are wee
giuen to a number of wicked imaginations, as we see, insomuch that
some are as it were frantike, specially when a man speakes too them
of God, for then will they haue their mouth open too spew out their
blasphemies, and too enter into disputation and debate, shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues


<pb facs="tcp:23289:249"/>
vtterly vnwilling too receyue any good doctrine. And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
fall not intoo such furie and outrage, but yit they let slip whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
is sayd too them, &amp; looke what comes in at the one eare, goes out
agein at the other. Howsoeuer the cace stand, nother the one nor the
other doo giue glory vntoo God in receyuing his woord with such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
as they ought too doo. Therefore let vs acknowledge our
owne naughtinesse, and bee sorie for it, seeyng wee prouoke Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
in not yeelding him the honour of thinking him too bee sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
and trew. In deede wee wil not say in open speeche, that his word
is vayne, wee will not accuze him of leasing and deceyt: but yit dooth
he protest that wee doo him as much wrong as that commes too, if
wee credit not his sayings? How long will this people slaunder mee
(sayeth he,) and rob mee of myne honour?<note place="margin">Num. 14. b. 11.</note> It is a complaynt which
he maketh there by Moyses, and in many other places of the scripture.
And surely if Saint Iohns saying bee trew,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. d. 33.</note> namely, that when wee
beleeue God, we set to our seales that he is trew, that is too say, wee
vphold him to be faythfull: then contrariwyse, if we haue not that sure
groundwoorke in our fayth, &amp; that Gods word win not so much at our
handes as too make vs too betake our selues wholly vntoo it without
any gaynsaying: it is all one as if wee counted God a lyer, insomuch
that although wee would hate and abhorre too vtter any such blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
yit dooth he complaine that wee haue doone him the like reproch,
and not without cause. And therfore wee see what frowardnesse there
is in our nature, vntill God remedie it.</p>
               <p>Furthermore wheras he sayeth, that the holy Ghoste sealeth his
promises after that fashyon in our harts: let vs vnderstand that that is
bycause he hath voutsafed too chooze vs. Wee haue seene alredy heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toofore
how he calleth vs too him, and inlyghteneth vs with the truthe
of his Gospell, according too his choozing of vs before wee were
borne, yea and before the making of the world. Therfore let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that Gods spirit is a speciall gift, which is not bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
all men indifferently, but is reserued as a treasure for his children
whom he hath chozen. And for that cause wee ought too beare well in
mynd the foretouched tytle, that he is the spirit of adoption. Also the
vnbeleef which is throughout the whole worlde,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15.</note> giueth an euident
proof of our Gods goodnesse, in that it hath pleazed him too ingraue
his woord in our harts. For it is certeyne that in all such as fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
God, or which bee as brute beasts, and so carelesse that his


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23289:249"/>
woord dooth no whit moue them: wee see what wee bee of nature, and
what wee should bee still, if our Lord for his mercies sake had not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vs with his holy spirit. And so yee see what wee haue too beare
in mynd. Wherfore whensoeuer the doctrine of our saluation is
talked of, let vs beeware that wee presume not any thing vppon our
owne wit and policie: but let vs bee small and lowely, that our Lord
may inlyghten vs by his his holie spirit. And when wee perceyue
that wee haue receyued such grace alredy: let vs not burye it, but let
vs giue the prayse of it too him that deserueth it. And on the contrarie
part, sith wee feele many perplexities, douts, and vnquietnesse, and
that sometymes we bee tossed lyke a ship that is redie too topple ouer,
and too be sunk in the bottom of the the sea: sith we perceyue our selues
too bee so trubbled: let vs consider our owne fraylty, that although
wee haue bin trayned vp in Gods woord, yit will there bee no stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in our harts, except God woork it there: and theruppon let vs
runne too the remedy, and pray God too keepe the seede that he hath
sowen in vs from choking, and the assurednesse of our heritage from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wearing out: that although Satan streyne him self too the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste,
too destroy that which God hath put intoo vs, yit it may bee
strengthened in vs from day to day, as is needfull for vs. And so yee
see what wee haue to beare in mynd in this that Saint Paule sayeth,
that wee be sealed and marked by Gods spirit.</p>
               <p>And now he warneth vs, that it is too heynous a cryme too greeue
him, yea &amp; to intollerable a trecherie. I haue told you alredy, that this
similitude intendeth not to impute any excessiue passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Gods spirit:
but too put vs too shame, and too make the heare too stand vp vpon our
heads. Behold (sayeth Saint Paule), Gods spirit hath chozen his
dwelling place in vs,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. d. 17. &amp; 6. d. 19. &amp; 2. Cor. 6. d. 16.</note> (according as it is sayd in another place, that not
only our soules, but also our bodyes are the temples of the holy Ghoste)
and he is glad too bee in vs, and too abyde there, and too make it his
continuall home: nowe then if wee fall too spyting of him, as though
wee mynded too chace him and banish him from vs, is it not too diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
a dealing? And yit notwithstanding, when wee seeke allurements
of vnthriftinesse, when wee take leaue too corrupt our selues by leaud
and loose talk, and when wee labour too haue other naughtie meanes
too turne vs awaye from the feare of God, and too bring our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
asleepe: it is all one as if wee indeuered of set purpose too chace
away and too banish Gods spirit from vs, and too say, wee will haue


<pb facs="tcp:23289:250"/>
no more acquayntance with him. Must wee not needs be moste mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and cursed creatures, when wee ouershoote our selues so farre?
That then is the thyng that S. Paule had an eye vnto.</p>
               <p>Therefore whensoeuer wee bee tempted vntoo euill, and the diuell
laboreth to make vs take pleasure in it, that all remorse of conscience
maye bee put away: let vs call too mynd the things that are spoken
heere, and say: How now? Thou reioycest: And wherin? In the
seruing of Satan: and on the other syde thou lettest him go that is thy
lyfe, the earnestpenny of thy saluation, and the foundation of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
which hath bin purchaced so deerly for thee by our Lord Iesus
Christ. Let vs thinke aduyzedly vpon this. And moreouer it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein,
that euery faythfull man ought too feele the thing that is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
heere. For if our Lord haue touched vs, and giuen vs the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that is spoken of heere: it will bee a greef vntoo vs when wee bee
tempted vntoo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uill. And so the thing that holdeth vs in awe, is the
spirit which watcheth and wardeth too withstand the enemie. And
if wee go aboue too kill this benefyte, that is too say, this inwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that God giueth vs, it is al one as if wee greeued the holy Ghost.
This then is a most certein experience, and such a one as sheweth vs
that the thing which the holy Ghost hath put intoo vs, is vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
all euill, and that there must needes bee a battell and stryfe
betwixt them, insomnch that none of Gods children can sin, but he
shall by and by bee stirred vp too feare, and too say in himself, Alas,
where shall I become? In what plyght haue I brought my self? what
shall I doo?<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Cor. 7. c. 10. 11.</note> And that is the sorrow that Saint Paule speaketh of,
which wee must not shun. But if wee neuerthelesse go on still in
euill: it is all one as if wee tooke pleasure in dryuing and chacing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Gods spirit. The Prophet Esay sayeth, wee prouoke Gods
spirit too bitternesse,<note place="margin">Esay. 63 c. 10.</note> when wee refuze the good doctrine that he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
afore vs. But S. Paule passeth yit further heere. For in deede
it is a kynd of prouoking God too wrath, when wee yeeld not too his
doctrine, which is a sure record of the care which he hath of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of the loue that he beareth vs. But wee must come too the
considering of euery of vs by himself. God hath voutsafed to ingraue
the beleefe of his Gospell in my hart, too the intent I should bee sure
of my saluation. And how dooth he that: By voutsafing to chooze mee
for his house, and too dwell in mee by his holy spirit. Now then if
I blot out this grace: it is asmuch as if I ment to estraunge my self


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:23289:250"/>
from God wilifully, And therefore let vs beware of such extemitie,
and let vs hold our selues in awe.</p>
               <p>And therewithall let vs marke also how Saint Paule addeth for
the last woord, <hi>that Gods sealing and marking of vs after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by his holy Ghost, is ageinst the day of our redemption.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he sheweth vs, that if wee will well ouercome Satans allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and the lustes of our flesh, and all the temptations of the
world: wee must alwayes mynd the heauenly lyfe that is promysed
vs, and wheruntoo wee ought too trauell. Now then, Gods spirit (sayth
S. Paule) is not giuen vs too bee withdrawen from vs agein when
wee haue once felt his grace and power: but too the intent that the
seale and print of him should abyde with vs euen vntoo the day of our
redemption: that is too say, tyll wee bee delyuered from this transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
lyfe, and from all the miseries wherwith wee bee beseeged. Now
therfore seeyng that God hath giuen vs his holy spirit, too guyde and
gouerne vs both in lyfe and death, and with intent that wee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bee depryued and destitute of him: Let vs looke well too it, that he
may alwayes keepe the possession that he hath taken in vs, and wee
also inioy that inestimable benefite of his continuing with vs for euer,
that he may guide vs, and hold vs alwayes vp by strong hand, duryng
all the course of our life. The cause then why Saint Paule doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
call vs backe too the last day, is too make vs lyue soberly, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
that like as wee haue neede too bee guided throughout by the
power of Gods spirit, so if wee bee depriued of it, and estraunged from
hym, and left destitute of his grace: it is too bee feared, that wee shall
fall intoo a reprobate mynd.</p>
               <p>As touching the day of our redemption, S. Paule by that woord
vnderstoode the happinesse which wee hope for, and which is hidden
from vs as yit. It is trew that wee were redeemed in the person of
our Lord Iesus Christ: but wee inioy not that benefyte as yit. Wee
may well say, Iesus Christ is our Redeemer, that is to say, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vs, and set vs free from the bondage and subiection of death &amp;
sinne wherin wee were, by paying our raunsome, and by makyng our
attonement. Ye see then,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. c. 30.</note> that wee bee redeemed as in respect of the
sonne of God: for he hath performed all that was requisite for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance
and saluation, as he hym selfe auoweth with his own mouth.
But when wee come too our selues, wee fynde not thys redemption
there. And for that cause, as well in thys place, as in the eyght too the


<pb facs="tcp:23289:251"/>
Romanes, Saint Paule sayth, that the last day, wherin Iesus Christ
will appeere, is the day of our saluatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and deliueraunce. And why?
Wee see what a number of miseries beset vs round about: yea wee
carye them with vs, and they bee inclozed in our bodyes and in our
soules. It behoueth vs therfore too seeke a better state, than that which
we see heere.<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. c. 24.</note> And for the same cause is it sayd, that our saluation ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in hope, and that wee hope not for the thing that wee see: but that
God intendeth too feede our hope. And wheras he sheweth not the
things too our eyes which he promiseth, and which it behoueth vs too
wayt for at his hand: it is too the end that although wee bee forlorne
wretches in this world, yit wee should not ceasse too reioyce in him,
knowing that wee shal not bee disappoynted in wayting for the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which he hath purchaced for vs. And so yee see what is ment
by the woord Redemption which is set downe heere. Wherefore let
vs learne too bee so armed and fenced with Gods spirit, too fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
all Satans temptations, as he may neuer fynde vs vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
nor out of order. And that that may bee doone, let vs pray God
so too ingraue his truth in vs by the same spirit, as wee may get vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
by it, and ouercome all that is ageinst our saluation, and that we
continuing in our vocation that God calleth vs too, may take corage
and bee pacient vntyll our Lord Iesus Christ (who is our lyfe) doo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that our lyfe and our full happinesse may also bee manifested in

               <p>And now let vs fall downe before the maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him too take vs too mercy,
and not too impute the great number of our sinnes vntoo vs, whereby

should bee peaceable themselues, but also
procure peace too the vttermost of their
power: and make attonement whereas
was disagreement and stryfe, forasmuch
as it is the marke that our Lorde Iesus
Christ hath giuen vs. Now if we ought
too reconcyle those betweene whom there
was any secret grudge: much more ought
wee too absteyne from all mouing of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.
For what authoritie or meanes shall wee haue too bring them
toogither which are greeued one at another, and too set them at bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
attonement, or too asswage their choler, when they bee moued
with some ouer vehement passion: if wee our selues bee full of stryfe
and trubble, and giuen to crying, roring and storming? So then, not
without cause dooth Saint Paule declare, <hi>that all bitternesse, vvith
testinesse, and anger, and cursed speaking, ought too bee put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
from the faythfull, euen vvith al Spytfulnesse.</hi> For he setteth
downe spytefulnesse heere, as the roote that yeeldeth the frutes which
he speaketh of. And by that woord he meaneth such a Churlishnesse


<pb facs="tcp:23289:252"/>
as maketh euery man too bee giuen too himself, and too drawe alone
without regard of others. For it cannot bee but that the man which
loueth himself ouer much, must needes disdeyne his neyghbours, and
so shake them of, as no gentlenesse can bee gotten at his hand. Then
if wee intend too auoyde stryfe and quarelling, wee must begin at
this poynt of putting away churlishnesse, and considering that God
hath linked vs toogither, indeuer euery man too maynteyne peace and
freendship, &amp; regard those whom God hath so inhonored as too make
them his children, or in leastwyze created after his owne image. That
is for the first poynt.</p>
               <p>Now out of this Spytefulnesse springeth <hi>Bitternesse,</hi> which is,
when wee bee wayward and easye too bee moued, and there reigneth
such a scornfulnesse in vs, as we thinke all the world to be our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and that other folkes are nothing in respect of vs. When
wee bee puffed vp with such pryde, it cannot bee but that wee must
needes bee bitter, and by and by bee out of pacience at the stirring of
euery strawe, if it bee too our mislyking, and take all things in yll
part, and seeke occasions of vnquietnesse. According as wee see a
great number, which are not contented with chafing when any wrong
is doone too themselues: but although the matter touch them not, doo
seeme too bee set as spyes too marke if there bee any thing too checke
at. In deede if a man speake but one word that mislykes them, they wil
not in any wyse be quyeted, but are still fynding fault with euery thing.
And howsoeuer the world go, they must needes bee medling where
they haue nothing too doo: for they bee of so froward a nature, that
they will bee quarelling for the furthest straunger in the world. But
if the matter concerne themselues: though a man labour neuer so much
too please them, and too doo the thing that may content them: yit
will they euer mislyke of somewhat: and if a man aske them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why, there is none other too bee found but their owne cankerde
stomacke, bycause they haue conceyued a rancour, and are puffed
vp with pryde too esteeme their owne selfwill with disdeyne of others.
Wee see then that Saint Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le hath shewed vs heere the trew reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
too hold our selues in awe, that wee may liue peaceably, and
keepe our selues from entering intoo quarels and braules. A Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will not only bid a man beware of the feuer or any other disease:
but he will also consider wheretoo he is inclined, and see what things
may bee ageinst him, and thereuppon say vntoo him, beware of such


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:23289:252"/>
a thing, for surely yee cannot but fall into such a sicknesse or such an
inconuenience, if you take not heed too your self. Now wee would
bee heedie ynough too keepe the orders that are prescribed vs for the
health of our bodies: but when it comes too the soule, euery of vs is
negligent: whereby wee shewe that wee make none account of our
saluation: and that is, bycause we consider not that on the one syde the
diuell laboreth too seduce vs, and wee on the other syde are so frayle,
as wee neuer cease too giue our selues too euill, except our Lord
haue armed and fenced vs with his woord. So much the more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dooth it stand vs on hand, too marke the order that is set downe
heere: which is, that too liue quietly toogither, and too keepe our
selues from contention and stryfe: first, we must not bee blynded with
excessiue loue of our selues, but rather indeuer too rid away all pryde,
that wee may make account of our neyghbours, and liue meekely with
them: for that will restreyne vs from being so bitter and testie in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all things in ill part.</p>
               <p>And hereupon S. Paul telleth vs, that when we be so purged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
both of spytefulnesse &amp; of bitternesse: we must absteyne from <hi>Hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
&amp; from wrath, and from roring.</hi> For here he setteth downe the
suddein heats of choler wherthrough men ouershoote themselues ere
they bee aware of it, and afterward fall intoo rages that cannot bee
stayed. For this cause it behoueth vs too bee mortifyed, for then will
it bee easie too alay the heate yea and euen too quenche it. But when
wee bee so inflamed with wrath, all must needs bee full of thundering,
and there wilbee no measure of our anger. Yee see then that the thing
in effect which wee haue too marke here, is that forasmuch as Gods
children ought too liue in peace and concord: they must, too the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste
of their power brydle all their passions, yea and consider what
commeth of wrath and anger, namely that fyre is kindled, open warre
preclaymed, many woords escape which a man would wish in agein,
and finally therof springeth incurable mischeef. Now then if wee
looke well whertoo all our moodinesse leadeth vs, or rather earyeth vs
away: namely that the diuell taketh possession of vs, and holdeth vs
in the the stocks, and that wee haue nother reason nor stay of our selues
when we be so farre out of pacience: certesse we would stand vpon our
gard, &amp; not giue place to the diuel, as hath bin declared afore. Howbee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
that we may auoyd stryfe &amp; debate, let vs learne to clenze our hartes
of bitternesse and testinesse. And too bring that too passe, let vs


<pb facs="tcp:23289:253"/>
learne too esteeme well of those that are linked vntoo vs, and vntoo
whom also we be bound. Thus yee see in effect how wee ought too put
this text in vre.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as it is a thing as hard to bee kept as any, &amp; a thing
that dooth greatly hinder vs: therfore Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that it
behoueth vs too bee myld, gentle, and courteous one too another.</hi>
Heere he setteth downe the contraries too the bitternesse and spyteful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that he spake of. And he bringeth vs backe too this principle,
that in asmuch as wee bee men, God hath created vs after his owne
image, and that inasmuch as he hath called vs too the beleef of his
Gospell, therby he hath marked vs new agein, and there wee behold
his image, which ought too moue vs too the Gentlenesse wherof he
speaketh. Therfore let vs mark well that we cannot despyze the least
that is, without dishonoring God. For (as I told you afore) all men
are made after his image. Now were it tollerable that an earthly
woorme should esteeme it self so much, and exalt it self so farre as too
set lyght by his maker? Let vs make no excuce in this behalf, for all
that wee can alledge will stand vs in no sted. And (as I sayd) seeing
that God hath inhonored men so hyghly as too giue them so excellent
a nature: it is good reason that wee should yeeld honour and reuerence
too his maiestie, and not tread them vnder foote by whom he represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him self vntoo vs. Agein, if a man consider him self well, shall he
not see his owne nature as it were in a glasse, in all his neyghbours?
(Yis:) For the greatest personages in the worlde, cannot say that
they bee made of any otheer stuffe, than the rest of Adams children
are. Seeing it is so then, what cause haue we too bee so proud as too
disdeyne those that are lyke vs, &amp; are alyed too vs by such a kinred as
cannot be worne out? Howbeit, there is yit a more peculiar reason as
in respect of the faithfull. For in them God hath ingraued his image
new agein, which was as good as defaced by Adams sinne. Then sith
it is so, let vs learne too bee gentle and courteous one too another, and
not too bee so churlish, as no man may haue accesse too vs, nor yit so
straunge and scornefull, as too separate our selues from the common
aray and company of other men. This is the thing that S. Paule
ment by the gentlenesse or courtesie that he spake of.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon he addeth, <hi>Mercifulnesse.</hi> Let vs (sayeth he) haue
compassion one of another. And this compassion stretcheth very farre,
and is as it were the welspring that moueth vs too gentlenesse. Wee


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23289:253"/>
will alwayes graunt that a myld spirit is a singular vertue, and one
without the which wee cannot continew in the world. And how may
it bee mainteyned among vs? The onely meane is this compassion,
that is too say, (the disposition of mynd which causeth vs too thinke)
that when wee see any despyzed person, yit is he our neyghbour, that is
too say, our owne fleshe and bone. Yea, but yit is he dispyzed, nother
hath he any thing too bee esteemed for. Yit notwithstanding, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seryes
that are in him, may also fal vppon mee. Then if wee consider
that: surely our hartes will yirne too see the man that is brought too so
great an afterdeale in respect of others: and whether he be weake of
body, or haue some infirmitie of mynd, it will greeue vs and touch vs
with pitie too rew his cace. And so there would bee no gentlenesse in
vs, if it were not for this compassion. Now then, put the cace there
bee a poore man that is sore diseased, or that droopeth and draggeth
his winges vppon the ground: should hee bee hild scorne of for that?
(No:) but contrariwyse, if wee were not vtterly mercilesse lyke wyld
beastes:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 1. &amp; Coloss. 3. b. 12.</note> surely the very same ought to moue our bowells (as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
teacheth vs:) and too inclyne vs vntoo pitie, at leastwyse if wee
did our dewtie. Agein, if there bee any impediment of wit or mynd:
(as for example, some sillie soule hath much adoo too vnderstand one
saying among a hundred, yea he is not able too discerne whyte from
blacke:) if I haue not compassion of him, what letteth me to do it, but
myne owne crueltie, which maketh mee too forget common kyndnesse
wherby God knitteh vs all toogither? Yee see then, that if wee haue
any droppe of pitie, too keepe vs from reiecting them that are alyed
vntoo vs, and also from disdeyning them in whom there is any cause of
compassion and mercie: wee shall not fayle too bee gentle and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
towardes our neyghbours in all caces and at all tymes. To bee
short, lyke as the myseries which God knoweth too bee in vs, do moue
him too bee mercifull towardes vs: so the myseries that are in our
neyghbours, ought to be as spurres too prick vs and prouoke vs to be
pitifull vntoo them. Yea and there is yit more: that euen their vyces
which inflame vs too choler and anger, ought too minister occasion vntoo
vs too pitie our neyghbours. I see some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man that hath doone
mee wrong: not it is the diuell that hath dryuen him therunto, &amp; the
wretched man dooth but vndoo himself, for he prouoketh God ageinst
him. Now then, if there were no more in mee but the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wheruntoo God hath knit vs all: ought I not too bee sorie at the

which are doone vntoo vs, nother let vs bee so farre prouoked, as
not too pitie those that doo amisse, namely, bycause they bee blynded

                     </gap> Colos. 3 b. 12.</note> is, that too bee gentle, wee must bee pitifull and
haue compassion, as is shewed in the foresayd textes. For there is none
of vs but he would gladly be borne withall: and without that, we could
not tell how too lyue one day in the world. The perfectest man that
is hath yit some infirmitie, insomuch that if men should deale altoogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rigorously with him, he should bee disdeyned, yea and as good as
vtterly disgraced and defaced. Nay further, where is that man too be
found which hath not many infirmities in him, and would not fayne
bee greatly borne withall, (as neede requireth) and that men should
not shake him of, though he haue some vyces that deserue their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
of themselues from him? Now if wee woulde so fayne bee
borne withall our selues: ought not wee also too pitie others? And
soothly when wee see a man hath some blemishe, ought wee not too
thinke, I am subiect too the same? verily when I haue sifted all things
throughly, I shall fynde other things in my selfe, that deserue more
iustly too bee condemned: and yit would I fayne bee borne withall,
though I were neuer so much conuicted. Therfore lyke as wee would
that other men should pardon vs: so let vs learne too pitie other men,
for they bee no more Angels than wee bee. That then is the thing
which S. Paule ment too bring vs too.</p>
               <p>And thereuppon he concludeth, <hi>that vvee should forgiue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
For if compassion go not alwayes afore, surely wee will
not let a pinnes poynt go without examination and rigorous sifting
of it, and without vnmeasurable displeasure, as experience sheweth
in very deede to much. Therfore a body should not stirre a strawe, but
wee would bee out of pacience at it. And why? Bycause there is no
pitie in vs. But if wee bee touched with mercy, surely wee will easly
forgiue, and let many things slip and passe (vnseene): and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
wee wil not bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yghtly moued, but there will bee a brydle too
hold vs backe, and wee will not refuze too admit them alwayes too
freendship, which haue so offended. That therefore is the order which
Saint Paule keepeth too bring vs too charitie, and too maynteyne vs


<pb n="236" facs="tcp:23289:254"/>
in it: for it is the whole summe of this Lesson. Too bee Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(say I), we must loue one another, &amp; be knit toogither in good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
that peace may bee maynteyned among vs. And how is
that possible too bee? For euery man is too much medded too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Agein, their myndes are as farre differing as may bee. Their
manners and conditions also are differing. Too bee short, wee haue
infinite causes too put vs away, and too cut vs of from all company.
And surely if euery man let himselfe looce, Charitie shall neuer take
place, but bee banished farre from vs. What is too bee doone then?
Wee must first rid away all scornfulnesse and pryde (as is sayd afore)
and afterward bee clenzed from bitternesse and frowardnesse, so as
wee fall not too bee cholerike and testie, but euery man brydle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and subdew his owne affections. But this cannot bee doone, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
wee bee gentle and kynd harted, namely bycause wee bee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
fashyoned after the image of God, and knit togither with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable
bond. Yit would not all this suffize, vntyll wee haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
too knowe our owne infirmities, and that euery of vs bee angrie
with himself, bycause he seeth that he hath neede too bee quickned vp,
and that there bee many vyces in himself of the same sort that are in
his neyghbours: and that therefore wee haue neede of this bond too
hold vs fast togither: which will then bee doone, when wee bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
and pitifull. Now if common courtesie ought too moue vs too
succour such as are in necessitie: it ought also too bee of force too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyle
vs.<note place="margin">Luke. 6. c. 36.</note> For when our Lord Iesus exhorteth vs too bee merciful:
it is not only too the intent wee should releeue the hungry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
with meat and drinke, or help vp a man agein that is falne in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
or that wee should succour euery man according too our owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
and the parties neede: our Lord Iesus intendeth not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
Trew it is that all things are comprehended therein: but he
will haue vs specially too shewe mercie, in forgiuing the faultes that
are committed, and not too bee so extreme as too shake of those vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
which are not altoogither too bee commended, or in whom wee
spye many vyces. In deede wee ought not too flatter one another:
for trew freendship will not beare that, bycause it would bee but a
foading of vs too our owne destruction. If a man bee a freend too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and suffer him to ouer come himself with meate and drinke, so
as in the end he killeth himself: is it too be sayd, that his flattering of
him after that manner, and his foading of all his foolish appetytes,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:255"/>
is freendship? (No:) So then, if wee see a poore man at the poynt
too throw himself headlong intoo destruction, wee doo well shew our
selues too bee rather traytors than freendes too him, if wee indeuer
not too plucke him backe.</p>
               <p>The compassion therefore whereuntoo our Lord Iesus exhorteth
vs, is not a rocking of vs asleep in our infirmities through flatterie:
but a holding of our selues in measure, and a tempering of our rigour
in such wyse, as oyle may alwayes bee mingled with our vineger, as
they say. That is in effett the thing whertoo Saint Paule ment too
bring vs. For although euery man doo his best too bee pitiful, so as
he may shew no ouer greate rigour towards his neyghbours: yit is it
as contrarie too our nature as any thing can bee. For (as I haue
sayd alredye) this selfloue of ours dooth so blynd vs, that wee make the
least scapes in the world, too bee heynous sinnes and offences vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable.
By meanes wherof if any man anger vs, too our seeming
his fault ought not in any wyse too bee forgiuen. So then, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall neuer bee found in men, vnlesse they fyght it out too the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
(ageinst their owne affections.) As for single teaching, it wil
not boote in that behalf. Wee haue this (Churlishnesse) so deeply
rooted in our harts, that if wee bee told of our dewtie, it dooth but half
moue vs. For this cause Saint Paule setteth Gods example afore vs
heere, who hath forgiuen vs in his only sonne. And immediatly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he addeth our Lord Iesus Christe, who spared not him self for
our redemption and saluation. The thing then that can breake all
hardnesse in vs, the thing that can mortifye all our excessiue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
the thing that can reclayme all our crueltie, pull downe all our
pryde and loftinesse, and sweeten all our bitternesse, is to haue an eye
too Gods behauing of himselfe towardes vs.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. b. 16.</note> Nowe he hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the world so well, that he hath giuen his only sonne too death for
our sakes. If we compare our selues with God, what a distance is
there betwixt vs? So then, the greatest wrongs that wee can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
imagin (too bee doone vntoo vs:) are nothing in comparison of the
least fault that wee commit ageinst God. For a man cannot deuyze
to break Gods will neuer so little, but the same is an incountering of
his souerein dominion, a violating of his maiestie, and an ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his ryghtuousnesse: which are thinges too precious (too bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzed.
What lyke thing is too bee found in man? can it bee sayd, that
if one haue misuzed vs, it ought too bee esteemed as if a man had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed


<pb n="237" facs="tcp:23289:255"/>
Gods ryghtuousnesse? Now then wee haue iust cause too
condemne our selues, vntill wee serue God as wee ought too doo. And
who dooeth that? Wee bee enemyes too him aforehand, euen from
our moothers womb: and as wee growe in age, so growe wee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
without ceassing in naughtinesse, in all sinfulnesse, and in all
vnryghtuousnesse. And yit for all that, God hath not forborne too
looke mercifully vppon vs: insomuch that the more wretched we were,
the more hath he vttered his infinite mercie, in sending vs his only
sonne. Now if wee consider this: ought not all pryde too bee layd
downe, all bitternesse asswaged, all rebelliousenesse tamed, all spyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
rid out of our harts, and all vntruthe put away? Yis verily.
What is the cause then that wee bee so wayward, and that when heate
hath once caryed vs away, wee ceasse not euen too spurre foreward our
selues, and that wee doo so easly enter intoo contention and stryfe, that
all the house where we bee, must ring of vs? What is the cause here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Euen our owne vnthankfulnesse, for that wee think not vppon
Gods incomprehensible goodnesse towards vs, in that he hath not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his only sonne, notwithstanding that wee were his deadlie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
notwithstanding that wee were at warre with him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that wee were cursed alredy of nature, bycause of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is in vs. But yit notwithstanding all this (as I sayd afore)
it is vnpossible that wee should taste of Gods mercie, except wee bee
touched with compassion, and haue our harts rid cleane of that cursed
affection of reuendge. So then albeeit that Saint Paule haue exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vs too things that are very hard, yea and vtterly repugnant too
mans nature, and which cannot bee brought too passe except God
woork in that behalf: yit notwithstanding the declaration that is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vs heere, ought too preuayle so much with vs, as too make vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
all wrongs. For admit that another man haue offended mee:
what then? Can I try my self ryghtuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and giltlesse, when I shall
come before God? Alas, there are so many iniquities and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in mee, that I should bee confounded a hundred thousand tymes.
Should one fault then which is committed ageinst mee, bee vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
and shall a hundred, yea a whole Million which I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ageinst God, bee nothing? What am I in comparison of that
souerein Maiestie: So then, following this warning of S. Paules,
whensoeuer wee bee moued too impaciencie for any displeasure or
wrong, so as we haue any desire of reuenge: let vs learne, let vs learne


<pb facs="tcp:23289:256"/>
I say, too gather our wittes aboute vs, and too consider what wee bee.
For first of all, if a man haue committed any fault ageinst vs, wee our
selues doo the lyke or farre woorse. On the other syde let vs consider
how God hath redeemed vs, yea and specially by that most precious
pledge of the blud shed of his onely sonne. And haue we deserued that?
Agein, what cause hath moued God too bee so mercifull towardes vs?
Nothing else but our wretchednesse. Now seeing that he which is so
good, and that he beyng not of our nature hath notwithstanding had
compassion of our wretchednesse wherin wee were plundged: what
shall wee doo? Ought not wee too haue much more compassion one of
another, bycause wee fynd the things in our selues which wee pardon
in our neyghbours? God can fynd no infirmities in himselfe: &amp; howe
then shall he bee moued too forgiue vs? Truely euen bycause he is the
welspring of all goodnesse and mercy. But when I see the thing that
greeueth mee in my neyghbour, if I examin well my selfe, I shall fynd
the lyke there, or else much more. Should not all these things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
mee too some compassion, if I forgat not my selfe too much?
The way then too make vs easly forgiue many faultes, and too beare
with many vyces that may mislyke vs in our neyghbours, is, too cast
our eyes vppon the inestimable loue which God hath borne vs in the
person of his sonne.</p>
               <p>And heereuppon wee may conclude, (as I sayde afore) that
if wee were not too vnthankefull, there would bee another manner of
myldnesse among vs than there is, and wee would not so soone fall
out for euery wrong that is doone vs. For ought wee not too thinke
early and late, and day and nyght vppon the fauour that is graunted
vs in our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the daysunne too inlyghten vs?
Should wee be so brutish, as not too consider that he maketh his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
lyght too shyne vppon vs, of purpose too guyde vs too saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And how is that doone but by Gods mercy? Agein, when wee
behold the fauour that God sheweth vs in maynteyning vs in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
lyfe: are wee woorthie too be be found at his cost? No: but all
commeth too vs through our Lord Iesus Christ. Therefore it would
become vs, both sleeping and waking, eating and drinking, in rest
and in labour, and in all things else, too consider alwayes the mercy
that God vseth towardes vs, and too beare it in mynd, and too make
it our continewall exercyze. And specially must this grace come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
before our eyes, when wee pray vntoo God. For what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:23289:256"/>
may wee haue too talke familiarly with him, and too discharge
all our cares and greefes as it were intoo his lap, yea and too call
him our father: if wee bee not called too him through his free bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
goodnesse in our Lord Iesus Christ, and he forgiue vs our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions?
If wee bethinke vs not of all these things, wee bee too
dulheadded and brutish. And heereby it appeereth full well, that we
shall alwayes bee disallowed in bragging our selues too bee Gods
children, and his household folke, and faythfull children, (if wee bee
not willing and glad too forgiue:) wee may well boast of it afore men,
yea and wee may bee had in estimation through a fond opinion: but
yit will God disgrade vs. So then, if wee bee loth too forgiue, our
vnthankefulnesse bewrayeth it self therein, how that wee consider not
the infinite goodnesse of our God as he sheweth it in our Lord Iesus
Christ. That is the thing in effect, whertoo S. Paule intendeth too
bring vs.</p>
               <p>Now he addeth, <hi>that vvee must bee follovvers of God, as vvell
beloued children.</hi> For a man myght yit reply, it is trew that Gods
mercy ought too rauish vs all and too amaze vs, and it is so woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a thing, that all our affections ought too bee fastened vppon it.
But what for that? Are wee able too bee lyke vntoo God? No: for
he is the fountayne of all goodnesse, and wee bee leaud and vntoward:
yea, God hath the full perfection of all goodnesse in him, and there is
not so much as one drop of it in our nature. No maruell then though
we come nothing neere him, ne haue any resemblance or lykenes vnto
him. Such reply (say I) myght men haue made, if S. Paule had not
added this saying, <hi>Bee yee follovvers of God:</hi> that is too say, follow
yee him, let him bee your example or patterne. For although God be
the souerein goodnesse it selfe, and that wee haue not any peece of vs
which tendeth not too euill: yit is it no sufficient excuce for vs, that
wee should therefore bee vtterly ageinst him, for that is a token that
wee belong nothing at all too him. Truely as in respect that wee bee
but onely men, Adams sinne hath so alienated vs from God: that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outof
spring malice, spytefulnesse, pryde, excessiue passions, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
desyre of reuenging: and it separateth vs from God, in whom is
the fulnesse of all goodnesse. Such are wee from our moothers womb
through Adams sinne, as I sayd afore. But yit for all that, must wee
not needes chaunge our kynd, when it pleaseth God too reache vs his
hand, and too gather vs too him, and too knit the things agein in one,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:257"/>
which were scattered asunder? (Yis.) And that is the cause why S.
Paule sayeth, <hi>as Gods deere beloued children.</hi> Heerein he sheweth
that wee shall haue our mouthes shet, vnlesse we answer God in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
by bearing one with another, according also as our Lord Iesus
telleth vs in S. Mathew.<note place="margin">Math. 5. g. 45.</note> Follow your heauenly father (sayeth he,)
which maketh his sonne too shyne both vppon good and bad. For too
say that wee bee Gods children, too call vppon him, too pretend the
name of Christians: and yit in the meane whyle too bee despyzers of
God, and too make as though wee would defye him, by shewing that
wee drawe aloofe from him: is it not vtterly ageinst kynd? (Yis:)
and therefore let no man deceyue himselfe, but let vs consider that wee
bee not onely full of hypocrisie, but also vtterly past shame, when wee
fashion not our selues lyke vntoo God, and yit will needes bee hild and
taken for his children. Trew it is, that too bee so fashyoned lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God, and too resemble him so fully, as one man commeth neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
another, is vnpossible: but yit must wee not bee out of hart for all
that. And soothly wee must call too mynd how the scripture sayeth,
that if wee go on too Godward, although wee bee farre of from the
marke that wee ame at, yit dooth he accept that willingnesse of ours,
when wee keepe our way and indeuer continually too go on forwarde
styll.</p>
               <p>Although wee bee slowe and weake, and although wee trip and
stumble, yit God imputeth none of those faultes vntoo vs, when wee
bee desyrous too fashyon our selues lyke too him. When wee shoote
at that marke, although wee bee farre short or wyde of it, yit dooth
God take it in good woorth, as I sayd. And that ought too giue vs
corage? For if wee should bee dryuen too fashyon our selues lyke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God poynt by poynt in all respectes: alas how could it bee doone?
For euen the very Angels, notwithstanding that there bee nothing
but holinesse in them, and that Gods glorie shyne foorth in them: are
yit farre short from the perfection that is in God. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d what are wee
then, which bee so corrupted and marred, which haue such abundance
of naughtinesse, and which are so plucked back and turned away, by
so many vyces and temptations which Satan trumpeth in our way?
yit haue wee this too reioyce of, that our Lord beareth with vs, and
accepteth all our dooings in good part, so wee keepe on toowardes
him. That is the manner of following him, which is commaunded
vs heere. Trew it is that wee must not in the meane whyle fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23289:257"/>
and say, as many doo: I would fayne be lyke vntoo God, and
then doo but wring their mouth at it: but wee must consider euery
day and euery houre, that wee haue ill profited in the trew rule of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyoning
our selues lyke vntoo God, and theruppon condemne our
selues for it, and thinke thus: I had some good will yisterday, how
is it increaced since? (nothing at all,) but rather to my seeming it is
become colder. After that maner must we quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp our selues, &amp; fyght
ageinst the things that hinder vs, that wee may indeuer too go styll
foreward, and too come neerer and neerer too our marke from whence
wee bee yit so farre of. But howsoeuer wee fare, yit wil not our Lord
fayle too esteeme vs alwayes too bee lyke him, and too bee trew fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of him, if wee willingly and without hipocrisy forgiue them
that haue offended ageinst vs, at leastwyse after his example, who
hath giuen vs a pardon that is farre greater than all the pardons that
can bee gotten at our handes, so as wee beare with the vyces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of our neyghbours, as wee see that he hath borne with vs.
For he myght iustly sinke vs downe too the bottom of hell: and yit he
forbeareth not too adopt vs for his children. Seeing then that he
loueth vs after such a sort, notwithstanding all the vnworthinesse that
is in vs: It is good reason that wee should resemble him in so dooing.
And although wee had no better prerogatiue than our naturall birth:
yit ought wee too knowe that God hath not separated vs asunder. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the wretched Paynims had some vnderstanding heereof. For
they sayd, that mans lyfe is too tend vnto God, and too bee fashyoned
lyke vntoo his image, and that the same is also the full perfection
of all happinesse. And agein, they added that wee cannot resemble
God better in any thing, than in vsing gentlenesse one towardes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and in dooing good, and in being pitifull. So then let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that in asmuch as God hath made vs his welbeloued children,
vs (I say) which were his enemyes, and had nothing but filthinesse in
vs, and were clogged with so many vyces, that we were woorthie too
bee lothed of him, and yit he hath not letted too loue vs, it is good
reason that wee should winke at manie things that myght offende

wherby our Lord Iesus Christ hath reconcyled vs too God his father?
So then, let vs thinke wel vppon all those things.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, too pull vs the more downe, and too breake the
hard hartednesse whertoo wee bee too much inclyned: Saint Paule
sayth, <hi>that he offered a sacrifyze of good sauour vntoo God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
As if he should say, my freends, had you once well weyed the
grace and fauour that is purchaced you by our Lord Iesus Christ, you
would soone beate backe all the wicked affections which make you to
stomack things, and yee would fyght ageinst them vntill yee had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them. And therfore bee kynd harted in bearing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and seeing it hath pleased God too gather vs as it were intoo
one flocke, and that our Lord Iesus Christ dooeth the dewtie of a
shepherd too leade vs toogither, shewe your selues too bee as a flocke
of sheepe, and not as rauening wooles. For somuch then as our Lord
Iesus disdeyneth vs not in any thing, insomuch that he hath made an
offering and sacrifyze of his owne person vntoo God his father, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath wyped out all our sinnes: let it moue vs, and rauish all our
wyts to glorifie God, and too doo homage too our Lord Iesus Christ,
as oft as wee thinke vpon it. And whereas he sayth, that the sacrifize
which was offered by Iesus Christ, was of sweet sent or sauor: therby
he sheweth, that there is nothyng but stynche in vs. Too what ende


<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23289:258"/>
hath he sanctifyed vs? Too ryd away our infections and filthynesse,
which made vs stynkyng and lothly before God: as when Sacrifizes
were offered in the materiall Temple, God sayd, they were of good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
vntoo him: howbeeit, that was in respect of men, who could not
come vntoo God by reason of their sinnes, for that they bee infected
with them, and therfore God must needs haue shunned them. But all
was fulfilled in our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the truthe of the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of the Law. Seeing it is so: let vs vnderstand, that wheras it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> sayd, that the sacrifyze which Iesus Christ offered, was of sweete
sauour before God: it was too put away the rememberaunce of all our
infections, too the intent that when wee appeere before the face of our
God, (as wee must dayly in our prayers and supplications:) our
sinnes may not bee layd too our charge: so that although wee bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
like wretched lepers, so as there is nothing but infection in
vs: yit the same may bee no impediment, but that God may imbrace
vs as ryghtuous and innocent, too bee companions with the Angels,
and fashyoned fully according too his image. And how may that bee
doone? Euen bycause our Lord Iesus Christ will haue all our spots
wyped away, so as wee may come before him with our heads vpryght,
being well assured that he will alwayes make vs fynd the frute of his
mercie which he hath once told vs of.</p>
               <p>Now let vs kneele down before the maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him to make vs so to feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
more &amp; more, as it may draw vs vnto trew repentance, and yit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
wee not dout but that he beareth with vs, too the end
that wee should ask him mercie and forgiuenesse, assuring our selues
that he will heare vs if wee keepe the way that he sheweth vs by his
word, and reforme vs more and more according too his image, so as
wee may giue a trew proof, that as wee call vppon him for our father:
so wee couet nothing else also but too bee his trew children. And so
let vs all say, Anmyghtie God heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as wee see our lyfe is subiect
too many myseries, and assone as we haue
scaped one daunger, another comes in the
necke of it: wee ought too take the better
heede too our selues. Then if a man haue
a care of his lyfe: hee wyll bethinke him
how too fence himselfe both ageinst colde
and ageinst heate, and ageinst all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences:
and agein, he wil take heede
that no mischaunce happen too his house
by making fyre in it, and as he goeth abrode, he is alwayes thinking
vppon the aduersities that are woont too befall men. But wee should
begin at the other ende: namely, that there are a hundred tymes mo
daungers within vs, than wee see without vs. For the diuell hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wyles too wynd vs in, and a number of vyces doo make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
vs. Therfore it standeth vs on hand too watch, or else when we
haue ouercome one vyce, it will bee easye for another too steale vppon
vs, and too take vs vnwares. For he that shall haue absteyned from
open force, shall bee tempted too defraud his neyghbour by couert po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie:
and he that despyzeth the goods of this world, shall haue some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
infirmitie in him. For some bee giuen too whoredome, some too
gluttony and superfluitie, and othersome too gamyng and play. Too
bee short, besydes that euery of vs is dispozed (naturally) too wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sinne: there is not that man which hath not an infynite sort
of enemyes too fyght ageinst. For (as I sayd) wee bee not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned


<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23289:259"/>
too some one euill by nature: but too so great a number, that
euen they which are most vertuous, shall fynd themselues surpryzed at
all handes. And therefore it standeth vs so much the more on hand to
marke the exhortations that are conteyned heere. Saint Paule hath
told vs of many vyces already, and shewed vs the meane too incounter
them and too put them too flyght. Now he addeth whoredome on the
one syde, couetousnesse on the other, and foolishe talke that is full of
vayne bibblebable. Wee would thinke it were ynough for vs too haue
bin warned in one woord, too walke godlily. But (as I haue touched
already) let vs consider a little, on which syde the diuell is woont too
assault men. For when he hath once layd his battrie, if he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
his purpose, he beginneth new agein: and when he hath gyuen
a skirmish on the ryght syde, he commes agein too the lefte, and one
whyle before, and another whyle behind, and alwayes he fyndeth some
gap open intoo vs. That is one thing which wee haue too marke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the exhortations that are made heere.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come too S. Paules speaking of fornication and all
vncleannesse. Forasmuch as it is a vyce that all men doo ouer easly
beare withall in themselues: therefore he warneth vs, that it is not
ynough for euery one of vs too absteyne from actuall whoredome: but
wee m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st also consider, that God in commaunding vs too bee chaste
and vndefyled, meaneth that wee should bee well fenced ageynst all
the intycementes whereby Satan myght beguyle vs. There are then
some kyndes of whoredome or whorishnesse, which are not made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of among men: but yit shall they not fayle too bee condemned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. For this cause S. Paul thought it not ynough too tell vs,
that wee must bee chaste in respeet of our bodyes: but he addeth, that
all vncleannesse or filthinesse ought too bee farre from vs: and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
he matcheth couetousnesse with it. It is trew that they bee two
farre diuerse vices for a whooremonger wyll commonly bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall:
and wheras he had bin well and thriftie before, he will forget
himselfe, so as he will wast away all. S. Paules intent was not too
make articles of difference betweene vyce &amp; vyce, nother was it neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Therefore it was ynough for him too shewe after how many sorts
the diuel might beguile vs, if we kepe not good watch, &amp; shet the gate
ageinst him, &amp; also preuent him, &amp; descry the daungerswherin wee be,
to the end that practyze what he can, he may alwayes fynd vs so gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder the feare of God, as he may haue no entrance vntoo vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:260"/>Moreouer he addeth afterward, <hi>Filthinesse</hi> or vncomlinesse. For
when men take leaue too bee wanton, surely all rebaudrie will haue
full scope. (As for example,) if wantonnesse and other foolish things
bee permitted, as dauncing and such other things, men will say at the
first, that that may well be borne withal, so there be no worse. But let
men once beare and suffer dauncing, masking, mumries, &amp; such other
lyke dung: and out of dout the diuell will haue a fling at them, &amp; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any means bee letted, but that all wil be marde. That is the
cause why Saint Paule in forbidding whoredome, addeth also all
manner of ribaudrie or vnhonestie: And by and by therewithall fond
talk. For a bodie would take it too bee no greate harme, if a man
should iest and dally with a mayd or a wyfe, and prattle of a number of
things. But (as I sayd) they bee all of them allurements of Satan:
and if it bee suffered, it cannot bee but the mayd must bee made a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
though shee were the honestest woman in the world. That in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect
is the thing which wee haue too beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>And he thinks it not ynough too say, that Gods children must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne
fron couetousnesse and whoredome, and from the things that
come neere vntoo them: but too the intent wee may abhorre them all
the more, he sayeth, <hi>Let them not bee once named among you.</hi> It
is not without cause that he sayeth so, for (as I haue sayd alredy, and
as shalbe declared more fully hereafter) as touching couetousnesse, it
wil bee thought too bee a vertew when a man woorketh and scrapeth
toogither on al sydes: O that is a good thriftie fellow: men clap their
handes at him, men soothe him: and although they count him but
as a theefe, and a robber, and a Cutthrote: yit notwithstanding so he
haue goods, euery body will think he dooeth well too maynteine him
self with such as bee in credit. Lo how men are flattered in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse.
And agein, as concerning whoredome, wee see that if
Gods woord cryed not out vppon that vyce continually without ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
it would bee set at libertie, and euery man would dispence with
him self, so as there would bee no more honestie among men. Saint
Paule therfore perceyuing it too bee so hard a thing too keepe men
from them, sayth, that not so much as the very names of them ought
to be suffred to haue their course, but that they ought to be driuen from
among vs. And in deede if there be any plague in a towne, euery man
will keepe him self cloce in his house, and bee afrayd too go abrode
where any perrill is. Too bee short, men wil bee ware ynough too


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23289:260"/>
keepe them selues cloce, that the disease catch them not. Yea and
generall commaundement also shalbee giuen too keepe the streets
cleane, that the aire bee not infected by them, and too take away the
things that may feede or increace the mischeef. But in the meane
whyle, these deadly plagues assayle vs: and yit notwithstanding euery
man holds on his way still, and it should seeme that wee would fayne
bee poysoned with them. Howbeeit this warning ought not too bee
vnprofitable for vs, where Saint Paule forbiddeth vs too name whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Trew it is that that word must needs be in vse still: for Saint
Paule standeth not vppon that Ceremonie.<note place="margin">Exod. 20. b. 14.</note> And in deede God sayeth
expresly in his Lawe,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. b. 18.</note> thou shalt not commit aduoutrie. He thinketh
it not ynough too forbid whoredome: but too the intent wee should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
it the more, hee sheweth vs what an enormitie the breaking of
the fayth betweene man and wyfe is. God then nameth whoredome
in that text, and so dooth Saint Paule name it heere also: and that is
not to contrarie one another: but to do vs to vnderstand, that we should
not talk of it in iest or sport, as men are woont too doo: for that is but a
further inbrewing of men with that vyce, so as they myght not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
it any more. Wee see that when there is talking of all vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and leaue is giuen too vse looce speeche, euery man will giue
him self too it, so as custome will go for lawe, and men will take
whoredome too bee lawf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll. Finally wee haue too mark that Saint
Paules intent was not too speake of the bare names of Whoredome
and Couetousesse: for if a man say too a whoremonger, What? Thou
playest the whoremaister: he will deny it, and say, I did but dally, and
play the wanton. As much will these naughtipacks doo which giue
ouer them selues vntoo it. But there is nother whoremonger nor har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
which abhorreth not the name of whoredome. And why? For
they see it is a filthie thing, and that it is as much as if a man should
set them vppon a scaffold too bee a shame too all the world. Saint
Paule therfore spake not of the bare name of Whoredome. As much
is too bee sayd of the name of Couetousnesse. What talke yee of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse? It sounds ilfauoredly, and no man will be acknowen that
he is atteynted with couetousnesse.</p>
               <p>They will rather make such excuces as these: I haue a charge of
wyfe and children, and why is it not lawfull for mee too seeke suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for them? Agein, should I not haue a care for heereafter, that
I may set them in some good stay? Couetousnesse hath such store of


<pb facs="tcp:23289:261"/>
excuces, that it is colored and vernished with them, and the terme
hath such visors put vppon it, that it is taken welneere for a vertew.
But Saint Paule ment not that men should onely forbeare the bare
names, which myght make the vyces themselues abhorred and hated:
but hee woulde rather that whoredome shoulde bee named as a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
thing, and that men should vnderstande that a whorehunter cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himself of from the bodye of our Lord Iesus Christ, banisheth
himself from the kingdome of heauen, and is cursed before God and
his Angels. Those are things that must be knowen. And agein,
that a Couetous person is an Idolater and forsaketh God, that he is
as a damned soule and a confounder of all ryght and equitie, that he is
possessed of the diuell, and a tormentour too himself. Those are the
things which it standeth vs on hand too knowe, and wherof wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
speake too much. But wee knowe what the manner of them is,
which are desyrous too take all libertie: for all their delyght is too
sharpen their wittes too tell merrie tales, (saying:) I remember mee
of such a thing and such a thing that was doone in my tyme. Yea and
they will not sticke to report what they haue heard of their graundfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
before they themselues were borne intoo the world. And if
there were any ribaudrie or vnthriftinesse in their dooings, that will
they lay open. And top what end? To the end that euery body should
bee desyrous too inquire of such filthinesse. Thus are snares layd too
chatch vs withall, whensoeuer the diuell shal haue wonne so much at
our handes. Yee see then that the things which Saint Paule ment,
are the pleasant tales that are told too make the men merry, too the
intent not only that euery man should delyght in whoredome, and bee
no more ashamed too giue themselues ouer too all leaudnesse: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
take it as a lawfull thing, so as there may be common speeches of
it, and it may bee made a table talke at all feastes, and an ordinarie
communication in the streetes and euery where else. Yea and we see
that such as haue any iorney or trauell, I meane euen the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
cannot solace themselues in their labour without offending God,
by intermingling alwayes of some fond tales. And too what end serue
they? Euen too harden mens hartes, that they may thinke with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
Euery man is at the same poynt: no maruell though lecherye
bee made so heynous a matter: behold how such a man behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and such a one also. And when vyces can once bee made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
then too their seeming the goale is wonne on their syde. Now


<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23289:261"/>
for that cause Saint Paule sayth, that they must not once bee named
among vs. And lykewyse dooth he say of Couetousnesse. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man takes it for a vertewe, if he can pill aud poll all his lyfe long,
and neuer leaue raking of other mens goods too him by fraude and
extorsion. Yea and men haue a delyght too followe them, and too say,
O, such a man of myne acquayntance could well skyll too vse such a
practyze and such a tricke. Trew it is that couetous folkes will not
speake so of them whom they malice. For they will say, that villein?
he dooth nothing else but catch and scrape on all sydes, there is no
trust in him, he is cruel and churlish: and too bee short, euery of them
spyteth at his fellow. And so ye see how the couetous sort do rayle one
vppon another. But when a couetous person intendeth too confirme
himself in his naughtinesse, and too harden himself in it, and too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his faultes: he will say, It is meete that a man should bee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casting:
I knewe such a one and such a one that came foreward by
that meane: he was a poore fellowe, and had nothing: but he hath
behaued himself in such wyse, that he hath hoorded vp well. And
how? Marrie he had good policie, and if any man fell intoo his hands,
he left his heare behind him, if he left not skin and all. Thus doo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
folkes shroud themselues in spoyling men, vnder pretence of
good thriftinesse, as they terme it, that is too say, vnder pilling and
polling, and such other lyke things. Therfore wee see how needfull
this exhortation of S. Paules is, where he sayth, that all vyces must
bee shet out of the doores, and that if any man speake of them we must
abhore him, &amp; not make a iesting matter of them among vs, for feare
least wee bee atteynted with them.</p>
               <p>And wee must marke also that which he addeth of <hi>al vvantonnesse
and folish</hi> (or fond) <hi>talke.</hi> For (as I sayd afore) it is certein that
whoredome must needes growe lawfull among men, when they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
such prouocations and occasions of naughtinesse: for it is all one as
if a man would wilfully giue ouer himselfe too Satan. Therefore let
vs take heede too our selues, and driue the enemie farre from vs, and
let vs bee sure that where such lyghtnesse and leaudnesse haue full
scope, by and by there must needes bee a Brothelrie, or stewes set vp,
not in some one corner of a Citie or towne, but ouer all, so as no place
shall bee cleane, as experience sheweth too much. But yit would not
men bee willing too see it so. Euery man complaynes now adayes,
that there is no more chastitie in the world. And is it any wonder? For


<pb facs="tcp:23289:262"/>
the tyme hath bin that there was some honestie and sobernesse too bee
seene in maryed women: but now they count it a vertew too bee more
than mannish, and too be brazenfaste and vtterly shamelesse. And why?
will men say that a woman is chaste, if shee bee not well tryed? Ho,
no, no. Come who will (sayes shee:) if these roysters fall too dallying
with mee, tush, I can tell well ynough how too send them away, they
shall well fynd to whom they speake, for I wote how to answer them.
Thus will a harlot play the chaste wyfe, as though shee were a mirror
of all honestie: and yit in the meane whyle shee wyll stand at the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryers
lyke a man of armes, ageinst all commers that will holde talke
with hir of leaudnesse and ribauldrie. Now therfore let vs marke well
what S. Paule telleth vs heere. For women haue bin suffered a long
tyme too bee so vnmeasurable bold: and besydes wanton talke, there
are also very garish attyres, that it is very hard too discerne whether
they bee men or women: they must haue euery day new deckings and
trimmings, and euery day some new disguyzed fashyon or other. They
make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great cart wheeles lyke Peacockes tayles, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
passe within three foote of them, but hee shall feele as it were a
wynd myll sayle flasking by him. Agein, they haue their ribauldry
songes myngled with it. Now what chastitie can there bee where it
is so driuen away and banished by force, and on the contrary part, the
trumpets sound on all sydes, that euery body should giue ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
too superfluitie and garishnesse, and seeke nothing else but too
plundge themselues ouer head and eares in it? So then, let vs marke
well, that when there is such disorder both in iestures, and in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and in talke, and in dauncing, and in all lyke fondnesse, and in
all vanities and loocenesse: it is all one as if man should cut trenches
from a riuer too conuey the water too him. For wheras a riuer run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his ordinarie course, if a man cut the streame of, and drawe it on
the other syde, must it not needes haue his course that way? Then if
men fall too corrupting of the world after that fashyon, (as in deede it
is one of the cunning trickes that the diuell hath vsed a long tyme:)
must not all needes go too hauock, and bee vtterly past recouery? Yis:
and therfore let vs marke well what is sayd vntoo vs heere. For when
wee heare these iesters say, What a Gods name: men shall shortly
bee at the poynt that they may not laugh and bee-merrie: dauncyng
is forbydden: it shall not bee lawfull for folke too talke toogither: a
good fellowe may not bee so bold as to come in company with a mans


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23289:262"/>
daughter, too talke vntoo hir of loue matters: if a man doo but speake
too a wyfe, though it bee but in sport, by and by it shall bee turned to a
cryme: and in the ende what will come of it, when there shall bee such
stowrenesse and sternnesse in the world? when men speake after that
maner, it is all one as if they proclaymed themselues too bee the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
proctors and aduocates, too infect and poyson the whole worlde,
that there might be nothing but loocenesse, and that whoredome and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baudrie
myght reigne in such libertie, as men myght no more thinke
it too be sin. That in effect is the thing that we haue to beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>Heerwithall Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>that it becommeth well the
Saincts:</hi> and that is too shewe, that there ought to be no disputing nor
replying: but that vyces should bee condemned sharply. For wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
dooth God call vs? Too that poynt must wee come. Truely if
any man say, men are frayle, and alas if they myght not bee so bold as
too cast their eye asyde too giue a pleasant looke, but they should bee
condemned for it: I say if mans frayltie myght bee construed so, truely
that vyce would eyther bee vtterly lessened, or else made half excuza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But let vs come to our owne state. God knoweth our infirmities:
but he wil not haue vs to welter in them: for he hath voutsafed to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
vs too his seruis. Now let vs see if wee can make these looce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyours
and all these folies, which are but Satans allurements (as
I sayd afore), too agree with the woord Holinesse. What is ment by
holinesse? It is as much too say, as wee must bee sholed out too offer
our selues vntoo God, that he may inioy vs and weeld vs, so as wee
may bee wholly his, and (too bee short) bee no more atteynted and sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
with the filthinesse of the worlde. If Holynesse import all this,
and that it must bee in vs or else wee shal not bee Gods children: it is
not for vs too pleade any more in defence of ribaudrie, that it myght
bee taken but for a lyght fault. Saint Paule therfore bringeth vs
backe too the honour that God dooeth vs: as if he should say, that if it
seeme ouer straunge and hard vntoo vs too refreyne from the vanities
wherin the worlde delyghteth so much, and wherin men think euen
their lyfe too consist, insomuch that the vnbeleeuers thinke not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
too bee alyue, vnlesse they may delyght themselues with foolish
and wanton dalliance, but that they doo but linger and pyne away:
when wee bee prouoked too the lyke things: wee must consider what
honour God hath done vs in voutsafing too dedicate vs too his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
For what are wee by nature? what is there in vs? Euen from


<pb facs="tcp:23289:263"/>
our moothers womb wee bring nothing but disorder, wee bee cursed,
we bee saped in sin, and too bee short, from top too toe there is not any
peece in vs which is not giuen too euill: all our members are instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of sin: nother eyes nor eares, nother mouth, feete, nor hands
are exempted. Forasmuch then as wee bee full of all vncleannesse
through sin, and yit for all that, God hath now plucked vs backe from
it: is it not reason that wee should be dedicated vnto him, seing he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs too holinesse? And ought not this honorable tytle too restreyne
vs, from taking such vnbrydled libertie as euery of vs could fynd in
his hart too take in folowing his owne lusts? Too bee short, Saint
Paule ment too shewe vs heere, how wee may fyght ageinst our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
lusts. For if we follow our own nature, surely though some man be
not inclyned too lecherie, yit shall he haue other vyces: yea &amp; we haue
all vyces in vs, but that we be restreyned by Gods brydle: and yit doth
euery man beguyle him self on his owne behalf. Now what is too bee
doone? Wee must not spare our selues, but rather fight ageinst our
selues. Let vs not bee dismayd though the Diuell bee so suttle, and
wee so tender and so easie too bee soone shaken downe: but let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how God calleth vs too the contrarie. And what is that? Too
be holy in him. The thing therfore that Saint Paule ment too say in
the first place, is that he armeth vs by setting before vs the state wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untoo
God hath voutsafed too call vs through his goodnesse, too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that euery man should gather strength, and not giue any way too
Satan: but that although wee bee sore layd at, yit wee should not yeeld
him the victorie, bycause God hath chozen vs vntoo all clennesse. And
after he hath drawen vs so by gentlenesse, he dooth also set downe an
horrible manace, and which ought too make the heares too stand vp
vppon our heads: and therby wee see how God indeuereth too win vs
too him by all meanes. When he sayeth, You bee Saynts or Holy
ones: therin God vseth sweetnes and gentlenesse, as if he should say,
my children, bethink your selues, for I haue not created you too liue
at alauenture in this worlde, but I haue therwithall adopted you, too
the intent too call you too the heauenly heritage. Now then, seeing
I haue redeemed you with the blud of my sonne, and giuen you my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
too dwell in you, too the end you should bee my temples, and I bee
woorshipped there: will you now go and giue your selues too all leaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
agein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in sted of being my temples, become styes for swyne,
and suffer your affections too bee as dirt and dung too defyle you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:23289:263"/>
and fall too wallowing agein in the myre, after yee haue bin was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and made cleane? If yee will be my children, hold yee in the
plyght that I haue set you. After this maner dooth God proceede
with vs, too drawe vs too him, as though he did (as yee would say)
half flatter vs. And on the other syde, bycause he sees vs cold, and
that wee abuze his pacience, and are not touched too the quicke with
his grace when he vttereth it, but followe still our owne lusts: he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
vs lyke a father who perceyuing his chyld too bee vnruly, and
not of so free disposition as too bee wonne at the first: (sayeth thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him:) Wotest thou what? Though I haue cockered thee and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much at thy hand, yit must thou behaue thy self otherwyse, and
play the good chyld towards mee, or else go too the diuell. If thou wilt
needs continew still in thy naughtinesse, get thee too the gallows: for
I am not a father that will suffer my self too bee so mocked without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
of it. After this maner will a father indeuer too keepe his
chyld in his good fauour if it bee possible: but if he see that it boote not,
he falleth too threatening and chyding of him, and all too breake that
stubborne hart of his, if he can. Euen so dealeth God with vs: and
therin wee see what care he hath of our welfare, as I sayd afore.</p>
               <p>Saint Paule therefore, after he hath told vs that wee bee Saintes:
addeth, <hi>that no couetous person, no lechour, nor no vncleane man
shall enter into the kingdome of God,</hi> nor haue any part of the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that is purchaced for vs. This threatning (as I sayd) ought
too scare vs all, or else wee bee too blockishe. What a thing is it
that wee should bee berefte of Gods kingdome? And by the way wee
must marke well the woordes that he vseth: for he sayth, <hi>that vvee
shal not possesse the kingdome of God and of Christ.</hi> Not that
they be twoo dyuers kingdomes: but too expresse the better how that
inheritance belongeth vntoo vs, namely not by birthryght, nor yit
by our owne purchace, but by free gift. The kingdome of God then is
the heauenly lyfe, and al our whole happinesse. For out of God what
can wee haue but all vnhappynesse? Therefore if wee bee banished
out of Gods kingdome, we must needs be plundged in all miserie. But
it is expresly sayd, too bee the kingdome of Christ: and why? Bycause
it was purchaced vs by his blud, and also bycause wee bee now resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
agein too the state from whence wee were falne in our father A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
Agein, wee knowe that the inheritance is giuen vs in our
Lord Iesus Christ, to the intent that we being his members, and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:264"/>
adopted of God by his meanes, should also bee parttakers of that
which is peculiar too him. In the first too the Hebrewes he is called
the heire of all things: and is that too shell vs vtterly out? No: but
bycause wee cannot otherwyse bee taken for Gods children, but by
being incorporated intoo the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ, to whom
all belongeth. Now then, if wee should bee reiected of God, if wee
should bee cut of from all the benefytes which haue bin purchaced for
vs by our Lord Iesus Christ, &amp; that this should come to passe through
our owne vnthankfulnesse. Alas, should wee not bee too too blockish?
Yea, and for the better expressing thereof Saint Paule vseth the
woord Heritage or Inheritance. As if he should say, if yee were
heires of Gods kingdome from your moothers wombe, consider how
great a greef it ought too be vntoo you too bee set besyde it. But now
vnderstand you, that the kingdome of God is communicated vntoo
you by our Lord Iesus Christ, bycause he hath purchaced it for you,
and made you his brethren and fellowes. And vnderstand yee besides,
that it is bycause God hath adopted you freely: and yit you haue it not
by birthryght, nother can yee say that it is your owne, otherwyze than
by free gift. Now then, seeing it is a state of inheritance: will yee
bee so leaud as to looze such a benefite when it is offered you? Shall
God inuyte you so graciously too his glory, shall he offer you all the
ioy and happynes of the kingdome of heauen, shall he match you with
his owne sonne, and by that meane make you too possesse all the good
things that you can wishe: and shall all this be nothing woorth to you,
but that you will needes hold scorne of it and refuze it? How can Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
so farre ouermayster you? Wee see then how Saint Paule ment
too waken vs heere earnestly by all meanes, too the intent that if wee
cannot bee drawen wholly vntoo God by loue, at leastwyze yit threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
may doo vs some good, and moue vs too yeeld, that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syres
may by that meane be brydled, and our lusts not ouerflow so out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously,
but that sith God sheweth himself our Iudge, wee may at
leastwyze refrayne too resist him: for that is all one as if wee would
openly runne rushing ageinst him. Seeing that he with his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mouth hath auowed vs too bee banished from the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
if wee notwithstanding doo make none account of the thinges
that he telleth vs: what a dealing is that?</p>
               <p>Furthermore whereas Saint Paule sayeth, that nother whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moongers,
nor cuetous men, nor vncleane persons shall enter intoo the


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:23289:264"/>
kingdome of God: he meaneth not that all such as haue offended and
doone amisse, are reiected of God. For who is he that can say, he is
cleere of all the vyces that are reherced heere? But he meaneth the
whoremoongers, couetous persons, and looce liuers that take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in their lustes, and are hardened in them, and are so settled in the
filthinesse of them, as there is not any more feare of God in them too
hold them backe. Wee heare what he sayeth too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. b. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note>
where hauing made a greater beadroll of the same and other vyces,
and hauing first vttered the lyke sentence, telling them that all such as
are giuen too those vyces shall neuer come in the kingdome of God:
he sayeth, and such haue you bin. He sheweth that the faythfull also
had bin steyned with the lyke corruptions. But yee bee washed and
made cleane, (sayeth he) yee bee sanctifyed by Gods holy spirit, and
through the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ. As if he should say, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
yee were miserable, and folke giuen too all leaudnesse. The wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
and desyre that you haue now too serue God, came not of
your selues, but of Gods drawing of you vntoo him, that wheras you
were erst as wyld beastes, he hath brought you vntoo his obedience:
wheras yee were foule and vncleane, he hath washed you with the blud
of our Lord Iesus Christ: and wheras you were vnholy, he hath made
you holy by his holy Ghost. And therfore fall not too wallowing and
plundging of your selues agein intoo vncleannesse. Thus the trew
meaning of those woordes is in effect, that the wicked and such as lead
an awlesse and lawlesse lyfe, that is too say, such as fyght not ageinst
their lustes, but delyght in naughtinesse, shall neuer come in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. For first of all, if the faythfull bee not renewed at their
birth by the spirit of God: they bee steyned with the sinnes wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
mankynd is subiect, yea and wee see some that are wholy giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
them. And albeit that our Lord haue wrought in vs by his holy
spirit: it dooth not therfore followe that wee bee so well reformed at
the first day, as there is no more euill in vs. For wee must bee fayne
too keepe continuall battell through repentance, all our lyfe long. And
repentance should take no place, if wee felt not sinne dwelling styll
within vs. Therfore it suffyzeth that it reigne not in vs, as S. Paule
exhorteth vs in the sixth too the Romanes. There S. Paule telleth
them too whom he speaketh, that if they looke vppon their former life,
they must needes be ashamed, bycause they were so strayed away, that
they had forgotten God and all vertew and honestie. Yee cannot (sayth


<pb facs="tcp:23289:265"/>
he) remember what yee were before yee were conuerted too the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of the Gospell, but yee must needes cast downe your eyes with
great shame. And yit notwithstanding he telleth them, that sinne must
not now reigne in our mortall bodyes, although it dwell there still. In
deede it were too bee wished that there were no sinne dwelling in vs,
and that wee were all lyke the Angels of heauen. But Saint Paule
knowing well that wee cannot atteyne too that so long as wee dwell
in this world, and vntyll wee haue put off our corruption, and bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
of this transitorie lyfe: wylleth vs yit at leastwize, that sinne
should not reigne in vs. So then, although wee bee steyned with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vyces, yit let vs so fyght ageinst them, that they may not become
heynous crymes, as though wee rebelled ageinst God, but continew
onely as infirmities, so as wee beseeche God too forgiue vs them quite
and cleane, acknowledging that wee haue neede too obteyne mercy
dayly, accordingly as it is not without cause that he teacheth vs too
aske forgiuenesse of our sinnes. And so yee see how that saying is too
bee vnderstoode.</p>
               <p>Now furthermore S. Paul addeth (as wee haue seen alredy to the
Galathians) <hi>that couetous folkes are Idolaters.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gala. 5. d. 20.</note> Truely this matter
were well woorthy too bee discoursed more at length,<note place="margin">Colos. 3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 5.</note> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
spoken of it which may not bee spoken agein. Howbeeit foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as in handling the Epistle too the Galathians, I declared there
why S. Paule calleth Couetous folkes Idolaters: it shall suffyze too
touche the pith of the matter in fewe woordes. For as touching other
vyces, they doo in deede make vs too forget God. What are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
lustes of our fleshe euerychone of them, but Idols? for euery
man is haryed away after the things that he desyreth, so as he setteth
all his hart and mynd vppon them, and forgetteth God. Therefore it
may well bee sayd, that all wicked lustes are Idols that impeache the
maiestie of God, and prouoke vs too stryue ageinst him, yea and too
shake of his yoke, and too betake our selues vntoo Satan. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
Couetousnesse is iustly called Idolatry, bycause it is certeyne
that when a man dooth once giue himselfe theruntoo, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etteth his
whole felicitie therin. He is not lyke a Glu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ton, who hath some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
and shame of his naughtinesse: nor lyke a drunkard, a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moonger,
or a blasphemer. For there is yit some shamefastenesse in
them. And why? Bycause they cannot so blynd men, but that they
wyll speake shame of them for it. And although the whole world clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:23289:265"/>
their handes at them, and knew no whit of their leaudnesse: yit
shall they themselues bee inforced too haue some hartbyting. Yee see
then that all such as offend God any other way whatsoeuer it bee, shall
yit bee hild in awe by some feare, and haue some remnant of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
left in them too say, I doo amisse, and how much so euer they soothe
themselues, and fall a sleepe, yea and euen vtterly harden themselues:
yit shall they bee compelled too feele some pricking within. But the
couetous man dooth so reioyce in his doyngs, that he thinkes not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
faultie, nother before God, nor before man: but (which more is)
gloryeth in his wickednesse. For when he hath fleeced one, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
another of his goods, and deceyued one, and snared or intrapped
another: theruppon when he casteth vp his account, he will say, Blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
bee God that hath prospered mee so well. Insomuch that yee shal
heare the greatest Cousiners in the world, say, thanked be God, I haue
made a good hand too day, I haue sped well this moneth, I haue gone
well foreward this yeere. And yit for all that, if they enter intoo their
owne hartes and sift them throughly: they shall fynd there that al was
but theeuerie, extortion, craft, and deceyt. Howbeeit the diuell hath
so stopped their eyes, that they haue no more discretion nor conscience
to say, this is euill done. Forsomuch then as couetous folke are at that
poynt, that they haue no more feare of God too stay them and holde
them backe: therefore are they termed Idolaters. But this is not all
the mischiefe, there is yit a woorse poynt: which is, that they set all
their felicitie in their riches, and doo so forget themselues, as they
thinke there can no harme happen too them, wherthrough they bee
puffed vp with such pryde, that they thrust God a hundred leagues of
from them, as the prouerb sayeth.</p>
               <p>And therfore it is not for nought that Saint Paule exhorteth the
riche men of this world,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. d. 17.</note> not too trust too their goods, nor too exalt
themselues for them. He sayeth that purposely, bycause they haue so
greate opinion of their riches, that they feare not God, but rather vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
forget him. Yee see then that the Couetous folk abuze their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
by setting their whole hart vppon them, (which notwithstanding
is forbidden them,<note place="margin">Psal. 61. c. 11.</note> by the prophet in the Psalme) and by weltring in
such wyse in them, that too their owne seeming they haue their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radyse
heere alreadye. And therefore this cursed disposition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saciable
luste of Couetousnesse,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. b. 10.</note> which maketh all men both drunken
and blynd, is iustly named Idalatrie, and lykewyse all the roote of


<pb facs="tcp:23289:266"/>
all euill, bycause the couetous man seekes alwayes his owne auayles,
and whether it bee by hooke or by crooke, by murther or by treason, by
periurie or by poysoning, or by whatsoeuer meane else, all is one too
him, so he may compasse his desyre. Thence spring so many trubbles
and contentions, and so much bludshed through the world: that some
are poysoned, and othersome haue their throts cut, there is none other
cause but this insatiable gripplenesse of couetousnesse. Trew it is that
Ambition, and whoredome, and such other lyke vyces drawe a sort of
foule inconueniences after them: but yit dooth not that discharge the
couetous sort from being atteynted with the same. So then let vs
mark well, that. S Paule speaking of Couetousnesse, doth iustly say,
that it doth so subdew vs too Satan, as it maketh vs too forget God,
and make vs so brutish, as wee stand no more in feare of God, ne haue
any remorse of conscience, and so puffe vs vp with pryde, as God see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be nothing with vs, but wee yeeld the honor of the liuing God
vnto our gold, siluer, &amp; riches. And that is so rank treason, that there
is good cause why we bee made too abhorre it here, as wee see by that
which the holy Ghost speaketh of it by the mouth of the Apostle.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faults, praying him too make vs feele them
with trew repentance, that being greeued and hartily sorie for them,
wee may so sorrow for our offending of him, and for our straying from
the way of saluation, as wee may seeke nothing but too dedicate
our selues wholly vntoo him, that he may dayly cut of whatsoeuer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
is in vs, and make vs forsake the world, as the end whertoo
wee were redeemed and clenzed by the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ,
and in the meane whyle voutsafe too beare with our infirmities, and
too rid vs of them continually more and more, vntill hee haue taken vs
out of this world, to ioyne vs to himself in all ryghtuousnesse and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
That it may please him too graunt this grace, not only too vs,
but also too all people and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

pityed vs, and that his drawing of vs from the euill wherein we were,
was too the end too chaunge vs, and too make his power and grace
the better knowen by our lyfe, in that it beareth witnesse that wee bee
no more the men that wee were before. That is the cause why Saint
Paul sayth in this text, <hi>Yee vvere once darkenesse, but novv hath
God inlyghtened you.</hi> As if he should say, that wee must not respect

And therefore let them bee as looking glasses vntoo vs, too
behold what a wretchednesse it is for men to followe their owne lustes.
So little then ought the offending and sinning of a multitude, too

men in generall is, vntill God haue drawen them too him. And he
telleth vs there is not any cause at all why wee should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooth our selues
in our vertewes, insomuch that this only speeche of his, where he
sayeth, that wee be darknesse, (that is too say, that there is nother
lyght, reason, nor any gouernement in vs, but rather that wee bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
stark beasts) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught well too make vs all too cast downe our eyes
and too submit our selues with humilitie. In deede many shall haue
some showe of wisdome, and bee commended of the world as well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyzed
men, and as able not only too guyde themselues in their whole
lyfe, but also too counsell (and direct) others. Yit notwithstanding,
God auoweth that in stead of hauing ryght wisdome and reason, wee
bee but brute beastes as in respect of him. Now lyke as this saying
warneth vs to sygh and grone before God: so also doth it prouoke vs
too seeke the remedie that is necessarie for the well ruling of our lyfe,
that is, too suffer God too bee our maister and teacher by his woord,
(as shalbee declared more at length anon) and also too pray him that
his holy spirit may so woork in vs, and that wee may not bee led with
such ouerweening, as too count our selues wyse in our owne conceyt
and fancie. And so yee see in effect what wee haue too remember vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
this streyne, where Saint Paul intytuleth men by a reprochefull
name, saying that they bee darknesse, and that there is nothing but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
brutishnesse in them. And hereof I haue treated alredy in the last
chapter, where Saint Paule shewed, that men discerne nothing, ne go
but too their destructions, vntill such tyme as they bee reformed.</p>
               <p>Now on the contrarie part he sayeth, <hi>Lyght in the Lord,</hi> too shewe


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23289:267"/>
that all the wisedome which wee haue, commeth of a supernaturall
grace, as they terme it, that is too say, wee haue it not by inheritance,
nother can wee father it vppon our selues, but it is altogither of Gods
woorking, and wee must bee linked too our Lord Iesus Christ too bee
parttakers of such a benefyte. For it is not for naught that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sayth,<note place="margin">Esay. 11. a. 2.</note> that Gods spirit was giuen vntoo him too rest vppon him
with full perfection. Therefore let vs learne too distrust our selues,
&amp; to know that all that euer wee can bring of our owne, will stand vs
in no stead, but to turne vs from the way of saluation, and that we haue
no wisedome, except it bee giuen vs of Gods free goodnesse, too the
intent too gather vs vntoo him, and too make vs members of our
Lord Iesus Christ his sonne, who is our trew lyght, as wee shall see
anone.</p>
               <p>Too bee short, it is all one as if S. Paule should saye, that by nature
wee bee but onely darknesse in Adam, and that wee bee inlyghtened
agein in our Lord Iesus Christ. Now (as I sayd afore) it is too the
intent wee should seeke none excuce, by alledging that wee cannot put
off our olde skin, nor vtterly forsake the thinges that are so printed in
vs: (for those shiftes are but tryfling, and they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> passe in account
before God:) but contrariwyse too the intent wee should learne, too
examine well what wee bee, and what our state is, tyll God haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
it, and too consider what wee haue of our owne, namely that
wee bring nothing but cursednesse with vs from our moothers womb:
and therwithall make the grace effectuall which God hath giuen vs,
that it bee not (as yee would say) choked through our vnthankfulnesse
and malice, but that wee consider well to what end our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vs his hand, and shewed himselfe so pitifull towardes vs: namely
that wheras wee were plundged in darknesse, it was his will to bring
vs agein too lyght.</p>
               <p>And wee bee called lyght in the Lord, not onely bycause wee haue
the woord of his Gospell, which is as a burning Cresset too guyde vs
by: but also bycause that he himselfe is as the spirituall Daysonne,
and dooth therewithall inlyghten vs inwardly by Gods spirit. For
wee see by experience, that men fare neuer a whit the better by hauing
their eares beaten with the doctrine of truth: for one may take payne
too teache them, and yit it shalbee but labour lost. Therfore our Lord
must bee fayne too make his sonne shyne, that is too saye, lyke as he
hath commaunded and ordeyned his woord too bee preached vntoo vs:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:268"/>
so also must he giue vs eyes too inioy the same lyght. For though the
sunne shyne neuer so bright in the skye, yit should wee fynd nother frute
nor profit by it, vnlesse wee haue eyes which are as instruments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the lyght that commes from aboue. So must God bee fayne
too giue vs spirituall eyesyght, to conceyue the things that are taught
vs by his woord. Yee see then that the meane how wee become lyght
in the Lord, is, that on the one syde God sheweth vs the way of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the preaching of his woord vntoo vs: and therwithall giueth
vs a new spirit, or mind, too the intent wee should not abyde in the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
wherin all of vs are by nature.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule vttereth his meaning yit better, when he addeth
<hi>that vvee should vvalke as children of lyght.</hi> Nowe wee see that
heere he not onely prayzeth and commendeth Gods grace, too stirre
vs vp too gloryfye him for it, as wee bee bound too doo: but also
therewithall sheweth the vse of it. As if he should say, beware in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wyse that yee thrust not Gods grace vnder foote, ne make it vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylable
vntoo you. For his calling of you too the knowledge of our
Lord Iesus Christ, was too the intent yee should bee wholly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
tod bee brought vntoo this lyght. For if wee would haue the
sunne but onely too stande ydly gazing vppon it lyke folke out of
their wittes, what a thing were that? Wee were better too haue
continuall nyght. But the Sunne must serue vs to apply our selues
too the buzinesse which we haue too doo, and too labour in getting
of our liuing, euery man according too his charge, office, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Yee see then that wee should abuze the sunne, which bringeth
vs so great benefyte, if we should not euery of vs occupie our selues in
the things that wee knowe too bee our dewtie. Now Saint Paule
applyeth this similitude too the spirituall daysonne: that is too wit, too
the doctrine of the Gospell, saying that it shyneth, howbeeit not for vs
too giue our selues too ydle speculations, but too the end wee should
set our hand too the plough, and euery of vs looke wherwith he can
and ought too doo seruice, and theruppon make the lyght auaylable
that is offered him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore Saint Paule in one place calleth vs <hi>Lyght,</hi> and
by and by he addeth, <hi>Chyldren of light.</hi> Both of them come too one
end. But yit is it not for nought that he termeth vs <hi>Lyght.</hi> For
it serueth too expresse the better, that Gods grace is not only offered
vs, but also imprinted in vs, so as wee bee after a sort new shaped by it.


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:23289:268"/>
And it is not only heere that he dooth it,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 15.</note> but also in the Epistle too the
Philippians. Now wee haue too marke first of all, that that tytle
belongeth properly too none but too our Lord Iesus Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

Christ is sufficient of himself alone too giue vs lyght, and that if wee
keepe our selues aloofe from him, we shall fynd nothing but darknesse
nother in heauen, nor in earth, nor in any creature else. For if wee
speake of Gods maiestie, it is aboue all the heauens: yea and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Angels haue no lyght but that which they borrowe of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. And that is the cause why Saint Iohn Baptist is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from that honour,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. a. 8.</note> when he sayth, that he was not the lyght, but
that that dignitie belongeth peculiarly to the sonne of God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyghteneth
all men that come intoo the world. Agein, the Apostles,
and all such as preache Gods truthe are also termed lyght in their
degree,<note place="margin">Math. 5. b. 14.</note> when as it is sayd, yee bee the lyght of the world. Not that
that belongeth properly vntoo them: but bycause God serueth his
own turne by them, when he deliuereth them his word to guyde others
by, and to shew them the way of saluation. Now if he that beareth the
Candle too lyght other men, doo reele and stumble, and stray heere
and there, what a thing is it? Therefore in asmuch as God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs the charge too preache his woord, wee bee warned too walke
in such wyse as euery man may bee edifyed by our lyfe. And yit in the
meane whyle, this is no derogation at all too the honour of our
Lord Iesus Christ: for they that are inlyghtened by him, must not
thrust forth themselues to be fellow and fellow lyke with him: but he
alone must continewe the ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht still, and wee inlyghten one another,
according too Saint Paules saying in the text that I alledged afore,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 15.</note>
where he sayeth thus too all the faythfull: You bee as Lampes bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this world, euen by hauing the woord of God. The lyght
then which the Scripture allotteth, as well too the teachers, as too
them that are taught, is, that all of vs must haue Gods woord, which
must bee as a candle set vp aloft, and our lyues must so ruled thereby,
as the vnbeeleeuers may bee drawen too the fayth and reformed, or
else confounded and put too shame, when they see that our Lordes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of vs too profit in his scoole is not in vayne. And so yee see in
what sense S. Paule sayeth, that wee bee lyght in the Lord, namely
bycause Gods woord ought too bee as a burning Lampe vntoo vs, not


<pb facs="tcp:23289:269"/>
only too guyde our selues by, but also too shewe the way too all such as
otherwyse should go astray.</p>
               <p>Hereunto he addeth, <hi>that vvee bee children of lyght,</hi> to doo vs to
vnderstand, that our lyght commeth from elsewhere than of our selues,
and that wee borrowe it of him that is the lyght of the world,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. b. 12.</note> as I
haue alledged before. According whereuntoo it is sayd, that God
is the father of lyght, and so also dooth the Scripture name him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
our Lord Iesus Christ is the trew lyght,<note place="margin">Iames. 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vntoo vs, and whereby it is his wyll too inlyghten vs. Therefore are

Gods lyght is in vs: namely bycause wee bee members of our Lord
Iesus Christ (as I sayde afore) and communicate with him, and he
guydeth vs by the lyght of his Gospell, and inlyghteneth vs also by
his holy spirit. And forasmuch as our Lord woorketh in vs by fayth,
he dreepeth it intoo vs by measure, as he himselfe thinketh good, as we
haue seene in the fourth Chapter. Howsoeuer the cace stand, let vs
esteeme Gods grace as it is woorthy, and as it deserueth, and therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
turne it too our owne benefyte, that it be not disappoynted through
our rechlesnesse, but that wee may walke, that is too saye, consider
whertoo God hath called vs, and euery of vs imploy and inforce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
theruntoo.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon Saint Paule giues a warning, that the frute of
this lyght is, <hi>Goodnesse, Ryghtuousnessr, and Truthe.</hi> As if he
should say, that he speakes not here after the common fashyon of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but intendeth too bring vs vntoo God, and too shewe vs too what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it serueth vs to be Christians, &amp; which is the trew vse of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that wee haue by the Gospell, and also how the power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoste ought too shewe it self in vs, that is too wit, in the well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of our lyfe. For by these three woords, <hi>Goodnesse, Ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and Holinesse,</hi> he meaneth that wee should not doo any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wrong, but indeuer too liue vpryghtly and faythfully with our
neyghbours, and also bee kynd harted in hauing compassion one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
too beare paciently one with another, and too succour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as neede shall requyre. Trew it is that there are other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisyte
in a Christen mans lyfe: but heere Saint Paule comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all vnder one kynd. As if he should say, my freends, God is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
gracious vntoo vs, in gathering vs vntoo him, wheras wee
were strayed away intoo destruction: and that wheras wee were hild


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:23289:269"/>
in thraldome vnder the tyrannie of the prince of the world,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. e. 31. &amp; 14. d. 30. &amp;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. b. 11.</note> which is
the diuell: he hath set vs free, and made vs members of his only sonne
our Lord Iesus Christ. Lo heere an inestimable benefyte. And now
must wee shewe too what end our Lord hath vsed so greate mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
vs. That (sayeth he) must bee knowen by our lyfe, euen by
walking one with another in all goodnesse: that is too say, that wee
be not cruell as dogges and Cattes, nor giuen too guyle, craft, and
malice, too deceyue and wynd one about another, but go on soundly
and roundly in all things, &amp; deale so vpryghtly as euery of vs indeuer
to yeeld his neyghbour that which is his dew, so as no man be wedded
to his owne profit to greeue others. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our life is once ordered after
this maner, then shall men percey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e that we beare frute in the lyght, &amp;
that the light also beareth fruit in vs, that is to say, that the light which
God hath giuen vs is not ydle, but that lyke as God hath inlyghtened
vs, so wee apply our selues too doo the things that he commaundeth
and appoynteth. That is the cause why Saint Paule speaketh of the
frute of Ryghtuousnesse, according too my former saying, where I
told you that the sunne giueth not lyght to the world, too the intent that
euery man should sit still with his armes folded one within another, or
too the intent wee should bee as the foules that flye in the ayre: but too
serue our turne, by guyding vs in all our dooings. That is the frute
and vse of the Sunne. Therfore the Gospell is not a frutelesse thing,
the woorking of it must shewe it self in our lyfe, that is too wit, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ryghtuous, kynd harted, and faythfull. Now vnder those woords
Saint Paule hath compryzed all things belonging too the twoo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the Law. For (as I told you afore) Charitie serues not too
make vs forget what belongs too Gods seruis, as though that were a
thing of small weyght: but it is the maner of the scripture too send vs
backe too our neyghbours when it speaketh of the seruing of God. For
it is certein that if wee loue our neyghbours as wee ought too doo, and
liue with them according too Gods law, God shall alwayes haue his
cheef ryght. For vntill wee bee ruled vnder his awe, euery of vs will
loue himselfe too much, and desire too drawe too himselfe, and too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in himselfe: and too bee short, there will bee nothing in vs but
Pryde, Uaynglory, Couetousnesse, Crueltie, and al maner of Deceyt,
vntyll our Lord hath brought vs vnder his yoke, and wee bowed our
selues vntoo his obeysance, too honour him and serue him, and to blisse
his holy name. And this shal bee doone when we yeeld men their dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:270"/>
for that is a trew tryall and record that wee feare God.</p>
               <p>And now too shewe vs how wee should liue in the world, S. Paule
setteth downe these three things: namely <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> that is too say,
kynd hartednesse in hauing pitie and compassion vppon such as are
in distresse, too releeue their neede, and too beare paciently with their
infirmities. Thus much concerning the woord <hi>Goodnesse:</hi> Next
that, is <hi>Ryghtuousnesse,</hi> which signifyeth vpright dealing, so as wee
take away no mans goods, nor go about too aduauntage our selues by
the hinderance of our neyghbours, nor bee giuen too pilling and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but (too bee short) be contented with whatsoeuer God giueth vs,
without raking of other mens goods or possessions vntoo vs. Last of
all is added <hi>Truth,</hi> which is contrary too all craftie packing, and too
all leaud practyzes, whereby wee labour too draw other mens goods
too vs. Then haue wee once these three things, it is certein that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
reigneth fully and perfectly in vs. These are the things that we
haue too remember vppon this streyne. Wyll wee then shewe that
our trayning vp in the Gospell hath not bin in vayne, and that wee
haue not forsaken the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ? Let vs liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
and euenly among men: and agein, let vs be kynd harted both
in bearing one with anothers infirmities, and also in succoring them
at their neede: and (finally) let vs bee faythfull, that is too say, let vs
vse no craft nor suttletie, but let vs bee soothfast, and wherin so euer we
haue too deale with others, let them not fynd vs dubble.</p>
               <p>The thing therfore in effect which wee haue too beare in mynd, is
that Gods inlightening of vs, is to the end we should no more plundge
our selues in darknesse, but that when wee haue once taken lyght of
him, wee also should indeuer too giue light too wretched vnbeleeuers;
which wander and reele, and stumble, and are lyke too breake their
neckes, bycause they bee as silly beasts: and no maruell at all, for they
haue no lyght too guyde themselues by. Trew it is that that shall not
excuze them, but that they shall alwayes bee giltie before God: for
their ignorance is matched with malice. But what shall wee on our
syde haue too lay for our selues when wee stray so away, seeyng that
God hath inlyghtened vs by his woord and holy spirit, and knit vs too
our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the daysunne of ryghtuousnesse, as I
haue declared alredie?</p>
               <p>Now hereupon S. Paule telleth vs, that we must trye and examin
what things please God. And this reacheth further than that which he


<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23289:270"/>
hath sayd: for it sheweth vs which is the trew rule, which if wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
wee cannot doo amisse: namely too frame our selues according
too Gods will.<note place="margin">Psal. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 10.</note> And truely we know that the feare of him is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause called the trew wisedome. For wherof commeth it that men
ouershoote themselues intoo all euill,<note place="margin">Prou. 1. a. 7. &amp; 9. c. 10.</note> but bycause they forget God, and
bury the rememberance of his name and maiestie? For they that haue
God in their myndes, shall euer bee restreyned as it were with a bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
Although their fleshe tempt them too euill: yit will they resist,
and consider that as long as they lyue in this worlde, they must spend
their lyfe in his seruice that gaue it them. Then if our myndes bee
vppon God, surely it will arme vs and giue vs strength ageinst all
temptations. And S. Paule sayeth heere, that we must examin well
what things please him: wherin he wakeneth vp our rechlesnesse. For
in the foresayde despyzing of God which I spake of, there are twoo
things. The one is that men fall as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eepe in soothing themselues, and
thinke not that euer they shall come too account, and theruppon doo
rest so soundly, as if it were in vs to make good or euill. And afterward
they fall outrageously too flinging themselues at aladuenture ageinst
God. Therefore it is not ynough for vs not too fyght wilfully ageinst
God, nor too play the wyld beastes, or the (mad) Bulles, which push
euery way with their hornes: that is not ynough: but wee must bee
watchfull in inquyring throughly what is lawfull for vs, that wee may
discerne betweene the things that God permitteth, and the thinges
that he disalloweth. Too bee short, the first thing that Saint Paule
sheweth vs heere, is, hat our lyfe shall neuer be well ordered, vntill it
bee wholly conformable too Gods will. Marke that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Secondly (as I haue told you) wee must not thinke that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth
our carelesnesse, when wee doo (as it were) wilfully shet our
eyes, and are contented too go astray without taking any great heede:
but that it behoueth vs too stand vppon our gard, and too seeke dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
what God alloweth. Those are the twoo poyntes which wee
haue too marke. As touching the first poynt, wee see how men haue
alwayes taken leaue in all ages too followe their owne inuentions,
as they terme them. And soothly it hath euer bin a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb,
that the intent iudgeth men: and it is very trew in part, but men
haue misexpounded it and misconstrewed it. For vnder that presence,
euery man hath imagined that he should bee cleered before God, and
bee taken for ryghtuous, so he had no intent too offend. After that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:271"/>
maner do the Hipocrites weene themselues to do well: and when they
haue inuented a sort of follies &amp; superstitions, they beare themselues on
hand, that God ought too take all in good woorth, bycause they wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them to be good. But God deales not according to our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wee see then, that men did foully beguyle themselues, in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that it was ynough for them too haue a good intent or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as they terme it. And euen therefore is there nothing but hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
confuzion in poperie, bycause they haue forsaken Gods woord,
and regarded not what he bade or forbade, but tooke leaue too doo
some this thing, and some that, as it came in euery mans fancie, and al
vnder colour that men are too bee iudged by their intent. Trew it is
(as I sayd afore) that the intent iudgeth men (in some respect.) For
although wee doo the most commendable woorke that can be deuyzed:
yit shall wee not fayle too bee condemned at Gods hand, if it bee not
doone too the ryght end. If our honest dealing bee but in outward
apparance, too get report that wee bee the henestest men in the world,
and in the meane whyle all our vertuousnesse is but dung and filth
within: it is but a showe of honestie. And why? Bycause our intent
is leaude and crooked. But yit for all this, (as I sayde afore)
wee must not take head too doo whatsoeuer our owne brayne teacheth
vs:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. a. 1. 2.</note> for our cheefe wisedome is to seeke what Gods will is, according
wheruntoo Saint Paule sayeth, it is our reasonable seruice which
God commaundeth vs, and wherin our obedience shalbee well allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But if wee will needes doo all vppon our owne head, God will
reiect it all: for that is not reasonable, it is but trash and trumperie
of Satan. Wherefore let vs marke well what is told vs heere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
is too wit, that wee must not seeke any other difference betweene
good and euill, than by weying it in Gods balance, and not in our
owne, too say, It seemeth too mee, and I thinke it too bee good, and I
will take some taste of it. Let vs beware (I saye) of bringing such
rashnesse with vs, and let vs bee as little children that are newlye
weaned from the teate. Let vs learne of God, and suffer our selues
too bee guyded and gouerned wholly by him. Yee see then that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
is the beginning too serue God well, when as wee bee not
puffed vp and caryed away with ouerweening, nor so rash as too say,
I weene so, I thinke so: (but contrariwyse, too thinke thus:) is this of
God? hath he spoken it by this woord? Although it seemed too bee
the best and excellentest thing in the world: yit notwithstanding; I


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:23289:271"/>
would not fayle too refuze it, if it bee forbidden of God. And that is
the cause why it is expresly sayd,<note place="margin">Deut. 12. a. 8.</note> thou shalt not doo the thing that
seemeth good in thyne owne eyes. And for the same cause are wee
forbidden too bee wyse in our owne conceytes. Only let vs assure
our selues, that too be taught of God, is the infallible wisedome. But
as soone as wee step asyde from that which he sheweth vs, wee bee
but wanderers though wee were the wyzest too outward showe, and
the best esteemed in the world. Too bee short, wee see how all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men can bring of their owne, will stand them in no sted, but onely
too condemne them. And why? There is nothing that can guyde vs
but only Gods will: it is the only rule whereby wee may say, this is
noughtwoorth, or this is good. Now seeing that the diuell hath
gone about too bereeue vs of such a benefyte: it behoueth vs so
much the more too stand vppon our gard, that is too say, too be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and too apply all our wits throughly too the seeking out of Gods
will. Wee be carefull ynough for our temporall profit, for men neuer
(lyghtly) take thing in hand without forecasting wel what may insew.
O (say they) behold, I shall cast my selfe intoo such a daunger: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
this will serue my turne that way, or else this may hinder mee,
or hurt mee. Now then we be heedfull ynough in seeking the things
that belong too this flyghtfull lyfe: but in the meane whyle wee step
forth at aladuenture in seruing God. And although we pretend great
zele in seeking the heauenly lyfe: yit we shew therby that wee make
none account of it, and that all that euer wee doo is but for fashyons
sake, and as it were taskwoorke. Therefore let vs marke well that
men shall not bee so sore condemned, when their rebelling ageinst
God is not wilfully and of set purpose, as when they harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their frowardnesse. Trew it is that men shall doo some
things without looking neerly too them: but yit must they looke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God lyke of them or no. The thing wherin wee must bee wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zest
and best aduyzed, is not too make our owne profit after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the world, which counteth the wylyest folke wyzest, but too get
vs spirituall discretion, too know what things God alloweth, and too
followe the same.</p>
               <p>Now heeruppon he addeth also, <hi>that wee must not haue too doo
with the fruitelesse woorks of darknesse, but rather rebuke them.</hi>
This is not added without greate reason. For although we bee well
dispozed too frame our lyfe according too Gods woord: yit shall wee


<pb facs="tcp:23289:272"/>
bee shouldered from it, if wee learne not too resist all temptations.
Truely although wee sawe no vyces about vs too withdrawe our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from God: yit haue we such store of vyces alredie in vs, that we
must needs haue profited very well in Gods schoole, beefore wee can
bee disposed too submit our selues in true obedience, and to say, Lord
reigne thou ouer vs, and let thyne only will bee our rule. But yit let
vs put the cace, that wee were come so farre foorth, as too feele no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
nor geynsaying in our selues, but that wee could so subdew all
our affections, that they myght after a sort bee ruly: yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the diuell neuer ceasseth too assayle vs on all syds, one whyle by
lyght biekerings, another by vndermyning, and another whyle by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
alarums &amp; open assaults, so as he wil soone ouerwhelm vs, except
we be well fortifyed, &amp; God haue giuen vs inuincible power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
all his pollicies. That is the cause why Saint Paule addeth,
<hi>that wee should not haue too doo with the vnfruteful woorks of
darknesse.</hi> As if he should say, my freends, I knowe well that the
vneazinesse of going vntoo God in this world, wil be as a blocke too
keepe you backe from dooing of your dewtie. And although yee knowe
that God ought too haue the maystrie, and that wee ought too
bee vnder his subiection: yit notwithstanding when yee bee conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with the despyzers of God, and with vnholie persons, it is very
hard for you too walk vncorruptly. For looke how many vyces reigne,
so many infections are there too atteynt you, and it is very hard for
you too scape vnperuerted, lyke as it cannot bee but that wee must
feele some prickings whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we walk among thornes. Forasmuch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as
there is such abundance of corruptions through the whole world, as a
man can scarsly remoue one foote but he shall stumble vppon some euill
or other: It standeth vs on hand too haue greate strength too mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
vs vnimpeached in the seruing of God: or else we must be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urned away fron his obedience. But what for that? There is no
excuce for vs, sayeth Saint Paule. It wil not boote vs too alledge,
Alas, what shall I doo, I that am a poore frayle creature? If God had
set mee alone by my self, I could serue him the better: but I am heere
among so many vyces, that I must needs doo as other men doo: for
some pill, and some poll, some are whoremongers, some are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
and some swearers: and finally I see so much wickednesse, that
it maketh my hart too quake: and seeing I am hemmed in with all
these things, what can I doo in such extremitie? Wee will alledge


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:23289:272"/>
all this geere (say I): but it is in vayne. Wherfore let vs learne too
prepare our selues in such wyse too the seruing of God, as wee may
stand obediently in battell ray too resist all temptations. It is trew
that wee shall haue much adoo too bring it too passe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yit will God
bee strongest, so wee pray him too gouerne vs with his holy spirit.
And that gouernment serueth not only to subdew vs too his dominion:
but also too giue vs victorie ageinst all the things that Satan practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
too ouerthrowe vs. Yee see then that if wee call vppon God and
put our selues to his guyding: it is certein that wee shall haue ynough
too make vs keepe on our way, notwithstanding that this world be ful
of wicked stoppes, too thrust vs out of the way. The thing then which
we haue too reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber vpon this streyne, is, that besyds the good mynd
which wee must haue too submit our selues vntoo God, and besyds the
lowlinesse too accept and receyue whatsoeuer God commaundeth vs,
&amp; too frame our whole lyfe therafter: wee must also be armed to fyght
ageinst all the assaults that Satan maketh ageinst vs, and though we
see the whole world set vppon naughtinesse, wee must not think that
that may serue too diminish our fault before God, but consider that it
is his will too exercyze vs after that fashyon. Yit notwithstanding if
wee call vppon him, and put our whole trust in the working of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit: surely wee shall obteyne victorie ageinst all that euer Satan
can trump in our wayes. And so yee see how wee may ouercome all
things that hinder our seruing of God.</p>
               <p>Finally, S. Paule following still the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imilitude which he brought
in afore, telleth vs that wee must not haue too doo with the woorks of
darknesse. As if he should say, that wee must bee separted from the
vnbeleeuers, and that when wee liue at aladuenture, as though God
had not wrought in vs, &amp; as though his word had done vs no good at al,
it is as much as if we tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pled Iesus Christ vnder our feete, abolished
the frute of his death &amp; passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; defyled his blud, which is the fountaine
of all holinesse? Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h it is so, let vs looke too retyre out of darkenesse,
and not too haue to doo with it in any wyse. And his calling of them
by the name of frutelesse woorks, is too shewe vs, that when wee bee so
mingled with the vnbeleeuers, worldlinges, and despyzers of God:
wee shall receyue but a poore reward, which shall yeeld vs no fruite at
all. What gayne wee then by taking leaue too doo euill, vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that the most part of the world is giuen too wickednesse (nothing)
for all of them must reape the reward of euerlasting death, for follow


<pb facs="tcp:23289:273"/>
one another after that fashyon. Now then let vs looke neerlyer too
our selues: for when men pardon them selues so lyghtly, that they seeke
nothing else but too keepe themselues fast fettered vnder the subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their father Satan, and too cast themselues as it were intoo the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of hell: Alas is it not a wretched libertie? Saint Paule therfore
telleth vs expresly, that wee ought so little too intermeddle our selues
with the corruptions of the world, that wee should rather indeuer too
amend those which take such libertie too doo euill, that they vtterly
ouerthrowe themselues: and that both wee and they ought too bee so
hild in obedience to our God, as his woord and holy spirit may serue
vs as an inuincible power too fyght ageinst all assaults, and that wee
may bee so armed and furnished therwith, as it may bee vntoo vs bothe
a helmet,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. c. 14.</note> and a brestplate, and a harnesse, and a swoord, as wee shall
see heerafter. And let vs beware too walk so in this world, as wee
may serue our God with trew constancie, and not bee turned from him
for any trubbles, impediments, lettes or stoppes that can bee layd in
our way.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too touche vs with such
repentance, as wee may bee sorie for them, and rid them away more
and more, too the strengthening of vs in his feare, and in the keeping
of his holy commaundementes: and the meane season he beare wyth
our infyrmities, vntill wee bee quyte and cleane rid of them: and
make vs too profit from day too day in the doctrine, that is too wit, in
the remission of our sinnes, vntyll wee come too the perfection of his
rightuousnesse and glory. And so let vs all say, Almightie God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue seene this morning, that although
there bee many things in the world too
turne vs away from the seruing of God:
yit must we not therfore swarue as though
that myght serue vs for an excuce. For
there haue bin stumbling blockes in the
world at all tymes: but the remedie for
them is this doctrine, that is too wit, that
Gods children must stande vppon their
gard, that they corrupt not themselues by
companying with the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>beleeuers, bycause God hath sholed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.
And it is not ynough for vs not too bee drunkardes, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
theeues, or murtherers: but wee must also shun all manner
of euill wheresoeuer it bee. In deede wee ought too begin alwayes
at our selues:<note place="margin">Luke. 6. f. 41. 42.</note> for hipocrites will alwayes spye a mote in their neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
eye, and yit beare a great stone in their owne, without feeling
it. But if wee will bee ryght and sound Iudges, let euery man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
himself, and begin there in condemning vyces. Let vs consider
well whether wee our selues bee faultie or no, that wee may first and
formest make our owne indytement before God, by hating the euyll
that is in our selues. Howbeeit wee must also shewe therwithall, that
wee loue God better than the world, and not maynteyne our selues in
fauour and freendship of the wicked, by foading them in their faultes,
and by flattering them. And for that cause S. Paule addeth, that wee
must rather euen rebuke the woorkes which can bring nothing but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cursednesse. And this serueth, not onely too shewe the zeale which
wee haue that God should bee honored: but also too withdrawe sillie
soules that are in the way too destruction, and too bring them backe
agein intoo the way of saluation. Lo heere twoo causes which ought
too moue vs too reproue euill. The one is, that it must irke vs too see
God offended, and men prouoke his wrath by ouerthrowing the order
that he hath set. Seeyng then that God is by that meane despyzed,
and his woord troden vnder foote: it ought too greeue vs, according


<pb facs="tcp:23289:274"/>
too the Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 69. b. 8.</note> where it is sayd, that wee ought too receyue too our
selues the reproches that are offered too God. Also we ought of dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
too haue a care of those that are redeemed with the blud of our Lord
Iesus Christ. If wee see the soules go too damnation which did cost
God so deere, and make no reckening of it: it is a scorning of the blud
of our Lord Iesus Christ. And euen for that cause also dooth S. Paule
tell vs, that inasmuch as wee bee separated from euill, too the intent
wee should not be companions of such as despyze God, nor in any wise
bee lyke them: wee must too the vttermost of our power shew, that we
hate them, to the end that they beyng by that meanes ashamed of their
leaudnesse, may bee touched with repentance. If wee haue once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
so farre: it shall bee a great gayne too haue drawen backe a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
soule that was in the way too destruction. And after the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
speaketh Saint Iames of it, exhorting vs too doo it, saying: The
thing that you shall gayne by it,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. d. 20.</note> is, that you shall saue a soule from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.
And although men bee hardened in their sinnes: yit is it too
great purpose for vs too shew the zeale that we haue of honoring God,
and that his woord should not bee so impeached, nor the order broken
which he hath set, without declaring that the same displeazeth vs. For
if a man will bee knowen too bee a good and faythfull subiect, he will
not suffer any man too speake euill of his Prince, without setting of
himselfe ageinst him. (Lykewise,) that chylde shall bee taken for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
and vnhonest, which heareth his father wrougfully <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lamed and
defaced, and maynteyneth not his honour or honestie.</p>
               <p>Now, is not God our souerein prince? Yis: and although wee bee
but wretched woormes of the earth, and vyle caryons: yit dooeth he
the honour vntoo vs too adopt vs for his children. Now then, if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and heathenish folk deface his maiestie, and darken his ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
yea and indeuer too plucke his dominion from him, and wee
dissemble at it: is it not too excessiue and intollerable a leaudnesse?
Therfore let vs mark well what is told vs heere. For it standeth vs
so much the more on hand too mark this text, bycause this vyce hath
reigned in the world in all ages: namely that according as euery man
is more or lesse desyrous too be flatttered, so dothe he the eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yer beare
with other men, not after the maner which wee haue seene heertofore,
which is that wee ought too haue compassion of such as are weake,
and too vse pacience towards them: but cleane contrariwyse, that is
too wit, that wee bee contented too feede the euill, and too enter conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:23289:274"/>
into a willing confederacie toogither: and too the intent that
other men should not sift vs too narrowly in our vyces, but let vs alone
too doo what wee list, wee giue euery man leaue too take lyke libertie
too him self. And that is the cause why all things are out of order
now adayes in the world. Agein, wee bee loth too prouoke any
mans displeazure ageinst vs, insomuch that we had leuer betray God,
and too betray our neyghbours bothe bodie and soule, than too vse the
libertie that Gods spirit commaundeth vs. Wee see a wretched man
play the naughtipacke: let him follow his owne swindge, (say wee:)
it maks no matter too vs. And why? for wee wil not discontent him.
Agein, we see othersome peruert all order of Iustice, and infect the
whole people and countrie. And wee passe it ouer easly without spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ageinst it. And why? O I will not bring my self in displeasure
with a man of authoritie. Let some other bodie leade the daunce, and
I will willingly say, Amen too it. And if he were hanged on a Iebet
a whyle, he had but his desert. But no Godhamercie too mee in the
meane whyle. For why? I will not go put myself in any hazard (for
the matter.) Thus are vyces passed ouer nowadayes. But yit will
not God giue ouer his ryght for all that. For the sayd sentence shall
stand inuiolable on his behalf, and according too the same shall wee be
condemned as full of treason, that is too wit, wee shalbee hild for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of the wicked, if wee play the blynd and deaf (beasts) when
wee should restreyne naughtinesse by setting of our selues ageinst it,
and (as much as in vs lyeth) doo suffer Gods honour too bee so abaced,
as all honestie is ouerthrowen, and wee say nothing too it. Therfore
ought wee too bee the more attentyue too this warning too rebuke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and (as I sayd afore) by shewing (too the vttermost of our power)
that wee mislyke of it, and also by being diligent too let it, if it lye in
our power too doo it. If euery man imployed him self after this sort,
surely wee should see another maner of soundnesse in the world. For
what is the cause that Gods name is so much blasphemed? It is for
that the blasphemies are cloked, and euery man had leuer too defyle
him self with other mens leaudnesse, than too purchace any disfauour
or mislyking, as they say. In lyke cace is it with drunkennesse, leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
robberie, and all extorsions and wanton dooings that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But had wee the zele that is commaunded vs heere by Saint
Paule: surely wee should be much more corageous and stout in rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such as doo amisse. On the other syde also wee shewe our selues


<pb facs="tcp:23289:275"/>
too haue no loue nor kyndnesse among vs, when wee suffer good men
too bee trampled vnder foote and misuzed, for wee ought too reache

               <p>Now S. Paule hauing spoken so, addeth to confirme the same doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
and too quicken vp the slothfulnesse that is in vs, <hi>that the cause

                     </gap>eleeuers take libertie too doo such euill, euen as they
bee ashamed too speake of, is for that they can hyde themselues</hi>
(from men.) And why? For they haue no feare of God: and therefore
they take themselues too bee well hydden. When a theese per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyues
no body neere him, he rifleth cubboordes, he breakes open
doores, he filcheth, and he catcheth and caryeth away. Uery well, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he cannot yit bee conuicted afore a iudge, he beares himselfe on
hand, that he is scaped quyte and cleane. If a Robber or a murtherer
get intoo some blynd nooke, he thinkes himselfe well hidden, and if he
finde a man astray, hee pulles him too hym, and strippes him, and
woundeth him, yea and cutes his throte too, if he cannot otherwise
mayster hym, and hee thinkes himselfe well escaped, bycause no
man sees him. In lyke cace is it with all other deeds: for wee bee
more ashamed of men, than afrayd of God. The scripture cryes out,
that all our thoughts must come to account, and that not only our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
deeds shalbe punished,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> but also euen the things that wee thought
too haue bin buryed. For at the last day the books shalbee layd open,
that is too say, nothing shall bee forgotten, except wee haue obteyned
this grace that is promised in the Psalme, namely that God forgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

not put too shame for it before men, let God doo what he will. For
they bee growne so brutishe, that they cannot wake, too consider what
it is too harden their hartes ageinst the souereine Maiestie of God.
Therefore when the vnbeleeuers and despyzers of God, get couert and
lurking holes after that sort, there is so vyle lycentiousnesse among
them, as a man would bee ashamed too thinke what they doo and
say.</p>
               <p>But Saint Paul addeth, <hi>that vvhen they bee rebuked, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef
is discouered,</hi> and their libertie cut of, bycause it is a brydle


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:23289:275"/>
too them. Not only bycause they bee blamed afore men, but also
bycause they feele themselues too haue too doo with the heauenly
Iudge, and that it is a dreadfull thing too fall intoo his handes. Too
bee short, Saint Paule ment too shewe too what purpoze rebuking
may serue, when wee vse it ryghtly and with good zele of charitie.
Now I haue told you alredie, that wee must not vse any hipocrisie,
nor iustifye our selues by condemning other men. But when euery of
vs hath well examined his owne lyfe, and hateth the vyces wheretoo
wee bee subiect, and wherein wee bee wrapped: let vs indeuer too
bring our selues home vntoo God, praying him too strengthen vs so
by the power of his holy spirit, as wee may stryue too frame our selues
according too his will and ryghtuousnesse. And that doone, let vs
not flatter such as doo amisse, but let vs tell them freely the thing
that may doo them good. The profyt that will come thereof (sayeth
Saint Paule) is that God shall not bee so greeuously offended as
wee see he is: and moreouer whereas men were past shame afore, they
may by that meane bee brought too some honestie, and whereas it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
too them that they had leaue too doo all manner of euill: they shal
repent themselues, and drawe others too repentance with them. But
much more ought this (that followeth) too moue vs. For too say, that
wee should line in this world, and inioy the infinite benefytes that God
bestowed vppon vs, and in the meane whyle suffer his authoritie too
bee defaced, euen when it may seeme that men would plucke him out
of his seate by blaspheming his holy name: when men shall prouoke
him too anger, and wee let all slip: must wee not needes bee arrant
villeins and traytors? If wee were found at some mans cost, and one
should rayle vppon him in his owne house, or practize too murther
him, or robbe him of his goods, or defyle his wyfe, or intyce his chyld
too naughtinesse: and wee in the meane whyle should sit cramming of
our selues, and eate of his bread and drinke of his wyne, and (too bee
short) bee fed and maynteyned at his charges, (and yit let all alone,
and say nothing too it:) should wee not deserue too bee stoned, and
too haue all men too spit in our faces? Yis certeynly: for the vyce of
vnthankfulnesse shall alwayes bee condemned, euen among men.
Now if wee bee so much bound vntoo a mortall man, as too mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
his honour and honestie, when wee bee found of his free cost:
what ought wee too doo for our God? Are wee not in his house as long
as wee liue in this world? Haue wee so much as one droppe of water


<pb facs="tcp:23289:276"/>
but only of his goodnesse and liberalitie? Behold, God hath a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
care of vs: and yit notwithstanding wee suffer his name too bee
blasphemed, his maiestie to be bereft and spoyled of al reuerence, his
woord too bee torne in peeces, all order (that he hath commaunded)
too bee broken, the Church (which is his wyfe) too bee corrupted and
misuzed, and his children too bee intyced too naughtinesse: and in
the meane whyle wee play mum bowget. I would fayne knowe of
you, whether such silence doo not sufficiently shew, that wee bee not
woorthie too eate one bit of bread, nor too bee counted in the number
of earth woormes, Lyce, Cimies, and other of the vylest and filthyest
things of the world? Therefore let vs thinke well vppon it, that wee
shalbee found giltie of the despyzing of Gods maiestie, (as wee see)
bycause wee rebuke not mens vyces. That is a cause why the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and heathenish sort waxe the bolder, and thinke the world to runne
on wheeles on their syde, and tryumph in their despyzing of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that fashyon: it commeth partly of our silence. And that is the
thing which S. Paule ment too shewe vs heere.</p>
               <p>It followeth moreouer, that the wretched soules whom our Lord
Iesus Christ hath bought so deerly, that he spared not himself to haue
saued them, doo perish, and are giuen intoo Satans possession through
our sufferance: and in the meane whyle wee make none account at all
of it. Now then, doo wee not therein bewray that wee haue not so
much as one drop of charitie in vs? Yis: and that is the cause why
I sayde, that (in so dooing) wee bee traytours too God and too our
neyghbours. For when wee haue no better zeale towards Gods name,
nor better care of our neyghbours welfare, doth not the world see eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way that wee bee full of crueltie and vnkyndnesse? Of crueltie I
meane towardes men, in that wee suffer them too perish, euen know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and looking vppon it: and of vnkyndnesse towardes God, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee yeeld him not such honour as he deserueth, when wee haue
not the corage too shewe, that at leastwyse wee mislyke that men
should so derogate Gods authortie, and the reuerence which they owe
too him. Therefore whensoeuer wee bee afrayd too prouoke mens
displeazure, or too purchace their ill will, let vs thinke vppon the
thing that is told vs heere: namely that wee ought at leastwyse too
feare the Lord, whose wee bee, and that seeyng wee bee fed at his cost,
wee must not abyde too see such leaudnesse committed ageinst him,
without shewing (as much as is possible, and too the vttermost of our


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23289:276"/>
power and abilitie) that wee doo vtterly abhorre such things: I say, as
farre as wee can: for some tymes our mouthes shall bee so shet, as wee
shall bee able too doo no more but sigh and lament at such vtter disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when men become lyke diuels that are let looce, in flinging out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
furiousnesse ageinst God, and they that beare the swoord seeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but too make a confuzed medly, too the intent that all goodnesse
may be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For then (as I sayd) we haue none other remedie, but
too bee sorie for it, according as it is sayd of Loth, that it greeued his
hart too bee in Sodome.<note place="margin">2. Pot. 1 b. 8.</note> Therefore let vs not forbeare, but let euery
of vs prouoke himselfe too greefe and sorowe, when wee see things so
out of order, and let vs gyue recorde of it, as farre as it may doo
good.</p>
               <p>Agein, if there be any hope for vs to win those that are so vnruly: let
vs continually assay too draw them too repentance, yea, let vs streyne
our selues too it. For many men alledge this prouerbe too lyghtly,
that a man must not cast perles among swyne. And they beare them
selues on hand, that men are swyne, before they haue tryed what they
bee. Though they haue bin of lyght behauiour, yea, or euen looce and
lawlesse, so as the diuell hath after a sort caryed them away: yit must
wee labour too win them agein,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. c. 7.</note> and haue good hope of it, according
too Saint Paules saying, that Charitie hopeth well of all things. So
then, vntill such tyme as men shewe themselues vtterly wilfull in euil,
and that their diseases appeere too bee vtterly vncurable, let vs inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too bee good Phisitions too them, by the aduyzements that God
shall put intoo our mouth. And so yee see what S. Paule intended, in
saying, that the vnbeleeuers thinke themselues too bee hidden, when
they bee not perceyued nor rebuked, and that when they bee let go at
rouers, they bee as it were in the darke, and theruppon conceyue the
more boldnesse too doo wickedly.</p>
               <p>But wee bee partly the cause of it, and we cannot wash our handes
of it: for God setteth vs in his roome in that behalfe, and giueth vs
his woord, which hath authoritie too condemne euyll, and yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all is suppressed and thrust vnder foote. Marke that for one
poynt. But on the contrarie part, when the wickeddest men in the
world bee rebuked, then perceyue they their shame, whereas before,
they discerned not whyte from blacke. And why? For if a man bee
in the darke, he seeth nothing at all, but staggereth and stumbleth: and
though he bee neuer so much berayed, yit he perceyueth it not. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:23289:277"/>
when Gods woord is set afore men, and we shewe offenders their
faultes with such libertie as is requisite: it is as much as if wee shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them a glasse, (and sayd too them.) See what thou art, thou art as
fowle and filthie as may bee: art thou not ashamed too see thy selfe?
go washe thy muzzle. So then, warnings will alwayes win thus
much, howbeeit not alyke with all men: for (as I sayde afore) many
are hardened, so as Satan possesseth them, and God hath giuen them
vp too such a wilfull stubborne mynd, that they bee past all shame. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
whensoeuer any faythfull man dooth his dewtie, it wyll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
doo good, and some profit will come of it, insomuch that they
which were erst as wood beastes, or as wyld bullockes, will returne,
and a man shall see some honestie in them. Therefore let vs win that
poynt, if it bee possible for vs, or at leastwyse let vs streyne our selues
too win it. And so yee see what we haue too gather vpon those wordes
of Saint Paule.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the woord <hi>Rebuke:</hi> it signifyeth properly too
discouer the thing that was hyd. And he allotteth this office vntoo
preaching, according wheruntoo he taunteth the vaynglorie that reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Churche of Corinth,<note place="margin">

too the intent too bee commended, and that men myght say of him,
This man is a greate Clerk, this man can speake all languages: and
yit in the meane whyle there was no edifying at all. Lykewyse in these
dayes, in the popedome the Organes are pyping at one syde, and there
is chaunting of fower parts on the other syde, and there is such store of
gewgawes, that the simyle people are rauished, but neuer a whit edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed.
But Saint Paule sayeth, that when wee bee come togither in
the name of God, wee must indeuer too fare the better by it. And how
may that bee? It is (s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yeth he) when good men, and such as are alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
inured too feare &amp; serue God, are edifyed by his woord. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that, but also if an vnbeleeuer comes in, which was erst a mocker,
and neuer had any remorse of conscience, and heare what is vttered in
the name of God, (that is too wit, that wee cannot scape (Gods hand,)
but must needs come before the iudgment seate of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and how deerly Iesus Christ hath payed for vs, and what a
trayterousnesse it is for vs too make the sacrifyze of his death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
vnauaylable:) I say, when an vnbeleeur heares all this, and
that wee bee exhorted too feare God, and stirred vp too loue him for
the infinite grace which he vttereth towards vs: Although he were


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:23289:277"/>
erst as a brute beast (sayth S. Paul) yit shal he enter into himself &amp; bee
rebuked. For he vseth there the same woord which he vseth heere, the
meaning wherof is,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. d. 24.</note> that wheras his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science was as good as dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and he in maner brutish: he was inforced too enter into examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him self, and too bee ashamed, so as he could not but giue glorie
vntoo God. Not that this befalleth too all indifferently: but wee see
that a number of folk which were gone astray, and had forgotten God,
and had no regard at all of their owne soule helth, shalbee so touched at
one sermon, that they appeere too bee chaunged all their lyfe after.
Now looke what is doone in common assembly: the same ought euery
man too practyze by him self. For we bee not heere too the intent that
euery man should profit him self only: but too the intent wee should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
teache one another with mutuall instruction. After that maner must
wee rebuke offenders, too the end they may take no more libertie too
mocke God after that fashyon, nor to shake of his yoke, and to wander
into all naughtinesse. And that is in effect the thing that Saint Paule
intended too shewe vs heere.</p>
               <p>Now too confirme this doctrine the better, he addeth yit one other
reason: <hi>It is the lyght</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>that layeth all things open.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toofore
he tolde vs,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. c. 8.</note> that when wee bee once inlyghtened by Gods
spirit and Gospell, wee must bee as lampes too giue lyght intoo the
world. For wee haue the woord of lyfe, which serueth, not only too
guyde vs, but also too drawe them intoo the ryght way, which haue
gone astray. Going forward herewithall, he sayth, that it is the nature
and propertie of lyght too discouer. And therfore when wee suffer
naughtinesse to nestle and to grow still deeper and deeper in huthther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muthther;
we shew well that we be nother lyght, nor children of the
lyght, that is too say, that wee belong not awhit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nother too God, nor
too Iesus Christ. Too be short, Saint Paule meaneth that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
giue any proof of our christianitie nor of our fayth, but by hating
and abhorring of euill, as much as is possible, that it may not haue
his full course and sway. But now let vs think vppon our selues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein.
For (as I sayd) there is none of vs all which is not faultie in
fearing men more than God, and in winking at others, to the end that
they shoulde wink at vs, and not bee inquisityue of our dooings. Lo
how wee betray one another by our silence. But there is yit another
vyce that is woorse and further cut of dsquare: namely that besyos our
dissembling, wee doo also help too feede the euill. And so by that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:278"/>
meanes whoredome hath his ful scope, bycause euery man and woman
playes the baude. Wheras I say, euery one, I meane, that most men &amp;
women now adayes doo wink at al maner of leaudnesse and misorder,
and stoppe their eares at the things which they myght well heare, and
euery man seeks too conceale his fellowes leaudnesse, men of mens,
and women of womens. They myght remedie a greate sort of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that are committed: but they will rather go and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eray their
Gownes and Cotes with other folkes dung and filthinesse, than disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
their vyces. Too bee short, euery body playes the bawd in effect,
by concealing his neyghbours vyce, too the end that the other shoulde
doo as much for him. In lyke cace is it with all other sinnes. Yit
notwithstanding (as I sayd afore) God hath not spoken this in vaine,
but wee shall one day feele the execution of the sentence which he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heere by his Apostle, and then will it bee too late too forethinke
vs of that which wee will not knowe now. But let such as feare God
learne and remember how it is sayd heere, that Gods inlyghtening of
vs, is too the end that euery of vs should examine himselfe, and not bee
as blynd wretches, groping in the dark, which stu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble on the one syde,
&amp; runne ageinst things on the other, but that we should know the way
of saluation: and moreouer teache other men also, by discouering the
euyll that lay hidden, too the end that such as haue turned their backes
vppon God, and were well appayd too haue bin in darkenesse styll,
may vnderstand that they must bee fayne too come too the lyght, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
come of it. The very way therefore for vs too shewe in deede
and in good earnest, that wee belong too God, and are inlyghtened by
his holy spirit and by his woord, is too discouer thinges which should
else as it were lye lurking a long tyme, if wee drew them not forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
the lyght. Trew it is that Charitie couereth a multitude of sinnes
(as sayeth Salomon) and that it behoueth vs too bee pacient,<note place="margin">Prou. 10. b. 12.</note> and too
beare with many infirmities. For it is not meete that wee should dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
one another,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. b. 8.</note> as diuerse do, who in stead of warning those whom
they see too offend, fall too sowing abrode of newes, so as the streetes
and the market places are all full of them, yea, and they do so inhaunce
the matter, that of small scapes they make deadly crymes.</p>
               <p>Therefore when Saint Paule biddeth vs discouer men, it is not
ment that wee should defame one another after that manner: but that
the wretched man which had his eyes blyndfolded by Satan, should
bee made too perceyue his owne miserie and naughtinesse, that he


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:23289:278"/>
myght bee ashamed of it: and that the woman which had giuen ouer
hir self too all vnchastitie, myght bee made too recouer some honestie,
and too returne agein intoo the ryght way, by being put too shame
in hauing hir faultes and vyces layd afore hir. The manner then of
discouering, is not too backebyte one another, or too taunt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayd
one another by this and that, and too play the hipocrytes, who
will streyne at a gnat,<note place="margin">Math. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. c. 24.</note> and swallowe vp and Oxe or a Sheepe at a
morsell: that is too say, which will make conscience in very small and
lyght matters, and not see a number of great enormities, which
they suffer too passe hard by their nozes, without beeing any whit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at them. Wee must not doo so: but when wee see the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef
fed and increaced by our vnfaythfulnesse, let vs prouyde for it.
and let euery man bee compelled too thinke better vppon himself and
vppon his vyces, that he may amend them. This in effect is the
carefullnesse which Saint Paule inioyneth vs heere: and it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meane to rid away the plagues that Satan would haue maynteyned
still by silence and dissimulation. Therefore whensoeuer wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any impostume lying hid, let vs beware that the matter settle not
so long within, till the disease become vncurable: but let vs purge it
out of hand, and let admonitions serue as it were for launcers, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of blud, and for such other meanes and helpes too take away
the rotten matter that myght marre and infect the whole bodye.
And so yee see in effect how wee ought too put this doctrine in
vre.</p>
               <p>Now heeruppon Saint Paule inferreth, that <hi>Therfore our Lord
Iesus Christ,</hi> in all the doctrine of the Gospell, <hi>speaketh too them
that are falne aslepe in their sinnes, &amp; to such as are as good as dead,
too the intent they should vvake and ryze vp:</hi> and so shall wee
beee inlyghtened by him. Now wee haue heere too remember first
of all, that Iesus Christ dooth then rayse vs from the deade, when he
calleth vs too the fayth, and bringeth vs intoo the hope of saluation.
And that is too the intent wee should perceyue our state the better.
For wee see how men sooth and glorifye themselues. Although there
bee nothing in them but vtter confuzion: yit notwithstanding they
will needes put out their hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es lyke Suayles too vaunt themselues,
as it were in despyte of God and nature. Now the Scripture sayeth
wee bee dead. Wee may well haue some resemblance of lyfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee bee conuerted too the fayth of Iesus Christ: Howbeit, that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:279"/>
lyfe is but death before God. And that is the cause why it is sayd in
Saint Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. c. 25.</note> The houre is come that all they which heare the voyce
of the sonne of man, shall liue though they bee dead, and shall passe
from death too lyfe. Iesus Christ speakes not there of the visible
death, nor of the resurrection which we hope for at the latter day. But
he sheweth vs how wee haue alredy a preparatyue of the second rising
agein, when God reneweth vs, and giueth vs a spirituall lyfe. For
wee can doo nothing but euill, as hath bin declared heertoofore. And
Saint Paule also vseth the same phraze of speeche, namely that wee
bee dead too Godward. Following the same matter heere, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs that the whole drift of the Gospell is, that we should ryze from
the dead. For as long as wee bee straungers too God, who is the
welspring of lyfe: where are wee but in such a dungeon, as it had bin
better for vs neuer too haue bin borne? But wee must wake: for one
part of our death is this blockishnesse wherin wee bee, according as
I declared heeretoofore, that wee bee so corrupted afore hand euen
from our moothers womb, as wee can fynd no sauour in well dooing,
and that wee bee starke blynded in our wicked lustes, &amp; the diuell dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs and thrusteth vs foreward in such wyze, that as long as God
giueth vs the brydle, wee can doo nothing but grub downe too the
bottom of hell, too sinke our selues the deeper in it. Now bee wee
once come too that poynt, there is no more sorinesse (as S. Paule sayd
afore,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 19.</note>) there is nothing but such stubbornnesse, as God is nothing with
vs, nother haue wee any more feeling or perceyuerance of our sinnes.
That is the cause why he sayeth heere, that wee must wake, bycause
wee be in a deadly sleepe, vntyll God stirre vs vp, and make vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
what wee bee, that wee may abhorre our sinnes and returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him. So then, the enterance of lyfe and saluation, is, that God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteth
vs with his grace, wheras wee were as dead wretches, and had
nothing in vs but vtter corruption. Mark that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Secondly let vs marke, that besydes the naughtinesse which is in
vs, there is also so great a hardnesse and wilfulnesse, as God must bee
fayne too wake vs as it were by force, that wee may haue some feeling
of our vyces too mislyke them. Trew it is that this is doone cheefely
when God calleth vs, and pulleth vs out of the confuzion wherin wee
were. But yit must euery Christian continew therin all the tyme of
his lyfe. For wee shall neuer bee so throughly awake, but that wee
shall haue neede of Gods stirring vp of vs still: according as yee shall


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:23289:279"/>
see some folke so heauie asleepe, that euen when their clothes are on,
and when they bee vp vppon their feete, they go reeling styll, and bee
as it were halfe in a slumber, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tyll they stretch foorth themselues and
set their handes too some buzinesse, and they bee so heauie and dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe,
that they still slumber euen waking. Euen so is it with vs: for
although our Lord Iesus Christ haue doone vs the grace too draw vs
backe from death, and too quicken vs by his holy spirit and by his
woord: yit shall wee still feele our selues slothfull and sluggish, so as he
must bee fayne too waken vs styll. And therefore wee haue neede too
bee exhorted euery day, yea and too haue our eares beaten early and
late, as though Iesus Christ cryed out shrill and loud vntoo vs, what
doo yee yee wretched soules? Wherat looke yee? Though wee heard
such warnings without ceassing: yit should wee not bee so throughly
awake as were needefull. Now then wee see what S. Paule ment to
declare in this streyne: namely that looke what wee feele through
Gods goodnesse in our selues, wee should put the same in vre towards
our neyghbours. Now, our Lord Iesus Christ hath rayzed vs from
the dead, and he wakeneth vs dayly from the dead sleepe wherthrough
wee bee so drowzie: and that is too the end that wee should afterward

Hee meaneth nothing so. But the effect of his intent is, that wee shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee
inlyghtened by Iesus Christ. And after what maner? Not only
as though we were but in some dark place (sayth S. Paul) &amp; had neede

more woonderous maner. For wee bee not only in the dark, but also

than was lawfull for him. But in sted of hauing greater lyght, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

and too haue Gods spirit too serue vs in sted of eyes. Mark that
for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Agein, in this world there is nothing but dull darknesse, yea and
that so thicke, as wee wote not how too step one pace without stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
or without straying out of our way. Therfore it standeth vs on
hande too bee guyded, and that our Lord Iesus Christ shewe vs
the way. This is it that Saint Paule declareth too vs heere, and how
our Lord Iesus inlyghteneth vs: namely, not only that wee bee dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syghted,
and that he helpeth vs, and supplyeth the want that is in vs:
but also that wee bee stark blynd, yea and dead, and finally euen in the
pit of hell, lyke as when a Coarse is layd in the graue, men may well
bring Candels and Torches too it, but it seeth neuer the more for all
that. So then our Lord Iesus imparteth his lyght vntoo vs, not too
make vs see more cleerly than wee did afore: but to giue vs our whole

that Iesus Christ speaketh after this maner, and contineweth day by

ought wee not too followe his example, and too hold backe our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as much as wee can, when wee see them straying too their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?

too doo his office in inlyghtening vs, and too shewe vs the way of

ouerwhelmed: but also, when he hath inlyghtened vs, he will haue vs
too serue as Lampes for others too followe, that wee may shewe them
the way, so as he will haue vs (after a sort) too execute the one half of
his office. Seeing then that the sonne of God hath doone vs such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
if wee for all this, doo thrust this lyght vuder foote, and nother

if yee search narrowly why men pardon themselues many
offences so easly, and why they beare themselues on hand that God
thinkes not on them: yee shall fynde that it proceedeth of negligence.
For if wee considered that wee walke in the presence of God and his
Angels: surely it would hold vs in another manner of awe than wee
bee. That therefore is the cause why he dooth expressely requyre
heere a great care and circumspectnesse in vs, too the intent that no
man should gyue himself ouer vntoo euyll for want of taking heede.</p>
               <p>And too prouoke vs the more theruntoo, he addeth, <hi>that vvee
haue neede too redeeme the tyme, bycause the dayes are euill.</hi>
Wherin he sheweth that wee cannot deuyze too abuze Gods grace
so little, but it is a willfull lozing of the tyme, which wee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
afterward. Now then, let vs gather a breef summe of the things
that are conteyned heere, and let vs begin at this poynt, that the dayes
are euill, wherby Saint Paule dooth vs too wit, that wee shall fynd
many lettes too keepe vs from comming vntoo God. For wee
knowe wee bee hemmed in with so many corruptions, that euen they
which are best mynded, shall stumble on the one syde, bee pulled
backe on the other, and dyuers tymes stray quyte away. Now wee
had neede of a singular inwoorking, too fyght in such wyse as wee
may get the vpper hand of all the impedimentes that Satan castes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs, to plucke vs from our God, and to thrust vs quyte and cleane
out of the way of saluation. And therefore this hath bin true in all
ages, that forasmuch as men are alwayes froward of nature, and
we be borne in sin: Satan holdeth vs as his prisoners. Agein, there
is not that man among vs, which draweth not other men too naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Moreouer, wee wote not scarsly how to open our eyes, but we
shall see some one thing or other, that may vtterly ouerthrowe vs, and
the diuell through his wylynesse applyeth all too his owne woorking,
that vnlesse wee take good heede too his dooings, he marreth vs out
of hand. But the more that the world rageth, and the more that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
ouerfloweth: the more ought wee too marke well this text, and
the counsell that is giuen vs heere by the holy Ghost. For surely
now adayes men are come too the full measure of all enormite, and
there is no part of the world where a man may fynd single and sound
dealing. In old tyme yit a man myght haue found some Nations,
where the folke were not so craftie and malicious, nor so excessiue in
pomp and all kyndes of pleazures, nor so farre ouer the shooes in rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:282"/>
crueltie, and extorsion. But now adayes let a man go about
euerywhere, and he shall fynd that there is nothing but as a horrible
water flud and confuzed turmoyle of all wickednesse. And therefore
if Saint Paul haue sayd, that the dayes were eui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, when there was
a hundred tymes more soundnesse than there is now adayes: we ought
too bee the more vigilant in keeping good watch, according too the
increacing of the euilnesse of the tyme. If there be any fear of warre,
euery of vs will abate his countenance, and consider that it is not for
him too hazard all at one chop, but that he must reserue some little
sprincling for a pinch, as well of vittelles as of other things. Also if
wee haue any other trubbles, euery of vs will bee forecasting ynough
in that behalf.</p>
               <p>Let vs bethinke our selues (will wee say) for necessitie will driue
vs too it. But now wee see well the euilnesse of the dayes, that is to
say, that all is ageinst vs, and although wee were the diligentest and
circumspectest in the world, yit shall wee not fayle too bee taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
with many things, and too fynd our selues hindered when wee
should serue God: and yit notwithstanding, all this passeth and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
away, and wee mynd it not at all. Therefore let vs bethinke
our selues, and learne too redeeme the tyme, that is too say, the mo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
there bee too prouoke vs too naughtinesse, and too pull vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from God, the more let euery of vs inforce and streyne himselfe
too doo good. For wee be woont too take the corruptnesse of the time
for a cloke too couer our sloth and vnlustinesse withal, and so wee beare
our selues alwayes on hand, that it is lawfull for vs too play the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftes
among vuthriftes, as the prouerb sayeth. If a man tell vs
that wee must liue indifferently and vpryghtly: how shall I doo then,
will euery man say? A man cannot buy a pennywoorth of apples
without some deceyt: and how then may I deale in wares or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaundyze?
Agein, if a man tell vs that wee must liue soberly and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tayedly,: yea, (say wee) but who dooth it? If a man speake too vs
of pacience and myldnesse, and such other things: Is it not apparant
(say wee) that euery man behaueth himselfe cleane contrariwyze?
Shall I bee al alone in the world? Lo how wee make vyce our buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
ageinst God, &amp; ageinst all the warnings that are giuen vs, as who
should say, that bycause it is common, therfore it ought too serue vs for
an acquittance or discharge. But contrariwyse it is sayd heere, that
wee must take so much the more peyne too redeeme the tyme, and the


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:23289:282"/>
more that the diuel laboreth to hinder vs, &amp; the more meanes and wyles
that he hath too doo it withall, the more must euery of vs imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
manfully, and waken vp all his wits and vnderstanding, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God too strengthen vs, and too giue power too risist him. Thus
yee see that our redeeming of the tyme must not bee by making of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
(and worldly) gayne, for in that behalf wee neede nother counsell
nor incoragement, euery man is too much inclyned that way of his
owne nature, and our lustes are so fyrye, as they will not suffer vs
too bee flothfull in that cace. But sith wee see the deuill goes about
to trubble vs, that we should not spend our lyues in the seruing of God:
let vs redeeme the tyme in that respect. And after what manner? In
that he speaketh of redeeming, (raunsoming, or buying agein) he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppozeth
that we must forgo &amp; looze the thing that we were desyrous
too haue kept. For when wee bee too redeeme a thing that was gone
out of our handes, or (too buy) a thing that wee neede, or too (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
for) a thing that another man withholdeth from vs: in those
caces wee forgo some peece of our profit. If another man haue layd
hold of a thing that were for my commoditie: I must giue him a peece
of mony too get it out of his hand agein. Euen so is it sayd, that wee
must redeeme the tyme. And after what manner? Not alwayes with
gold and siluer: but by forsaking our owne lustes. It is true that
some tyme gold and siluer must bee spent about it. For if worldly
riches turne vs away, or plucke vs backe from following whithersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
God calleth vs, wee must redeeme the tyme, that is too say, all
that euer wee perceyue too bee noysome and offensyue after that sort,
must be thrust vnder foote. Howbeeit there are many other meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes.
For some are so snarled in their ambiciousnesse, as this world
hath altogither rauished them, and they take no tast of the euerlasting
lyfe, for any thing that can be preached vntoo them. Othersome bee
giuen too deceyuing, and others too extorsion. According then as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man sees the Diuell able too win of him, and too make him to looze
his tyme, by consuming it in wicked things: so let him redeeme it,
that is too say, let him reforme himselfe, and forsake both himselfe and
all the temptations wherwith he myght bee intangled. Yee see then,
that the thing which wee haue too marke vppon this streyue, is, that
considering the corruptnesse which is now adayes throughout the
world, and the great number of outrageous vyces, and how all things
are quite out of order, and (too bee short) that euen the perfectest men


<pb facs="tcp:23289:283"/>
are somwhat infected with the vyces, and disorders that are euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where:
in stead of seeking vayne excuce, by alledging that wee bee
weake, and vnable to ouercome the great number of impediments that
are offered vs, wee must redeeme the tyme.</p>
               <p>Now the only meane too doo it, is too vnderstand that Satans
thrusting of vs downe after that sort, is no sufficient discharge for vs
before God: for if wee resort vntoo him, he will giue vs armour and
weapon too hold out the battell withall, vntill wee haue gotten the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.
But howsoeuer the cace stand, let it not greeue vs too lay away
the things that wee lyked of, and too hold our wicked affections as it
were imprizoned, and then will it bee easy for vs too followe the thing
that Saint Paule sayeth heere, that is too wit, too bee watchfull and
heedfull that wee walk aduyzedly, euen as <hi>VVyzefolk, and not as
fooles.</hi> Wee haue seene alredy heretoofore, that if wee profit in Gods
schoole as wee ought too doo, wee shall haue a sure rule, and cannot bee
deceyued nor seduced. For God knew what wee haue neede of, and
he hath not forgotten too shewe vs any thing. And therfore Saint
Paul presuppozeth that although we be blynd wretches, although we
be ouerwhelmed with the darknesse of this world, although the diuell
haue manie suttleties &amp; wyles to wynd about vs: yit if wee bee good
schollers too Godward, and suffer our selues too bee ruled by him and
his woord: wee shall haue sufficient wisdome, and wee shall not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too say, that we offended vnwares: for God is forecasting ynough
too rule our whole lyfe, at leastwyse if wee herken too all that he sayth,
and yeeld our selues easy and willing too bee taught. If it bee so: then
may wee surely bee wyse, as Saint Paule requyreth.</p>
               <p>And in deede he expoundeth him self by and by after in saying, <hi>that
we must not be vnwyze, but wel aduyzed, &amp; vnderstanding what is
the wil of God.</hi> He sheweth here what maner of wisdome he meaneth.
It is not as the world speaketh of it. For the world sayth, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very
wyse whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is suttleheaded to deceyue, &amp; can skill to keepe him self fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his enemyes, &amp; maynteyn himself by his shifting &amp; pollicie. Or else, the
wisdome of the world is also to lay wel aforehand for a mans own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
whether it be by hooke or by crooke. For there is no talk of the feare
of God, there is no talk of equitie, &amp; much lesse of single &amp; playne dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
bycause that he which wil bee wyze to the worldward, must beare
two faces in one hood, he must bee malicious, he must be ful of lying.

               <p>It is trew that all men shall not be so wel inlyghtened as were

it is not for men too aduaunce themselues, or too bee so proud as too
thinke that they can gouerne themselues as they ought too doo: for
the beginning of our wisedome is too be fooles in our selues,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. d. 18.</note> as hath
bin shewed in the first too the Corinthians. But on the one syde there
is presumptuousnesse, so that very fewe can humble themselues in
such wyse, as not too be styll plucked backe and hindered by their
owne opinions: and (on the other syde) othersome are so rechlesse, that
although they haue their eares dayly beaten with Gods woord, yit
they continue dull styll for all that can bee doone. So much the more
behoueth it vs too marke well the warning that is giuen vs heere:
which is, that too bee well taught in Gods scoole, wee must not
bring any whit of our owne reason, nother must wee thinke our owne
deuyces good, but wee must bee fooles in our selues, that is too say,
boyde of our owne reason, and wee must giue place and open way too
Gods woord, so as wee accept without any geynsaying whatsoeuer
is vttered by his mouth.</p>
               <p>Heereuppon Saint Paule comes backe agein too certeine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and speciall exhortations, as he had begonne too doo before, and
first he sayth, <hi>that the faythfull ought too keepe themselues vvell
from beeing drunken vvith vvyne, vvherein there is disorder.</hi>
As if he should say, that wee must haue such stay of our selues in our
eating and drinking, and so vse the good thinges that God hath
ordeyned for our sustenance, as too take measurable repast of them,
and not make our selues lyke brute beastes. Now, that wee may
profit our selues well by this doctrine, wee haue too marke first of all,
too what end our Lord hath appoynted foode and all other things that
are for our sustenance. What then is the lawfull vse of wyne, of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

bee glorifyed in all things, as it is sayd in another place. Now then
wee see that meate and drinke ought too serue too leade vs to God.<note place="margin">Colos. 3. c. 17.</note> For
is it reason that when God shall haue reached out his hand too powre
vppon vs the benefytes that wee receyue of him, he should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
go vnknowen, and wee still cram our selues heere at his cost,
and yit forget him? Were not that too leaud and detestable a beastli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Therefore although meate and drinke bee helpes too our fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
yit ought wee too referre all vntoo God. In deede it seemeth
at the first syght, that wee bee letted and hindered too doo good, as well
by eating and drinking, as also by sleeping. It is very trew: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God sheweth what wee bee. But on the other syde wee must come
also too the recompence of it, that forasmuch as the tyme is after a
sort lost whyle wee take our repaste, bycause wee cannot apply our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
too the seruing of our neyghbours (during that tyme:) our forslow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that behalfe may as it were spurre vs too resort vntoo God, by
considering what his goodnesse is towardes vs, according to the proof
that he setteth before our eyes. Thus yee see (as I sayd) that although
our eating and drinking doo hinder vs too the worldward: yit ought
they on the other syde too gyue vs occasion too bee more cheerefull in
seeking God.</p>
               <p>But now let vs see what excesse woorketh. If a man cram himself so
full, that he becommeth vnweeldie, there is a chaunge in his nature,
and it is all one as if he were at defyance with God and with nature,
and with all order. For (as I haue sayd already) meate and drinke
are ordeyned too strengthen vs, that wee may apply our selues to the
things which God commaundeth, and our vocation requyreth. Now
therfore, when a man is so pampered as he can no more, first he hath


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23289:286"/>
defyled the sustenance that God gaue him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and secondly he chaungeth

God. Moreouer God is forgotten. Is not this vnkyndnesse monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as though a man would mingle heauen and earth toogither? But
this is not yit all: Saint Paule addeth heere the vpshot of all enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

see that one of the properties of drunkennesse is too driue men eyther
intoo whoredome, or intoo some other leaudnesse, and too cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so sound a sleepe, that they perceyue nothing at all: let a man mocke
at them, let him spit in their faces, they feele nothing of it. Agein,
whatsoeuer commes at their toungs ende, out it goes, bee it ryght or

thus caryed away, and wheras God had printed his image in them,
too make them reasonable creatures, and giuen them an excellent state
aboue all other lyuing wyghtes: they fall too playing of the beastes
after that fashyon, &amp; become lyke Asses and dogges: must it not needs
be vnderstoode, that drunkennesse is one of the detestablest things that
can bee? So then, Saint Paule ment too shewe vs heere in one word,
that although there were no trew feare of God in vs too restreyne vs,
nor wee so well aduyzed and discrete as too consider the trew and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

refrayne for shame of the world, forasmuch as wee see that a drunken
man is as a confuzi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which this vnhallowing of Gods benefyts deserueth, when wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

nature, which the very heathen men considered. And heere wee haue
too remember, that the mischeef is dubbled when men step asyde, and
giue ouer themselues (from euill too euill) by degrees: and therfore
much lesse ought it too serue too lessen their fault as wee see (a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

their shamefulnesse may make folke too loth and abhorre it: the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefe
is increaced so much the more. And therefore too the intent
too kepe vs in sobrietie and orderly conuersation: Saint Paule sayth,
wee must keepe our selues from being so ouercome and vanquished
of wyne.</p>
               <p>And now on the contrarie part he addeth, <hi>that vvee must rather be
filled vvith the Spirit.</hi> For they that burst themselues so with eating
and drinking, and keepe no measure, tyll they can no more, doo well
shewe that they haue no feeling of the kingdome of God, ne neuer
tasted what the heauenly lyfe is. This remedie therefore is ryght
conuenient too correct all the excesses and superfluities that reigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
heathenish men, and such as neuer conceyued any incling of
Gods grace and spirituall benefytes. Lyke as if a man that were
emptie, should deuoure &amp; swallow vp al without chawing, it were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an ouerlaying of his stomack, than a taking of sustenance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past:
and therefore if another man sawe that vyce in him, he would
restreyne him: euen so is it with all such as haue inordinate lustes: it
is a token that they bee too emptie. And wherof? Of fayth, of the
feare of God, and of the ioy which is in the holy Ghost: and that they
know not a whit of Gods goodnesse and fauour toowardes them, nor
of the grace which he sheweth vs in our Lord Iesus Christ. For had
we once our bellyes full of such vittelles, surely we would not play the
Wolues in rauening, but wee would keepe mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure. That then is
the cause why Saint Paule sayth, that wee must bee filled with the
holy Ghost. As if he should say, that the despyzers of God, and such
as haue none other religion but too lyue at ease heere, and too haue all
their delyghtes and pleasures, are excessiuely full, beyond all reason
and measure. And that is a defyling of Gods benefytes, and a despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of the order of nature, as I sayd afore. Now then if yee bee so
sharpe set too knowe what God is, and what it is too profit in his
woord: come your wayes to deuoure it, as they doo which haue eaten
no meate a twoo dayes afore: bee not afrayd of eating too much of
that foode, for it will neuer burst our soules. Therefore let vs hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cram our selues with the giftes of Gods spirit, and with his Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
benefytes, wherby he feedeth vs in the hope of the heauenly lyfe:
for in so dooing wee cannot doo amisse: but wee cannot giue head too
our lustes, in taking foode for the bodie, but there will by and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe


<pb facs="tcp:23289:289"/>
some euill and offence. The matter which wee haue in effect too
remember vppon this streyne, is, that all they which glut themselues
after that fashyon, and cannot satisfie themselues but by playing the
beastes: shewe well that they haue not so much as one drop of fayth,
nor of the feare of God, nor of religion in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that their bellye
ouerruleth them, and that they bee so subiect thereuntoo, as too their
peculiar &amp; principall Idoll. Now seeing it is so, let vs learne to long
after the foode of our soules. And forasmuch as it is liberally offered
vs from day too day, insomuch that it is Gods whole desyre that wee
should haue all that suffyzeth for our saluation: let vs sharpen our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petytes
too take such repast, and then shall wee bee sure that (our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
meates shall not allure vs too such gluttonie, that wee shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as vnsatiable gulfes, but wee shalbee contented with the hauing
of that which is meete for vs, and sufficient for our necessitie, at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
too our behoof.</p>
               <p>Furthermore this similitude which Saint Paule vseth, must not
bee thought straunge, when he sayth, that wee must drinke our fill
of Gods spirit.<note place="margin">Esai. 55. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

take at your pleasures both Milke, Wyne, and Water, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,

wee shall haue abundance of all spirituall benefites, and sufficient too

               <p>Now forasmuch as this doctrine is so yll put in vre euerywhere, we
ought to thinke the better of it. If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consider how great emptinesse

the foode that is profered vs and set afore vs. Yea, and this serueth
well too vpbrayd vs with our leaudnesse, in that wee voutsafe not too
go vntoo God though he call vs, nor too make account of that which
he offereth vs. Wee will not forget too eate and too drinke for refres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of our bodyes: and yit that will not content vs nother: for wee
could fynd in our hartes too cobble vp (as yee would say) the whole
world. Yit notwithstanding euen the soberest are willing too haue
their ordinarie repaste. The other sort doo cram in meate and drinke
a foure or fyue tymes a day, and in the meane whyle the wretched
soules of them are hungrie still. Therefore wee must beare in mynd
that the warning which Saint Paule gyueth vs heere, telleth vs, that
too bee sober and well ruled, and too vse measurably the benefites that
God bestoweth vppon vs: the soule must not bee forgotten, but wee
must feede vppon the spirituall giftes, too leade vs too the heauenly
lyfe, and too maynteyne vs in the hope therof, vntyll the full possession
and fruition thereof bee gyuen vs at the comming of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</p>
               <p>And hereuppon Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that vvee should talke too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
in songs and hymnes, and also that the same should be done
vvith the hart:</hi> bycause the toung would but vnhalowe Gods woord,
if the mynd match not with the speeche. Now wheras he sayeth, that
wee must talke toogither in hymnes, praysings, and songs: it is too
correct all fond talke, wheruntoo wee bee too much giuen. For wee
see that all of vs haue as it were itching eares: there is none of vs
which is not well apayd too heare tryflyng bibblebabble: he that hath
receyued in on the one syde, is ready too delyuer out on the other syde:
and so the day passeth away in things of nothing: or else our talk shall
bee wanton and looce, meete too infect good manners, and God shall
bee offended with it. Yee see then, that the thing whertoo men are too
much inclyned, is, that too please one another, they banish all talk that
may edifye, and common of pelting tryfles too moue laughter, as they
say. Now Saint Paule perceyuing this vyce to be ouer common in
the world, sheweth vs heere the remedie of it, that is too wit, that wee
should talke one too another in songs and hymnes, that is too say, that
men myght heare the prayses of God at our mouthes. And he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
styll the similitude that he had vsed heretoofore. For drunkards
are not contented too become beastes themselues: but they doo also
drawe others. And ryot hath alwayes this inconuenience with it, that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:290"/>
men incorage one another too drinking,<note place="margin">Esai. 2. d. 13. &amp; 56. d. 12. &amp; VVisd. 2. b. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 1. Cor. 15. d. 32.</note> saying: come on, let vs eate
and drinke, after the same maner that the Prophet Esay speaketh of.
Forasmuch then as Ryotters, after they haue well stuffed themselues,
would that the same vyce should raunge abrode euerywhere: Saint
Paule sayeth on the contrarie part, that when wee haue taken our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paste
of the giftes of Gods spirit, the same must not serue for our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
onely, but also too giue refection and foode too others that haue
neede. The trew feasting therfore which wee ought too make one too
another too cheere our selues well, is that he which hath profited in
Gods woorde, indeuer too deale some part and portion of it too his
neyghbours, according too his owne measure. Nowe he vppeneth
heere Songs, Psalmes, and Hymnes, which differ nothing at all one
from another: and therefore I neede not too buzie my selfe in setting
foorth any curious distinction of them. For all commeth too this end,
that all our myrth should euer tend too the glorifying of God. And
surely we should take pleasure ynough in the mynding of Gods grace,
if wee were not withh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d by our owne maliciousnesse.</p>
               <p>And it is a woonder too see how desyrous euery man is, that God
should shewe him self liberall and louing towards him. Wee would
fayne inioy his benefytes, and yit in the meane whyle we put the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberaunce
of them vnder foote, and labour (as much as in vs is)
euen too burie them: and too our seeming, the tyme is lost that is spent
in acknowledging how many wayes wee bee bound vntoo God: and
yit notwithstanding it is the thing wherin wee ought too occupie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And soothly if men were well aduyzed, there is no mirth compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
too this, nor meete too bee matched with it, namely with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of how many wayes God hath witnessed his goodnesse
and loue towards vs. For (as I sayd) it serueth too further vs in the
hope of the heauenly lyfe. And vndoutedly, none of the things that
wee receyue at Gods hand haue any trew sauerinesse, vnlesse we come
too put our trust in him, and can call vppon his name, and flee too him
for refuge, and yeeld him his dew and deserued prayze. And therfore
let vs marke well what is sayd heere, namely that when wee talk one
with another wee must alwayes magnify Gods name. Trew it is, that
wee cannot atteyne too such perfectnesse in this lyfe, but that wee must
bee fayne too haue much communication of the needs wheruntoo wee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:23289:290"/>
another, and of dyuers things besyde. But yit for all that, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
poynt must not therfore bee let alone, and cast behynd our backs:
that is too wit, wee must not foreslowe too acknowledge the benefyts
wherby wee bee bound vntoo God, and therby bee prouoked too prayse
him, so as euery of vs not only doo his dewtie in secret, but also drawe
one another too it by mutuall example. That therfore is the pith of
the things which wee haue too remember in this strey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>Now by the way Saint Paule dooeth vs too vnderstand, that wee
must <hi>sing vntoo God in spirit,</hi> too the intent wee imagin not too dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
our selues as a number of hipocryts doo, which magnifye God
alonly with their tung, hauing their harts full of coldnesse still within.
Heere therfore he setteth downe twoo things which ought not too bee
put asunder. The one is, that wee should sing vntoo God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is, that wee should talk with our neyghbours. The whole ground
then of our matter is, that the benefyts which God hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
vs, should bee commended, and that the rememberance of them
should prouoke vs too loue him and serue him, and too giue our selues
wholly too him, too seeke him, and too knowe that too cleaue vntoo
him, is our full happinesse. That is the ground of the matter that S.
Paule setteth vs downe heere. Now first of all wee must (sayeth hee)
sing vntoo God: and that cannot bee doone but with the hart. For we
knowe that God accepteth not any thing which is not agreable to his
owne nature. Then if wee will so sing as he may alow of it, and as
hee may accept our songs: wee must goo too it with a hartie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For if there bee any counterfetting in our dooings, so as wee
make a greate shewe before men, and in the meane whyle bee nigard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our harts, and haue no zele at all, so as all is doone but for fashy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sake: surely wee vnhallowe Gods name in so dooing. And euen
for the same did he say by his Prophet Esay,<note place="margin">Esay. 29. d. 13.</note> that such as came neere
him only with their lippes,<note place="margin">Math. 15. a. 8.</note> were farre of from him in their harts.
Therfore let vs mark<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k. 7. a. 6.</note> well how it is sayd heere, that too sing Gods
prayses, the hart must go before, and (as yee would say) make a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
within. For it is the cheef melodie that can bee, and therin
wee agree with the Angels of heauen. For if the mouth speake alone,
surely it is but flat mockerie. And although men allow of vs for it: yit
dooth God refuze our paying of him with such coyne, that is too say,
with follies and things of nothing.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, when wee shall haue bin zelous in the praysing


<pb facs="tcp:23289:291"/>
of God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d he can well bee our iudge and witnesse, that wee lay open
our harts before him: then must wee also doo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur dewtie towards our
neyghbours, that euery man may be incoraged and tolled foreward by
our example. And heere wee see first of all, how little account is made
of God now adayes. For all the countenance that men make of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his prayses, is but a howling and yelling. It is one of the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
abuses in papistrie, that they think that God ought too hold him
self well apayd, when they haue barked at their parchment, as they
say. But in so dooing the holy scripture is vnhalowed, torne in peeces,
yea and vtterly falsifyed. Howsoeuer the cace stand, there is nother
aduyzednesse, wit, nor vnderstanding in their dooings: for it is y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with them that the throte hath yelled it out aloud. Yea and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
among vs too, it is certein that such as pretend to set foorth Gods
prayses, doo commonly seeke nothing but too glorifye themselues by
it, and keepe backe the principall in making countenance too pay
God some peece of their arreerages. Agein, let vs consider how cold
and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ender this exercyze of talking one too another in songs, hymnes,
and prayses of God, is among vs. For hardly can one woord bee
wroong out of vs that may edify. Leaud talk can by no meanes bee
banished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs: all the world shall heare vs sing vnchaste and ribauld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
songs: and such things cannot be plucked out of mens mynds.
But then ought this matter too bee rayzed out of the holy scripture.
Howsoeuer the cace stand, if men pardon themselues, they shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for it before God, according too the sentence that Saint Paule
pronounceth heere by the authorie of God, and by the power of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spirit.</p>
               <p>And by the way let vs marke, that his touching of three woordes
heere togither, which import all one thing, is not for nought. It is
too shewe that wee shal haue ynough wherwith too interteyne one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if wee acknowledge the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our syght.</p>
               <p>For the same cause also he addeth, <hi>Yeelding alvvayes thankes.</hi>
As if he sayd, that if wee were well aduyzed, the continuall repeting
of Gods prayses, and the harping vppon them should neuer greeue
vs nor weery vs. And why? Seeing that God continueth his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyting
of vs, is it not reason that there should bee an answerablenesse
on our part, too hold out in dooing him honour for his good turnes?
Dooth any one day passe wherein wee receyue not at the least a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
good turnes at Gods hand? Now is it meete that wee should
thinke, that when wee haue thanked him a twyce or thryce for the
greate number of benefytes which we receyue of him al our lyfe long,
we haue leyzure to occupy our selues otherwyse euer after? When as
our Lord renueth and refresheth the rememberance of his goodnesse:
were it not meet that wee should bee moued by it? Therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

and too yeeld him the sacrifyze that he requyreth of vs, which is, that

that they consider not how many wayes God allureth and spurreth

should say, my freendes, considering how much wee bee bound vntoo
God, both in respect of our bodyes, and in respect of our soules, can
wee comprehend it? No, it is not possible: for wee haue too small
and narrowe a wit. And when wee haue after a sort comprehended
Gods benefytes, yit haue wee not tung too expresse nothing neere
how much wee bee bound vntoo him. So then, of whom is it long
that wee bee so cold, that as soone as wee haue spoken but one woord,

There are a great number that pray vntoo God: but yit they do

My God, helpe mee. But which is that God? If they could plucke
him out of heauen, they would doo it with all their hart, too the end he

too pray vntoo God, doo but prouoke him to wrath, bycause their
requestes are full of pryde, spytefulnesse, and defyance. And therfore
Saint Paule telleth vs too the Philippians,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 6.</note> that all our petitions and
requestes must bee matched with thanksgiuing, too shewe that wee
doo paciently abyde too bee gouerned by the hand of God. Likewise
in this text he sayeth, that wee must thanke God for all things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when wee bee in prosperitie, and all things fall out as wee would
wish, so as God giueth vs our hartes desyre, and wee lyue in delyght
and pleasure: that is not the onely fit tyme and season too yeeld praise
vntoo God: but although he squoorge vs, yit must wee acknowledge
that he procureth our saluation (and welfare) by that meane. Let vs
see then, if wee haue not cause to blisse God in all our aduersities? Yis:
For first, whatsoeuer betyde vs, he beareth with vs: insomuch that if
he should touche vs but with one of his fingers in good earnest: wee
should bee ouerwhelmed at the first blowe. Seeyng then, that wee
hold out, it is a token that he spareth vs: and haue not wee cause too
thanke him for it? Agein, when he turneth his chastizings too our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte,
for that he purgeth vs by that meanes, too further vs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
therby too the kingdome of heauen, and too lift vs vp bycause wee
bee too much tyed too the world, too the end wee should bee gathered
toogither, too come too the full perfection that is prepared for vs in
heauen: when wee see all this, haue wee not cause too prayse our God,
notwithstanding that wee bee full of greefe, care, feare, and doubtes?


<pb facs="tcp:23289:293"/>
Yis certeinly, but that our owne vnthankfulnesse hindereth it. So
much the more behoueth it vs too marke well the thing that S. Paule
telleth vs heere, namely that wee haue cause too praise God without
end or ceassing. And if our mouth bee stopped sometymes with grief,
so as wee seeme too bee barred from praysing God, and wee cannot
apply our selues freely theruntoo: let vs vnderstand that God neuer
sheweth himselfe so rough and rigorous towardes vs, but that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swageth
the bitternesse which is in our afflictions, too the intent too
drawe vs vntoo him, and that wee myght thanke him, and glorify him
for it. Forasmuch as wee receyue no grace but by the meanes of
our Lord Iesus Christ, who dooth also turne the corrections too our
welfare, which wee should suffer as punishments for our sinnes: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is sayd, <hi>that vvee should yeeld thankes too our God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
namely by our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Now he setteth downe on
the one syde, God the father: and afterward sheweth how God is our
father in all respectes: that is too wit, by meanes of the mediator,
through whom we be reconcyled vnto him, and he hath so put away al
our sinnes, that whatsoeuer things we can indure in this world, are all
furtherances of our saluation,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 28.</note> as is sayd of them in the Epistle too the
Romans. And heere wee haue to marke first of all, that without fayth
wee cannot prayse God as we ought to doo, insomuch that whatsoeuer
prayses wee sing with our mouth, all is but feyning and hipocrisie, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
wee bee throughly perswaded that God is our father. And
marke heere what is ment by fayth. It is not as the Papistes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poze
it, namely too beleeue that there is a God in heauen, and in the
meane whyle too knowe no whit of his will: but Saint Paule telleth
vs, wee must bee throughly resolued, that God accepteth vs for his
children, or else wee shall neuer bee able to prayse him with a pure
and free affection. And how may that bee doone, but by being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

bycause he is our father: dooth iustly adde, that that is doone by our

afrayd of Gods maiestie, and cannot trust him, nor rest vppon the
promises of his fauour, too call vppon him as their father: can neuer
prayse him. In deede they may well vse some Ceremonies, but all
shal bee but leazing. Therefore whensoeuer wee wil pray vnto God,
and yeeld him prayse and thankes, fayth must leade the way. Marke
that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit, (as I sayd afore) it is vnpossible for vs too bee groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in any certeintie of fayth too take God for our father, vntyll wee
knowe that wee bee made one in our Lord Iesus Christ, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as wee bee members of his bodie, we bee also parttakers of
the benefytes that he hathe purchaced, so as his death and passion are
our ryghtuousnesse, his holinesse our clenzing from all our own defyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and the sacrifyze which he hath offered dooth set vs cleere,
and drawe vs out of the damnation wherin wee were, and finally hath
set vs free from the bondage of sin, and purchaced vs full ryghtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Forasmuch as wee haue all these things in our Lord Iesus
Christ, therefore ought wee also too geue thankes vntoo God by his
meanes. And that is the cause why the Papistes cannot frame so
much as one request, that God alloweth. Yea and in very deede, they
bee as good as dumb. For though a man may heare Hymnes and
Canticles ynow (as they terme them) among them: yit cannot God
bee praysed at their handes. For although they wynd vp all things
with this saying, <hi>By our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> yit doo they not beleeue
that God is mercifull too them, nother are they woorthie of it, bycause
they disclayme our Lord Iesus Christ, and doo so intangle him with
patrons and aduocates of their owne forging, as a man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
him from others, insomuch that they coope him vp in a corner,
or else set him behynd in the reerward, whyle in the meane tyme there
is hunting after the merites and intercessions of Saintes, and that
is their trust, that is the moother of their diuelish presump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that they can make amendes (for their sinnes) and redeeme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
But as for vs, when as it is told vs that wee must thanke God
in all things: it is too the end that wee should alwayes abace our
selues. And for that cause did I say, that fayth openeth vs the way
as wel too pray vntoo God, as also too giue him thankes for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
that wee haue receyued at his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:294"/>Now heerupon Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that wee must bee subiect
one too another in the feare of Christ, or in the feare of God,</hi> for
any of bothe will fit the text wellynough. In saying that wee must bee
subiect, he sheweth, that lyke as God will haue his children too exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyze
themselues in his prayzes: so also he wil no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> haue them too bee
vnprofitable heere beneathe, but too serue one anothers turne. For
inasmuch as wee bee not able too doo God eyther good or harme: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is he contented that wee doo but prayse his name. For though
we imploy all our abilitie: what is there in vs wherwith too inriche
God, or too aduauntage him? For the giueth vs all things, and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
nothing him self. Therfore is it an inestimable goodnesse, in that
he quitteth vs of all that wee can owe him, so wee protest our selues too
bee so greatly beholden and bound vntoo him, as wee cannot discharge
our selues of it. Then if wee come with all humilitie, and confesse
the bond wherin wee stand bound vntoo God: it is the payment that he
requyreth of vs, and (for his owne part) hee seeks no more. But yit
he will haue vs seruisable one too another, and not too seeke our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
profit in such wyse, as too forget that wee bee knit toogither in
one mutuall bond of charitie. That is the thing wheruntoo he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to bring vs now in this text. Now a man myght think it straunge
at the first blush, that he should say, wee ought too bee subiect one too
another. For it seemeth not meete that the father should bee subiect
too his children, the husband too his wyfe, or the magistrate too the
people whom he gouerneth, yea, or that euen they also which bee equal
in degree, should bee subiect one too another. But if wee looke well
vppon all things, wee shall fynd that Saint Paule hath not without
cause put all Christians vnder this subiection. For why? The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats
which are aduaunced in authoritie and glorie aboue other
men, are bound neuerthelesse too those whom they gouerne, for they
bee not ordeyned rulers for theyr owne saks, but for the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
sake. For Gods ordeyning of Principalities, kingdomes, and
States, was not to the end that some should haue preheminence aboue
others: but for that it is for our behoof too haue some brydle too hold
vs in obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e vnder lawes, and too haue some power and authoritie
ouer vs, and to stand in feare and awe of magistrats, bycause wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
forbeare such a remedie. Seeing then that God hath set magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
in such state: it is certein that they be therfore subiect too those
whom they ought too serue in reigning ouer them. As much is too


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:23289:294"/>
bee sayd of fathers. It is trew that the father ought too bee honored
of his children. Yit notwithstanding, forasmuch as it is an honorable
tytle, it shal cost them ryght deere, if they gouerne not their housholds
discreetly. And in that gouernment there is also subiection. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
is it betweene the husband and the wyfe. For is it not a subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the husband beareth with the frayltie of his wyfe, and hath
the discretion too forbeare rigour towards hir, holding hir as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
and taking vppon him a part of hir burthen both in sicknesse
and in helth? Is not that a subiection? yis. Not without cause then
dooth Saint Paule pronounce heere generally, that all they which
will proue themselues faythfull, must bee subiect one to another, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euery man in his state and degree. Let them that are hyghly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced
consider well, that Gods aduauncing of them, is too the end
they should the willinglyer submit themselues too beare the paynes
and cares that belong too their office: and let such as are inferiours vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
that they ought much rather too humble themselues, and
too beare the yoke that is layd vppon their necke. And let such as are
equals and fellowes, (vnlesse they will needs bee as wood beasts, and
are loth too maynteyn any c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urtisie among them) consider neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to beare with his neyghbors. And is not this
a subiection? Wee cannot liue one with another without forbearing.
Now surely al forbearing importeth bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dage,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. b. 8.</note> therfore must we be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for necessities sake. According wherunto it is said in another place
that wee must owe nothing but that which charitie byndeth vs vntoo.
And heerin wee see what a statelinesse it is, when any man shall say,
what owe I vntoo you? It is trew that men may well vpbrayd one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
that they owe them no dewtie: but they must step yit further.
And that is the cause why Saint Paule setteth downe the feare of our
Lord Iesus Christ, or of God. As if he should say, If wee were here
without a God, and that euery man would get alone by him self: wee
myght well hold scorne one of another, and say, I passe not for thee.
Trewly, yit were it a greate and intollerable follie too say, I passe
not for thee. For the richest man that can bee deuyzed, dooth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
stand in neede of a hundred folks helpes, yea of all mens
help. Then is it a greate ouer statelinesse too thrust away our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
after that fashyon, vnder colour that they can nother boote vs
nor hurt vs. And it is apparant that wee bee too blynd in so dooing.
But put the cace wee myght say, I passe not for thee, I owe thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:295"/>
yit must wee come too God, who is our head. For when he did
put vs intoo this world, he linked vs togither, and would haue vs too
serue one another in charitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wee knowe there is none other bond
of perfection but charitie: and charitie bringeth a bondnesse with it.
So then, although I owe a man nothing as in respect of him self: yit
doo I owe him somwhat as in respect of God. And that is the thing
whertoo Saint Paule bringeth vs backe. As if he should say, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with your selues that yee were not created and put intoo the world,
but with condition that yee should serue euery man his neyghbours.
Otherwyse, if yee shrinke asyde one from another: it is lyke as if yee
would cut asunder the sinewes of the body, too the intent it should fall
in peeces, yea and that our Lord Iesus Christ who is our head, might
haue no more too doo with vs. They then that will needes play the
wyld beastes, and cannot fynd in their hartes too stoope too any bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
too their neyghbours, must go lyue abrode in the wyld woods,
for they bee not woorthy too lyue among men. For wee see how God
hath knit vs toogither, and therby separated vs from the brute beastes,
and yit notwithstanding bound vs one too another. Now if wee wyll
needs shake off this yoke, is it not a playne bewraying that we thinke
not our selues beholden for any thing too our Lord Iesus Christ, and
that wee bee loth too bee ruled by his hand, or too submit our selues too
the order wherunder he hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> put vs, and which he would haue too bee
kept without breaking? So then, forasmuch as euery of vs is so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too himselfe, that wee cannot submit our selues one too another:
let vs beare in mynd that which Saint Paule hath set downe for vs
heere. For it is the very sauce that will make vs fynde taste in this
doctrine, that is too wit, that if wee feare God, and can fynde in our
hartes too submit our selues quietly too his wyll, it must not greeue
vs, nother must wee thinke it irksome and straunge, that euery of vs
should serue them whom he is bound too serue, and by that meane so
maynteyne his degree, as we may all linke toogither vnder our head
Iesus Christ, and atteyne too the heauenly glory which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
for vs.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs so too feele
them, as it may drawe vs too trew repentance, and make vs too profit
in it from day too day, and too examin our myseries in such wyze, as
wee may bee moued too call vppon our God for remedie, that he may

him as his children, and also haue wherefore too thanke him through
our Lord Iesus Christ, bycause he hath by his holy spirit sealed the
adoption in our hartes, wherby he holdeth vs fast too him, and that
wee may so perseuer in fayth and hope, as wee may euer persist in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the manifold benefytes which he addeth one vppon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and learne too receyue them so at his hand, as they may be made

vs is subiect too his neyghbours, and
that wee cannot otherwyse lyue one with
another, than by dooing some duetie as
of subiection. And forasmuch as that
mislyketh vs, bycause euery of vs coueteth
too bee aboue his fellowes, and wee set so
much store by that loftinesse, that it is
hard for vs too stoope: wee haue seene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that if wee feare God, wee must not
thinke it straunge, that wee should submit our selues too our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
for God created vs with that condition. Yee see then in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that charitie doth so bynd vs one too another, that we ought not
too disedeyne this man, nor too loth that man, or too count the third
man vnworthie to haue any seruice done vnto him. For as in respect
of God, wee must eyther bow downe our necke, or else our stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
wil turne too our decay. And now Saint Paule passeth further,
and sheweth that there are certein degrees among men. For although
the foresayd rule doo stand generally: that is too wit, that euery of vs
must indeuer too performe his duetie: yit notwithstanding, there is
also a greater subiection particularly of the sonne too the father, of
the wyfe too hir husband, and of vnderlings too their superiours, than
there is indifferently among al men. I haue told you ere this, that there
is a brotherood euen betweene the furthest straungers on the earth, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they bee all of one common nature, and euery man must
needes acknowledge himself indetted too other. Howbeeit when
God hath knit folkes togither in a streyter and holyer band: euery
man must looke neerlyer to himself. For when a wyfe is matched too
hir husband, shee is giuen him for a help, and shee is a part of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Also there is a speciall subiection, so that although the husband
bee superiour in authoritie: yit is that no let but that he also is bound
too his wyfe: for shee is his companion both too lyue and dye with
him. Lykewyse is it with children towardes their fathers, and with
fathers towardes their children, eche one in his behalfe and calling:
as subiects towardes theyr princes and superiors, and seruantes
towardes their maysters. Yee se then that the thing which we haue to
treate of as now, is, that we must generally liue in charitie one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
indeuering too discharge the duetie that God byndes vs too,


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23289:296"/>
according too our abilitie: and therewithal, not de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God hath set among vs, but rather bee prouoked so much the more too
doo our duetie, knowing that if wee refuze that condition, wee make
warre ageinst God.</p>
               <p>And now let vs come too mariage: which is not a thing ordeyned
by men. Wee knowe that God is the author of it, and that it is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
in his name, and the Scripture sayeth, it is a holy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and therefore dooth it call it diuine. Now then, if a wyfe bee
stubborne and froward, and cannot fynd in hir hart too beare the yoke:
although shee doo wrong too hir husband, yit dooth shee more wrong
too God. And why? For it is his will that that bond should bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable:
and behold, a mortall creature will needes breake it, and
plucke it asunder. Wee see then that in so doing, shee bendeth hirselfe
ageinst God. On the other syde, when the man will needes rule af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his owne lyking and fancie, and despyze his wyfe, or vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and tyrantly: he sheweth himselfe too despyze God, and too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye
him openly. For he ought too knowe too what end he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
what the state of wedlocke is, and what lawe God hath set in it.
The thing therefore which Saint Paule calleth vs vntoo, is that
in all states wee should haue regard of God. For so long as our eyes
rest vppon them with whom wee bee conuersant, surely wee shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
fynd excuces ynow &amp; too many, to exempt our selues from all
lawe. The husband may alledge, I haue a spytfull and stubborne
wyfe: or else shee is proud, and coy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or hath a wicked head of hir owne:
or else is talkatiue. Agein, another perhappes is a drunkard, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an ydle huzwyfe, &amp; another of some other leaud disposition. To be
short, there is not that man which may not haue some colour, if hee
keepe not the faythfulnesse and honestie of mariage, as becommeth
him. The wyfe also for hir part shal not bee vnprouyded. For now
and then hir husband may hap too bee testie and riottous, and too haue
small regard wheretoo God hath called them. Some are ill hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
and hunters of Tauernes (and ale houses:) or else playe the
vnthriftes in gaming and lyght behaueour. Some are whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
some gluttons, and some drunkardes. And so euery woman
myght pretende some excuce too exempt hirself from hir dewtie. But
when wee come too God, wee must bee fayne too cast our heades in
our bozom, for it will not boote vs too stand checking ageinst him.
Although the men misbehaue themselues on the one syde, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

on the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yit wil not God haue the mariage to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
therby, sauing the diuorce (I meane) which our Lord Iesus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.
But the (other) vyces that are in a husband must not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peache
the wyues subiection &amp; obedience vnto him. Agein, though
the wyfe bee not found to bee as shee ought too bee, yit may not the
husband shake hir of, and rid his handes of hir, what shift soeuer he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
but Gods ordinance must alwayes stand firme, and the bond
which wee haue by his woord, must be inuiolable. This is the thing
that wee haue too remember vppon that sentence.</p>
               <p>The world seeth how ill this lesson is put in vre: but wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that the roote of the mischeef is, that in mariage fewe or none
haue an eye vntoo God. In deede Gods name shall runne roundly y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and euen the wickeddest could fynd in their harts that he should
blisse them &amp; make them to prosper: but that in their marying they put
themselues intoo his hand and guyding, and call vppon him vnfeyned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
that is no poynt of their meaning. Some seeke welth and gayne,
and othersome pleasure and voluptuousnesse. In lyke cace is it with
the women. And no maruell though the ende bee out of all order,
when the beginning was so out of square. For God must needs bee
reuenged on his part, when he is so lyghtly esteemed and despyzed.
Therfore let vs learne too mark well this lesson of Saint Paules, that
lyke as mariage was ordeyned of God: so they that are too enter intoo
it, must betake themselues wholy vntoo him, and make him their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
knowing that it is he which byndeth the man and the wyfe the
one too the other, and which knitteth them toogither, and therfore that
eyther of them looke too their owne dewtie.</p>
               <p>Wheras he sayeth concerning wyues, that they owe subiection too
their husbands: wee haue too mark, that this subiection is dubble. For
man was alredie the head of the woman euen before the sin and fall of
Eue and Adam.<note place="margin">3. Tim. 2. d. 13.</note> And Saint Paule alledging the same reason, too
shew that it is not meete that the wyfe should reigne in equall degree
with hir husband, sayth, that the man came not of the woman, but the
woman of the man, and that shee is but a peece of his body. For God
could haue created Eue of the earth as well as he did Adam, but hee
would not. Nay rather he matched the man and the woman toogither
with such condition, that the man knowing his wyfe too bee as his
owne substance and flesh, should bee induced therby too loue hir, (as
wee shall see agein heereafter:) and that the wyfe knowing hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

haue none other being but of the man, should beare hir subiection pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
and with a willing mynd. For if the hand being a member of

of the wyfe: for wee knowe that shee was beguyled. Women ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must remember, that in being subiect too their husbands, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the hyre of Eues sin: and they must consider, that if mariage
had continued sound and vncorrupt, there had bin nothing but ioy both
for man and wyfe. For knowe that things were blissed of God, and
there was not any thing which shoulde not haue turned too gladnesse
and felicitie. But now although Gods blissings shyne foorth euery
where bothe aboue and beneathe: yit are there alwayes tokens of
cursing imprinted in them, so as wee cannot behold nother heauen nor
earth, nor any other creature, but wee may partly perceyue that God
is become a straunger too vs, bycause our father Adam fell from that
noble and excellent state, wheruntoo he was created afore. This is
too bee seene euery where in all things, and specially in mariage. For
women ought too feele the frute of their sinnes: and men feele ynough
of it for their parte. For surely if Eue and Adam had continued in
the ryghtuousnesse that God had giuen them, the whole state of this
earthly lyfe had bin as a Paradise, and mariage had bin so beautifyed,
that man and wyfe being matched toogither, should haue liued in such
accord, as wee see the Angels of heauen doo, among whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but peace &amp; brotherly loue, and eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so had it bin (with vs.) Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as now when a man hath a curst and shreud wyfe, whom he cannot
weeld by any meanes: he must consider with him self, Lo heere the
frutes of original sin, and of the corruption that is in my self. And the
wyfe also on hir side must think, good reason it is that I should receyue
the payment that commeth of my disobedience towards God, for that
I hild not my self in his awe. Thus much concerning the woord sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,
which is set downe heere.</p>
               <p>Now Saint Paule in saying, <hi>As too the Lord,</hi> meaneth not too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:298"/>
make men equall with God, or with our Lord Iesus Christ: for that
were too greate an ouersyght: but he sheweth that the feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
which a woman ought too beare vntoo God, and the subiection
which shee oweth too hir husband, are twoo things that cannot bee put
asunder: lyke as when he exhorted vs erst too link toogither in mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
subiection:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. d. 21.</note> he added this saying, <hi>in the feare of God.</hi> And why?
For if wee pretend too honour God, and to obey him, and in the meane
whyle reiect and despyze our neyghbours, so as euery of vs is wedded
too him self, and will needs be exempted from all lawe and rule: it is
too grosse hipocrisie. Also if a wyfe pretend neuer so great deuotion,
and seeme too bee throughly seasoned with the feare of God, and in the
meane whyle bee a feend, so as there is nothing but scolding and brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and wrangling, and such other thinges with hir at home in hir
owne house: therin shee shewes hir selfe not too haue one sparke of the
feare of God, forasmuch as shee dooth so holde scorne of hir husband
who is hir head, and as it were Gods lieftenant in that behalf. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs marke that Saint Paule hath not set downe this similitude
too match husbandes (who are mortall creatures, yea &amp; very woormes
of the earth) in equall degree with Iesus Christ: but too shewe breef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that forasmuch as our Lord Iesus hath authoritie ouer mariage,
men must haue an eye vntoo him, and euery person submit himselfe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
bycause no man can refuze his part, without despizing of him
which wyll haue wedlocke maynteyned with mutuall dewtie, so as
the man loue his wyfe, and the wyfe be subiect too hir husband. That
is the pith of the matter which wee haue too remember vppon this
streyne.</p>
               <p>Now then let wyues looke well too their dewties, and vnderstand
that when they contend with their husbandes, it is all one as if they
would reiect God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bycause he hath not created them otherwyse than
with condition, and too the end they should bee subiect too their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes.
Trew it is that they will bee soo proud and stately, as to say,
Should my husband haue my head vnder his girdle? Yea, but the
wyfe that dooth so, sheweth that shee is loth that God should haue any
authoritie ouer hir, and would fayne put Gods Lawe vnder hir foote.
Howbeeit, forasmuch as there is none other shift but women must
needes stoope, and vnderstand that the ruine and confuzion of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
came in on their syde, and that through them wee bee all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne,

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:23289:298"/>
(say I) doo vnderstand that all this came of Eue and of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mankynd,
(as Saint Paul telleth vs in another place:) there is none
other way for them but too stoope,<note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> d. 14.</note> and too beare paciently the subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that God hath layd vppon them, which is nothing else but a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
too them too keepe themselues lowely and myld. But if they
lyft vp themselues ageinst their husbandes, and cannot fynd in theyr
hartes too bee ruled by them: it is as it were a setting of their seales
too the sinne of Adam and Eue, and too the disobedience by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
too declare that they be not willing that God should heale that
wound agein, notwithstanding that it bee deadly. Now, when they
doo so make warre ageinst the grace of God: what can come of it but
vtter confuzion? But the wyues that are leaud headed, will not think of
that: but yit is it registred before God, and they must bee fayne too
yeeld an account of it too their vtter confuzion. And therefore let vs
looke that wee keepe this warning better, too the end that euery man
may glorify God in his owne house.</p>
               <p>Also let the husbandes thinke vppon their duety. For although
(to speake properly) they be not subiect to their wyues, bycause their
wyues haue no authoritie ouer them: yit are they aduaunced too that
honor of superioritie with certeyne conditions: namely that they should
not bee cruell towardes their wyues, nor thinke all things graunted
and lawfull which they lift, but that their authority should rather bee a
companionship than a kingship. For doubtlesse the husband in not his
wyues head, too oppresse hir, or too make none account of hir: but let
him vnderstand, that the authority which he hath, dooth bynd him so
much the more too hir. For seeing he is the head, he ought too haue
discretion and skill how too guyde his wyfe and his houshold. And
what is the way too bring that too passe, but too vse gentlenesse and
myldnesse, and too beare discreetly with the frayltie which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
too bee in his wyfe,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. b. 7.</note> according as Saint Peter exhorteth vs. Yee
see then that husbandes must so requyre obedience at their wyues
handes, as they themselues must therwithall doo their owne duetie,
and consider that they shall not bee borne with before God, if they
giue their wyues cause too lifte vp themselues so ageinst them. For
it is certein that if the husband deale discretly and vpryghtly, the wyfe
shall stoope too him, and our Lord will so dispoze hir hart, as the
house shal bee quietly guyded. But the first and cheefe poynt is, that
God bee called vppon. For though a man vse all the meanes that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:299"/>
can bee, yit if he trust to his owne wit, he shall but loose his tyme. And
why? Bycause God will laugh his presumption too scorne. But if
husbandes consider that God holdeth folkes hartes in his hand, and
boweth them as he listeth, and thereuppon doo pray him too giue
them grace and power too win their wyues, that they may agree with
them, and humble themselues too them: them shall they perceyue that
God woorketh in that behalfe. But most commonly it is to be seene,
that men deale roughly with their wyues, and thinke too win them
by playing the termagauntes, so as they sticke not too brooze their
bodies, yea somtymes that the blud followes. These are hangmen
and tormentors that will so martir their wyues: asd yit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they will alledge the superioritie that God hath giuen them.
That superioritye is not diuelish, nother serueth it too make men
lyke brute beastes: but too maynteyne good order and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But the women on their syde doo for the most part inharden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
and when rhey are too marrie, they neuer thinke vppon the
things that God sheweth and teacheth them by his woord: hardly shal
a man fynd one among a hundred, that prayeth vntoo God when shee
is vppon the poynt of mariage. No boubt but they heare it well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
sayd, that the husband must be the head: and (they themselues
will say,) very well: it is true, that if I haue a husband, he must bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
mee, for so is the fashyon of the world, and I must abyde it.
But in the meane whyle there shalbee such ouerweening, or rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish
stoutnesse in them, as they could fynd in their hartes too plucke
God out of his seate, and they would fayne that this matter which wee
reade now, were razed out (of the Scripture,) too the intent they
myght not bee subiect too it. Yea and they make a confederacie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues in that cace, saying: tush, I warrant thee, I will
hold myne owne, and if my husband play the Churle with mee, he shall
well perceyue that I passe not for it, and I will hold him at a bay so
long, that when he sees he doth but looze his labour, he shalbe fayne to
giue ouer his game, and too let mee alone. After this manner (say I)
doo women begin too enter intoo huswyfrye, so as a man shal scar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly
fynd one among a hundred, which is not of that mynd, and dooth not
fully determine vppon it.</p>
               <p>Also the husband on his syde thinks thus: Tush, let mee alone, I
will compasse hir well ynough. As who should say, he were God: who


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:23289:299"/>
hath told vs that there is another maner of discretion too bee vsed in
this behalf. For the way for men too win their wyues, is not too step
too them with stoutnesse, and too play the bedlems with them, or too
vse tyranny ouer them: none of that geere will boote: and yit men
thinke themselues so wyse in their owne conceyt, that they shall scare
their wyues with a grim looke. Too bee short, they dispute of the
matter, &amp; in the meane whyle rob God, as though he had reserued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him self, wherby to teach vs to repayre vnto him, to pray him
to meeken their harts, and to bow them to obedience and myldnesse.</p>
               <p>Therfore it behoueth vs to remember the lesson so much the better,
which is shewed vs heere. And for the same cause dooth Saint Paule
apply the similitude of our Lord Iesus Christ, as well too the one side
as too the other. For he telleth the women that it is for their benefyte
too bee so subiect too their Husbands. And why? Let vs consider the
spirituall state of the Churche. How miserable were our state if wee
were separated from our Lord Iesus Christ? For we should be bereft
of all hope of lyfe, and of all Gods benefyts. And although wee inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many gifts in this world: yit should they turne all too our displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
if wee were not members of our Lord Iesus Christ. Too bee
short, without the sonne of God, there is nothing but scattering heere
beneathe. For he was sent too gather toogither all things that were
scattered afore, insomuch that all our happinesse, ioy, and rest, is too
haue Iesus Christ reigning ouer vs and ruling vs. Now then, there
must be an answerablenesse hereunto in mariage, and the women must
vnderstand, that forasmuch as wedlock is as an image of the spirituall
vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is betwene vs &amp; the sonne of God: it is for their benefyte to
be vnder their husbands, &amp; to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedience, &amp; that it shalbe much
more for their profit, than if they were at libertie too gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and too doo what they li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, without brydling or controlment.
Trew it is that they cannot conceiue it, but who shalbe found wyzer in
the end? God, or Women? If they will needs reply, that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for them too bee in no subiection at all too their husbands, wheras
God for all that hath ordeyned otherwyse, yea euen for their welfare,
and hath declared and giuen sentence that it is so: weene they too get
the vpper hand in pleading so ageinst God? Yee see then that Iesus
Christ is set downe as the sauyour of the bodie, too the end that wyues
should knowe, that God hath preuyded better for their necessities,
than they bee aware of. When they haue well chawed their cud, and


<pb facs="tcp:23289:300"/>
debated what they can with themselues, and gathered all the reasons
that are possible too bee had: yit is it certein that they knowe not so
well what is for their owne profit, as God dooth, who hath put them in
subiection too their husbands, yea euen for their owne welfare, too the
intent they should bee maynteyned, which otherwyse could not bee.</p>
               <p>Agein on the other syde, Saint Paule alledgeth our Lord Iesus
Christ too the Husbands also, too the intent they should not abuse the
authority that is graunted them, nor breake the frendship which ought
too bee maynteyned in wedlocke, by being ouer churlish as they are
woont too bee. And the thing that he setteth them downe in our Lord
Iesus Christ, by demaunding how he hath loued his Churche: is first
and formest that he hath giuen him self for it, and that he spared not
himself when he tooke mans flesh vpon him. In deede al power and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
were giuen vnto him, so as all knees must needs bowe before
him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 10.</note> (as Saint Paule him self sayeth) and all of vs both greate and
small must doo him homage: but yit notwithstanding, what hath hee
doone for his Churche? Listed he too reigne in such sort as too exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyze
tyrannie ouer vs? No: but contrarily he humbled him self, and
wheras he had souerein dominion ouer the Angels of heauen, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
subiect too the Law,<note place="margin">Gala. 4. a. 4.</note> and was called a Seruant, yea and he was
vtterly emptyed for our sakes. Now when wee see that God beareth
vs so inestimable loue in our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 7.</note> that he hath put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in the person of a husband, and voutsafed that wee should bee as
a wyfe vntoo him: I say, when wee see that, should we now which are
but woormes of the earth and a thing of nothing, refuze too follow the
example of the sonne of God, who had no regard of his heauenly glory
and maiestie, too the end too abace himselfe in such wyse for our sakes?
So then, it is ynough too meeken the hartes both of the one partie and
of the other, if there be not too beastly leaudnesse, or rather stark diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse
as wel in the husbands as in the wyues. For considering that
our Lord Iesus Christ dyd so abace himselfe, for the loue that he bare
vnto vs which are but carions and nothing woorth: and also hath told
vs that there is nothing better, than for the wyues too bee subiect too
their husbandes, and the husbandes too beare with their wyues: if that
moue them not, it is a signe that they bee too beastly hygh mynded, or
rather that there is nother wit nor reason in them. For were there but
one drop, surely the thing that Saint Paul telleth vs, ought too make
vs amend all things, that myght hinder the doing of our dewties, as


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:23289:300"/>
well on the one syde as on the other. And were this well regarded:
doubtlesse men shoulde see much more quietnesse in their houses then
they doo: and man and wyfe should not bee as Cattes and Dogges in
snatching and byting one at another. But the very mischeefe is, that
a man can see no feare of God among them. For ought not men too
call too mynd both euening and morning, the grace that is shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs by the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ? And when all too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
had well thought on it, and set their myndes too it, the maryed
men ought also too thinke (particularly) with themselues, to what end
hath God shewed himselfe so louing, so kynd, and so pitifull towardes
mee? Seeyng he hath aduaunced mee too such dignitie, it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that I should fashion my selfe lyke vntoo him. Now he will haue
mee too behaue my selfe towardes my wyfe, as Iesus Christ hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
himselfe towardes mee. Is not this ynough too breake the
hartes that were as hard as stone, yea or as steele? Yis surely. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
if the women on their syde were myndfull of their redemption
and saluation: then should their hard hartes needes bee softened, and
they would not harden themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es any more too such stubbornnesse, as
they doo, but they would submit themselues too the yoke of our Lord
Iesus Christ, that they myght bee parttakers of the benefyte which
he hath purchaced for them by his death and passion. Wee see then
that when the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ is preached too vs indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently:
most men gayne nothing by it, for they forsake it in all their
lyfe.</p>
               <p>And by the way wee haue too marke further, that although hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
bee froward, and wyues vntoward too bee ruled, yea and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
vncorrigible: yit is that no release too them, that eyther of them
both should not doo their duetie. As for example: It may bee, that if
a husband had a gentle and tractable wyfe (as I touched afore,) he
on his syde could beare with hir, and there should bee a maruelous
good lyking and lyfe betwixt them. But peraduenture one man will
say, he hath a drunkard or a glutton, another, that his wyfe is giuen too
garishnesse and ouer much brauery, so as all that shee can rap and
rend, is too little too trim hir and decke hir withall: and another, that
his wyfe is an ydle huzwyfe, and will doo nothing. Well, these
things may haue some colour before men: yea and (as I sayd afore)
if the matter concerned but the parties themselues: euery of them
myght haue their defence at hand, to cast of all yoke. But the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band


<pb facs="tcp:23289:301"/>
must thinke in that cace, I haue an ill dispozed woman, or a sot,
or one that hath nother manners nor good behaueour, nor any care at
all of hir houshold: but how doo I also behaue my selfe, not only in
these worldly affayres, but also towardes God? Now when the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
shall haue bethought himselfe well, and examined his owne
faultes throughly: he will hold his peace, &amp; paciently beare with his
wyfes faultes, vntyll God giue her the grace too amend them. And
in the meane whyle, howsoeuer the world go, let him not ceasse too
play the good husband in applying himselfe too his wyfe, too win hir
vntoo God. For he is not set in degree of superioritie, but for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyte
and welfare of his yoke fellowe. And forasmuch as it is an
inuiolable law, the same reason also must perswade the women. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that if a woman haue a drunkard, or haunter of Tauernes and
Tippling houses, or a Gamester, or a Spendall, or an vnthrift and
a ryotter, or a Churle that is neuer in quyet with her, so that, do what
shee can too obey him and to please him, shee can neuer haue any peace
or good wyll at his hand: let hir consider, Alas, it is Gods squoorge
vppon mee, for I haue not bin as I ought too bee in obeying my God,
and in submitting my selfe to his wyll. For how haue I applyed my
selfe too serue and honour him? How haue I quitte my selfe of the
charge that he hath committed too mee? Let the wyfe thinke vppon
those things, and then let hir conclude, that howsoeuer shee fare, yit is
it not for mortall creatures too breake the bond wherin God will haue
vs bound: for that were a stryuing ageinst him. And therfore must I
submit my selfe too him that is my head: and although he bee terrible,
yit becommeth it mee too bee subiect too my God, who hath my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes
hart in his hand, and can alter it when he listeth. And I must
not prouoke him too win mee with strokes of the Cudgell: for in so
dooyng God would bee discontented both with him and mee. So then
the faultes of the wyfe cannot discharge the husband from keeping the
lawe vnbroken which God hath ordeyned, that is too wit, from lyuing
toogither both in one accord. Lykewise the vyces of the husband, shall
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now Saint Paule too confirme this exhortation the better, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

of our God wee haue, if wee consider by

that wee were cursed afore
in Adam. And now Saint Paule setteth
foorth how wee bee made parttakers of
the grace that is purchaced for vs by our

Baptim is a visible figure and record vntoo vs, according too
our rudenesse and infirmitie, too make vs the better too perceyue the
grace of our God, which passeth all vnderstanding of man. Now
first of al there is the woord <hi>Sanctify,</hi> which importeth that we should
bee separated from the world, too bee knit vntoo the sonne of God.
And this doctrine is such, as wee can neuer knowe it ynough. For
(as I haue sayd afore) wee must alwayes compare the state wherein
God fyndeth vs, with the state wheretoo he calleth vs: For from our
moothers womb wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>fore God. Therefore he draweth vs out
of the dungeon of death: from thence dooth he gather vs vp too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And by the woord <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> S. Paule meaneth the chaunge
which ought as it were too rauish and too astonish vs, as oft as wee
consider what wee were, and what wee should bee styll if God pitied
vs not.</p>
               <p>But let vs come too the meane that I spake of. He sayeth, <hi>that
our Lord Iesus Christ hath washed vs.</hi> No dout but this is too bee
referred too his death and passion. For how could wee appeere before
God as it were with our countenances vpryght, but that our sinnes
are done away by the sacrifyze that was offered too set vs at one with
God. Then vntill wee bee wasshed and scoured cleane by the blud of
our Lord Iesus Christ, wee bee fowler before God than any leapar:


<pb facs="tcp:23289:303"/>
wee bee full of all maner of filth and infection: and too bee short, all
that wee can bring shall but prouoke Gods wrath, and the vertewes
that men esteeme greatest, shalbee but lothsomnesse. Therfore wee
must imbrace the sacrifyce wherby our Lord Iesus Christ hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyled
vs too God his father, and his blud must flowe downe vppon our
soules, too clenze vs from our filthinesse and spots. Neuerthelesse it
is not without cause that Saint Paule sets vs downe baptim heere,
not that wee bee made cleane by that: nother was it his meaning too
turne vs asyde from the death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ.
But forasmuch as wee bee dust and grosse, and vnderstand not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
benefyts so well as were requisyte: therfore Saint Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him self too our rudenesse and infirmitie, hath shewed vs here
our wasshing by a visible signe. That wee may the better profit our
selues by this maner of speeche, let vs consider too what end baptim
was ordeyned, and whertoo it serueth. When our Lord Iesus Christ
commaunded vs too bee baptyzed in his name, ment he too turne away
our fayth from his bludshed? Ment he that baptim should take the
roome of his death and passion, to performe the office of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
No surely. For Baptim is but on Incum and an appendant too the
death and passion of our Lord Iesus Christ: and if it did not direct vs
thither, certeynely it were but a tryfling Ceremony. As much is too

This is my bodie (sayeth he) which is giuen for you. Trew it
is that is sheweth well what our ordinarie foode is: but therwithall he
sendeth vs also too his death and passion. For had he not made satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for our sinnes, and shed his blud to wash away our spots: what
should it boote vs now too haue baptim and his supper ministred and

                  </gap>nds
vppon the corruptible and transitorie element. For what is the water?


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:23289:303"/>
If it stand but one day, it will corru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

soules for euer, and get vs a purenesse that shall continew after death,
though wee our selues doo turne too rottennesse? If this power cannot
bee in the water: wee must of necessitie repayre too the death and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Lord Iesus Christ. And in dede the water also is a figure
of his blud and of his holy spirit. Then let vs mark that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
did then wash vs, when he shed his blud wherby he clenzed vs.
That is the meane wherby wee may resort vntoo God with full trust
that wee shalbee recey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed as ryghtuous and perfect, bycause he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not our sinnes too our charge. Mark that for one poynt.</p>
               <p>Now (as Saint Peter sayeth in his first Epistle) wee be was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed
with the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ, by the holy Ghost. Wee see
then that wee haue the substance and truthe of our saluation in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the sonne of God. And moreouer wee haue too note also, that
he communicateth him self vntoo vs, and therby putteth vs in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and fruition of all his goods through the power of the holy Ghost.
And how happeneth it then that Saint Paule hath made no mention
heere, of the blud that clenzeth vs, and of the woorking of the holy
Ghost? It seemeth that hee hath forgotten the cheef thing, and buzieth
him self about a thing that is very small. I haue told you alredye that
he ment not too abridge any thing that belonged too the sonne of God,
that wee should not seeke the whole fulnes of our saluation in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and settle our fayth alonly vppon him: nother ment he too dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
the holy Ghost of his office, but he had respect of our infirmitie.
And that is the cause why he set downe the signe wherby the thing that
(of it self) is too hygh and too farre hidden from our vnderstanding,
is set before our eyes. That is the pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of the thing which we haue
too beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>Now of this declaration wee may receyue a very profitable lesson
in generall: that is too wit, that the trew and lawfull vse of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is too leade vs directly too our Lord Iesus Christ, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse
wee make them but as Idols. And (therfore) in poperie
Baptim is but as a Charme, bycause they think there is no saluation
but by the water. I let passe the things that they haue pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to it of their
owne deuyzing. For they haue corrupted and mard the very instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Iesus Christ, by mingling baptim with the superstitions that
are knowen of. But let vs put the cace they vsed nothing else but the
pure water: yit is it diuelish opinion that Baptim is able of it self to


<pb facs="tcp:23289:304"/>
saue vs. For by that meanes our Lord Iesus Christ is as good as
thrust away, so as they make none account of him. For they stand po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vppon the visible signe, and are (as yee would say) vtterly doted
vppon it. In lyke cace are they with all the rest of their Ceremonies.
So much the more therefore dooth it stand vs on hand too beare this
lesson in mynd, That too apply the Sacraments too a ryght vse, and
too such vse as God alloweth and ordeyneth: they must guyde vs too
our Lord Iesus Christ: Lyke as in Baptim, wee see but the water:
but therby we must be lifted vp hygher to the blud of the sonne of God,
assuring our selues that it is not the water that maketh vs cleane, but
that it is only a warrant of the washing that was gotten for vs, when
our Lord Iesus Christ was crucifyed for vs. In the Supper wee
haue bread and wyne. Now to hold our selues to that which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out eyes, were a withdrawing of our selues from Iesus Christ.
Our fayth therfore must bee lifted vp, and conueyed too him in whom
all the partes of our saluation are inclozed. Forasmuch then as wee
haue the whole perfection and fulnesse of all good things in the onely
Sonne of God: it is thither that wee must looke vp and labour too
atteyne, when the Sacramentes are set afore vs, for that is the very
office of them: or else wee pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uert all, and it is (as yee would saye)
an vnhallowing of the thing that God hath halowed too our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte,
if our Lord Iesus Christ bee separated from the visible
signes.</p>
               <p>Wee haue also too note, that wee communicate not with Iesus
Christ, but by the grace of the holy Ghost. Yit notwithstanding let vs
not hold scorne of the helpes that our Lord hath ordeyned for vs, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knewe them too bee requisite for our infirmities sake. Why
be we not taught simply, that if wee runne too our Lord Iesus Christ,
in him wee shall fynde our washing and clenzing? It seemeth that that
ought too suffyze vs, and that the water of Baptim is but a vayle too
keepe vs from comming vntoo Iesus Christ. Yea, but let vs see a little
what our owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udenesse is. If wee had the myndes of Angels,
wee should no more neede this outward Baptim, than the Angels do.
But forasmuch as wee bee earthly, and it is hard for vs too atteyne
vntoo God, and the secretes of his heauenly kingdome: it is for our
behoofe too bee helped after that fashion. And it is a wonderfull gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
goodnesse of God, that he stoopeth so too our infirmitie, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
it with mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and conuenient remedyes. So little then dooth


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:23289:304"/>
Baptim hinder vs from comming too the sonne of God, (so wee bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too apply it too our behoofe,) or keepe our fayth from amyng at
him: that without it wee should bee hild downe still heere, and wauer
continually as floting in water. But when wee see how water is cast
vppon the chyldes head, there we ought too mynd the blud of our Lord
Iesus Christ, and too consider that lyke as water washeth away the
filth of the body, so the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ is the very clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of our soules.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the inwoorking of the holy Ghost, wee knowe it
is lykened too water: and that is bycause he maketh vs parttakers of
the benefytes that were purchaced for vs by our Lord Iesus Christ:
and agein, bycause that by his grace and woorking, wee bee renewed,
and dye vntoo the world, and all our owne corruption is put away, to
the intent wee should come too the newnesse of lyfe which is gotten for
vs by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esurrection of our Lord Iesus Christ. All this must wee
behold in Baptim.</p>
               <p>And lykewyse the Supper must serue vs as a ladder too clymb vp
too our Lord Iesus Christ, and too bee throughly confirmed that he
dwelleth in vs, and that wee bee made one with him, so as he quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs as the braunches of a tree, which take their strength from the
roote, and as the body of man, which draweth his strength from the
head. And so the thing that wee haue too marke vppon this streyne,
is that the Sacramentes doo not turne vs away from the trust which
wee ought too put wholly in our Lord Iesus Christ, nor make vs too
start asyde one way or other, but that being perswaded by them that
Iesus Christ suffizeth, wee fynd all our contentation and rest in him,
too the end also that all the honour which belongeth too him, bee
yeelded vntoo him. For it is not for vs too abridge him of that
which his heauenlye father hath giuen him. Let that serue for one
poynt.</p>
               <p>And that is also the cause why Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>hauing clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
it.</hi> Then yeeldeth he the dignitie of clenzing vs too our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. True it is, that if he had not bin appoynted too bee the
Mediator, he could not haue doone it: for it is a woorke altoogither
belonging too God: but forasmuch as he was sent too that end, and
had that office committed vntoo him, therfore are wee washed by
him. And in deede it is not only in his humane nature that wee bee
washed by his blud: but wee must also beare in mynd how the Apostle


<pb facs="tcp:23289:305"/>
in the Epistle too the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 14.</note> sayth, that he suffered in spirit. How
in spirit? That is too say, his death must not bee considered of vs, as
if a man dyed: but wee must vnderstand that he is in such wyse the
sonne of God manifested in the flesh, as he hath vttered his euerlasting
power. And that when he was so abaced, and emptyed, although there
appeered nothing but cursednesse in his death: yit ought wee too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that he wrought in that behalfe with a woonderfull power,
such as surmounteth all our vnderstanding, and all that wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue.
Yee see then that Saint Paule hath very well confirmed the
thing that I told you, that is too wit, that all our fayth is but a waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and vanishing opinion, vntyll it bee so grounded in our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, as it rest wholly there, and nother swarue nor stagger one
way nor other. For as soone as wee go about too adde one thing or
other too our Lord Iesus Christ: surely he shaketh vs of, as vnworthie
too haue any part or portion of his benefytes. Therefore wee must
leaue him that which is his owne: that is too wit, that he onely clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
vs: according also as it is of his mere grace, that wee haue all
ryghtuousnesse before God.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paules speaking of Baptim (as I sayd afore) is too
the end that wee considering our owne abilitie, should bend our selues
too the confirming our fayth by these meanes which are behooffull for
vs. For he that reiecteth Baptim as superfluous, dooth well bewray
that he knoweth not him self. Insomuch that when wee haue well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

cause did he terme his temple his house, his dwelling place, &amp; his rest,

not to harden the people in their superstitions. Too what end then?
He ment too drawe them to him by little and little, which were vnable
to come to him at the first dashe. For where are the wings that wee
should stye aboue the clouds withall? But our fayth must stye vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

on the contrary part hath shewed it selfe too much, that is too wit, that
men haue taken occasion too hold themselues downe, and too intangle
themselues in Ceremonies: and wheras they should haue lifted them
vp, they haue abuzed them, by turning them too the cleane contrarie.
And that is the cause also why the Prophets were continually occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in rebuking the Iewes, for that they thought that God had dwelt in
the materiall temple. How now (sayeth Esay?) Hath not the Lord
made all these thinges?<note place="margin">Esay. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yee would locke him vp in some Cabane of your owne
buylding. Wherby he sheweth that it is too grosse a folly for men too
snarle themselues after that sort in visible figures, Ceremonies, and
Sacramentes, and too dwell vppon them, wheras they should bee led
vntoo God. Now forasmuch as this hath reigned in all ages, Saint
Paule too redresse it, sayth, that wee haue our washing warranted in
Baptim, vnder the figure of water. Yea, but yit must wee haue an eye
too the woord, sayeth he. For if there were no teaching, too shewe vs
that wee fynd the things in our Lord Iesus Christ, which are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
too vs in Baptim, and that it is in his person that wee haue the
full performance and assurednesse of them: certeinly Baptim would
turne vs away from God, and it were better too haue none at all. For
it were an euill thing, if wee should bee withdrawen from the sonne of
God, too giue our selues too the corruptible world. Therefore let vs
bee well ware that wee separate not the Sacramentes from the word
at any tyme. And hereby wee see what Christianitie there is in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of folke. For all is well with them, if they bee Baptyzed, nother


<pb facs="tcp:23289:306"/>
consider they that the hauing of the signe without the promise added
too it, is but a deceyuable &amp; vnprofitable thing. Wherto serueth a seale
when it is set but too a peece of Lether, or too bare parchment, paper,
or cloth? Surely it were too no purpose: for it ought too confirme and
ratifye some Euidence, whether it bee of gift or otherwyse. So is it
with the Sacramentes, when they bee not matched with the woord.
A man shall see a seale there, howbeeit too no purpose, for he shall see
no benefyte come of it. And surely they that continew still doted in
their ignorance, bycause they were Baptyzed as soone as they came
intoo the world: doo shewe therin too leaud an vnthankfulnesse: for
they falsifye Gods truth, as much as they can. If a man should coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
a Seale, it were felonie, though it were but in a cace of fyue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
But they that are so drowned in their ignorance, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abyde to bee drawen out of it: are falsifyers and forgers in a thing
that is more worth than al the world. For heere the cace concerneth the
ratifying of the things that haue bin purchaced vs by the death and
passion of the sonne of God, as hath bin declared alredy.</p>
               <p>Furthermore let vs marke also, that Saint Paule speaketh of the

wee cannot vse them without turning them too vncleannesse, and

vs that all these things are giuen vs, too the intent that by vsing his
liberalitie, first wee should bee prouoked too serue and honour him,
and too bee rauished in loue of him: and secondly bee confirmed in the
hope of the heritage that is promised vs. For seeing he makes vs
feele his gooddesse aforehand in this world: it is certein that when
wee come too the glorye whereuntoo he calleth vs, wee shall then
haue our fill of the good things, whereof there is but some little tast
shewed vs as yit. Yee see then that all the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the body, are made holy by the woord. And what shal bee
done then in things concerning the euerlasting saluation of our soules?
Is it not much more reason that they should bee sanctifyed by the same
woord?</p>
               <p>Now then, too bee short, wee see that the Papistes are destitute
of the power of the Sacramentes through their owne misbeleef, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they haue robbed our Lord Iesus Christ of his power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tew,
and conuayed ouer his prerogatiue vntoo corruption and dead
things. And therefore God hath so blynded them through his ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vengeance, that they thinke themselues too haue the Sacraments
styll, but yit notwithstanding without the woord. As for example,
in deede in Baptyzing they mumble ynough, and they make theyr
coniurations and charmes, and all in an vnknowen language, but
yit is their speaking rather too the diuel, than too the Godfathers and
Godmoothers that are there, too answer for the teaching of the child,
and for the common instruction of the whole Church. Too bee short,
in Popish Baptim there is not the woord, and therefore (as much as

God hath not suffered the rememberance of his goodnesse too bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

that our Baptim as wee receyued it then had bin vnauaylable,
nay rather it had bin a cursed treacherie, if wee had gone no further
than so. And why? For wee had bin peruerted, and wee had falsifyed
the ordinance of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>In lyke cace is it with the Supper. Of a truth there is no supper
remayning now adayes in poperie. For that which they call Gods
Table, is a flat mockage and reproche too the death and passion of our
Lord Iesus Christ, bycause it is knit in vnseparable bond with the
masse, and wee knowe that the masse is an vtter renouncing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyze
that was made by the sonne of God. But howseuer the cace
stand, although they vsed some conuenient resemblance too the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of our Lord Iesus Christ: yit for all that, they haue not the
woord. For they mumble betweene the teeth in their consecrating (as
they terme it) of the spiritual Sacrament, which they haue peruerted.
For how doo they vse it? They prattle vppon the bread, and blowe
vppon it, too chaunge it intoo the bodie of Iesus Christ, at least too
their seeming. Also they chatter ouer the Chalice, and beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
on hand that all is chaunged there, and that they haue made
such an alteration, as though they were able too create a new world.
For it is much more too make a peece of bread too become the sonne of
God, than too haue created a whole world. But Satan hath so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
the Papistes, that they beeleeue they doo all that. And by
what power? not of Gods woord. Howbeeit (as I sayd) the woord
that Saint Paule treateth of heere, is not a bare found, but a teaching
that edifyeth our fayth, so as wee receyue the promis that is made vs

washing and clenzing of vs, is too set vs <hi>as excellent and singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

let vs note that wee be washed, not only through the forgiuenesse of our

bee renewed by the holy Ghost too fyght ageinst all the temptations
of the world, and too mortifye the vyces of our flesh, and all the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

that it is a dubble grace which wee receyue of our Lord Iesus. That
is too wit, bycause he hath satisfyed for vs and discharged vs of our
dettes: wee come before God as ryghtuous. For our sinnes are not
layed too our charge, but wee bee reconcyled freely, at leastwyse as

too his lyking: So Saint Paule telleth vs in this text, that the sonne
of God wyll lyke well of vs, if wee weare the badges that he giueth
vs: that is too say, first if vppon the knowledge of our owne wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wee humble our selues too seeke the pardon that he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vs, too the end that beyng quit at Gods hand, wee may call vppon

labour too put away more and more the things that wee haue of our
selues, that God may reigne and lyue in vs, and wee bee gouerned by
his holy spirit, so as our lyfe may bee nothing else but a yeelding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

That in effect is the thing that wee haue too beare in mynde.
For where it is sayd, that Iesus Christ is giuen vs to be our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

bee doone by our owne power or cunning: but all is attributed heere
to Iesus Christ, and Saint Paul  sheweth, that it is his office to make
vs so excellent. For it is certein, that when men will needes come too

               <p>And for the same cause also doth he say, <hi>that he may present vnto

that al the outward shewe and gay glistering which wee can haue

too the intent it should be pure and ryghtuous: but he intended too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
that our purenenesse or cleannesse, is not too please the syght of
the world, that wee may be prayzed and commended heere belowe, as
hipocrits are, whom men gape and gaze at a great way of, clapping
their hands at them, and esteeming them holyer than the Angels: but
that it is much better for a man not too bee so precyze, but too walk
playnly, and if there bee imperfections in him, too let them be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,

though men haue neuer so maruelous opinion of vs, all (say

then what is the end of our Redemption? wherfore are wee reconcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

Iesus Christ? Wherfore also are wee sanctifyed and regenerated? It
is too the intent we myght in the end be vnblamable before God. And
what in this world? There will euer bee much too bee blamed and to
bee found fault with: but let vs bee contented that our sinnes shal not
bee layd too our charge. And this is well woorth the noting, bycause
there were a sort of malicious and leaud heads in old tyme, which
surmyzed an Angelicall perfection in their brayne, as though men
myght atteyne too a full and perfect ryghtuousnesse in this world, and
that was euen an abolishing of the couenant that God hath made with
vs, wherin consisteth our saluation. For therin are twoo inseperable
poynts: that is too wit, the forgiuenesse of sinnes, and the newbirth,
as it is sayd in the seuen and thirtith of Ezechiell, in the thirteenth
of Ieremie, and in effect euery where. These things then cannot bee
put asunder, namely that God dooth so receyue and adopt vs, as wee
neede still too haue our sinnes forgiuen vs, till wee bee ridde quyte and
cleane of al earthly corruption: and agein, that wee must go foreward
dayly in newnesse of lyfe. But there are yit still of those diuells incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
which would abolish the remission of sinnes, insomuch that they

               <p>Agein, forasmuch as heere is mention made of man and wyfe, let
them that are maryed, consider what damnation is prepared for them,
if they bee not moued and touched too the quicke by the things that are
told them heere: namely that on the one syde the heathen folk shall
ryze vp to giue witnesse ageinst them at the latter day, and that (on the
other syde) the order of nature teacheth them what they haue to doo: so
that if they liue not in concord and freendship, as is shewed them here,
they doo (as it were) wilfully withstand God, yea and vtterly forget
themselues, and become woorse than brute beastes. And furthermore
let them knowe also, that forasmuch as mariage is a figure of the holy
vnion that is betweene the some of God and al the faythfull: the same
ought also too hold them in the greater reuerence: and although there
happen many contentions, yit ought they too subdew them, and too let
them lye as dead, and too consider that sith our Lord Iesus sitteth ouer
them, it is too shewe that wedlocke was blissed in such wyse by God
his father at the first, that he himselfe also hath ratifyed the same blis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by his death and passion, yea and reconcyled vs too God, in such
wyse as the husband may perceyue as it were in a (lyuely) picture,
that he is all one with his wyfe, howbeeit in such wyse vnder the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of God, as both twayne of them ought too serue him with one

feare of God, and the least occasion in the world wyll bee ynough too
set them at oddes, so as they shall forget all that is conteyned heere: Or
(too say the truth) they neuer once thinke of it. The loue that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them is led and prouoked by their lustes, and not grounded vpon
any knowledge that they haue of the discharging of their dewtie, that
the husband considereth how he ought too beare with his wyfe, how he
ought too guyde hir in the feare of God, and how he ought too loue hir
as a helper allotted vntoo him (for his ease) that he myght walke
as hee ought too doo: Nor that the wyfe humbleth hir selfe too hir
husband, or bendeth hir wittes too please him, bycause shee percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
that shee is expressely giuen vntoo him, too bee a furtherance and
not a hinderance vntoo him. There is no talke nor inckling of al this:
but if all bee well considered, (I say) the common and most ordinarie
state is, that in euery house a man shall fynde diuelishnesse, cursyng,

shee is towardes hir husband: yit if hir husband had any wealth or

reygneth welneere euerywhere.</p>
               <p>Agein, euery man complaynes of his wyfe, saying: I cannot liue

and there is nothing in hir but froward stubbornnesse. I
cannot speake a woord too hir, but shee payes mee agein with foure
for it. Now surely, such as men make their wyues, such haue they
of them. For were there no more but this that I spake of, namely
that men doo (as it were) in spyte of God maynteyne their wyues
wrongfull quarelles: ought not God too yeeld them their deserued

he shall fynde that there may bee a sorte of fond loues, and a forte of

vppon God, and is grounded on his woord: hardly shal he among
a hundred houses fynd one, where the husband and the wyfe are so
well qualifyed. Yit notwithstanding wee bee vnexcuzable, if wee
profit not in this doctrine. So then, euery of vs must fyght ageinst his
vnruly affections: &amp; if a man haue not such a wyfe as he could wish, let


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:23289:312"/>
him vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that God intendeth to try his pacience by that meanes
and let him consider wel, that he behaueth himselfe woorse towardes
our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the husband, too whom all of vs are
maryed. And therefore let him not bee rigorous towardes his wyfe,
seeing that he himselfe deserueth too bee so humbled. Too bee short,
let euery man so mynd this doctrine, that when the husband hath not
all things in his wife that he desyreth, he may thinke thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
yit am I bound vntoo hir, yea and I am not onely bound vntoo
my wyfe, but also vntoo God, who is the mayster of mariage, and too
our Lord Iesus Christ, who is as a mirrour and lyuely image of it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs. Therefore am I bound too doo my duetie towardes hir, and
both too loue hir, and too beare with hir, although there bee vyces in
hir. Yit is it not ment, that the husband should foster and feede his
wyues vyces. For as wee must warne and counsell one another: so
must there not bee any such neerenesse or linking toogither, but that
if the husband see any thing amisse in his wife, he must at leastwyse tel
hir of it, yea and rebuke hir, and labour and indeuer too bring hir intoo
the right way, as much as he can possibly.</p>
               <p>But yit howsoeuer the world go, so long as wee bee maried, this
standes continually, that wee cannot chaunge the order which our
Lord hath set, yea euen too bee vnuiolable. Therfore wee must not
passe what the persons are: insomuch that although a woman haue too
rough &amp; sharp a husband, &amp; such a one as dealeth ouer hardly with hir,
yit must shee alwayes consider, that he is hir husband, and that when
God matched them toogither, he allotted hir that portion, bycause
shee was woorthie of it: and let hir also enter intoo examination of hir
sinnes, that shee may pray God too take away that rod, and too deale
more gently with hir. Then lyke as the wyfe must on hir syde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the bond of mariage, and submit hir selfe, euen without respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what hir husband is: so when the husband hath not a wyfe too his
lyking, let him thinke lykewyse, my wyfe dooth not hir duetie, I
cannot lyue with hir: but yit dooth wedlocke dure styll. Who ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it? God. Then if I forget my duetie, and reuenge mee of my
wife, or fall too stoutnesse without regarding what belongs too my
charge: it is not ageinst a mortall creature, that I shall bend my selfe.
When the husband ouershootes himselfe after that sorte, surely he
fyghteth ageinst God, and indeuereth too disanull the thing that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable
by nature. So then let euery of vs put this doctrine better


<pb facs="tcp:23289:313"/>
in vre on his owne behalfe, and let not onely maryed folkes, but
also all men in generall vnderstande, that wee cannot estraunge
our selues one from another, and become vnkynde, mercilesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacient
one toward another, but wee must bee as witlesse creatures
that haue no reason nor regard from whence they come, or to what end
wee liue in this world. That is the effect of the things which we haue
too beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>And if wee rgarded well the Prophets reason,<note place="margin">Esay. 58. b. 7.</note> surely wee shoulde

of vs gaue himselfe too consider what care he hath of his owne person,
how tenderly he cherisheth all the partes of his bodie euen too the least
toe of his foote, how carefully he forecasteth that nothing may want
him, and how prouident he is in all respectes for it, so as if any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

himself in health: I say, if euery of vs bethought himself through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after that fashyon: surely then would it bee a good teaching too vs
too doo the lyke too our neyghbours, that is too say, too al men: and
much more consequently, the fathers too their children, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
too their fathers, the husbandes too their wyues, and the wyues to
their husbandes, and so foorth mutually according as it hath pleased
our Lord too linke vs in neerer bond, as I haue sayde afore. And if

then must it needes followe that thou art no man. For (as I sayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)

bodie should fall too banding, and too deuiding of it selfe intoo facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
nother is it possible that it should so. Then if euery of vs bee so
wedded to his owne profit, that in the meane whyle he disdeyne others
through pryde, or else bee cruell, so as if hee see all the miseries in the

to beare with any thing, or to forgiue it: is it not a signe that wee haue
forgotten our owne nature?</p>
               <p>Wherfore too the intent wee may fare the better by this doctrine,
let vs wey well these woordes of Saint Paule, <hi>that neuer any

man hated his owne fleshe, but that euery man nurrisheth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth

God too send vs his Angels from heauen, or neede wee too take much
payne too learne this art or cunning? (No:) wee bee but too much
giuen to it alredy by nature. Sith it is so, euery of vs beares his owne
euidence rolled in record ageinst himselfe, and his owne indytement
redie framed: there shall neede no long examination before God. For
the more carefull that men haue bin for their owne bodyes, the more
forecasting they haue bin for the mayntenance of it, and (to bee short)
the mo signes that they shewe of louing themselues: the greeuouslyer
shall they bee condemned before God, bycause they haue not doone
the lyke towardes them which are their owne flesh, yea though they
were most vnknowen and of the furthest countrie in the world, as I
sayd afore. And if this bee generall for all: what shall become of it,
when the sonne setteth himselfe with all outrage and stubbornnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
his father, so as he hath no meeknesse too suffer himselfe too bee
gouerned by him, but euen vtterly shaketh him of, for whom he ought
to spend himselfe euen too the death? Also when the fathers on their
syde vse nothing but bitternesse toowardes their children, or gouerne
them in such wyse, as they do but prouoke them to impacience: When
the husbandes deale so roughly with their wyues, as it may vtterlye
discorage them, and cast them intoo sorrowe, so as they shall let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
looce, and fall disorderedly too all manner of leaudnesse: When
the women lykewyse bee stiffenecked, and cannot bee brought to good
order: I say, when these disorders are among vs: let vs assure our
selues there needeth none other record too condemne vs, than the care
that euery of vs hath had of himselfe, in that wee haue bin myndfull of
our owne welfare, and labored (earnestly) for it, and in the meane
whyle broken the bond that our Lord had set among vs, and euery of
vs drawen alone by himself, and forgotten all duetie of louing kynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
insomuch that wee would (if wee had could) haue made euery
of vs a new world. Truly there is no man of that abilitie, that he can
forbeare the helpe of his neyghbours: and yit are wee loth that our
neyghbours should dwel with vs, yea or that they should bee counted
in the number of men: there is not that man which would not reigne
alone lyke a Lord. But this vnkyndnesse and leaudnesse are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
too shewe that wee bee not woorthie too inioy the benefytes
which God dealeth too vs in this transitory lyfe. For sith wee bee too


<pb facs="tcp:23289:314"/>
much wedded vntoo it, and mynd it more carefully than wee should do:
wee bee so giltie, as there is not that man which may open his mouth
too reply or too alledge any excuce for himselfe.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule hauing told vs what wee ought too knowe, yea
and too iudge of our owne nature, returneth agein too that which hee
had touched afore, that is too wit, that such as professe themselues too
bee members of the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ, ought to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by his example, too liue quietly, freendly, and agreeingly with
their wyues. <hi>No man</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>loueth him self, but he loueth his
wyfe</hi> (also.) Uerely God hath ordeyned wedlocke, in such wyse, as
the wyfe must bee as the bodie of hir husband. Therfore if a man loue
him self, his wyfe must bee matched with him, or else it shalbee a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
loue. It is a thing that men ought most too abhorre, that the
thing which is most holy in mans lyfe, should bee vtterly abaced. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is so, he that loueth him self, will loue his wyfe. <hi>For wee bee of
his flesh, wee bee of his bones.</hi> Heere he toucheth a thing that hee
spake not of before. For when he did set downe the example of our
Lord Iesus Christ, it was in alledging that he spared not him self,
but did shead his blud to wash vs from our filthinesse and vncleannesse.
We then were defyled &amp; stayned before God, &amp; our Lord Iesus Christ
found the meanes too bring vs in his fauour agein. And how? Euen
by his owne bludshed. But heere hee alledgeth another reason, too
confirme the matter yit better: which is, that <hi>wee bee bone of his
bones, and flesh of his flesh.</hi> In so saying, he dooth vs too vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that when men doo theyr duetie, it is too theyr owne benefyte.
For therby they may taste the inestimable and infinite grace of God,
in that euery man accordyng too his degree, dooth in his mariage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the vnion that is betweene them selues and our Lorde Iesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>The thing therfore which Saint Paule intendeth, is yit agayne to
remoue the ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wee lyue in freendshyp togither, accordyng to the image therof which
wee haue in the loue that he bare vs in his death and passion, whiche

               <p>Howbeeit, before wee goe any further, let vs see why and in what
sense Saint Paule saith, that wee bee of the bones of our Lord Iesus
Christ, and of his flesh, and members of his body. For he is descended


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23289:314"/>
of Adams linage,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. a. 3.</note> and is called the seede of Dauid. And although he
was conceyued after a woonderful maner in the wombe of the Uirgin,
yit tooke he mans fleshe vpon hym, and became very man. Howbeit
he saith, that he is the sonne of Man, too shewe that he hath taken a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is common too vs, wherein he hath made hym selfe familiar
with vs.<note place="margin">Hebr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 14.</note> And in deede (as saith the Apostle in the Epistle too the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes)
he is not ashamed too call vs brothers.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come too that which is sayd heere. It seemeth
that Saint Paule would make Iesus Christ as it were the roote of
mankynd, so as wee should descend of him: for he calleth vs his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring.
But wee haue too marke, that for asmuch as our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ was shaped of the seede of Abraham, too performe the
thyngs that were promised, yea and that he could not bee the Mediator
betweene God and vs, except he had byn of our nature: (for he could
not haue amended our misdoinges wherthrough wee were bounde too
endlesse damnation, vnlesse he had clothed hym selfe with our body, and
had also a soule, too the end too present hym self in the person of al men:
and so it behoued our Lord Iesus Christ too bee our flesh in our body:)
wee may say that he is of our bones and of our flesh. And why? He is
descended of Adams race, as I sayd afore. But howsoeuer the cace
stand, he was conceyued maruelously by the holy Ghoste. Howbeeit
there is another respect. For yit for all this he ceasseth not too bee the
second Adam,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. c. 21. 22.</note> as Saint Paule termeth him, in making comparison
betweene the grace wherethrough wee were set agein, and the deadly
fall wherthrough wee were all forlorne. He sayeth, that the first Adam
did by his transgression make vs enemies too God, so as wee haue no
accesse to him, but should be thrust back, if we preaced to him, and that
iustly. For where sin reigneth, there must needes bee as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoucylable
diuision. God being the fountayne of all ryghtuousnesse,
cannot match with our iniquities and corruptions. Then is there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a second Adam, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to remedie al, that is to wit, our Lord
Iesus Christ. And how is he the second Adam? For (as I told you
afore) it is not ment that wee should bee so bold as too think too preace
vntoo Iesus Christ, as though wee were linked too him of our owne
nature: but that is done in the power of his holy spirit, &amp; not in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his body. Behold then, Iesus Christ is become very man, and
hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon him the selfsame humane nature that ours is: but yit is
it not of nature that wee bee his flesh and his bones: (for wee bee not


<pb facs="tcp:23289:315"/>
descended of him as touching our own substance) but it is of his diuine
power. Then must wee come too this poynt, that wee bee bone of the
bones of our Lord Iesus Christ, bycause wee bee restored in him, and
haue in him as it were a new and second creation.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule (as wee shall see heerafter) hath an eye too the
originall of Eue: for shee was taken out of Adams substance, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
of one of his ribbes. Now then, are wee restored by our Lord
Iesus Christ? If wee consider our first birth wherby wee bee brought
intoo this world too bee mortall men: wee cannot say, such is our flesh,
vnlesse wee bee of the seede of them that were afore vs: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
wee bee, in that seede wee bee accursed. It is trew that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
was created after the image of God: but yit was that image de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
by sin, so as wee bee not worthie too bee counted among Gods
woorkes. And the same horrible condemnation is pronounced wyth
his owne mouth,<note place="margin">Gene. 6. b. 6.</note> where he sayeth, that it repenteth him that hee had
made man, as though he disclaymed vs all, bycause wee doo but infect
the earth, and are not so woorthy too bee mustered in the aray of hys
creatures, as are the woormes, lyce, fleas, dogflyes, and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
of the world. That then is the benefyte which wee haue by Adam:
and as oft as it is sayd, that wee be of his seede and of his fleshe, it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
too shew vs, that there is nothing in vs but a gulf of cursednesse.
Now hereuppon, if wee come too our Lord Iesus Christ, wee bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
agein,<note place="margin">

new creatures in him. Yee see then, that it is by power of the spirit,
and not by order of nature, nor by any common fashyon, that wee bee
of the bone and of the fleshe of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the cause
why wee bee members of his body, is that God his father hath ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and stablished him as our head. Howbeeit (as I sayd afore) that
is doone by a secret power, which wee comprehend not but by fayth.
Then do both these things agree very well: namely, that Iesus Christ
is of our bone and of our fleshe, in respect that he hath taken our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature vpon him, and clothed himself with it, without the which
wee should haue no alyance with him. For if wee cannot atteyne too
the Angels: how shall wee atteyne too him that is the souerein head of
them? But wheras he is come in such wyze vntoo vs, that he hath
voutsafed to bee knit in the bond of brotherhood with vs: that is doone
specially when he woorketh so by the power of his holy spirit, that he
is our head, and wee are gathered toogither in him, and haue a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23289:315"/>
state, and wheras afore wee had nothing but of the earh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
had nothing in vs but corruption, now wee bee lifted vp on
hygh, and are made the children of God by the grace that is spoken
of heere, wheras erst wee were heires of his wrath, which wee hold
from our father Adam when wee followe his nature, bycause wee are
all lost and peruerted in him. Thus yee see in effect how the twoo
things are too bee agreed, wherin there seemed too bee some diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And in deede if wee haue not that, what would become of vs?
How miserable would our state bee? I haue shewed alredye, that
if any man looke well what is in himselfe: he shall fynd nothing there
but matter too separate him from God. Now then, vntyll wee bee of
the substance of our Lord Iesus Christ, God must needes hate vs and
abhorre vs, and not knowe vs too bee of the number and company of
his creatures.</p>
               <p>Now remayneth too see how it commeth to passe that wee bee of
the bones of Iesus Christ, and of his flesh. For he is in heauen, and
wee are heere beneath on earth. Agein, when wee bee begotten, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of vs is begotten after the order of nature, he hath his father and
his mother too come of, and they bee of the same race that he is. How
then are wee of the bones of Iesus Christ? It is not in respect of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
for if wee looke vppon our owne flesh, nother the skin, nor
the bones, nor the gristles that wee haue, doo come of the body of our
Lord Iesus Christ: but it is in respect that the cursednesse which wee
bring from our moothers womb, and is spred ouer all Adams li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
is taken away by the power of our Lord Iesus Christ, and that
therwithall he hath so sheaded foorth the grace of his holy spirit vppon
vs, that wee bee inlyghtened by it. Therfore it is as a qualitie (as
men terme it) &amp; not a substance. Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal descend of such linage,
and God letteth the common order runne on styll which he appoynted
at the beginning, namely that men beget one another from issew too
issew: but in the meane whyle Iesus Christ renueth those whom God
his father hath chozen, and such as are the members of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and riddeth them of the corruption which they had taken from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
And afterward he giueth them such a power, as euery of them
feeleth by fayth that he is vnder the head that is set ouer vs, and that
wee bee gathered all toogither in him, and his lyfe is giuen vntoo vs,

wee should bee fashyoned lyke vntoo the glory that is now in him.
But yit for all that he woorketh in such wyse, as wee haue all our

their leaues, and their fruites from their roote: and lyke as the
body of man feeleth his strength too flowe downe from the head, so do
wee feele the vertew and force of the coniunction that is betweene vs
and our Lord Iesus Christ, and yit he continueth still in his full state
al the whyle. Nother doth that hinder vs too inioy the inestimable
benefite that S. Paule magnifyeth so much in this text. And therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

stird vp to doo euery man his duetie: for thereby wee tast the
grace of God which concerneth the saluation of our soules.</p>
               <p>The matter that is in hand heere, is that men should liue freendly
and agreeingly with their wyues. And when a husband considereth
the things that are spoken heere, he ought too bee prouoked, not only
too discharge him selfe of the bond wherein he is bound too God and
his wyfe: but also too thinke thus with him selfe: This is such a state
that although it bee corruptible, and serue but for this transitorie lyfe,
yit hath God set it afore vs as a lyuely image wherein I see that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is my head, and that I belong too him, and that not onely
I am his, but also he is myne, so as his lyfe belongs too mee, and
(too bee short) I am as if I were a member of his body. Seeing
then that men in dooing their duetie towards their wyues, and wyues
also in obeying their husbandes, may behold how they bee ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too

all meanes too win vs, and too make vs walke vnder his yoke? And
moreouer he not onely allureth vs by gentle and louing meanes, too

Saint Paul applyeth this further, to the vnion which is betweene our
Lord Iesus Christ and his Church. For (as was declared vppon

betweene vs and the sonne of God. And therefore he cryeth out, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>It is a hygh misterie,</hi> that is too say, a secret which wee ought too

               <p>The one is, that wee see how God euen from the beginning, hath
knit man and wyfe togither in vnseparable bond. The other is, that he
intendeth too leade vs yit hygher: that is too say, that forasmuch as
there is nothing in our selues but all maner of wretchednesse, wee
should bee knit too the sonne of God, who is the fountayne of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

in that the sonne of God hath made vs bone of his bone, and flesh of his

think so, and it is euident that the text should bee mard, if it bee not

bee washed by the blud of our Lord Iesus Christ: and in the Supper,
the bread and wyne are warrants and pledges of his body and of his

when wee see that such doltishnesse hath crept in through the whole
world, and that these greate doctours had neede too bee set agein too
their Apcies, for so much as they knew not euen the things that they

lyeth a greate vengeance of God vppon such as haue corrupted the
trew religion, and made minglemangles in the woord of God, after
their owne fancyes. And therwithall wee haue too thank our God so
much the more, for that he hath drawen vs out of such dungeons. And
seeing there was so horrible confuzion in such as are reported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be the Lampes and pillers of the Church, &amp; were taken so to

And seeing he hath graunted vs the grace too bee no more mingled

there wee haue a warning too hold our selues in awe, that wee being

                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:318"/>
them. The cause then why Eue was shaped of one of Adams
ribbes, is, that God ment to stablish such a concord betweene man and
wyfe by that meane, as there should bee no bond in the world so streyt
as that. For the chyld ought in deede too honour his father: for he
is his seede, and he is his blud: but yit is the bond of wedlocke prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before it. And by whom? It commeth not of mens lyking: but
according as Adam had spoken, and as God had pronounced the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
so is it an inuiolable order, that man should bee knit vntoo his
wyfe, yea and that in such wyse, that if he should needs forsake the one
or the other, his father should not bee so neere him as his wyfe.</p>
               <p>Yit is not this as much too say, as that God ment too breake that
yoke, and too giue children leaue too bee stubborne ageinst their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and moothers, when they bee once maryed. God chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not any whit of the things that he hath ordeyned. Therfore he
that hath a father or moother alyue, ought too bee still subiect too them,
without ceassing of from dooing his dewtie, according as the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sheweth, and as nature also teacheth euery man too doo. For wee
haue it ingrauen in vs, and wee cannot wype it out. Thus yee see that
maryed folks ceasse not too bee alwayes subiect too their fathers and
moothers. But heere the cace standeth vppon the comparing of the
one with the other: as if he should say, If a yong man should forsake his
father, &amp; haue him in any contempt or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eine, or be stubborne ageinst
him, or yeeld him no reuerence: would not the world say, hee were a
monster? Now if God haue commaunded in his lawe, that stubborne
and disobedient children should bee stoned,<note place="margin">Deut. 21. d. 21.</note> and that men should roote
such villanie out of the world: what a thing is it, when a man shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his wyfe, or the wyfe hir husband? Surely it is an outrageous
cryme. Then if it be intollerable that the chyld should ryze vp ageinst
his father: (No doubt but) the bond of wedlocke is yi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> much holyer, and
more expresly commended too vs of God. Seeing it is so: it standeth
euery man on hand, too looke that he discharge his dewtie. For if a
woman haue a froward head of hir owne, so as shee must bee brawling
euery minute of an houre, and wil not be subiect to hir husband: also if
the husband be churlish &amp; cruell, so as he disdeyneth his wyfe: it is not
a doing of wrong to a humane creature, but to God, who is the author
of mariage, &amp; hath ordeined it with such condition, as we heare of here.
And so ye see what we haue to remember vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first part of this text.</p>
               <p>But this extendeth yit further: that is too wit, that euery man


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:23289:318"/>
should loue those that are alyed too him by meanes of God. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a man hauing no more but his wyfe, is bound notwithstanding
too acknowledge that God hath vnited vs all toogither. And when
he created Eue the moother of all men out of Adams syde: it was too
the end that the same should extend euerywhere, and that wee should
knowe that he will haue vs to liue in such concord, as none of vs should
for all that separate our selues from other. No man then ought too bee
so cruell as too say, Tush, shee is not my wyfe. But wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that forasmuch as it is our Lords will that there should bee a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
concord among all men, and that euery man should think him
self bound too his neyghbours: it is as though mankynd were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of twoo sortes, so as there were both malekynd and female<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd.
Then are wee all bound one too another. Trew it is that
matrimony (as I sayd) is reserued by it self: but yit for all that, men
are bound towards women, too succour them, seeing that our Lord
hath shewed it by deede euen in the first creation. And women also
must behaue themselues soberly among men, although they bee not
their husbands.</p>
               <p>Also there is further, <hi>that they shalbee twoo in one flesh.</hi> Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our Lord Iesus Christ sheweth vs, that the man which is maryed
ought too hold him self contented with his owne wyfe, and the woman
lykewyse rest wholly vppon hir husband, so as they let not their lusts
raundge abrode, nor giue themselues the brydle to chaunge any thing
in the order which our Lord hath set, and will haue too stand in force to
the worlds end. Men haue so passed their bounds in all ages, that
they haue forgotten both kynd and all kyndnesse. And they haue not
onely despyzed God and his woorde, but also forgotten with what
condition they were created, in the worlde: and they knewe not
euen that which naturall reason could haue shewed them. And they
had not come too that poynt, if they had not bin doted in their lusts
lyke woode beasts. And surely there is no such rage as the reigning
of inordinate lusts in our flesh, when they bee not repressed by the feare
of God. Thereof it came that in many countries it was lawfull for
men too haue three or foure wyues a peece, as it is permitted
still at this day among the Turks. The Iewes also, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they had the Lawe of Moyses, did put away their wyues
for euery small occasio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that came in their heades. If a woman were
not fayre ynough, or if shee were not rich ynough, by and by shee was


<pb facs="tcp:23289:319"/>
diuorced. Trew it is that our Lord had prouyded for it, howbeeit
but halfe.<note place="margin">Math. 19. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And in deede our Lord Iesus Christ declareth, that God
had a regard of the hard hartednesse of that people, which was past a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
or taming. Therefore when any of them listed too put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his wyfe, he was bound too giue hir a Testimoniall, that shee
was no harlot, but that shee lyked him not: and he choze rather too
susteyn that shame, than to keepe the fayth of mariage. For in putting
away his wyfe after he had plyghted hir his fayth too liue and dye
with hir, he shewed himselfe forsworne and vnfaythfull. Therefore
it was a reproch too them too put away theyr wyues after that sort.
But yit for all that, diuorces were common. And our Lord Iesus
sayth, that in so dooyng the Iewes were backestyders from the lawe
of God, and therfore he telleth them, it was not so from the beginning.
They tooke that libertie on that it was sayd, that he which found not
himselfe well at ease with his wyfe, should giue hir leaue too depart.
But our Lord Iesus telleth them, It is trew that God graunted it too
your fathers: howbeeit that was bycause he was fayne too deale with
them as with wyld beastes. So then, he graunted them more than
was lawfull: but yit knowe yee, that although he punished them not
with rigour, yit is it not ment that you should therefore take occasion
at it too doo yit woorse. Therefore haue yee an eye alwayes too the
beginning, when God created Adam, and shaped Eue out of his syde:
he sayde (at that tyme) that twoo should bee one fleshe. He then that
taketh twoo wyues, is woorthy too bee cut asunder, and he that takes
three, is woorthy too bee cut in three peeces: for it is all one as if he
would defye God and nature, seeyng God hath printed a marke in the
person of man and wyfe, too the intent that wedlocke should bee kept
as it ought too bee. Wherfore if a man disanull the ordinance of God,
deserueth he not to bee wyped out quyte and cleane? The thing then
which we haue yit still to beare in mynd, is, that a man must brydle all
his senses, and not cast his eyes wandering heere and there, least his
mynd bee caryed away when he sees a wooman that seemes fayrer too
him than his owne. And let the wyfe also not looke vppon any man
but hir husband, otherwyse than with simplicitie. And let them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
thinke, wee bee but twoo, yea and yit one fleshe: I can not bee
a whole person, except I bee with my husband. And let the husband
also on his syde thinke, I am but halfe a creature, when I am asunder
from my wyfe, seeyng that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

For the woord that he vseth, signifyeth too feare: but it is taken heere
for the reuerence and subiection which the wyfe oweth to hir husband.
And heere wee haue too marke the difference that is put betweene the
dewtie of the husband, and the dewtie of the wyfe. God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

must bee subiect. If a man demaund, How then? Dooth the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

loue him whom he despyzeth. The world dooth in deede call it
loue, but (too speake properly) if I loue a wanton person or a iester,
bycause he makes mee some sport or pleaseth mee, that is no trew
loue: but there must bee a linking togither, and an agreement in good
manners, so as a man haue alwayes good estimation and opinion of
him whom he loueth. In lyke cace is it betweene a man and his wife.
For when I thinke with my selfe, Shee is a portion of my selfe, shee

The man then must honour his wyfe, howbeeit not by subiection that
hee shoulde not alwayes abyde in his state as heade, and haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
of his wyfe. That is the cause why Saint Paule requyreth
nothing at the husbandes hande, but that he should loue his wyfe.
In another text too the Colossians he addeth,<note place="margin">Colo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

bitter too them. For if there bee loue, surely he that loueth, wil beare
with many faults and infirmities of his freend. And if wee doo it one
too another: much more ought the husband too doo it towards hir
whom he knoweth too bee giuen him of God, that he should loue hir
as his owne bodie:<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 7.</note> And therefore Saint Peter sayeth expresly, that
men must haue discretion and wisdome too helpe their wyues infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by bearing with their frayltie. If a man take a toy in his head,
that his wyfe is vnconstant and lyght: or too bee short, if he despyze
hir vnder pretence that shee is not a man: it is an ill regarding of hir.
For though shee bee frayle, he must consider that there is the lyke in
himselfe, and thereuppon beare with hir, as he would bee borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
himselfe. Thus yee see how this is too bee defyned that Saint


<pb facs="tcp:23289:320"/>
Paule speakes of here. He meaneth not that a man should bee doted
in fond loue, as it falleth out oftentymes. And the last Sunday I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the examples of such as pretend too bee very hot in maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their wyues quarelles (abrode,) and yit are diuelles to them
at home. So then, the loue that Saint Paule speaketh of, is a right
and good affection which the man beareth too his wyfe, bycause hee
knoweth that God hath knit them togither, as though he had put them
togither with his owne hand, and sayd, lyue you two togither in peace
and concord.</p>
               <p>Agein, as touching the wyues, bycause they bee loth too beare
the yoke that God hath layed vppon theyr shoulders: therefore in the
other text Saint Paule did put them in mynd, that God is the author
of wedlocke, and that it is he which hath set downe this condition,
that the wyfe should bee subiect too hir husband, and suffer hirselfe too
bee ruled by him as by hir head, and beare him reuerence. For a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will alwayes find matter ynough in hir husband too despyze him.
If he haue any goodnesse, shee will go about too deface it, that shee
may haue occasion too say, why should this man haue preheminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mee? For he is no more able too rule than I. And wee knowe
what ouerweening there is in men and women. For euery one thinkes
himselfe more able than his fellowe. The wyues therfore would feyne
gouerne and haue the maystrie. For that cause dooth Saint Paule
tell them, that they must abyde in the state that God hath put them in,
(that is too wit, in subiection,) and that they must not stand scannyng
what is in their husbandes, too examin whether they bee woorthy too
haue authoritie and superioritie or no: but that they must consider what
God hath ordeyned, and obey the same without geynsaying or reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
They must not inquyre, why is this, and why is that? too the
intent too fynd some excuce too exempt themselues from the obeying of
God and of his commaundementes. Therfore wee must giue eare to
him, and euery of vs must without geynsaying receyue the things that
he commaundeth vs. Thus yee see how the things are too bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
which are spoken here concerning the feare &amp; subiection that
wyues owe too their husbands. This doctrine is cleere and familiar y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it self: but yit for all that, how is it practyzed in the worlde?
Folke would fayne alledge excuce of ignorance, too shift off the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their dewtie, by saying, this is to hygh &amp; to hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode,
when as it is sayd, that men ought to loue their wyues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needeth


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:23289:320"/>
there any gloze too expound what the holy Ghost ment? No: the thing
is euident ynough of it selfe, and euery man knowes in himself that he
vnderstandes it well ynough. But if yee looke vppon the loue that
men beare too their wyues, scarsely shall yee fynd one among a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
which could not fynd in his hart too giue it ouer, and which hath
not some wandering fancies in his head. The women also are so lyght
mynded, that they could fynd in their hartes too bee vnmaryed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tymes in a yeere. And wherof commeth that? Euen of that they
haue not an eye vntoo God, who is the author of Mariage? Truely
though wee had no scripture at all (as I sayd:) yit would the brutishest
man in the world reuerence mariage. And why is that, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ycause it
was our Lordes will too leaue that record ingrauen in mens hartes?
His meaning then is too shewe, that sith the most ignorant and gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest

one in their degree: men must bend that way. But now, wee haue
teaching, and wee haue exhortations added too spurre vs the further
foreward, too the intent wee should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and yit what are wee the better? It is too bee seene dayly, that men
storme at their wyues, and wyues checke at their husbandes: it is an

the man and wyfe should haue any accesse too come vntoo God. For
after what manner ought our repayring vntoo God bee, that wee
myght receyue mercy, and be vnder his protection, and he haue a care
of vs? It is by prayer.</p>
               <p>Now Saint Peter sayeth expresly,<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how wee bee his flesh. It is not that wee bee taken out of his bodie,
for wee come of the linage of Adam: but bycause wee liue of his owne
substance,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. f. 55.</note> according too this saying, that his flesh is our meate, and
his blud our drink, wherby he meaneth that wee liue in him, howbeit
spiritually. In deede wee haue a common lyfe both too talke and too
walk with all men, which proceedeth not of the speciall grace of our
Lord Iesus Christ. But yit the mouing which wee haue common
with the brute beasts proceedeth also of him, according as it is sayd,
that he was the lyfe of all things.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 12.</note> Yea and Saint Iohn passeth yit
further, saying, that the woord, (that is to say, our Lord Iesus Christ,)
was too quicken men, in that God hath giuen them this speciall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
of hauing some vnderstanding and discretion. But when the
spirituall lyfe which wee haue with the sonne of God is spoken of: that
is a thing aboue nature. For although wee haue not any woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or excellencie when wee come out of our moothers womb: yit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
there alwayes some print and image of God. And yit for all
that wee bee so cursed in our owne nature, and so miserable, that wee
bee called euen deceassed and dead. And that is the cause why our
Lord Iesus Christ sayeth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 25.</note> that the houre is come, that the dead which
are as rotten carkesses in the graue, shall heare the voyce of the sonne
of God. And Saint Paul hath sayd in the second Chapter, that when
wee bee reformed by our Lord Iesus Christ, then wee lyue, whereas
erst wee were dead in our sinnes and trangressions, bycause wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
that from our father Adam as it were by inheritance. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
therfore that wee bee of Iesus Christes flesh, and bone of his bone,
is that wee bee graffed intoo his body, accordingly as Saint Paul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vseth the same similitude of graffyng.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. a. 6.</note> Lyke as a sine that is set in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
a stocke, taketh his sustenance from the same: so must wee by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
graffed intoo our Lord Iesus Christ. Trew it is, that we doo not
yit bring foorth good fruite of our selues: for his purpose heere is but
too shewe that as a braunche withereth which is broken of from the
roote and so let alone, but receyueth sap and nurrishment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the roote,
if it bee graffed intoo another: euen so is it with vs, that is too wit, that
if wee continew such as wee bee by kynde, then are wee in death, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee bee separated from our Lord Iesus Christ? but if wee bee
incorporated intoo him, and it please him too communicate himselfe
vnto vs, then doo we feele in very deede, that bread doth not more nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee eate it, nor wyne strengthen vs better when we drink


<pb facs="tcp:23289:322"/>
it, than wee verily receyue lyfe and strength by the body and blud
of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Now then, that this is a hygh misterie, euery man is able to iudge
of himselfe. When wee haue debated neuer so much, and scanned
the matter in our hartes, is there any of vs that can comprehend how
wee bee knit too our Lord Iesus Christ, and how wee bee made all
one with him, so as wee can assure and warrant our selues, that wee
shall by that meane bee parttakers of Gods glorie, and that euen at
this day wee liue in our Lord Iesus Christ: According too this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14. c. 19.</note> bee of good cheere, for as I liue, so shall you also. Can
this (say I) enter intoo so small a roome as our sensuall reason is? No
surely. And that is the cause why a number of men cannot admit this
poynt, that wee bee the flesh of Iesus Christ, and bone of his bones,
but content themselues with their owne imaginations, which is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacing
of Gods grace, which Saint Paule was not able too expresse,
but rather shewed vs that it ought too rauish our wittes too woonder
at it. Many then may happen too haue a rouing, and as it were a
heathenish imagination, that we bee knit vnto our Lord Iesus Christ,
that is too say, that wee bee saued by his grace. But the Scripture
goeth further: and though there were no more but this saying, <hi>That
it is a great misterie:</hi> yit let vs beware of limiting it after our owne
fancie, for it were al one as if wee would make Saint Paule a lyer.
All such as despyze this spirituall coniunction which wee haue with
our Lord Iesus Christ, would shewe that there is no such secret nor
wonderfull power of God, nor aught else, as wee heare spoken of
heere. And the holy Ghost vseth such speeche, too humble vs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oo exalt vs agein. Therefore wee must on the one syde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that all the wisedome and wit which wee haue, dooth fayle vs in
that behalfe: and afterward ryze vp agein, for that we heare our Lord
Iesus Christ call vs too him, and tell vs that wee bee so knit vntoo
him, that he hath not any thing of his owne, which he maketh not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
too vs, and wherof he will not haue vs too bee parttakers. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if wee haue any contrarye motions in our selues, and it come
intoo our heades too say, how is it possible that our Lord Iesus Christ
who is in heauen, should nurrish vs with his owne substance, so as his
body should bee our meate, and his blud our drinke? I say, if wee fall
intoo such fancies: we must repulse them all with that which is sayd
here, namely that it is a great Secret, and wee must rebuke our owne


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23289:322"/>
folly and rashnesse, in intending too measure the thing that is infinite.
Our Lord sheweth vs, that when he hath knit vs too his only sonne, he
hath doone so high and profound a woorke, as surmounteth all our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie.
Seeing it is so, let vs alwayes conclude, that although
wee fynde it a straunge matter: yit must wee rest vppon the thing
which is spoken by God himselfe, specially when he sayth, that he will
woorke after so hygh a fashyon, that wee shalbee vtterly rauished at
it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs learne generally vppon this text, that all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefytes
which wee receyue by the meanes of our Lord Iesus Christ,
thereby too atteine too the heauenly lyfe, are and doo proceede of the
fayd fountaine of Gods incomprehensible wisedome, so as it is not

our selues from such presumption, for it will make vs vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the misterie of fayth, bycause it is a saying that importeth a
great secret. The end (say I) whereat wee must begin, if we mynd
too fare the better by Iesus Christ, and too bee parttakers of all his
grace: is too vnderstand, that Gods woorking in our saluation is a
great misterie or secret, according too the text that I alledged heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toofore
out of the Epistle too Timothie. It is a great misterie (sayth
Saint Paule) that God was manifested in the flesh.<note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great distance is there betweene God and man? Wee be but wormes
and rottennesse, and Gods maiestie is so hygh, as no man can say what
it is, nor conceyue the hundredth part of it in thought, but wee must be
fayne too bee rauished too woonder at it. Seeyng then that God hath
so linked himselfe vntoo vs, that he is the trew Emanuell (as he is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Esay,<note place="margin">Esay. 7. c. 14.</note>) and that the things which seeme to be so farre asunder,
are knit togither in the person of our Lord Iesus Christ: Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
theruppon, that there is nothing but mysteries and secretes in
all the grace which wee receyue of our God, and specially in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating
or graffing intoo our Lord Iesus Christ, who hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our nature vppon him, and clothed himselfe with our fleshe,
will haue vs too bee graffed into him as into our roote, too bee quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his spirit, and too bee parttakers of his lyfe, so as he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
peculiar too himself alone, but will haue all to be common vnto
vs. Will wee then receyue our Lord Iesus Christ with all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes
which he bringeth vs, and will wee by his meanes ouercome all


<pb facs="tcp:23289:323"/>
the temptations that can crosse vs? Wee must tast throughly of the
thinges that the holy Scripture telleth vs and setteth afore vs, and
giue such reuerend credit vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by acknowledging that God woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

vs in such wyse, as wee may bee rid of them, and he so gouerne vs by

and reforme our whole lyfe according to his holy commaundementes,

if there bee any stubbornnesse and
malice in vs. And that is the thing which
Saint Paule telleth vs heere, which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of vs ought too haue ingrauen in our
hartes. For it is a thing which all of vs vnderstand by our moother


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23289:323"/>
wit, that children ought too bee obedient and subiect too their fathers
and moothers, and also that there ought too bee such gentlenesse in
those that haue children too gouerne, as too vse them myldly, and not
too giue them cause of frowardnesse, through their ouer great rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
This (say I) is knowen well ynough of all men: but yit is
not the warning that is giuen vs heere, more than needeth: For who
is he that dischargeth himselfe of the things that are told vs heere by
Saint Paule? Fathers and Moothers doo dyuers tymes marre their
children with cockering them, and make them such Cocknyes, as they
leade them too vtter vndooing. Agein, somtymes they bee in such
cholers and heates with them without measure or discretion, that they
haue no hold of themselues, nor no indifferent dealing with them as
there ought too bee. As for children, although it bee sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
too them, that they ought too bee obedient and subiect too their
parentes, dooth not the world see how they despyze them, &amp; as it were
hold vtter scorne of them? Nother are there almost any, which hold
themselues in awe, and yeeld a ryght reuerence too their fathers and
moothers, in respect that God hath bound them too it, and that they
ought too doo it. Therefore sith wee see heere, that Saint Paule
exhorteth the faythfull too things that are so common: therein wee
may perceyue the frowardnesse of our owne nature. For th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se are
such things as wee ought not too bee put in mynd of them, but euery
of vs ought too bee inclyned of himselfe too doo his dewtie without
warning. Gods spirit then rebuketh vs for being so fleshly, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee knowe a thing too bee as ryghtfull as may bee, yit wee
cannot giue our selues too it. Wherfore let vs indeuer to fyght ageinst
our owne vyces. For it is not ynough for vs too haue learned what
wee ought too doo: but also, forasmuch as there is much fyghting
and stryuing in our selues ageinst it: after wee once knowe Gods
will, and what is ryghtuous and conuenient, euery of vs must enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
himselfe, and beware that he drawe not cleane backe, but that he
imprison and bridle himselfe, and beare wel in mynd that it is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for him too haue bin instructed &amp; taught, vnlesse he do also thrust
foorth himselfe by force, and subdue all his wicked affections, how hard
so euer it bee too bring it too passe.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come too that which is sayd heere. <hi>Yee Children</hi>
(sayth Saint Paule) <hi>obey your fathers and moothers.</hi> Trew it is
that (as Paule alledgeth afterward) God hath in his lawe set downe a


<pb facs="tcp:23289:324"/>
more generall terme: that is too wit, <hi>Honour.</hi> For God ment too
doo vs too vnderstand, that children ought too yeeld bothe subiection
and reuerence too their fathers and moothers. For such a one myght
yeeld obedience and subiection, as myght neuerthelesse haue a spyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
a proud, and a loftie hart, and despyze the partie whom he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
But when as our Lord commaundeth vs too honour our fathers
and moothers: therunder he meaneth too comprehend reuerence, and
moreouer a performance of all dewtie: that is too wit, that children
should vnderstand, that they bee bound too serue their fathers and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp; to be subiect too them in all things too the vttermoste of their
power. Yee see then that generally God will haue children, not only
too bee obedient and subiect too their parents, but also too yeeld them
reuerence, and moreouer too doo their dewtie towards them, in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coring
them, and in dooing them all the ease and comfort that they
can, assuring themselues that they be not their owne, nor at their owne
libertie, but that they owe all seruis vntoo them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whose meanes
they came intoo the world.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule sayeth expresly, <hi>in the Lord:</hi> meaning that
there is a dubble bond too hold vs in this subiection. For (first) there
is the order of nature, and agein, God telleth vs, that he hath set vs in
this earthly lyfe with condicion, that fathers and moothers should
haue superioritie ouer their children. The Heathen men shal not fayle
too bee found giltie, though they had not the lawe too direct them, nor
were taught the doctrine which wee heare now by the mouth of Saint
Paule. Insomuch that if a chyld were stubborne ageinst his father
and mother among the heathen, he was as it were abhorred, and there
was nother greate nor small which could not iudge of it: Nother
shall they scape Gods hand, sith they bee condemned alredy in this
world: for (as I sayd afore) it is a thing that is grauen in the harts of
vs all, and also as manifest as may bee. Howbeit, besyds that which
wee knowe naturally, God addeth his owne will for a further and
more ample confirmation, and telleth vs, that he hath so ordeyned and
appoynted it, and therfore that wee must passe that way. Then sith
wee perceyue that God holdeth vs vnder awe of our fathers and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
it is certein that wee bee so much the more vnexcuzable, if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of vs submit not him self with meeknesse and humilitie. And they
that haue followed the order of nature among the heathen and poore
blynd soules, shalbee our iudges. For who hath stirrred them vp ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untoo?


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23289:324"/>
They had not the helpes that wee haue: and yit they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
their dewtie. That then is the thing which Saint Paule inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in saying, that children ought to obey theyr fathers and moothers
in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now he addeth, that <hi>that is ryght.</hi> As if he should say, no man shal
gayne any thing by stryuing in this behalf. For wee knowe that
mans mynd is so full fraught with pryde, as there is no man but hee
would bee a lord. As for subiection, it irketh men to yeeld too it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
our Lord haue framed vs too it by his holie spirit.<note place="margin">VVis. 1. b. 6.</note> And for that
cause also is the spirit of God called the spirit of meeknesse and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And why?<note place="margin">Gala. 5. d. 22.</note> Bycause pryde maketh men lyke wyld beasts, and
puffeth them vp lyke Toades, so as they cannot humble themselues.
Saint Paule therfore perceyuing that this vyce is so rooted in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and mynding too redresse it, sheweth that it is ryght, and that it
becommeth euery man too imploy him self theruntoo, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there bee any such sturdinesse in vs, as wil not suffer vs too bee
subiect too our superiours, yit this ryghtfulnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gods (that is too
say, the rule that he hath set) must ouerwey it. For when he sayeth, it
is ryght (or ryghtfull) he bringeth vs backe too Gods authoritie: as
if he should say, seeyng God hath sayd the woorde, there is no further
scanning of the matter, but men must stop their mouthes, and seeyng
God hath commaunded it, men must obey it, assuring themselues that
his wyll is a sure and infallible rule, from the which it is not lawfull
too swarue nother too the ryght syde nor too the left. And it is a good
warning. For wee see that although men were willing too doo well,
and had some good zeale towardes it: yit will euery of vs bee wyze in
his owne conceyt, and when it commeth too the guyding and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our selues, wee will needes beare sway aboue the woorde of
God. Forasmuch then as men are so fond and presumptuous, as too
attribute somewhat continually too their owne wit: it standeth vs the
more on hand too marke well what is sayd heere: that is too wit, that
wee must haue the discretion and skill, too perceyue what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
and alloweth, and lykewyse what he disalloweth. Haue wee
then a warrant of Gods will? Wee must bee contented with it. And
if he once say, This pleaseth mee: then is it ryghtfull, though wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
not the reason of it. Agein, if there bee some hardnesse: yit let
vs not aske why, nother let vs reply ageinst God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he condemneth
the thing that seemeth not too bee vtterly euyll in our eyes. Let vs


<pb facs="tcp:23289:325"/>
(say I) beware of such malapertnesse and diuelishe rashnesse, and let
vs followe that which Saint Paule telleth vs heere, that is too wit,
that all that euer God hath vttered by his woord, is ryghtfull, and that
wee also must auow it too bee so without geynsaying. For the trew
proofe of our fayth and obedience, is that when wee thinke that this or
that ought not to haue bin commaunded or forbidden: yit we accept it
for good and auaylable, bycause God hath spoken it.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon Saint Paule alledgeth the commaundement of
the Lawe, <hi>Honour thy father and thy moother.</hi> And agein he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
further, <hi>that it is the first commaundement of promis.</hi> As if he
should say, that God intended too bring vs by all meanes too the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
which wee should yeeld too our fathers and mothers. It ought
too suffyze vs that it is acceptable too God: but seeyng he allureth vs
moreouer by gentlenesse, and will not fray vs with authoritie &amp; force,
but promyseth too prosper vs, in seruing our fathers and moothers:
that ought too make vs too lyke the better of our subiection. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Saint Paule hauing shewed vs that wee must bee subiect too our
fathers and mothers, except wee will bee rebels too God, and bend
our hornes ageinst him, and turne all ryght and order vpsyde downe:
addeth, that wee shall bee tootoo hard harted and wilfull stubborne, if
after Gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of vs, this promis of his moue vs not, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he intendeth too induce vs so graciously, too doo the thing that he
willeth vs. And surely if wee bee not moued, yea and euen meekened
by it: it may well bee sayd, that the diuell reigneth wholly in vs, and
that he possesseth our hartes. His saying then is, that it is a commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
which hath a speciall promis, and so hath none other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the lawe but that. The promis is, that wee shall liue
long vppon the earth, yea and in prosperitie, bycause God will blisse
vs, if wee honour those that were the meanes whereby wee came into
the world.</p>
               <p>And on the other syde he sheweth what the dewtie of fathers and
mothers is towardes their children: that is too wit, too intreate them
gently. Not too pardon them altoogither, or too lay the brydle in their
neckes,<note place="margin">Coloss. 3. d. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and too let them doo what they list: but too deale so myldly
with them, as they doo not in any wyse put them out of hart (as it is
sayd in another place,) but nurrish them in the feare of God. By this
woord <hi>Nurrish,</hi> Saint Paule meaneth that they should deale gently
with them, and shewe themselues louing towardes them. Howbeeit,


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23289:325"/>
this woord is also sauced (as yee would say) with nurture and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God. Then is there on the one syde <hi>Nurrishment,</hi> that is too
say, kyndnesse and gentlenesse: and on the other side, <hi>Chastyzement
and Discipline,</hi> that children may bee hild in awe, and not bee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
too bee wanton and vnruly, but so brought vp in the feare of God,
as they may knowe that God hath not left them awelesse and lawlesse,
but that he hath giuen them ouerseers too rule their lyfe. This is the
effect of the thing that S. Paule sheweth vs heere.</p>
               <p>Now too the intent wee may haue the fuller and certeiner vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this text, wee must marke first of all, that (too speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly)
wee haue no father but only God. Trewe it is that now and
then he is called the father of our soules and of our spirites,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. c. 9.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he is spoken of in the Epistle too the Hebrewes. Howbeeit,
euen as in respect of the flesh also, the honour and dignitie of bearing
the name of father,<note place="margin">Iob. 13. b. 15.</note> belongeth not too any mortall creature: for it is
God that fashyoneth vs, as it is sayd in the booke of Iob. Is the seede
of man (which is but corruption) able to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> fashyon a body, wherein
appeereth so excellent woorkmanship of God? (No.) Then let vs
vnderstand, that forasmuch as our bodyes are all of them recordes of
Gods woonderfull power: he onely deserueth too bee hild and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as our father. Yit for all that, they also that beget vs, and by
whom wee bee brought intoo this world, are our fathers. By what
tytle? Bycause God hath voutsafed too make them parttakers of the
honour that belongeth too himselfe alone. And heereby wee bee put
in mynd, that in stryuing ageinst our fathers and mothers, we make
warre ageinst God. For he hath imprinted his marke in them, &amp; that
tytle of theirs dooth vs too wit, that God hath set them as it were in
his place. Therefore we must hold it for an vndoubted truth, that in
honoring our fathers and mothers, wee yeeld God the seruice that he
requyreth of vs, and which we owe him. And contrarywyse, if wee
despyze our fathers and moothers, and hold scorne too do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
towardes them: God is expresly offended in it, not only bycause
wee breake the commaundement of his lawe, but also bycause wee
despyze his maiestie, whereof our fathers and moothers doo beare
a certein marke, as I haue sayd afore. And that is the cause why
there is so rigorous punnishment in the Lawe, ageinst them that were
disobedient too their fathers and moothers,<note place="margin">Leuit. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

once giuen this witnesse, Behold, this our sonne will not bee amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
by and by thereuppon let him bee stoned (sayeth he,) and let the
world bee rid of such an infection. Gods saying so, is too shewe vs,
that it is tootoo outrageous &amp; horrible a cryme, when children cannot
fynd in their hartes too yeeld submission too their fathers and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
for it is al one as if they were full bent too abolish the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of nature. That therfore is the end that wee must begin at, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
our selues well by this doctrine.</p>
               <p>And the same also is the cause why Saint Paule sayeth, that wee
ought too bee subiect too our fathers and moothers in God: meaning
thereby, that the thing which the Paynims and vnbeleeuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
darkely, ought to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bee much better knowen vntoo vs. For the

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t not well, how too yeeld a reason why children ought
too yeeld this subiection and obedience too their fathers and mothers,
sauing that it appeered that there is a certeine equitie and ryght that
required it, and that that was the reason. But as for too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> too
this ground of the matter, that God is our father, and that he requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
this subiection at our handes: that could they not doo. And
why? For they knewe not whether there were a God that created and
fashyoned them, or no. But wee which knowe that God who is our
Creator, is also our father, and that too bee so, belongeth vntoo him,
and that he hath reserued that honour and dignitie too himselfe: and
agein, that he will haue fathers and moothers too be also parttakers
of that priuiledge: wee must of necessitie conclude, that wee ought
too obey our fathers and moothers, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> euen in God, as though he
receyued at our handes the honour and seruice which wee doo to them
that represent his person and maiesty heere (as I sayd afore,) which is
despyzed in the stubbornnesse and disobedience of children too their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and moothers.</p>
               <p>Here agein I must put you in mynd of a thing that I spake of afore:
that is to wit, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods wil is once knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs, we must brydle
our selues short, &amp; not take leaue to reply ageinst God, &amp; to aske why
God lyketh this, or dislyketh that: but admit his will as the souerein


<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23289:326"/>
ryghtuousnesse &amp; equitie. And where shall we fynd that will of his? In
his word. For when S. Paul intendeth to proue Gods will, he soreth
not in the aire aboue the clouds, but bringeth and alledgeth the things
that are conteyned in the Lawe. So then, too rule our lyfe aryght,
let vs apply our whole myndes too seeke out the things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and acceptable too God, as he sheweth them in his lawe, in the
Prophets, and in the Gospell. That is all our wisdome. And let vs
beware of the ouer boldnesse which I sayd was diuelish, which is, too
bee wyse in our owne conceyts, and too say, How should this bee?
Why should that bee? But let vs simply obey our God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore here is also a promis. In deede a question myght be
moued heere, why Saint Paule sayth, it is the first commaundement
of Promis: seeing there is a promis added lykewyse too the second
commaundement of the lawe.<note place="margin">Exod. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 6.</note> For there it is sayd, I am the Lord
which doo shewe mercie in a thousand generations, too such as loue
mee, and keepe my commaundements. Heere is a much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
than that wherof mention is made in this text. And how then
dooth Saint Paule say, that it is the first commaundement with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis?
The answer is easy: For Gods promising of mercie too a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
generations in the first table, is not a restreint of it too that only
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, but an extending of it to the whole law: as if he should
say, there is nothing better for you tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to submit your selues to my wil,
for otherwyse you be in a cursed plyght. And for proof therof, doo not
all things that you can hope for, come too you of myne only free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Now, for my part, I will not fayle such as serue mee, and seeke
too honour mee: but they shall fynde continually that I am a mercifull
God. Heerin (as I sayd afore) our Lords intent is too drawe vs too
the obeying of his commaundements and ordinances with a willing
mynd. And so it is no speciall promis proper too any one commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
alone. But the promis that Saint Paule speaketh of heere,
(where it is sayd) Honour thy father and mother, that thou mayst liue
long vppon the earth, is peculiar (too that commaundment alone.) As
if he should say, God is so gracious, that he will cause them too pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
through his blissing and fauour, which behaue themselues humbly
and meekly, and yeeld dew reuerence too theyr fathers and moothers.
Not without cause therfore dooth Saint Paule say, that it is the first
commaundment with promis, namely with such promis as is speciall,
and hath respect too none other commaundement than that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23289:327"/>Now let vs come too the promis. God sayth, that such as obey so,
shall liue long. Heeruppon wee may gather, that this present lyfe is
not too bee despyzed, bycause it is a record of Gods fatherly goodnesse
and loue towards vs. And in good sooth it is no small thing, that God
voutsafeth to create vs, and to set vs in this world, not only to liue here
as brute beasts, but also too reigne as his children, and too haue domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ouer all other creatures. It is sayd, that his goodnesse and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
extend euen too Asses,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. b. 11.</note> Oxen, and horses. And why? For when
he maketh the earth too beare hay for Cattell: dooth he not therin shewe
a wonderfull goodnesse towards the poore brute beasts, as I sayd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
But there is a farre other reason in respect of vs. For how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
wee all the goods and riches wherof the earth is full? God hath
powred out his bountifulnesse in that the earth bringeth vs foorth such

Gods goodnesse.<note place="margin">Psal. 104. c. 19.</note> Too what ende shyneth the sunne, but too giue vs
lyght? And are not the Moone and the Starres ordeyned to doo vs
seruis? And yit are they as noble Creatures as may bee, insomuch
that the heathen folk woorshipped them, thinking that there was some
Godhead inclozed in them. Agein, when wee looke downward, wee
see what good things God hath appoynted for our vse. And although
he feede the beasts,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. b. 9. 10.</note> yit in the end all redoundeth too vs, according as
Saint Paule speaketh of them, saying: hath God a care of the beasts?
That is to say, when as God voutsafeth too succour the beasts in their
neede by his prouidence, he doth it for mens saks. Seing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God
hath harborowed vs after such a sort to make vs possesse so many good
things, besyds his creating of vs after his owne image and lykenesse:
is it not an inestimable benefyte? So then, this present life is not to be
hild scorne of. But there is yit more: God hath set vs heere as it were
in a iourney, too come too a further matter: that is too wit, too the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
rest, and too the heritage of heauen. Then if this present
lyfe guyde vs thither, that is too say, too the glory which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for vs, and which was purchaced for vs by the death and passion
of our Lord Iesus Christ: therbey wee see that it is a great benefyte,
and meete too bee esteemed at our handes. Trew it is, that there are
so many myseries in our lyfe, that it were much better for vs neuer too
haue bin borne, than too linger (continually) as wee doo. Therefore if
a man consider how wretched our lyfe is in it self, and too what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber


<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23289:327"/>
of greefes, anguishes, peynes, and vexations it is subiect: surely
he will say, it were better neuer too haue come out of our moothers
womb, than to enter into such a sea of confuzion as we see vppon earth.
Neuerthelesse when all commeth to al, we shal fynd that Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
exceedeth all the chastyzementes that he sendeth vs for our
sinnes. This lyfe should of it self bee nothing but happinesse and rest,
if God made vs vs not to reape the frute of our sinnes &amp; transgressions.
Yit notwithstanding when as God dooth now and then afflict vs with
some barrennesse, or kill our vynes with frost, or drowne our Corne
with wet, or parche it vp with drought, and (too bee short) send vs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
and derth: they bee as a rod of God, too shewe vs that in sted of
his former leberalitie, he is now become contrarie to vs. Likewyse are
the plague, warre, particular diseases and sicknesses, harmes, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and all other such thinges as woorke vs greefe or displeasure.
They are all chastyzements whereby God putteth vs in mynd of our
sinnes and faultes, of purpose too humble vs that wee myght knowe
what wee bee, and finally too make vs ready too forsake the world the
more willingly. Howbeeit, when wee haue gatherrd all the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
trubbles, and greefes that we see, intoo one heape: yit see we well
(as I sayd afore) that God maketh vs too feele the taste and sauour of
his goodnesse, in that he gyueth vs sustenance in this world. And this
present lyfe is euer as a record of his loue. For proof wherof, we should
quayle at euery temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; at euery vexation that myght befall vs in
this world, were it neuer so little, if God gaue vs not some cheering to
mitigate his rigour withall. For he dooth alwayes shew such euent, as
may cause vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue that he myndeth not to handle vs according to
our desertes, but that in his chastizing of vs, he leaueth alwayes roome
for his mercie,<note place="margin">Hab. 3. a. 1.</note> as he himself sayeth in Habacucke. Not without cause
then doth God promis prosperitie in this lyfe, to such as obey their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
&amp; mothers. Trew it is, that Moyses ment the land of Chanaan,
bycause he spake to the people of Israel which were to be settled there.
Therefore as in respect of that people it was a particular lesson.<note place="margin">Exod. 6. a. 4. b. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Yit
notwithstanding, not euen wee at this day can set our foote in any
place, but that wee bee after a sort harbrowghed there by God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must all of vs hope for the blissing that was promised in olde

them for their inheritance.</p>
               <p>A man myght moue other questions heere. For wee see some that


<pb facs="tcp:23289:328"/>
are disobedient too their fathers and mothers, which notwithstanding
doo lyue still, and othersome which are of a good, gentle, and tractable
nature, doo dye: so as God should seeme too disanull the promis that
he made in his lawe. The answere heretoo is this. That God dooth
them no wrong whom he calleth out of this world too take vp to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
nother dooth he appayre their state. But too the intent wee may
haue an euidenter and easyer answer: let vs marke that things fall not
alwayes out alyke as in respect of temporall promyses.<note place="margin">Psal. 34. b. 10.</note> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
God promyseth too prosper all them that serue and loue him in
singlenesse of hart. And how falles this out? Wee see a number of
poore beleeuers, which are wretched too the worldward, and reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and despyzed of all men. And where is this promis of God? As
I sayd, we must alwayes haue this condition added, that God giueth
vs whatsoeuer he knoweth too bee expedient for vs. There are twoo
sortes of Gods promises: and wee must marke well that. Some of
Gods promises belong too the saluation of our soules, as his recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of vs too mercie, his pardoning of our sinnes, his shewing of vs
his will, his giuing of vs power too withstand Satan, and his streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
of vs ageinst al temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by holding vs vp with stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hand,
that wee may neuer quayle: in all these things wee must firmly and

                  </gap>astly beleeue that God will performe whatsoeuer he sayeth, yea
and farre more than our vnderstanding can see or conceyue. God then
will surmount all our wit and capa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity, in things concerning the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
saluation of our soules.</p>
               <p>But there are other promises to passe this world withall, for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of vs in our miseries. In those God wil cantle vs out our morsels,
so as wee shall now and then haue hunger and thrist with them. Yea
and yit dooth not that impeach but that he is faythfull styll. For (as
I sayde) he knoweth what is meete for vs, and therefore wee
must not take his promises precyzely woord for woord in those caces:
that is too say, we must not take them according too the bare letter or
sound of them, too say, that God should doo all that is sayd there too
the vttermost sillable: No: but wee must alwayes beare in mynd, that
he knoweth what is for our behoofe and benefite. Now then, if he
take vs soone out of this world, it is bycause he knoweth it too bee for
our welfare and saluation. And so yee see that God dooth not falsifye
his promis, when he taketh those away in the flower of their age,
which haue obeyed their fathers and moothers. Surely none dooth


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23289:328"/>
so discharge himselfe, but that he should alwayes bee found faultie, if
God listed too sift him with rigour: but yit shal some haue doone their
dewtie in such wyse, as God lyketh well of the obedience which they
haue yeelded, and yit notwithstanding he fayleth not too take them out
of the world: for he seeth that it should not bee for their profit too tarye
there any longer. As for (other) reasons that are hid in him, and in
his secret wisedome, it behoueth vs too cast downe our eyes at them,
bycause wee cannot atteyne vntoo them. Howbeit let vs vnderstand,
that if there were no hope of a better lyfe, those that are taken away so
soone out of the world, were too bee greatly lamented. But seeing
wee knowe that this world is but a pilgrimage, and this lyfe but a
iourneying to bring vs too the rest of heauen: wee must not complayne
when God deliuereth vs from the great number of miseries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wee bee beseeged heere beneath, too take vs vp too a perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
which wayteth for vs (aboue.) But howsoeuer the cace stand,
let vs beare in mynd the thing that is sayd heere: that is too wit, that
when God holdeth vs long tyme in this world, it is as a pledge of his
fatherly loue towardes vs. And therefore wee ought too bee the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in reckening the dayes that wee liue, whyle wee bee in this lyfe.
And for the same cause also dooth Moyses say in his Song,<note place="margin">Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. c. 12.</note> that it is
great wisedome when men can skyll too count their dayes, and too
consider the shortnesse of their lyfe, that they may hye them apace too
heauen.</p>
               <p>But wee must also count our dayes too a dyuerse end, and for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect, which notwithstanding is not contrarye, but both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
very well, and that is, that when wee bee come too the age of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
so as we know that God hath created vs too be glorifyed by
vs in this world: wee must on the othersyde consider how wee haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored
him, and thinke continually vppon the tyme past, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
how wee haue spent it: and this must wee doo from day to day,
and from mooneth too mooneth. And when wee come too the yeeres
end, let vs thinke thus with our selues: Behold, God hath bound mee
too him a great sort of wayes: and howe haue I counted his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes
that I haue receyued of him all my lyfe long? Can my mynd
atteyne vntoo them? Alas no, nor too the hindredth part of them.
Therefore we must make a rehersall of all our yeeres and dayes, that
wee may bee put in mynd too loue and honour God, when wee see
how greatly we bee bound vntoo him, for his maynteyning of vs so


<pb facs="tcp:23289:329"/>
long a tyme, and for his pacientnesse towardes vs in bearing with vs.
For if wee should make comparison of the faultes that wee shall haue
committed: there is not so little a fault which craueth not that wee
should bee confounded at his hand, and yit notwithstanding he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
styll his goodnesse towardes vs. Therefore let vs marke well
this doctrine, that is too wit, that this present lyfe byndeth vs too
God, bycause he maketh vs too tast his fatherly goodnesse in voutsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
too maynteyne vs well, and in extending his bounteousnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
vs, and in being so gracious as too turne all his corrections
too our benefyte and behoofe, and moreouer sheweth vs that he will
haue vs too bee inured in this world too knowe him for our father, in
that he giueth vs his word and Sacraments, whereby he assureth vs
that his setting of vs heere beneath for a tyme, is too drawe and too
gather vs in the end too himselfe. Therefore if wee consider whertoo
wee bee called, and too what ende wee bee created, namely, too
passe through this worlde and too bee taken intoo the heritage of
heauen: wee shall perceyue that this present lyfe is well woorthie
too bee esteemed, if wee consider the benefytes that God imparteth
too vs heere.</p>
               <p>It is too bee noted heerwithall, that wee shall neuer haue any pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
nor welfare in this world, except we be in Gods fauour. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in saying, <hi>that thou mayst liue long, and fare well:</hi> he sheweth
that the hauing of long lyfe is not all, but that it standeth vs on hand
too feele his blissing therwith. For the wretched vnbeleuers which
conceyue not the thing that I intend too declare, (that is too wit) that
God powreth out his riches vppon vs, too the intent we should knowe
him too bee our father, and bee confirmed more and more in tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
too his goodnesse and loue:) may well come too greate yeeres:
but what doo they in this world? What is their lyfe? It is certeyne
that all that euer they haue, shal turne to their greater condemnation,
and their riches wherin they ioy, toogither with their delyghts and
pleasures, shall but prouoke Gods wrath, and all the goods that they
inioye, shall serue but too the further inchauncing of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and too make them the more damnable. Then is it but a
wretched lyfe, if wee can perceyue no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oken of Gods goodnesse in
it.</p>
               <p>And moreouer we must proceede further to the second poynt, which
is, that such as are so disobedient too God, and too their superiours,


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23289:329"/>
haue no rest, but haue a woorme that gnaweth their consciences, and
are alwayes in vnquietnesse. Too bee short, experience sheweth, that
there is no welfare in this present lyfe, except wee bee blissed of God.
This diuersitie is not too bee seene alwayes as in respect of outward
apparance: but yit doo the faythfull know well ynough in themselues,
that God giueth them all things that they want. And so God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
not long lyfe only, but also his blissing. As if hee should say,
you shal not liue, alonly too linger heere beneath, or too get your selues
greeuouser damnation, or too repyne and too gnash your teethe, and
too torment your selues with afflictions, miseries, and trubbles: but
too tast my goodnesse. Although I exempt you not from the trubbles,
comberances, and greefs of this world: yit shall you alwayes haue
some cheering, so as yee may feele that I haue not forgot you, but that
I take you for my children, yea and that all your sorrowes and greefs
shall turne too your benefyte and welfare. Wheras the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

too keepe you from comming too mee, and too turne you away
from your perfect felicitie: I will drawe you too it by meanes of the
afflictions that you shall haue in this world. The thing therfore which
wee haue too beare in mynd, is, that too bee filled with the benefyts
which God bestoweth vppon vs in this world, and too liue at ease, is
not all that wee haue too desyre: but too knowe that it is God that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vs too prosper, and that as he giueth vs lyfe, so will he maynteyne
vs in it, and prouyde vs of all things expedient and needfull for the
same. Wherfore let vs haue it well printed in our harts.</p>
               <p>Now then if wee bee desyrous too inioy this promis of God: let
euery of vs looke too the discharging of his owne dewtie. In deede
I cannot as now go through with the things that are inioyned heere to
children, &amp; to fathers &amp; mothers: &amp; therfore I wil reserue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to another
tyme. Yit notwithstanding for a short conclusion, let vs vnderstand
that God allureth vs too our dewtie, by shewing that he seeketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but our welfare and benefyte, too the intent that wee should
with a frank and free hart receyue the yoke that he layeth vppon our
shoulders. And although it be an irksome thing too bee subiect too
those whom God hath appoynted too bee superiours ouer vs: yit when
wee haue first condemned our selues for it, let vs neuerthelesse yeeld to
that which he sayeth and vttereth, assuring our selues th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t he procureth
our welfare, &amp; would fayne win vs by gentlenesse, and not by rigour:
and let that make vs the more obedient. And also generally, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much


<pb facs="tcp:23289:330"/>
as wee see that all superiorities are of God: let vs vnderstand
that wee cannot geynsay them, but wee shall lift vp our selues ageinst
his maiestie, and bend our hornes ageinst him: and that contrariwyse
if wee beare subiection willingly, wee may assure our selues, that it is
an acceptable sacrifyze vnto him, and not doubt that our labour shalbe
lost in seruing him. Not that God will recompence vs by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
as though we had deserued aught at his hand: but he wil doo it
of ouerplus. For as I haue declared alredie, wee bee bound too obey
him in all things that he commaundeth, nother must wee think him
beholden too vs for it, nor think too bynd him too vs by any meanes,
but that although wee bee bound too him, (as wee bee wholly his) yit
he of his ouerflowing goodnesse voutsafeth too blisse vs, and too make
vs feele his fauour, when wee haue awfully and reuerently followed
the things that he ordeyneth in his woord. That then is the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
which wee ought too hope for at Gods hand: howbeeit not as
the Papistes say, ho, God promiseth vs, and therfore we deserue. They
beare themselues on hand that God is beholden vntoo them, bycause
he hath bound himselfe willingly: yea, but that is of a free (and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued)
goodnesse. Howbeeit, wee must not fall intoo such dotages,
but vnderstand that God beyng no whit at all bound vntoo vs, dooth
notwithstanding voutsafe too win vs by gentlenesse, too the intent wee
should serue him with the freer mynd and cheerfuller corage. Thus
dooth he call vs too him by all wayes. And therfore so much the leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are wee, if wee bow not our neckes willingly too giue our selues
wholly vntoo him, without seeking of any thing but onely too frame
our selues too his good pleasure and will, which is our cheefe rule, by

               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with

all men, heere are also seuerall warnings,
how euery man should behaue himselfe in

already what the husbandes ought too bee
towardes their wyues, and how the wyues
should behaue themselues towardes theyr
husbandes: what gentlenesse parentes
ought too vse towardes their children, and
what subiection children ought too vse towardes their parentes. Now
Saint Paule speaketh of Maysters and Seruantes, howbeeit, not of
such seruantes as we haue now adayes, for at that tyme there were no
seruantes that serued a yeere or two for wages, but they were hild in
bondage for lyfe and death, and were in the same taking that they bee
whom now adayes wee call bondslaues. But wee neede not too stand
any longer as now too haue further knowledge of them. Yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
wee haue great cause too prayse God for taking away of such
bondage from among men. For no doubt but it was too excessiue an
authoritie which maysters had in those dayes ouer their seruantes.
They hild them as brute beastes, and they had libertie too kill them


<pb facs="tcp:23289:331"/>
for euery fault. And in deede they had prisons in theyr houses to keepe
them locked in the stocks, they racked them, they rent them in peeces,
and (too bee short) they vsed them horribly, yea and euen beastly. Yit
notwithstanding, bycause of mans naughtinesse, it was our Lordes
wyll that this state should bee styll suffered. Moreouer, wee see that
euen they which are auowed too haue lyued in the feare of God, and to
haue excelled in his Church, left not too keepe bondmen or slaues in
their houses, howbeeit, they vsed another manner of gentlenesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
them, than the Infidels did, according as wee shall see heere
in Saint Paules teaching.</p>
               <p>Also there was a reason that constreyned maysters sometymes too
vse the greater rigour towardes their slaues, bycause it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
prouerb among them, that looke how many slaues they had, so
many enemyes they had: and that was by reason of their holding of
them in awe by extreme force and violence, as those are now adayes
vppon the Sea, which are called Gallie slaues. And I haue alredy
touched what &amp; how excessiue o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trages were done vnto them. There
was a great number of those bondfolke, and riche men had as it were
halfe armies of them, insomuch that some had fyue thousand slaues
in one house, and that was the way too haue ones throte cut fyue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
tymes, if there had not bin good heede taken too keepe them fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
And this came of sin, as one mischeef tolleth on another, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll
things bee come too vtter confuzion. But if wee consider what
the ryght or authority of maysters was, wee will alwayes say, it was
a thing vttterly ageinst all order of nature. For wee bee all fashyoned
after the image of God, and therefore that a reasonable creature in
whom God hath printed his marke, should bee put too such reproch, it
was tootoo farre out of all square. But such are the fruites of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
and sin of our father Adam, that all things were turned top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siteruie.
Also on the other part, inasmuch as seruantes were in such
subiection: it seemeth that if they could by any meanes plucke their
neckes out of the collar, it ought too bee lawfull for them, and it was
an honest excuce so too doo. But howsoeuer Seruantes fare, Saint
Paule commaundeth them to obey their maysters, &amp; too be subiect too
them. In deede he dooth also exhort the maysters not too abuse the
power that was giuen them, nor too thinke that the thing which was
graunted them by the Lawe of man, was so ryghtfull and vnparciall
before God, as they could not bee blamed for it. Saint Paule then


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:23289:331"/>
counselleth maysters too asswage the excesse of their superioritie: but
yit will he haue their seruantes too submit themselues too it, and too
beare the yoke that was so hard and heauy. Now it myght seeme
that he did seruantes wrong therein, and that he should rather haue
cried out ageinst the common abuse, that such outrage myght haue bin
layd downe. But we haue two principles to remember to restreyne vs
from attempting of any chaunge.</p>
               <p>The one is, that forasmuch as it had bin Gods will too put mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd
intoo confuzion, and that all men both great and small should be
put in mynd that Adam had peruerted the order of nature. Therfore
S. Paul counselleth seruantes to beare such subiection, assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
that it commeth of God, and therefore that they must take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.
The other is, that the Gospell serueth not too chaunge the
common policies of the world, and too make Lawes that belong too
the temporall state. It is trew that Kings, Princes, and Magistrates
ought alwayes too aske counsell at Gods mouth, and too frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vntoo his word: but yit for all that, our Lord hath giuen them
libertie, too make such Lawes as they shall perceyue too bee meete
and conuenient for the gouernment that is committed vntoo them,
howbeeit they must call vppon God too giue them the spirit of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and discretion, and bycause they bee not of abilitie too rule of
themselues, they must take aduice and counsell at Gods woord. Yit
notwithstanding, the doctrine of saluation, which is called the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen,<note place="margin">Math. 13. c. 24. d. 31.</note> and the thinges that belong too the brydling of
vs in this world, that men may knowe how too behaue themselues
one toowardes another, are sundrye thinges. That therefore is the
cause why Saint Paule left slauerye, bondage, or seruiship as it
was.</p>
               <p>And he exhorteth Seruants to doo their dewtie, <hi>in feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
that is too say, with all lowelinesse and reuerence: yea and hee
addeth further, <hi>with singlenesse of hart,</hi> which he matcheth ageinst
all the fyne slyghts and shifts wheruntoo the seruants and slaues of
that tyme were too much giuen, as is too bee seene in them that haue
written of them, &amp; haue set forth the maners and trade of lif which was
in course and vse at those dayes. And let vs mark first of all, that S.
Paul thinks it not ynough for seruants too seeke the benefyte &amp; profit
of their maisters, and to be willing to obey them, and too be foreward
in executing whatsoeuer is commaunded them: but he requyreth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence


<pb facs="tcp:23289:332"/>
aboue all things, as I sayde afore. Let Seruants vnderstand,
that although they should not bee inforced, nor chastized with whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
when they doo amisse, but that they had gentle and meeke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
yit notwithstanding they ought too beare paciently the state
wherin they bee, assuring themselues that God alloweth of it, and that
the superioritie which their maysters haue ouer them, how hard and
greeuous so euer it be, is neuerthelesse ordeyned and stablished of God.
And that is the cause why he setteth downe the woord <hi>Singlenesse.</hi>
For wee bee ouer wittie in seeking our owne aduauntage, and there is
none of vs all which is not a great doctor in matters concerning his
owne profit. Why should such a one (say wee) haue this prerogatiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
mee? What reason is there that I should bee bound too him in
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take mee the handicrafts men, that neuer knew word of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and deale with them in dayly matters, and in things that may
make with them, and they bee so skilfull in debating their cace, that
yee would take them too bee all men of lawe. Forasmuch then as men
are so wyly in seeking their owne commoditie and profit, too the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of others: Saint Paule dooth purposely set downe singlenesse
of hart, which serueth too sift all affections, and too ouerthrowe all
things that men can deuyze too hinder themselues from dooing of their
dewties.</p>
               <p>Now he setteth downe purposely (these woords:) <hi>As seruing the
Lord:</hi> and it is the cheef foundation that wee haue too leane vntoo,
when the cace concerneth the dooing of any dewtie towards men. For
if wee sticke too creatures, wee wil say, Came wee not all out of the
Ark of Noe? Why should he bee better esteemed than I? Is it meete
that I should bee put vnder his feete? what reason is that: And all
the rest of the woords which wee heare euery day. For wee haue skill
ynough too alledge exemption, and so little doo wee think our selues
bound vnto others, that wee think all others bound vntoo vs. The
mark therfore that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shoote at, is, that euery man would be a Lord,
and no man admit any subiection. And so it would needs followe, that
wee should bee as wyld beasts, or rather as doggs and Catts (as men
say), vntill wee knew that God lyketh well of the seruis that wee doo
too creatures. If wee bee not throughly perswaded of that, wee may
well make some fayre countenances, and please men: but out mynd
shall neuer bee ryght and well dispozed, vntill wee bee come to the
poynt that wee know, that our Lord accepteth our seruis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:23289:332"/>
But there is yit one other cause that myght hinder vs, or rather
coole vs in the discharge of our dewtie towards other men: and that is,
mens vnthankfulnesse. For they whom wee pleasure, doo commonly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> vs no thank, but rather think that wee bee made for none other
purpose but too serue them. When wee see them requyte our seruis
so euill, it spyteth vs: and it were ynough too make vs leaue of altoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.
Now then it is needfull for vs too come backe too that which
Saint Paule telleth vs: namly that God is aboue all degrees, and
that he hauing superioritie ouer the world, will haue euery man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
him self with all humblenesse, and that all subiections which he
hath ordeyned in the world, too remayne firme and vnuiolable. This is
the effect of the thing that Saint Paule telleth vs heere.</p>
               <p>Now first of all wee haue too mark the generall article which I
come now to touch: which is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue superiours ouer vs, we
must not obey them as inforced,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. a. 1.</note> but bycause God hath ordeyned them,
and there is no preheminence but of him, as Saint Paule declareth to
the Romanes. It is trew that there he speaketh expressely of Princes
and Magistrates: but yit for all that, it extendeth too all authoritie, as
too that which parentes haue ouer their children, husbandes ouer
wyues, and Maysters ouer their seruantes. Therefore wee must bee
fully perswaded of this, that Gods intent is not that all men should bee
shuffled toogither, (as it woulde come too passe, if there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streynt,)
but that some should rule and haue authoritie too commaund
others, and that they which are vnder them, should obey. Then is it an
vnreuocable sentence of God, wheruntoo wee must hold our selues and
bee contented. For if wee protest our selues too bee willing too obey
God, and in the meane whyle will needs remoue all order that he hath
set among vs: all that wee speake wyth our mouth is but hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
Therefore wee must gyue a proofe of our humilitie too God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by our willyng and easye bearing of mans yoke which he
hath layd vppon vs as it were his owne handes. Let that bee for one
poynt.</p>
               <p>Now (as I sayd) this comprehendeth all subiection, as well of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
towardes Princes and Magistrates, of children towardes theyr
parentes, and of wyues towardes their husbandes: as also of seruantes
towardes their maysters. And when wee once haue that, it wyll bee
easie for vs too withstand all the trubbles and incomberances that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
vs, and turne vs away from our dewties. For what is the cause


<pb facs="tcp:23289:333"/>
that wee cannot submit our selues too Gods wyll? As I sayd, all these
disputings are vnauaylable and fond, when a man shall say, Why am
I bound too such a one? Why shoulde he holde his foote vppon my
throte? Who hath giuen him more authoritie than mee? But seeyng
God hath told vs that he will haue it so: it behoueth vs too holde our
peace. Therfore if wee bee fully perswaded of it, wee shall be too fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
if wee shewe not by our deedes that wee bee willing too please
our God, and too fulfill his good wyll. For if a mayster haue a great
multitude of folke in his house, he shall bee of sufficient authoritie too
appoynt whom he listeth too haue the ouersyght of it, and they must be
obeyed. A Prince hath his officers, and they must commaund, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must herken too them, and simply obey them. And what is too
bee doone then, when our God who is the souerein Lord and father,
&amp; hath the ryght of preheminence and dominion ouer vs, will haue vs
too obey such as he hath appoynted, without making any reply? For
what can it boote too say the contrarie? Therefore (as I sayde) let vs
print this counsell of Saint Paules throughly in our hartes, That
when wee doo our dewtie willingly and vnfeynedly towardes those
whom God hath set in authoritie ouer vs, wee serue God himself. And
soothly, without that mynd, all the vertewes that wee can haue in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shewe too the worldward, shalbee but smoke, as yee shall see a
number of men that pretend maruelously well, insomuch that they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they serue, shall bee contented tootoo well with them. But although
such dealing bee allowed among men: yit is it nothing woorth before
God. And why? For God will bee honored at our handes: He wyll
haue men too inioy theyr ryght in such wyse, as nother he bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
nor they as it were defaced. Therefore if wee will but onely obey
men, and despyze the thing which God will haue too bee as an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
sacrifyze too himselfe: what a dealing were that? Then let vs
tend alwayes too him, and dedicate our selues too him. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is hys will that wee should bee vnderlyngs, let vs beare
that yoke willyngly, and with a free and vnslauishe or vnconstreyned
mynd.</p>
               <p>And for the same cause Saint Paule sayeth expresly, <hi>Let not your
seruice bee eye seruice, as though yee sought too pleaze men.</hi> And
in very deede, they that play their pageantes so fayre (as they say)
seeke eyther recompence, or else too bee well interteyned and fed with
the fattest, or else too haue greater wages, and afterward too haue


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:23289:333"/>
some extraordinarye gift or reward when occasion serueth. That is
the thing that men hunt for, when they haue not an eye vntoo God.
But Saint Paule telleth vs, that although they whom we serue be so
froward, as wee cannot tell how too content them, and wee haue not
any hope that euer wee shall get the valew of a button at their hands:
yit wee must neuerthelesse performe our dewties towards God. And
heere wee haue too gather, that in all things which God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs, wee must not onely imploy our eyes, our feete, our handes,
and our armes (as they say:) but wee must begin with the inwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

affection. Therefore when as Saint Paule sayeth, <hi>not vvith eye
seruice:</hi> he sheweth vs, that if wee desyre that our Lord should allowe
our serui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

as it is sayd, that he regardeth faythfulnesse, that is too say,
that wee should deale soundly,<note place="margin">Psal. 101. b. 6.</note> playnly, and substancially. Thus are
all gay showes quyte dasht. For (as I sayd) there is grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that wee should resort too him with a free and franke hart: thinke
wee that he accepteth aught at our handes, when wee come too him

too any worldly and transitorie policie, nother is that the state of Gods

in that state, as though he had appoynted them their place there
with his owne hand. Therfore let not the common sort aduaunce them
selues, but bee contented with their state.</p>
               <p>That (say I) is the cause why Saint Paule setteth downe this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expresly, <hi>as touching the flesh.</hi> It was not too bring maysters
in contempt for reygning ouer their slaues, but too preuent all obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that men myght alledge, when they would seeke priuiledge too
exempt themselues from obedience too God, and too all order that he
hath set. And therewith all hee dooeth vs too vnderstande also, that
the same subiection is no preiudice too the faythfull, but that they may
continew still in full libertie, as in respect of their soules. For the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
vseth that colour also. What (sayeth he)? Seeing that
our Lord Iesus Christ hath shed his blud too purchace vs freedome,
why should wee not continew in it? Yea, but Saint Paule answereth
theruntoo, (as he hath doone with more large circumstance in the fifth
Chapter of the first Epistle too the Corinthians:) that the bondage
which wee yeeld too our superiours, is alonly as touching the flesh,
and that our soules and consciences ceasse not too bee alwayes frank
and free before God. And therfore it is a chyldish ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ection, too say,
that seeing our Lord Iesus Christ hath set vs free, why should men
make vs bond? He hath not set vs free as touching our bodyes, for it
is his will that there should bee principalities and Lordshippes still
in the world: which cannot bee, but that some must be subiect, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome
haue preheminence and authoritie. For asmuch then as our
Lord hath so distinguished the twoo gouernmentes of the bodie and of
the soule, and that the one is spirituall, and too bee gouerned by his

chaunge their state: for wee see how Saint Paule hath cut of all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of such dealing. And therfore let vs learne by that which is told
vs heere, that first and formest wee must haue God as it were fastened
before our eyes, and knowe that he hath set vs in this world too serue
one another in such sort, as wee must notwithstanding liue toogither
in all humilitie, and not disdeyne too doo our dewtie euen towards such
as are not so sufficient as wee could wish, &amp; as wee take our selues too
bee. Bee wee once at that poynt, it is certein that wee will euery of
vs submit our selues willingly according too the state that God calleth
vs too, and hold our selues in the place where he hath put vs.</p>
               <p>Now if Saint Paule would that the Slaues of his tyme should be
so obedient too their maysters, there is lesse excuce in these dayes, for
Seruants that take wages. Let vs compare the one with the other.
Those poore soules (as I tolde you before) were handled so rigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly,
that their maysters myght imprizon them, put them in the
stocks, racke them, dismember them, mayme them, yea and kill them.
It was a greeuous cace, and yit were they bound too it for lyfe and
death.<note place="margin">Exod. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

among whom God had appoynted a terme. But the common and
generall lawe of all nations was, that bond folks with their children
should continew bond for euer, so as the father had no more ryght too
his owne chyld, that a horse (as yee would say) or any other beast had
ouer the young ones that came of their seede. And was not such a
state as bad as a hundred deathes? Yis: for man dooth alwayes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
libertie, and too take his ease, and too eate his bread with quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and those wretched slaues had not a bit of bread at their owne
appoyntment. As touching their persons, they were woorse than
Captyues, as I sayd afore. And yit for all this, God willeth and
commaundeth streytly, that they should beare this state paciently, and
performe their dewties faythfully, and fall too it with a free and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hart. Now what is too bee sayd of hyred seruants, which may
warne themselues away, and haue their wages payd them when they
haue serued out their yeere, and are vsed and treated much more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and liberally than those poore slaues were? For they were fayne
too labour euery one in his trade and craft, they earned their bread,
they drunk water many a tyme scarce their fill, and they were shet vp
in Cabanes, where they were inforced too doo their taskes. Then if
Serua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:23289:335"/>
that God hath layd vppon their backes: it is certein that they be too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vnexcuzable. As much is to be sayd of subiectes towardes their
Magistrates. Therfore inasmuch as we see that our Lord spareth vs:
wee bee so much the more bound too the subiection which S. Paule
speakes of heere.</p>
               <p>Furthermore wee haue too wey yit agein the woordes where he
speaketh of franke and free harted willingnesse. For it is impossible
for vs too fynd any tast or sauour in our state or calling, of what sorte
so euer it bee, except wee knowe it bee for our benefyte and welfare.
For we can reape no great profit of the seruing of Creatures. Wee
must therefore resort alwayes too our God, and ame at this marke,
namely that seeyng he hath bin so good and gracious too vs as too set
vs in this world, and too maynteyne vs heere, and too shewe himselfe
so good a father towardes vs, that all that euer wee haue, dooth come
of him: wee must shewe the reuerence which wee beare too his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and labour too please him in such wyse, as wee sticke not too bee
subiect too men, nor take it in greefe or in scorne. So shall our state
bee greatly sweetened, when wee know that God accepteth it in good
woorth at our handes.</p>
               <p>And that also is the cause why he setteth these things as one ageinst
another: not too shewe any contrarietie, but rather too accord them
toogither. For he sayeth, that wee must serue God on the behalfe of
our maysters, with all willingnesse: and afterwarde setteth downe
Gods will on the other syde. Then is it a very good melodie which
answereth very well, that wee should know how it is Gods wyll, that
seruantes should obey their maysters. And this will of Gods must
dispatch all obiections that myght hinder vs or stop vs. When the
diuell tempteth vs too thinke any thing straunge that is commaunded
vs, he intyceth vs too our destruction. Now then, let vs take Gods
wyll as our souereine welfare and perfect happinesse, assuring our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
that howsoeuer wee bee handled at his hand, yit he loueth vs styll,
and hath an eye too that which is good for vs. Let that serue for one
poynt. And if wee haue such perswasion well rooted in our hartes, it
is certein that this willingnesse which S. Paule speaketh of will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with it, so as wee shall fynde no lothnesse in our selues, too grudge
ageinst it, as wee see they doo which are inforced to doo things ageinst
their wils: for they grunt at it, and although they dare not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
of it, yit their hartes are fell, and there is nothing but rancor


<pb facs="tcp:23289:336"/>
in them. Therefore Saint Paule setteth downe willingnesse, that is
too say, that wee should doo all thinges with a good will and freely.
And so shall we make our state lee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>some and pleasant. For as for them
that doo nothing but by force and constreynt: they cannot eschew the
necessitie of obeying, and yit in the meane whyle they bee tormenters
too themselues, and woorke themselues more spyte then they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
by all the sorrowes that they can alledge. For when wee bee
handled roughly by our maysters, superiors, and Magistrates: yit if
wee bee sure that God accepteth our seruice, it asswageth all the greef
that wee can conceyue, so that when wee haue doone our dewtie, wee
take our repaste with praysing of God, wee take our rest as a releefe
that he giueth vs for our infirmities, and besydes this wee wyll euer
haue an eye too the heauenly lyfe, and take corage at it too walke on,
though wee haue neuer so many stoppes. Yee see then that Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall alwayes make a hundred tymes better market, when they
doo their dewtie in seruing God freely: than they that go too it as
though nyne men hild them, (as they say) and discharge it very coldly
with grudging and repyning.</p>
               <p>Furthermore let vs marke, that Saint Paule heere bringeth vs
three tymes backe vntoo God and too our Lord Iesus Christ: and
that is too rid vs of this imagination which wee myght conceyue, that
if other men misbehaue themselues towardes vs, the bond is broken
too vs, and therefore that wee may exempt our selues from subiection
if wee can. As for example, if a seruant haue a mayster that is too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and froward, he thinkes with himselfe, why? What doo I?
And so, seruantes thinke themselues halfe quit, if their maisters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
not their dewties towardes them. But S. Paule declareth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,
that although maysters be so cruell as they doo by no meanes
spare such as are vnder their hand: yit is not their superioritie dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
therby. Trew it is, that in respect of themselues such maisters
are vnwoorthie too haue authoritie, as wee shall see hereafter. But yit
for all that, he that is the inferiour must holde himselfe styll vnder the
yoke, bycause he sees that God hath so ordeyned it. That is the effect
of the thing which wee haue too beare in mynd.</p>
               <p>And on the other syde, Saint Paul forgetteth not seruants, that he
should not procure them their right, and that which belongeth too
them. For he commaundeth maysters too doo the lyke too them, not
as ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and matelyke (as they say) but so as maisters consider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:23289:336"/>
though the ciuill lawes lay the brydle looce in their necks, yit dooth
not God graunt them leaue too doo what they list, but speaketh as
well for the one as for the other: which thing wee must beare well in
mynd. Now for the maysters he giueth this rule, namely that they
must looke well about them how they rule, bycause they haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mayster in heauen,<note place="margin">Deut. 10. d. 17. &amp;. Rom. 2. b. 11.</note> who accepteth no persons. As touching
Seruants, he sayeth, my freends, though yee haue not such recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in this worlde as yee would desyre: let it suffyze you that God
accounteth you not as slaues. It is trewe that yee bee despyzed
too the worldwarde, but you haue your inheritaunce in heauen, and
our Lord accepteth your seruis, and yee shall haue your reward payd
you as well as if yee were Kinges and Princes. That is the
thing which wee haue too remember heere. In deede the tyme will
not serue for the whole discourse of it: but yit wee see, that first Saint
Paule ment not too currye fauor with the greate and riche sort, by
maynteyning their ryght ageinst their slaues: &amp; also that he laboreth
on the other syde, too bring those too lowelinesse and meeknesse, which
otherwyse myght haue aduaunced themselues too much. And the same
order ought too bee obserued by such as haue charge in the Churche,
&amp; are ministers of Gods word: namely that they spare nother great
nor small, but tell euery man his dewtie. For sith there is no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of persons before God: his woord must bee handled roundly, and
wee must not bee dismayed at the hyghnesse and authoritie of such as
are in estimation among men. For seeing it is God that speaketh,
his woord must pull downe all loftinesse, according as Saint Paule
speaketh in the second too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. b. 5.</note> where he sayth, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is giuen too all Shepherds and ministers of the Gospell, too
pull downe the pryde of men, and too subdew their ouer loftinesse, when
they will needs exalt themselues ageinst our Lord Iesus Christ, and
step vp ageinst his doctrine, so as they wil not submit themselues too
his yoke. The way then for ministers of Gods woord too discharge
their office faythfully, is too exhort the meaner sort too doo their dewtie,
and the poore and oppressed too beare their state paciently without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
howsoeuer they fare, and without grudging ageinst men, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in so dooing they should rebell ageinst God.</p>
               <p>But on the other syde also he telleth the greate ones, that they must
not be as beasts that deuoure others, and eate them vp, but that they
must behaue themselues vpryghtly. And in deede euen the heathen


<pb facs="tcp:23289:337"/>
men themselues, when they listed too speake according too naturall
equitie, declared that euen at that tyme it became not the maysters
too abuze the authoritie which they had ouer their seruants: and these
were their woords, that bondmen and slaues ought to be hild as Hyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges
that were interteyned by the day. Sith the Paymins spake
so, without hauing any other vnderstanding than their moother wit
auorded them: what excuce is there now adayes for such as are tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp in Gods schoole, where there is a brotherhood betweene both
greate and small, and where the maysters ought too become fellowlie
with their seruants, bycause they haue all one hope of the endlesse lyfe?
If they that haue power aboue others, will needs set their feete vppon
their throts by abu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the ryght of their authoritie: what a thing is
it? So then, so much the more ought both the one and the other sort of
vs, too think how too walk in our owne state and calling: so as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
sort grudge not that our Lord suffereth them too bee abandoned
too so many wrongs too this worldward, and too bee so mocked and
scorned: but that although they should indure a hundred tymes as
much, yit they repyne not ageinst God, bycause it were but a kicking
ageinst the spurre: And the greater sort also doo the lyke, that is too
say, that they consider, that the neerer God hath drawen them too him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in giuing them preheminence, the more will he also haue them too
fashyon themselues too his image and lykenesse. And what shall wee
fynd in God but goodnesse? according as wee see that throughout all
the Scripture he is called the fountaine of all lowelinesse, gentlenesse,
and mercy. And therefore let such as are in degree of honour thinke
cheefely theruppon. For it is certein, that if they discharge not their
dewtie, they shall pay full deerely for that they haue bin so honorable
in the world, and yit abuzed the singular benefyte of God. And (as I
sayd afore) bycause both the one and the other are hard too bee brought
too conformitie: insomuch that they which are oppressed, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freyne
grudging, but are prouoked too breake all bondes: Let them
be hild in awe by Gods woord, and by earnest exhortations. And let
the great ones also bee subdewed, that they forget not God as they are
woont too doo. For they ouershoote themselues so farre, as to thinke
they bee no more mortall men. And it is certein, that if men bethinke
themselues well of their owne state, and view themselues in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the meanest, it will leade them too humilitie. So then, Gods
woord must haue his course in this cace, too brydle as well the one as


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:23289:337"/>
the other, that wee may lyue in such sort euery man according too his
calling, as God may bee quietly obeyed, and wee in herkening too
his voyce, desyre nothing but too performe our dewtie towardes him,
and towardes all creatures, vntyll wee bee come too the euerlastyng
kingdome, where wee shall bee parttakers both of his glory, and of
his maiestie, and of all the good things that are in him.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our sinnes, praying him to voutsafe to touch vs
with trew and lyuely repentance, that wee may bee so sorie for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of him, as it may make vs too hate our vyces, and too craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of them at his hand, too the intent he may gouerne vs by his holy
spirit, and make vs too liue according too his holy commaundements,
and beare with our weakenesse, vntyll hee haue rid vs quyte and

the poorer sorte which are despyzed and

why Saint Iames sayth, let him that is small, glory in his hyghnesse.
Why so? Bycause God hath adopted vs too his children, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee bee but poore earthwoormes, and euen men themselues
account vs as filth and dung: yit hath God voutsafed too print his
marke in vs, that wee myght bee knowen too be his children, and that
he hath giuen vs leaue to call vpon him as our father with full mouth.
Therefore wee haue iust cause too glory, notwithstanding that wee be
of lowe degree. For wee haue a hyghnesse whereby God exalteth vs
aboue all the world. And on the contrary part, Saint Iames sayeth,
that he which is great, must glory in his lowenesse. For wheras the
vnbeleeuers are so bewitched with pryde, that they despyze God,
and (as I sayd afore) doo beare themselues on hand, that they bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from all lawe, and that their state is set alone by it selfe from
all the rest of the world: the beleeuers must vnderstand, that all the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
and excellencie in the world, serueth but for a tyme, and passeth
away, and that when wee come before God, wee shall haue nother one
thing nor other to clothe our selues withall. Too bee short, the things


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:23289:339"/>
which the scripture calleth Persons, are as apparels and clothings.
Let vs take this similitude: If he that is richly apparelled, thinke too
scape from God, vnder colour that he gazeth at his owne gay fethers,
and that the world woondereth too beholde him: he deceyueth himself
very much. For all those things must bee layd asyde when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs too iudgement. Agein, the poore folke that scarsely haue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
too couer halfe their body, yea and that but with a fewe ragges
and torne cloutes, must not thinke themselues the lesse esteemed (of
God) for all that. For there shall bee no more persons, that is too say,
there shall bee noth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

must all appeere as wee bee, that is too say, mortall men, and children
of Adam. That is it in effect which wee haue too gather vppon that
lesson.</p>
               <p>After Saint Paule hath shewed euery mans dewtie particularly:
now he returneth agein too generall doctrine. For (as I sayd afore)
there is one rule common too all men without exception, which is the
same that is conteyned in Gods lawe, namely that wee should leade a
holy lyfe, giuing our selues ouer vnto his seruis: and also loue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
liuing chastely and soberly, in all myldnesse and honestie.
This is common. But it is sayd afterward, that euery man must haue
an eye too his owne calling, as, the husband hath a speciall dewtie
towards his wyfe, and the wyfe towards hir husband, as wee haue
seene hertoofore: for Saint Paule hath layd foorth all those things.
Now he attempereth his talk too all men, saying, <hi>Moreouer my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
bee strong in the Lord.</hi> Wherin he sheweth that wee cannot
giue our selues too the seruing of God without hardnesse, but must take
peynes too prepare our selues thertoo. Trew it is that if wee were
whole and sound, and that our nature were vncorrupted, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
dare vs to liue according too Gods commaundement: nay rather
it would be our whole pleasure, accordingly as the faythfull doo feele
by experience, when God hath touched them too the quicke. And for
that cause also dooth our Lord Iesus Christ say,<note place="margin">Math. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

hard nor rough, nor his burthen heauie: as if he should say, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth
nothing but too guyde vs by all gentle aud louing meanes. But
if wee consider what wee bee: that is too say, how vnable wee are too
bee firme and constat, and too hold out in the way which God sheweth
vs: surely wee shall well see how it is not without cause, that Saint
Paule exhorteth vs heere too bee strong. As if he should say, I haue


<pb facs="tcp:23289:340"/>
exhorted you hithertoo too doo your dewties: but I knowe well that
euery of you shall fynde such stubornnesse in him self, as he shal not be
able too ouercome his wicked lusts but by fyghting manfully. And
though you be weake, yit think not that that ought to serue for excuce.
When your passions on the one syde are stubborne and rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinst
God, and your selues on the other syde are frayle: think not that
that shall quit you before God: for yee shalbee condemned in your
sinnes neuerthelesse. What is too bee doone then? Bee yee strong in
the Lord (sayeth he:) that is too say, wheras most men doo welter in
their sinnes, and think themselues discharged by<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and affections are so rebellious ageinst the ryghtuousnesse of God:
you knowing all the same miseries must mislyke of your selues for
them, and seeke the remedie of them. And what is that? Strengthen
your selues: that is too say, wee must inforce our selues: As if hee
should say, It is a hard thing too walk aryght: for wee shall haue as
many impediments as may be. The diuell wil not ceasse too seeke all
meanes possible too thrust vs out of the way, and wee shall haue store
of oppressions and vexations, for he hath slyghtes ynow and too many,
and besyds that, he assayleth vs now after one maner, and now after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and we haue not wherwith too resist him. Therfore it behoueth
vs too get strength too vs.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, he sayth, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> least men should imagin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
able too furnish out the matter with their owne freewill, and
with their owne cunning. Therefore, <hi>Bee yee strong in the Lord</hi>
(sayeth he) yea and <hi>in the myghtinesse of his power.</hi> When hee
dooeth vs too wit, that God will vtter such power, as wee shal not
neede to doubt of victorie ageinst all that the diuell can practyze, so we
bee not rechlesse, ne fall asleepe. Wherfore let vs call vppon God,
that he may help vs and succour vs at our neede. So then, let these
twoo things go toogither with vs: that is too wit, first wakefulnesse,
and such care as the faythfull should haue too strengthen themselues:
and on the other syde, hartie desyrousnesse too call vppon God. And
this is a text well woorthie too bee marked, as which conteyneth a
greate matter in fewe woords. For first wee see that wee must not
bee slothfull if wee couet too rule our lyfe according too Gods will,
but forasmuch as euery man beareth with him self, and we desyre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but too shake of all care, and too cast the things at our backs (as
they say) which myght trubble vs: too the end wee bee not so nyce,


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:23289:340"/>
wee must mark first of all, that if wee will serue God, wee must inforce
our selues, and that is as much to say as we must fyght ageinst the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
For (as I sayd afore) he is not ydle, nother will he suffer any of
vs to doo our dewtie with such ease, as though wee did but walk vp
and downe in some foyre place: but he will set thornes, and cast logs
in our wayes too stop vs. Agein, he will giue such girds at vs, as shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee
ynough too ouerthrow vs a hundred tymes, before wee can step
one pace, vnlesse God ayd vs. Forasmuch therfore as wee cannot
walk in the feare of God without fyghting: wee ought too beare
Saint Paules warning in mynd. Furthermore he intendeth also too
make vs perceyue our owne weaknesse. For wee knowe that men doo
beare much with themselues, and seeke nothing but too welter in their
pleasures. Also there are which presume vppon their owne strength, &amp;
beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues on hand that they be able to worke wonders as though
they were as stout as could bee requyred. And this cursed perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath deceiued wretched me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in al ages, and by that meane hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
trotted in euery mans mouth. But S. Paule telleth vs heere, that
wee haue neede too bee strenthened: which saying importeth that wee
bee weake by nature.</p>
               <p>And afterward he expresseth him self yit better, in saying, <hi>that it is
in the Lord that wee must bee strong,</hi> and that he hath all power in
him, too giue therof vntoo vs, as much as needeth. Then if wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryze
any thing without calling vppon him, wee shalbee punished
for our rashnesse and pryde. Saint Paule therfore sheweth vs, that
men cast themselues into decay by their ouerweening, in imagining
themselues too haue that which they haue not, which conceyt turneth
them away from calling vppon God, Now it myght bee sayd heere,
that it is a superfluous exhortation too bid vs bee strong in the Lord:
for no man is able too vphold him self: that lyeth not in any bodies
power too doo. (No:) but yit for all that, wee feele by effect, that
God woorketh in such wyse in vs, that wee doo the same things that
he dooeth. But yit must that woorking needs bee amyable too vs. If
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue liued holily, so as he may haue bin as a mirrour of holinesse
and of all vertew: it may well bee sayd, he hath doone this or that.
And in deede wee bee not as timber logs: and therfore wee doo good.
Yea, but yit must wee vnderstand that this (woorking) commeth from
elswhere than of our selues: and there lyeth the knot of the cace. Then
if it bee demaunded, whether men can doo good or no: yea, but not of


<pb facs="tcp:23289:341"/>
themselues, nor of their owne selfmouing, or of their owne kynd, but
(only) bycause they bee guyded by the holie Ghoste. If it bee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
whethr men can doo euill: yea, they bee giuen wholy too it, it is
their common byasse. So then, men doo euill of themselues, and the
roote of it remayneth in them, and the blame of it is ryghtly imputed
vntoo them, and they must not fetch wyndlasses aboue nor beneath too
fynd tryflyng shiftes. Whosoeuer hath doone euill, shall abyde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in his condemnation: but let vs consider well that God woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in vs when wee doo good, and the prayse thereof ought of ryght
too bee giuen too him. Howbeeit, although there bee nothing in vs
nor on our syde when wee serue God: yit notwithstanding S. Paule
exhorteth vs not in vayne, in saying that wee must bee strengthened
in God.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all according too his good pleasure freely and of his owne mercy.

vs too woorke our saluation. For is that in vs? (No:) But he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
that which myght bee conceyued through presumption and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerweening,
by saying that it must bee done with trembling, and that
wee must walke in feare: that is too say, wee must distrust our selues,
yea and bee vtterly abashed, assuring our selues that wee cannot stirre

(which confirmeth this matter yit better) he addeth for a conclusion,
that God giueth both the wyll and the performance of the wyll. Then
is it God that dooeth all, and yit ceasse not wee too doo also: yea, but
that is by him, and of him, as I haue declared already. Too bee short,
the holy Scripture sayeth, not that God doth renew vs, and that when
wee bee begotten agein by his holy spirit, wee begin too haue a good
mynd and too bee well inclyned: too the intent wee should bee sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and ydle, but too the intent that God should bee glorifyed, and wee
not imagin our selues too bee the woorkers of our owne saluation, but
yeeld him the honour of all the good that he hath put intoo vs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the world go, yit must wee bee watchfull, that is too saye, wee
must keepe good watch ageinst the diuell, and indeuer too giue our
selues too goodnesse, so as euery of vs inforce our selues, for wee must

               <p>His adding of these woordes, <hi>of the myghtye povver of God,</hi>
is too make vs ouercome all distrust, for wee see wee bee geuen too
bee out of hart, insomuch that if wee cannot compasse the thinges as
wee would, which he commaundeth vs, wee conclude, that in the end
wee must needes quayle. But contrarywyse Saint Paule sayeth,
that God will vtter a myghty and victorious power, according as it
is sayd, that he which is on our syde is stronger than all the world.
Seeing then that God taketh our part, and vpholdeth vs with his
power: let vs not feare too bee surpryzed by Satan and all that euer
hee can deuyze ageinst vs, but that whatsoeuer distresses betyde
vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. c. 9.</note> in the end wee shall ouercome all, euen by resting vppon Gods
inuincible power. And of a truth God perfecteth his power in our
weaknesse: that is too say, he woorketh not in such wyse, but that in

of Gods assistence, and that is too the end wee should knowe what
neede wee haue too call vppon him, and too flee too him for refuge.
For wee bee redye ynough of our selues too barken Gods glory. And

him euery minute of an houre, knowing that if he helped vs not vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
and hild vs on our feete, wee should perish without any mercye.
That then is the cause why that vntoo Paules former saying, wee
must also ioyne this sentence, that God doth in deede leaue some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in vs as long as wee lyue in this world, but yit ceasseth not too
vtter his inuincible power in making vs too get the vpper hand: and
that wee must dwell vppon this concluzion, that when Satan hath
wrought the vttermost that he can, yit must wee marche on neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and keepe our way too our iournyes end. And why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is
not onely sayd, that God will humble vs, and that he will haue pitye

vppon vs: but also that his power shal shewe it selfe in succoring vs,
and that not with a single and common operation, but with a myghtye
power, that is too say, with a power that shall ouercome all the lettes
of the world.</p>
               <p>Now then wee see what diuersitie there is betweene the doctrine
of the Papistes, and the doctrine that we follow, which is grounded
vppon the holy Scripture. For these blynd wretches say, they can
woorke woonders by their freewill. In deede they will giue some
little snippet vntoo God, saying, that he supplyeth their wantes, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they bee inclined too euill and too vyce, but that they bee restrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by him. God therefore is as a pretie fellowe too help them at a
dead lift: but in the meane whyle it is their owne freewill, and their
naturall power that beares all the sway. But when they haue made
the vttermost of their owne strength: yit doo men dwell alwayes in
doubt, &amp; if they happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold their own one houre, by and by they slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and can neuer get vp agein. But contrariwyse wee hold opinion,
that man must bee vtterly beaten downe (as wee bee taught by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost,) so as wee may not haue one drop of power resident in our
selues, but bee vtterly emptied. Are wee once at that poynt? Our
Lord sheweth vs the remedye. If wee repayre too him, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

then dooth our Lord assure vs, that he will not fayle vs, and wee shall

reckening,) and are put too vtter shame. On our part, when wee
haue acknowledged that nothing wee bee, nor nothing can doo, wee
resort vntoo God, too glory ageinst Satan, and ageinst all the
assaultes that he giueth vppon vs, and ageinst all the munitions of hel,
and ageinst all the impedimentes and temptations in the worlde.
Thus yee see how wee ought too put this lesson of Saint Paules
in vre.</p>
               <p>After he hath spoken so of the myghtye power of God: now he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<hi>that vvee must arme our selues vvith his complet Harnesse.</hi>
As if he should say, that it is long of none but our selues, that wee bee

that our owne negligence is the cause that wee bee so often vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:23289:342"/>
vs by his power, and that in such measure, as wee shall get the vpper
hand: but also putteth meanes intoo our handes, and armeth vs: and
yit notwithstanding wee hang vp our armour vppon the wall. And
is it any maruell if wee bee taken vnwares, or bee vnable too resist
at the pinch, when wee hold scorne too vse the meanes that God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
vs, and are so neere our hand? Now what is this armour?
Saint Paule will shewe it in dew place, as now let it suffize vs too
knowe his intent. Then whereas it is sayd, that wee must bee armed
with Gods complet harnesse: it is too rebuke and quicken vp our
rechlesnesse, in letting the things alone which he offereth vs. In deede
wee will lyke well if a man tell vs that God is redye and foreward too
succour vs, and that we neede not too doubt of victorie ageinst all our
enemies, so long as he is on our syde: we accept this geere willingly:
but in the meane whyle wee bee contented too sit styll, and it is not
for vs too incounter our enemie, for he is farre too strong for vs. But
yit must wee in this cace incounter hand too hand: and wee would that
Gods armours should lye styll, and bee prepared for vs without v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them. For this cause are wee commaunded too put them on,
that is too say, too apylye them too our vse, sith our sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wee must maynteyne battell, and it pleaseth God that wee should bee
so armed, and that the diuell should not come vppon vs vnprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>And Saint Paule not onely vseth the woord <hi>Armor or Harnesse:</hi>
but also addeth, <hi>all the furniture,</hi> as if he should say, wee must bee
armed from top too toe. And that shalbe set foorth particularly yit
better heerafter. Howbeeit his meaning in this text, is that our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse
is knowen so much the more, in that God armeth vs at
all poyntes, so as nothing is missing, except the fault bee in our selues.
In deede wee will not sticke too put on some part of the armour that
God giueth vs: howbeeit, it is but as if one man should clap on his
Morion for a countenance, &amp; take nother Target, nor Corselet nor any
thing else: and another catch vp his swoord, and the third his halberd,
&amp; in the meane whyle euery of them want many other things that they
should haue neede of. So wee perhaps apply some part of Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
too our vse: that is too say, wee will not vtterly reiect or refuze
all the grace that he offereth vs. But there is none of vs all that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
himselfe as he should doo: that is too say, which is fenced with
all the vertues that God giueth him. For it is certein, that both from


<pb facs="tcp:23289:343"/>
the ryght hand and from the left, from aboue and from beneathe, God
ordeyneth meanes for vs too fyght withall, which are sufficient, so wee
despyze them not, but vpon knowledge of our want, receiue the things
which he giueth vs so liberally.</p>
               <p>And too the intent wee should bee the more prouoked too arme our

he confirmeth the matter that I spake of afore: that is too wit, that
wee cannot serue God at our owne ease, as though there were nothing
too let vs: as, a man may go too his woorke all day long, and it shall
go foreward quietly, bycause he is not distrubbled. But it is not so in
the obedience which the faythfull should yeeld too their God. And
why? The diuell ceasseth not too trubble them, and too woorke them
a thousand spytes and incomberances. Therefore if wee desyre too
walke in the feare of our God: wee must bee armed, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too anoy vs, so as wee feare not that he can doo vs any harme: wee
despyze him, and that is oftentymes a cause, that such as yee would
esteeme too bee the valeantest in the world doo come short home. And
why: Bycause they despyzed their enemye. But Saint Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, we haue to do with other maner of wyghts than mortall men:
and yit wee feare them not. If a man hate vs, although he bee not of
any great abilitie: Yit haue wee a flea in our eare (as they say) and
wee think it wisdome too preuent the things that our enemie can prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyze
ageinst vs. But specially if our enemyes be myghtie and strong,
and wee vnable too stand ageinst them, and too repulse them: then are


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:23289:343"/>
wee as much amazed as may be, &amp; yit they be but mortall men as wee
be. Howbeit S. Paul tels vs, we haue not to fyght ageinst mortal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but ageinst enemies that doo farre passe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And for that cause doth he
cal them powers and principalities, giuing them authoritie as though
they had the ouer hand of vs alredye. If wee were too fyght with an
enemye that were ouer our head, it would trubble vs curstly. Now
such are the diuells: they haue that aduauntage of vs: for they bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
euen Kings of this world: and besyds that, they haue a thousand
wyles and policies. And therfore it is sayd, that they not only assayle
vs with force, but also lay so many stales and ambushes too intrappe
vs, as wee could not scape them, if wee stoode not vppon our gard.
Heere it standeth vs on hand too bee throughly waked, though wee
were not only asleepe, but also as it were in a swound. Yit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
this warning dooth little boote vs: for wee see how cold wee
bee in buskling our selues to the battell. Saint Peter telleth vs the
lyke,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. b. 8.</note> though he vse not the same woords. For in saying that the diuel
is as a roring Lyon, going about and seeking some pray to deuoure,
so as he will swallowe vs vp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sheweth vs that it is not for vs too bee rechlesse and out of feare, but
rather too sticke well too our talking. Not that wee should bee afrayd
out of measure: for the intent of Saint Peter and Saint Paule in
setting foorth the diuells force, is not too discomfort vs and dismay vs,
that wee should conclude (with our selues:) how shall wee then doo?
wee bee quyte past hope of recouerie. No: but Saint Peter addeth,
withstande him beeing strong in fayth. And Saint Paule sayeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
vntoo vs: the diuell is strong and myghtie, but yit God surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
him: and if yee bee armed with his power, feare not but yee shall
farre ouercome Satan and all his assaultes, and in the ende get the
vpper hand of him. So then, the thing that wee haue too beare in
mynd, is that as oft as wee perceyue the lets that hinder our wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
where God calleth vs, and our holding out as were requisyte: we
must acknowledge our owne infirmitie, and condemne all the foolish
ouerweening of poperie, as their freewil, their works of preparation,
and all things which they imagin themselues too bring vntoo God.
Let all such stuffe vanish away. And when wee haue acknowledged
that wee can doo nothing at all of our selues: then let vs on the other
syde consider who is our enemie, and bee afrayd: not as men in a maze
too sinke in our owne wretchednesse: but that the same may the better


<pb facs="tcp:23289:344"/>
waken vs, and driue vs too seeke succour at Gods hand by prayer and
supplication, and too imbrace his promises with fayth, which shall get
the vpper hand of all the world. And therwithall let vs not doubt but
that God wyll alwayes haue the vpper hand of Satan and of all his
practizes. For he hath promised too vse an infinite power, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the cace concerneth the succoring of vs. Yee see then that wee
must walke in feare and warenesse. And why? Bycause wee bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeged
with many enemyes, and yit are destitute of all goodnesse, and
giuen too al euill. Then standeth it vs on hand to distrust our strength,
and too mourne, and too bee quickened vp with feare, bycause of our
enemyes, which might so deuoure vs at the first chop with one grayne

                  </hi> Shewed you this morning, why Saint
Paule speaketh heere of the force and
craftes of Satan, that is too wit, to wake
vs, that wee bee not taken vnwares, as
it happeneth oftentymes. Therefore it
standeth vs on hand too knowe, with what
manner of enemye wee haue too doo, that
the same may stirre vs vp too resist him.
Trew it is that at the first wee myght bee
abashed, by comparing our owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse


<pb facs="tcp:23289:345"/>
with the practyzes and preparations of Satan, wherof mention
is made heere. But the remedy thereof is set downe therewithall, as
I haue touched alredy, and as Saint Paule proceedeth too shewe yit
more at length. Therefore he sayeth first, that the incounter which
wee haue too deale in, is much more harde and daungerfull, than if
all the men in the world did set themselues ageinst vs. For the force
of Satan is aboue them all. And that is the cause why he sayeth, <hi>that
our fyghting is not ageinst flesh and blud.</hi> By these woordes he
dooth vs too vnderstand, that wee haue not too stand ageinst mortall
men onely. It is trewe that men shall oftentymes bid vs battell,
yea and they shalbee Satans vnderlings too torment vs. But that
is not the thing that we must sticke at. For the diuel serues his turne
by them too driue vs too despayre, or too prouoke vs too reuengment,
and too make vs grudge ageinst God. Howsoeuer the cace stand, the
wicked doo neuer trubble vs, but they bee egged too it by another,
that is too say, by Satan, who ruleth them, and is their head, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them a woorke, too the endes aforesayd. Therefore if wee sticke
vppon men, wee forget the principall, after the manner of Dogges,
who if a man doo cast a stone at them, fall too byting of the stone too
wreake themselues, and regard not the hand that threw it. Euen so
are wee vnpurueyed of wit, when wee thinke our stryuing is but only
with men, and in the meane whyle thinke not vppon our inuisible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye.
Wherfore let vs bethinke vs well of the thing that Saint
Paule telles vs heere, namely that Satan is the cheef enemye that
wee haue, yea and that it is he whom we must withstand: and although
he use diuerse meanes to vexe vs, and to turne vs away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the feare of
God: yit must wee alwayes haue our eye vppon him, that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of him.</p>
               <p>Agein, a man myght thinke it straunge, that Saint Paule should
say, that the diuelles are the principalities of the aire, the lordshippes
and powers of heauen, and the princes of the world: for a man would
deeme that he matcheth them ageinst God. Now although some
Heretikes in olde tyme haue abuzed this place, intending too haue
made as it were twoo beginnings, so as God should bee letted too
maynteyne himselfe ageinst Satan, and too defend those whom be
hath taken intoo his protection: yit notwithstanding if wee haue an
eye too Saint Paules intent, this question wil bee easly resolued.
And why? For heere is no talke of any power that the diuell should


<pb n="327" facs="tcp:23289:345"/>
haue as it were in despyte of God too aduaunce himselfe ageinst him:
for wee must rather stand fully resolued of this poynt, that the diuell
is the executer of Gods iudgmentes, and cannot attempt any thing
more then is graunted and permitted him.<note place="margin">Iob. 1. b. 6.</note> If there were no more
but this text of the first chapter of Iob, where the diuell appeered with
the Angelles (who are named there the children of God) to get leaue
too doo mischeef: it ought too satisfie vs throughly. Trew it is that
he seeketh nothing else but too peruert and confound all things. But
yit for all that, God holdeth him brydled, and executeth what he thinks
good by his meanes, insomuch that when the diuelles haue deuyzed
what they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yit can they not attempt any thing without Gods leaue,
yea and except he haue ordeyned it, and giuen them expresse charge to
doo this or that. Yit notwithstanding, it is not for nought that S.
Paule nameth them the powers and principalities of the aire: for all
this dependeth vppon the things that he will speake anon concerning
the darkenesse of the world. But, that the diuelles should haue supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie
ouer mankynd, which is shaped after the image of God, were
ageinst all reason: yea if wee had continued in our soundnesse. Had
wee hild out in the state wherein God created our father Adam, it is
certeyne that the diuell should not haue had any aduauntage ouer vs.
But forasmuch as wee bee now ouerwhelmed with darkenesse, and
become thralles of our owne nature: therefore the diuell is named the
Prince of the world. Wherfore let vs marke well that Saint Paule
hauing so aduaunced the power of the diuell, sheweth vs from whence
all of it proceedeth, and what is the welspring of it, too the intent
wee should not thinke that the diuell hath the reynes of the brydle looce
on his necke, so as hee should bee able too doo what he listeth, and
God vnable too let him. Too the intent then that wee should not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
that Gods souerein dominion is abated by any power of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelles:
Saint Paule sayth, that their power proceedeth of this, that
this world is in darkenesse. Trew it is that the Sunne shyneth vppon
vs, and the Moone also: but yit for all that, wee ceasse not too bee
plunged in the dungeon of death, and too bee blynd wretches, bycause
wee bee banished from the lyght of lyfe which is in God. Inasmuch
then as wee bee destitute of the knowledge of him that made and fashy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
all things, and haue our wittes intangled in all naugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inesse, and
our reason is vtterly peruerted: therefore dooth Satan reigne ouer vs.
And so the question is dissolued which myght haue bin demaunded,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:346"/>
namely how the diuelles are named the princes of the aire, and haue
such scope in this world which God hath created. That commeth
not of the originall order of nature, (as I haue declared alredye) but
of the corruption that is happened through the fall of man: Howsoeuer
the cace stand, the diuels haue such power ouer vs, as wee could not tel
how to withstand them, vnlesse God were both our sheeld and our wal,
and serued our turne at al assayes, yea and fought for vs at such tyme
as wee can doo nothing at all. I say, wee must mark well that, and
also beate downe the foolishe presumption which is so rooted in
our harts, as it is ryght hard for vs too weede it out. For wee see how
men doo alwayes vaunt themselues, and woulde make themselues
as Idols. But how speaks the scripture of them? It calleth them the
diuells slaues. So long then as wee haue not Iesus Christ for our
king, and his seate is vnset vp among vs by reason of Adams fall: the
diuell must needes bee our Prince, and haue all authoritie ouer vs,
and wee bee subiect vntoo him. Now let men make as greate braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
as they list, and chalendge this and that too themselues: and yit
notwithstanding, the thing that the holie Ghost hath spoken, must
continew soothfast. For vnrepealable is the definitiue sentence that
is giuen heere, that is too wit, that the diuel is our prince, and wee his
subiects, hild downe vnder his thraldome, vntill wee bee set free by our
Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. c. 36.</note> according too this saying in the eyght of Saint
Iohn, that it is he which maketh vs free, too the ende wee shoulde
depart out of the cursed tyrannie and bondage of Satan. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wee bee as wretched folk ouerthrowen, and the diuell is ouer our
heads, and hath gotten the vpper hand of vs alredye, if wee bee not
reskewed after a woonderfull maner: there is good cause why wee
should stoope, (as I declared alredye this morning) and distrust the
strength that wee surmyze our selues too haue of our owne, for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else than deceytfulnesse. Also there is wherwith too quicken vp
our carefulnesse, too make vs resort vntoo God, and too pray him that
he forsake vs not, ne suffer vs too bee giuen vp as a pray too our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And finally, too make euery man too streyne himself, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that although wee our selues doo nothing: yit dooth God woork in
such wyse by vs, as he wil not haue vs too bee as blocks, but he will
haue vs exercyze our fayth, and too bee as men of warre, too serue him
in battell, so as the stoppes that wee incounter, restreyne vs not from
keeping on our course still, but that wee outstand all the ambushes and


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:23289:346"/>
assaults that are put too vs. Thus yee see in effect how wee must put
this text in vre.</p>
               <p>And he concludeth agein, <hi>that wee must hold our owne too resist
the wicked dayes, vntill wee bee fast settled after the performance
of all.</hi> Heere he putteth vs in mynd agein, that it is not ynough for
vs too haue fought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>toutly for a mooneth or for a yeere, but that wee
must hold out too the end, yea euen all our lyfe long. For God hath
set vs in this world too maynteyne the battell vntill wee bee come too
the rest of heauen. The earth then is not only as a pilgrimage too the
faythfull, but also as a Camp where wee must alwayes haue enemies
too trubble vs nyght and day without ceassing. That is the cause
why Saint Paule sayeth expresly, that wee must resist till wee haue
finished and performed all things. And by <hi>the euill dayes,</hi> he meaneth
all our lyfe, but specially (the tymes) when our lord suffereth vs too be
pinched more than ordinarie. For although God trye vs too the end:
yit doth he forbeare vs now and then. For if he had not pitie of our
weaknesse, what would become of vs? It is trew that wee must no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
take truce with Satan: but yit dooth God sometymes giue vs res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
so as we bee not greeued with extremitie. The euill dayes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are, when there bee greate and in maner extreme temptations and
tryalls, howbeeit that all our whole lyfe is comprehended vnder the
same words. It is true that that impeacheth not our continuall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but that God taketh vs still for his people and heritage: but yit
shall there alwayes bee that euilnesse wherof Saint Paule speaketh
heere. Then let vs not make our account of an earthly paradyse heere
beneath, or too reape heere the frute of our victorie, or too liue in rest:
but rather let vs assure our selues, that miseries are prepared for vs
without ceassing or number. Wherfore let vs bee armed too abyde
them, and too ouercome them. And it is no pleading ageinst Gods
will in this behalf. It is verye trewe that he could handle vs much
gentlyer, and that hee could so set vs alone by our selues, as our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
should not come at vs, nor wee suffer any vexation: but it lyketh
him not too doo so. Therfore wee must bow downe our necks, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of vs buckle himself too the battell that God calleth vs vntoo.
For (as sayeth Saint Peter) it is good reason that our fayth which is
much preciouser than gold and siluer,<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. b. 7.</note> should bee tryed. Seeing that a
corruptible mettall is fyned by fyre: should our fayth which is much
more excellent, bee kept from comming too his purenesse and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?


<pb facs="tcp:23289:347"/>
Therfore let vs think wel vpon that which is sayd here, namely
that wee must finish things (or go through with them.) And that is to
the end that no man should cocker himself, when he hath hild his owne
for a whyle, and taken greate peyne in imploying him self too Gods
seruis, but that he should walk on still to the end, &amp; put the thing in vre
which S. Paul sheweth vs in another place,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. c. 13.</note> euen by his own example.
For although he had doone so notable things, as a man myght say,
that God should haue hild him quite, &amp; giuen him some rest for his ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
fyghting both by sea and by land dyuers wayes: yit notwithstanding
he sayeth, he forgetteth all that is past, and streyneth, and inforceth
him self still foreward, till he may atteyne too the fellowship of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of our Lord Iesus Christ. For what causeth a number too
take so greate libertie, but that they think themselues too haue doone
ynough, and may giue others leaue too take their turne? why not, say
they? It is now a twentie or thirtie yeeres that I haue taken extreme
peynes without ceassing, and the world hath seene my faythfulnesse,
zeale, and care which I haue had too serue God, and my diligence in
dooyng the things that my charge requyred. And theruppon they
conclude, that now therefore they may well take rest. Wee must not
so indent with God. But whatsoeuer wee haue done, wee must forget
that which is behynd, (sayeth Saint Paule) and looke foreward to the
thing that is yit too come, that is too wit, that wee bee not yit come to
the glory of our Lord Iesus Christ, but that there are many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in vs styll, and our fayth is not yit so throughly well fyned, but
that it had neede too be brought ageien too the furnace and the fyre.
And therfore let vs hold out tyll wee haue finished all things. And what
is ment by this <hi>All?</hi> that hauing lyued in the obedience of our God,
wee dye lykewyse when it pleaseth him, and according too his wyll.
For it is not ynough for vs too lyue in awe of him: but wee must also
euen in our death, yeeld record that wee bee wholly his, and wee must
not couet too lyue heere vntyll wee bee wery of our lyfe, but wee must
alwayes haue one foote lifted vp too depart when it pleaseth God. So
then, all is then finished, when wee haue lingered in this world as long
as pleaseth God, and euery man indeuered too lyue according too
his calling, and bin pacient too the end. Finally, bee it that wee

               <p>Hereuppon he sheweth with what maner of Armour wee must bee
fenced and furnished: that is too wit, <hi>vvith Fayth, vvith Ryghtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
vvith Truth, vvith Gods vvoord, and vvith the Gospell.</hi>
Now wee must not bee curious in seeking heere why Saint Paule
giueth the tytle of Helmet too one, the tytle of Brestplate too another,
and the tytle of Sheeld too another. For in the first Epistle too the
Thessalonians he toucheth the same doctrine briefely,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. b. 8.</note> howbeeit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
following the similitude throughout, saying, that wee must bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the helmet of fayth and charitie. But he speaketh otherwise
in this place. If any man would say, there is some contradiction, the
doubt would soone bee dissolued, namely that Saint Paules intent
heere, was not too decyfer particularly all the peeces of a Christen
mans armour, but too shewe briefely that if wee receyue the meanes
that God offereth vs, and bee diligent too serue him, wee shall bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of all peeces, and wee neede not feare but wee shall haue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
too withstand all our enemies, yea and too vanquish them. That
then was Saint Paules meaning.</p>
               <p>Now he setteth downe heere first of all, <hi>that wee must bee girt
vvith the Svvoord girdle of truth, and put on the headpeece of
Ryghtuousnesse.</hi> By those twoo woordes he meaneth soundnesse
and holynesse of lyfe. Therefore whensoeuer wee heare this woorde
<hi>Truth,</hi> let vs vnderstand, that Saint Paule condemneth all hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and will haue vs learne too giue our selues too the seruing of God
with a free hart, not with eye seruice, nor, as to the syght of the world,
but with a pure &amp; right meaning mind. And to know why this Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes,
or vprightnes, &amp; this soundnesse is put for a brestplate: it is not
now needefull too trubble our selues much, as I sayde afore. For the
poynt that wee must beare in mynd, is, how Saint Paul shemeth vs,
that if wee take the armour which God giueth vs, wee shall bee sure
without fayle too haue victorie ageinst all our enemyes. Ryghtuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is matched with it: which is a trew rule whereby too walke in
the feare of God, and too lyue with our neyghbours without dooyng
any harme, without fraud, without malice, and without extortion, and
rather too indeuer too doo one another good, according too the end too
which our Lord hath knit vs toogither, which is, that wee should so
communicate with our neyghbours, as no man bee wedded too hys


<pb facs="tcp:23289:348"/>
owne profit, but all of vs seeke the common welfare. And no maruell
now though the Diuell ouercome vs easly, and steale vppon vs al kynd
of wayes v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wares, both Euening and Morning and euery minute.
For where is this soundnesse that Saint Paule requyreth heere first
of all? Nay rather euery of vs flattereth himselfe, and wee thinke wee
haue doone much when wee haue vsed a fewe fayre countenances, and
not bin vtter rebels ageinst God, so as the world cannot vpbrayd vs
that wee haue bin despyzers of his maiestie. Then if wee play not the
starke bedlems, but pretend some fayre showe, &amp; make some gay coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of religion: too our owne seeming wee haue discharged our
dewtie very well, when notwithstanding the diuell in the meane while
hath turned vs quyte away from the soundnesse and substancialnesse,
whereof Saint Paule speaketh heere. In lyke cace is it with Rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse.
For wee would fayne content God with a little. In deede
wee will confesse well ynough with the mouth, that it is reason that
God should bee serued and honoured, and that wee should lyue quietly
toogither, and indeuer too doo one another good. Wee will condemne
Robberie, Extortion, Whoredome, Deceyt, and wrong Dealing: but
yit when all is doone, wee would haue God too accept in good woorth,
the little that he fyndeth in vs, and too hold him contented with it. But
by that meane, behold, the diuell fyndeth vs still vnprouyded. Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
then as wee open him such a gap, wee must not maruell that he
getteth the better hand of vs. And therefore it were much better for
vs too go through with our race, and too sticke too our tackeling that
wee stand fast. For a man shall see dyuerse that haue a good zeale, as
farre as can bee iudged: and yit it shall bee but a blast, it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
And why? Bycause wee bee not fenced ageinst Satan. And
for proofe hereof, if wee followe the thing that is shewed vs heere: it is
certeyne that the promis wyll neuer deceyue vs. For although Saint
Paule exhort the faythfull too stand fast, and too hold out too the ende:
yit is there a certein warrantyze included therin, that God wyll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
succour them at their neede, and that they shall not fynd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
disappoynted, so they fyght styll vnder his banner, calling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
vppon his power, and vsing the meanes that are offered them
by his word. Therfore if there bee such cowardlynesse in vs as too be
so afrayd of the diuell, that he makes vs too tumble downe, and to start
asyde, and too stray quyte out of the good way: wee must impute all
too our owne rechlesnesse, bycause wee haue not put on the armour that


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:23289:348"/>
God giueth vs, but haue hanged them vp vppon a pin.</p>
               <p>Afterward heere followeth, <hi>that vvee should bee shod vvith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
too the Gospel of peace.</hi> No dout but Saint Paule had
an eye to the auncient fashion of men of warre. For they wore no
shooes at home, but only when they went a warfare: and that was
bothe too defend them from the cold, and too saue their feete when they
entred intoo battell with the enemie. It is sayd, that the Gospell ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs for it. Howbeit there are twoo other woords too bee marked
also, in that he addeth, <hi>Preparation,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> Notwithstanding,
that wee may lay foorth things in their order, let vs note that Saint
Paule allotteth too the Gospell this power and propertie of shooing of
vs, bycause that when wee bee trayned in the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
as wee ought too bee, then wee may walk (safely) through the
world. For wee see how the vnbeleeuers are plundged euer head and
eares in it. Those whom God hath not prepared too walk and too at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
too the kingdome of heauen, are so snarled in this world, that
they bee altoogither vnprofitable, as though they had their legges
broken, and they sink themselues dayly deeper and deeper in it. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is but one only way too make vs wade through this world,
and too atteyne too the kingdome of heauen: which is, too haue such
instruction as is in the Gospell, namely that God hauing adopted vs
too bee his children, will not haue vs too dwell heere beneathe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
but that wee should come vntoo him, yea euen with all haste and
speede, and agein, that we intermeddle not our selues with the vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the vnbeleeuers, but separate our selues from them. Thus
much concerning the first poynt.</p>
               <p>There is also the woord <hi>Preparation,</hi> wherby Saint Paule dooeth
vs too vnderstand, that if wee haue the skill too aduauntage our selues
by the Gospell, wee shal bee rid of all thinges that let vs, and hinder
vs from comming vntoo God. What is it then that wee fynd there?
It is, that wheras erst wee were as it wee falen asleepe, or rather do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our pleasures and vanities: our Lord dispozeth vs too come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him. Wee haue seene already that all this world is in darknesse,
and that as long as wee abyde in it, wee bee as it were asleepe, so as
wee see no way before vs, and doo but reele and stumble, or rather lye
along in it as dead men,<note place="margin">Esay. 59. b. 10.</note> (as it is sayd in Esay): and if wee bee not
reskewed by our our Lord Iesus Christ, we must lye snorting in it still,

<pb facs="tcp:23289:349"/>
selues in such redinesse, as our loynes may bee girded vp (as sayeth
our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Luke. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 35.</note>) and our lampes bee burning in our hands,
that wee may see the way by the lyght that is giuen vs in our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who not without cause is named the lyght of the world.
Agein,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. b. 12.</note> let vs withdrawe our selues from this spirituall drunkennes,
which turneth the vnbeleeuers away from the kingdome of heauen,
and holdeth them downe heere beneath, vntill they bee come vntoo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
destruction. Therfore let vs mark wel that wee cannot profit well
by the Gospell, vntill wee bee put in redinesse, that is too say, vntill
(as neede is) we be weeded out from all these things here belowe, and
our Lord haue so dispozed vs too him self, as our only trauell may bee
too come alwayes forewarder and neerer vntoo him, vntill wee bee
gone out of this world, and bee also quyte rid and set looce from all the
bonds of Satan, and from all the meanes that he hath too hinder vs.
If wee knowe this once, wee shall haue profited well for one day.</p>
               <p>But Saint Paule addeth one other tytle too the Gospell, which
serueth too make vs the more in loue with it, saying, <hi>that it is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of peace.</hi> And therby he giueth vs corage to fyght, as if he should
say, my freends, it is trew that your enemies are myghtie, and will
giue you hard skirmishes, insomuch that yee should not bee able too
withstand them, but yee should bee ouerthrowen a hundred thousand
tymes in an houre, if God ayded you not. Neuerthelesse, if yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuze
not the succour that God giueth you, but rather make it effectuall
by inforcing your selues to withstand all euill: yee shall haue peace in
the middes of warre. And why? For the Gospell bringeth alwayes
that benefyte with it. Now it is much when wee can fyght without
being afrayd. For wee see in what taking they bee from tyme to time,
which are out of quiet: there is nother counsell nor aduyce in them,
they bee quyte out of hart, and too bee short, the trubble dooth alwayes
dismay them. But yit is it trew, that we must haue a care with vs, as
hath bin sayd afore. For if wee bee rechelesse, we shalbee ouerraught
by and by. Howbeeit, this Care is no let or impediment, but that we
may enter intoo the battell freely with a stedie and well settled mynd,
forasmuch as God is on our syde, and will vtter his myghtie power
(in our defence.) This is the thing that ought too make vs quiet, so
as no such feare attache vs, as may make vs too turne head, or disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
vs of aduyce, but that the more wee bee pinched, the more we may
flee vntoo God, praying him too succour vs, and too prouyde for all


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:23289:349"/>
our needs, which he knoweth much better than wee our selues doo.
Now then wee see what Saint Paules meaning is, when he wil haue
vs too bee shod with the Gospell. It is not too holde vs in this world,
but rather that wee should bee in a redinesse too trauell freely towards
the kingdome of heauen: and moreouer haue a quiet mynd too serue
God, trusting assuredly that notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all the trubbles which we
haue too indure, yit wee shal not perish. For he assureth vs not only
too succour vs in some one assault, but too continew with vs vntoo the
end, euen till he haue deliuered vs from al the greefs and trubbles
which wee susteyne at this day.</p>
               <p>There is further, <hi>that vvee must aboue all things take the Sheeld
or Buckler of fayth, and the spirituall Svvoord vvhich is Gods
vvoord.</hi> As touching this Sheeld, he setteth downe, that by meanes
thereof wee may beate backe the burning or fyrie dartes which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye
whoorleth at vs. It should seeme that Saint Paule vseth here
a needlesse speech, in putting Gods woord and fayth asunder, and that
he should not set downe twoo things which are but one. For fayth is
nothing of it selfe furtherfoorth than it is grounded vpon Gods woord:
and Gods woord also aduauntageth vs not, except wee receyue it by
fayth. But his distinguishing of these twoo things, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
go ioyntly toogither, was for the easyer declaring of them.
And he setteth fayth for the buckler, too the end (sayeth he) that wee
should therewith ward all the dartes of our enemye. Yit agein he
sheweth vs, that of our owne power wee bee not able too warde the
blowes that Satan can giue vs, but that they would be deadly. For he
thinkes it not ynough too say (simply,) too ward the blowes or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saultes:
but he sayth, the dartes. Now men see that one shall sooner
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee hit vnwares with dartes, than with speares or swoordes: lyke as
now adayes a man shall sooner bee hit with a Hargabusse, or with a
dubble Canon, than with a swoord that is swindged before ones face,
and which he may more easly shun. Saint Paule therefore setteth
downe the diuelles dartes, lyke as he had erst set downe his wyles.
Now then let vs marke, that Satan not onely vseth force, but also
myght wound vs too death by suttle meanes, if wee were not fenced
by fayth. For (as is sayd elsewhere) it behoueth vs too knowe his
whyles:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> c. 11.</note> and without wee doo so, wee can neuer withstand him. He
is the father of lying, and besydes that, hath such store of wyles, as
none can haue more, too beguyle vs and too intrappe vs. Therefore


<pb facs="tcp:23289:350"/>
let vs receyue these warnings, that wee may bee the more waking
too apply the promises too our behoof which are giuen vs in Gods
woord. And he setteth downe <hi>Fyrie Dartes,</hi> too shewe that his
woundes should be deadly (As I sayd afore) if God did not set his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
afore vs, and defend vs and preserue vs therby. Now wee see what
the force of fayth is.</p>
               <p>Now looke how much is attributed too fayth, so much is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from men. For fayth borroweth all things of Gods mere grace
and liberalitie. Therfore let vs marke that in this text Saint Paule
ment too humble vs, and too shewe vs that God must bee fayne too
prouyde vs of all things belonging and requysyte too our victorye.
And therefore whosoeuer make themselues sheeldes of any of all the
(other bulwarkes that can be deuyzed, too repulse Satan withall:
they shall haue but a spyders web (as they say) and Satan will but
sport him at their presumption, insomuch that when they weene they
haue all the mountaynes of the world too fortifye them, it shall profit
them nothing at all at their neede. Wherfore let vs learne too make
fayth our bucklar: that is too say, when wee mynd too enter intoo the
battell, and too hold out in it: let vs consider, that God is our father,
bycause he hath elected and chozen vs for his children, of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
goodnesse. Seeing he hath assured vs that he will alwayes be
on our syde, and that he is greater than all the world, and that he hath
put vs in good and safe keeping by ordeyning our Lord Iesus Christ
too bee our Shepherd: let vs gather all those promises toogither, and
make a sheeld of them too set before vs whensoeuer wee bee assayled,
and let vs defye the diuell, bycause wee bee in the protection of our
God, who is of inuincible power, and bycause our Lord Iesus Christ
hath taken vppon him the charge of our saluation,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and promised too
bee a faythfull keeper of our soules too the end. When wee bee once
at that poynt, then shall wee beat backe the dartes of the diuell. For
on the one syde he wyll labour too make vs distrust Gods grace: and
on the other syde he will make vs beleeue that our Lord Iesus Christ
is farre of from vs: yea and he will tempt vs too murmur and grudge
ageinst him, or too make vs cast foorth tryflyng and vnprofitable
questions, or else blasphemyes, and such other things: and all these
are dartes. Agein, when wee bee tickled with any wicked lust or
longing in our hartes, it is the next way for vs too bee taken tardye.
Trew it is that at the first blush these allurementes will seeme nother

wee bee afrayd least the earth should fayle vs: God hath taken
vppon him the charge too nurrish and susteyne vs. And so, let vs rest
vppon him, and aske our dayly bread at his hand. If the diuell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

incorporated vs intoo himselfe, and made vs his owne members too

vs by his blud: and shall wee go wallowe agein in our vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Are wee prouoked too gluttony? and, why not? Hath
not God created vittelles too our vse? (Yis:) but shall wee defyle
and ouerthrowe the order that God hath set, which is, that wee should
bee susteyned by them, thereby too bee directed too the heauenly lyfe?
And shall wee turne the things too our hinderance, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And agein, if any man appoze thee, (saying,) how canst thou tell
whether thou shalt bee euer the better or no for all thy trauell? Where
is the thing that the Gospell promiseth? Fayth must woorke in this

store of trubbles, incounters, and sorrowes. Too bee short, wee seeme
too bee the miserablest creatures in the world. And what shall wee
doo then? Wee should needes quayle euery minute of an houre, if God
reached vs not his hand. And how take wee holde of his hand? that
is too say,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Satans dartes.</p>
               <p>Now finally he addeth the woord, which (as I sayd afore) ought not
too bee separated from fayth. But I haue told you already, that S.
Paule ment too adde that saying, for a further declaration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.


<pb facs="tcp:23289:351"/>
As if he had sayde, My freendes, wheras I tolde you that you

then as yee haue the promyses of saluation, and God speaketh
too you, so as you knowe that he hath you in his keeping, and that you
cannot bee confounded, if you trust in him: therfore did I set fayth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you as a bucklar. Howbeeit, if you haue fayth, yee haue mo buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
than one. For Gods woord is the trew spirituall swoord, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee may not onely beate backe our enemye, but also discomfit him,
and beate him downe vnder our feete. What remayneth now, but to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

learne too profit our selues better by Gods woord, than we haue doone
hithertoo? Seeyng then that our Lord Iesus Christ graunteth vs
this inestimable grace and benefyte of teaching vs in his schoole: let
vs consider therwithall too what end he dooeth it: that is too wit, too
arme vs ageinst Satan, bycause wee cannot lyue in his obedience, and
keepe the way that he sheweth vs, but by fyghting: and he also dooth
giue vs armour. So then, let vs assure our selues that wee haue a
good swoord, when wee can skill too apply Gods woord too our vse:
and moreouer, that fayth (which proceedeth thereof) will bee a good
sheeld for vs.</p>
               <p>Also wee shall haue the Helmet of the hope of saluation: and too
bee short, wee shall bee throughly fenced and furnished on all sydes.
For thereof commeth the soundnesse of conscience and holynesse of life,
which he hath spoken of. Finally wee shall want nothing, if wee can
skill too vse well the meanes that God setteth foorth for our welfare.
So then, albeeit that the state of the faythfull seeme too bee as irksome
as may bee, bycause God exercyzeth them ageinst all the Diuels in
hell, and that not for one day onely, but for all the tyme of their lyfe:
yit must wee thinke it ryght sweete and amiable, seeyng God prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for all our needes, at leastwise so wee awake, and consider the
daungers wherein wee bee, sauyng that wee resist them. Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
(I say,) on the one syde Satans violence and force: and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
syde his craftes and suttleties. And therwithall let vs call vppon
our God, (as Saint Paule will shewe vs agein hereafter,) and also
consider the commoditie that Gods woord bringeth vs. And hereby
wee see how the wretched Papistes haue stripped themselues starke
naked out of all the armour that should serue them for their saluation.
For what is the woord of God among them? A noze of waxe. They


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:23289:351"/>
haue not bin ashamed too belke out that blasphemie, both in all theyr
bookes and also in all their Sermons: namely, that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie
in Gods woorde. Yea, but wee did wrong too call it the
spirituall swoord, if it armed vs not ageinst all the assaultes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
Therefore wee could not repulse the temptations wherwith wee
bee prouoked too euyll, vnlesse Gods woord serued vs thertoo. And
if wee found it not so by experience, surely Saint Paule would neuer
haue giuen it that name. Now then, let vs indeuer too profit more and
more by it, and let vs bee good schollers, and giue good eare too it
whyle God hath his mouth open too teache vs: and wee shall fynde
that Saint Paule hath not in vayne promysed vs heere, that wee shall
euer get the vpper hand, euen tyll wee bee come too the heauenly
Kingdome, where wee shall fully inioy the fruite of our victorie.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too make vs feele them

truly that his promises haue taken effect in vs, and that wee trust too
them,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. c. 15.</note> is, that as soone as wee bee touched with any greef or affliction,
wee go streyt vntoo him,<note place="margin">Psal. 62. b. 9.</note> and vnburthen our hartes there, as is sayd
in another place. Now wee see how wee must make our aduauntage
of Gods woord, whereby wee bee certyfied that he wil neuer fayle vs:
that is too wit, by seeking the things in him which he protesteth that
wee shall fynd there. And so, prayers are as it were keyes whereby
too come too the treasures that God reserueth for vs, and which he
will not keepe from vs. Therefore wee must open the way too them
by praying.</p>
               <p>And yit Saint Paule thinketh it not ynough too say, that our fayth
must bee matched with prayers and supplications too our God: but
he sayeth also, <hi>Yea all prayer.</hi> As if he should say, that in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in al things both great and smal, in al our dooings, whatsoeuer
they bee: that must bee our shooteanker. For it myght happen that
wee would call vppon God, onely when wee thought on him, or else
when we had some matter of importance in hand. But Saint Paule
(as I sayd) will haue vs too doo God that homage euery where and
at all tymes, protesting that wee cannot haue any good but at his
hand, and of his mere free gift. So much importeth the woorde <hi>All.</hi>
And in good sooth wee see how our Lord taketh charge of our whole
lyfe, with condicion that wee should seeke too him euen for the bacest
things, and for such as wee durst not requyre of our freend that were
our equall and companion. Euen those things will he haue vs to ask
of him. For vnder this saying, <hi>that he giueth vs our dayly bread,</hi> it
is certeyne that he comprehendeth all that belongeth too our lyfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
what a number of small things haue wee neede of, which wee
would bee ashamed too bee acknowen of, euen too our inferiours?
And God abaceth himselfe so farre, that he voutsafeth too haue a care
of our persons, which are but wretched and rotten carions, and yit
neuerthelesse he will not haue vs too stick too aske him the thinges
that are expedient and needefull for vs. Sith it is so, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
well this saying of Saint Paules, which willeth vs too
pray too our God for al things that wee deede, assuring our selues that
he wil yeeld so farre vntoo vs, as nothing shal (as yee would say) scape
his handes.</p>
               <p>And he sayeth expresly, <hi>that vvee must pray at all tymes, and
in Spirit.</hi> Whereas he sayth, in Spirit: it is surely too exclude all


<pb facs="tcp:23289:353"/>
Hipocrisye: for we knowe that the most part of the world babble y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
when they should come vntoo God: howbeeit, it is but their
lippes or the tippes of their tungs that doo their dewtie. But that is
not the manner that God will bee prayd vntoo and called vppon: he
lyketh not of such supplications, but rather abhorreth them, bycause
that when wee pray so fondly vntoo him, wee make a false shrowding
sheete of him, and that is a kynd of trecherie. For if wee thinke too
be heard of God for our babling, when in the meane whyle our hart
is dead, and our prayers proceede not of a ryght dispozed and earnest
mynd, wee make God as an Idoll, or as a little babe, wherein wee doo
too great wrong to his maiestie, and to be short, we do but transfigure
him after our owne fancie. Therfore it behoueth our prayers, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be made with our mouth, but also too come from the bottom of our
hart.</p>
               <p>And now forasmuch as we haue not that of our owne power: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost must be fayne to worke therin. And therfore by the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
may be vnderstood, that we should beseech God to gouern vs in such
wyse, as he touch vs throughly, to the end we may pray to him as we
ought too doo, and he also accept our prayers, acknowleding in them
the marks of his holie spirit. For wee must alwayes remember how
it is sayd in the Epistle too the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 26.</note> that wee know not what too
pray: for as in respect of our selues, it is a thing that surmounteth all
our vnderstanding, and the ablest of vs all fayleth in that behalfe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that there are a number which beare themselues on hand
that they knowe perfectly howe and what too pray vntoo God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeit
all such opinion dooth but shet vs out of the gate, vnlesse that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the knowing of our defaults and infirmities, wee resort ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
too the remedie,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 26.</note> according too this saying of Saint Paules,
that the spirit of God driueth vs to vnutterable gronings which cannot
bee expressed, without the which wee could not vtter so much as this
woord <hi>Father:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gala. 4. a. 6.</note> according also as he sayeth too the Galathians, that
when the spirit cryeth in vs, wee can open our mouthes too call freely
vppon God,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15.</note> as is reherced in another place. Now then, it is certein
that wee shall neuer bee throughly dispozed too pray vntoo God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he gouerne vs by his holie spirit.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Saint Paules intent (as I haue declared alredie) is too
exclude all counterfetting, and that wee should not hope too iustify
our cace before God by ceremonies, or by popeholines (as they terme


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:23289:353"/>
it) in making of long prayers and many circumstances, but suffer the
spirit too beare sway. Wherfore first of all let vs bee so touched, as
the spirit may bee our mayster and teacher, and indyte the things too
vs which wee haue too vtter in calling vppon our God: and secondly
let our prayers proceede from the bottom of our hart, &amp; let vs put this
saying of the Psalme in vre,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. d. 18.</note> that wee must sue vnto our God in truth:
for it is sayd that he is not neere too any, but too such as haue that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
And not without cause is such exposition set downe: for (as I
haue declared alredie) wee bee so much inclyned too shifting, that (too
our seeming) God ought too yeeld too vs and too our nature: but it is
cleane contrarie. Now then forasmuch as God perceyueth that men
abuse his name after that fashyon, and make prayers after their owne
maner, that is too say, prayers that are wrapped in hipocrisie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe,
and haue no substancialnesse nor soundnesse in them: he sayeth
expresly, that we must not hope too bee heard at his hand, nor too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
any thing of him, except our prayers bee ruled by a ryght mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that is too say, vnlesse wee pray with a hartie affection. Thus
yee see what wee haue to remember vpon that saying of Saint Paule.
And that wheras he sayth, Stedfastly, and with holding out through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
too the ende: it is too expresse the better, that it is neuer out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
too call vppon God. And euen therefore is this added, bycause
wee would fayne exempt our selues from our God. Wherein a man
may well perceyue howe vnperfect our myndes are, and howe desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of wit and reason wee be. For all our welfare consisteth in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
accesse too our God, that wee seeke help at his hand, and too bee
short, in being neere vntoo him, so as wee bee sure that he regardeth
vs, and hath a care of our welfare. And besyds that, who is he that
would not fayne bee heard? Yit notwithstanding, when wee should
pray vntoo God, it seemeth that wee bee haled to it as it were by force,
and wee should bee rauished in loue with it, as I haue shewed alredy.
Now then, this vyce of rechlesnesse and coldnesse in that wee neuer
pray vnto God, but when we be compelled or constreyned, had neede to
be corrected. Saint Paule therefore telleth vs, that wee must not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
till vtter necessitie inforce vs, but we must vnderstand, that al times
are seasonable and conuenient too resort vntoo God. Iu deede after as
wee bee picked foreward, so must wee runne the swiftlyer, according
as it is certeyne that wee bee as it were spurted by the afflictions and
manifold trubbles that God sendeth vs. And lyke as if an Asse


<pb facs="tcp:23289:354"/>
wil not go, he must haue a good cudgell layd vppon his backe: euen so
God perceyuig that wee come not too him with a good will, is fayne
too drawe vs too him as it were by violence. But yit must euery man
cheere vp him self, though no vrgent necessitie compell him. Too bee
short, we must pray vntoo our God bothe in tyme of prosperitie, and in
tyme of aduersitie. That is the thing which is ment by these woords,
<hi>at all tymes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theruppon S. Paule sayeth, <hi>that wee must bee watchfull in
it, euen with all instance, too pray for all the Saints.</hi> In saying
that wee must bee watchfull, hee toucheth a vyce whertoo wee bee
too much inclyned, yea and wholly giuen ouer: that is too say, that
wee bee sleepie when wee should pray vntoo God, and had neede too
bee waked. Bycause of our heauinesse and sluggishnesse, wee bee
commaunded too wake and to keepe as it were a continuall wacth, to
the end wee should not let occasions slip, but alwayes resort vntoo
God with prayer. Now there is not so perfect a man, which fyndeth
not this maladie by experience in him self: namely that when wee
should pray vnto God, a number of things crosse vs, that set vs wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
abrode: insomuch as wee shall woonder, that in sted of holding
out earnestly, our mynd shalbee rouing here and there. Seeing then
that wee bee so fickle, and our wits so skittish, and is hard too hold vs
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast any whyle: it standeth vs on hand to be the more watchfull, to the
intent to bring our selues back agein intoo the good way, when we be
started out of it. And let vs not tarie till the diuell haue woone so much
at our handes, as to plucke vs quyte from our prayers and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and to breake of the continuall course of them, and of the sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes
that ought too bee in them: but when wee pray, let vs be as it
were locked vp and fast tyed too it, that is too say, let all our wittes
bee full bent and settled vppon the thing that wee haue too doo. For
euen the heathen men, when they were about too make sacrifyze too
their Idolls, vsed this proueth among them: whyle thou woorshippest
God, doo nothing else, but bee thou so wholly occupyed and fastened
theruntoo, as thou think vpon no other thing. If God wrested such a
confession from them, what ought wee to doo when wee offer him the
cheef sacrifyze which he alloweth aboue all other, that is, when wee
confesse our selues beholden too him for all good things? Should wee
mingle our owne vanities with it, and make our prayer too bee but for
custome and fashyons sake? Now then this watchfulnesse wherof


<pb n="336" facs="tcp:23289:354"/>
Saint Paul speaketh, is verie requisyte, by reason of the fraylnesse of
our wits, and specially bycause wee bee so wandering as is horrible.
Seeing it is so with vs: when wee goo about too pray vntoo God, let
vs bend our whole mynds vnto it, and let not our wittes bee intangled
about other cares and affections, but let our comming vntoo it bee as
though wee had broken all other bondes. That is the cause why men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made of lifting vp of our selues in our prayers and supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Trew it is that in offering our selues vnto God, wee must come
with all lowlinesse: but yit must wee lift vp our hartes in such wyse,
as wee may bee after a sort in the prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce of our God. That (say I)
is the thing that is imported by the sayd diligentnesse.</p>
               <p>And he sayeth further, <hi>with all instance:</hi> which serueth still too
shewe vs, that if wee intend too bee wel disposed too praying, wee
must not go too it lazily, yea and that if wee followe that which our
owne nature sheweth vs, wee shal bee farre of from comming at God.
Therefore must euery man inforce him. For seeyng Saint Paule
speaketh so, it is as much as if he sayd, My freendes, yee shall fynde
such a coldnesse in your selues, as yee shall neuer pray vntoo God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall yee euer bee willing too pray, except ye prouoke and inforce
your selues. For the Diuell will alwayes bleare your eyes, too the
end yee should not see what neede yee haue too pray vntoo God. And
if yee lye sleeping still, it will cause your God too forsake you, seeyng
you bee so thanklesse as too despyze his benefites, and too yeeld him
no honour for them, no nor too acknowledge that all your welfare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
of him. For lyke leaud lozels, wee defyle the benefytes which
God bestoweth vppon vs, vnlesse wee acknowledge that wee haue all
things at his hand, yea euen by crauing all thinges that wee want, of
him, and also by yeelding him thankes for the things that wee recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
already. So then, let vs learne too match our watchfulnesse with
all instantnesse.</p>
               <p>And herein wee comprehend holding out or continuance: so as it
is not ynough for vs too pray vntoo God by startes and braydes (as
they say:) but wee must continue in it, and that twoo wayes. For first
when wee haue prayed too day both euening and morning, and euery
houre: wee must holde on still, and neuer swarue from that trade, so
long as wee lyue. For our fayth (as I sayd) must exercyze it self: and
the meane too exercyze it withall is this, There is yit one other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of perseuerance or holding out: which is, that when wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred


<pb facs="tcp:23289:355"/>
God too helpe vs in this or that, wee must repete the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
not twyce or thryce onely,<note place="margin">Esay. 65. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 23.</note> but as oft as wee haue neede, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
yea a thousand tymes. As for example, Although God haue told
vs that he will succour vs before wee open our mouth too him: yit doth
he not shewe it (alwayes) openly too the eye. Therefore wee must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bee weery in wayting for Gods helpe. Also it is not good that
wee should bee heard after our owne lyking, bycause God knoweth
what is meete and expedient for vs. So then, he must gouerne vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
too his owne will. But (as I sayd) if wee pray too him after
his fashion and after his maner: he protesteth that wee shall obteyne
all our requestes at his hand, euen before wee haue vttered them with
our mouth. Yit notwithstanding he will sometymes hold vs as it were
at the staues end, in so much as it shall seeme that he is asleepe when
wee call vppon him, and that he hath turned his backe vppon vs. For
this cause is perseuerance requisite, so that if wee bee pinched with
any distresse, and would fayne seeke ease of it at Gods hand: we must
not doo it once and away, but wee must returne too it (oftentymes,)
and bee (as yee would say) importunate,<note place="margin">Luke. 18. a. 1.</note> according too the similitude
which our Lord Iesus telleth vs of the widdowe, which had too doo
with a Iudge that was without any feare of God, or shame of the
world, and yit neuerthelesse shee obteyned hir sute euen by importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenesse.
So must wee doo: that is too say, wee must bee importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
vppon our God: not that he is slowe in succouring vs (as I sayd
afore:) but bycause he will trye the constancie of our fayth. For they
that pray vnto God and fall to stomacking, chafing, and impaciencie,
if he releeue them not out of hand: doo not pray vntoo him, but (as yee
would say) summon him too bee at commaundement of their lustes.
But it behoueth vs too restreyne all our passions and desyres too
Gods good will, so as when wee pray him too make speede, wee may
neuerthelesse bee pacient, and bee contented too tary his leazure, in
delaying too day or too morrowe, or as long as it pleaseth him. Yee
see then that wee must continue in prayer and supplication, so as wee
must pray presently for the necessities that pinch vs too day, and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
too morrow, for those that may come then: and so wee must pray
ordinarily euery day. And besydes this, if God list not too deliuer vs
so soone as wee fayne would: let vs not ceasse to renew our petitions
still, euen vntill wee perceiue that wee haue profited by our praying,
and that he haue shewed vs the effect of his promis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:23289:355"/>
Now forasmuch as it is hard for vs too bee brought too pray well
vntoo God: Saint Paule heere setteth vs foorth the thing out of our
owne persons, which ought too perswade vs: that is too say, that
wee bee bound too pray vntoo God, not onely for our selues, that is
too say, euery man for himselfe: but also too haue a care of our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to respect them also. It is trew that if wee considered our
owne miseries well, and the great number of sinnes that are in vs, and
the great neede which we haue to be succored at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: we should
haue cause ynough without going out of our selues, too imploy our
selues in prayer and supplication, yea though wee did nothing else al
our lyfe long but sygh and lament before God for our offences, and
pray him to reach vs his hand, too the end that Satan might not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vs. As I sayd, wee should haue matter ynough in our selues.
But now that wee must extend our prayers further, that is too wit, too
the whole Church of God, and vnderstand that he will not haue mee
too thinke alonly vppon my selfe, but also too bee myndfull of all his
chozen, inasmuch as he hath knit mee too them, so as I must indeuer
too comprehend them in my prayers as much as is possible for mee:
seeing (say I) that wee bee resolued herof: it must needs bee that we be
too blockish, if we be not touched yit more to the quicke, and set on fyre
with this carefulnesse that is spoken of here, and therwithal continue
in the same.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit Saint Paule speaketh heere expresly of the Saintes or
faythfull, but yit is that no impediment that wee should not pray ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
for all men. For the wretched vnbeleeuers and the ignorant
sort haue greate neede too bee sewed for vntoo God: for behold, they
bee in the hygh way too destruction. If wee sawe a beast at the poynt
to perish, we would haue pitie of it: and what shal we do when we see
a soule in perill, which is so precious before God as he hath shewed,
in that he hath raunsomed them with the blud of his owne sonne?
Then if wee see a poore soule go so too destruction, ought wee not too
bee moued with compassion and kyndnesse, too desyre God too reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
it? So then Saint Paules meaning in this text, is not that wee
should let the wretched vnbeleeuers alone without care of them: but
that wee should pray generally for all men: howbeeit he sheweth vs
therewithall, that wee must haue a speciall care of those whom God
hath knit vntoo vs by a streyter bond. Lykewyse when he speaketh

without exception which haue neede: but yit he addeth, that wee must
specially succour them that are of the houshold of fayth. Euen so is it
with our prayers and supplications. For the spirituall brotherhood
which God hath set among vs, ought too touch vs the more, and too
make the Church of God too come before our eyes, and intoo our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
as oft as wee pray. And these words, <hi>Our Father,</hi> ought
too teache vs too make our prayers common. For none of vs can say
<hi>My father,</hi> alone of himselfe, but wee call him <hi>Ours,</hi> too shewe that
wee ought not to haue such care of our selues, as to forget them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto vs, and are linked to vs with so neere a knot, as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
already. That then is the cause why S. Paule sayeth expresly, that
wee must pray for the Saintes.</p>
               <p>Now were this well printed in our hartes (as I sayd afore) wee
should bee well waked too pray too our God without end or ceassing.
For let vs consider the state and plyght of the Church in these dayes.
Although our Lord giue vs some rest: yit are our poore brethren tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by tyrantes, and by the enemyes of the fayth. Some are fayne
too flee, some haue their goods taken from them, many bee thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
prizon, and other some are burnt at the stake. All these poore
soules are in vnquietnesse, and put too some new terrour euery mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of an houre. Wee see that there is as tirrible manacing and
threatening as may bee. Wee see how the diuell dryueth all those
foreward with outrageous fury, which would abolish the doctrine of
the Gospell. Wee see what scatterings are made by the stumbling
blockes that Satan thrusteth in by his champions. Wee see how a
great sort seeke nothing else but too put the Gospell too all shame.
And in the meane whyle, the poore seruantes of God which imploy
themselues in his seruice, are trubbled and vexed by all meanes.
Then if we gather toogither all the miseries and aduersities wheretoo
the Church is subiect, and consider well the distresse of euery of our
brethren: must it not needes bee that wee are duller than brut beasts,
if wee bee not moued too pray vntoo God, yea euen with a ryght per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance
in the same? For though I bee at myne ease too day, there
are many thousands in great perplexitie: and I shewe wel that I cut
of my selfe (as much as I can) from the bodye of our Lorde Iesus
Christ, if I pitye not the members too whom I am linked. Not
without cause therefore dooth Saint Paule set all the Saintes heere
afore vs, when be intendeth too inflame vs the better too a ryght


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:23289:356"/>
dispozed mynde in praying, and too continewe throughout in the
same.</p>
               <p>And therupon he requyreth also that men should pray for him. <hi>Yee
shall pray for mee also,</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>that God giue mee boldnesse
in opening my mouth, so as I may vtter the secret of the Gospell
accordingly.</hi> When Saint Paule commendeth him self too the
prayers of his neyghbours, therby he sheweth well in what humilitie
wee ought too walk. For he did not counterfet in exhorting the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
too such praying. He protesteth before God and his Angels, that
he had neede of it. But now let vs compare our selues with Saint
Paule. What man is of such abilttie, that he can forbeare too bee suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored
by the prayers of his neyghbours, when Saint Paule exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not him self from it? Now then, let euery man in his praying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God, desyre too bee made parttaker of all the prayers that are
made throughout the Churche,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. d. 18.</note> both generally and particularly. In
deede this promis shall alwayes stand trew, that God wil bee neere at
hand too all such as call vppon him. And Ionas fayled not too bee
succored of God,<note place="margin">Ionas. 2. a. 2.</note> though he were in the whales belly. Now therfore,
when we bee forsaken of men, when we be as good as dead, and the
remembrance of vs is as good as buryed: yit wil not God ceasse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
vs, and too cast his eye vppon vs too succour vs, according too
this saying, that the eyes of God are alwayes vppon them that feare
him,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. d. 18.</note> and his eares open too such as repayre vnto him. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
too the intent too humble vs the better,<note place="margin">Psal. 34. c. 16.</note> our Lord telleth vs, that
wee haue neede one of anothers help, and that there should bee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercommoning
among vs. And besyds this, there is also another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which is, that he will keepe our charitie occupyed. Wherfore,
let vs learne too shewe both by our almesdeeds, and by our counsell, and
by all other helpes, that none of vs is giuen too him self, nor too his, too
owne priuate profit: but that after as God hath linked vs toogither,
euery of vs coueteth too succour our members, and too communicate
toogither in our prayers &amp; supplications. For our commending one of
vs of another after that maner vntoo God, is the cheef dewtie of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
And therfore it caused Saint Paule too desyre the Ephesians
expresly too pray for him.</p>
               <p>Now if any man alledge that that was a signe of vnbeleef, for if
this promis suffyze vs not, that euery man shall obteyne his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
is it not a poynt of distrust? the answer thertoo is easy. For


<pb facs="tcp:23289:357"/>
wheras God sayeth, that he will haue pitie vppon all such as seeke it at
his hand: he meaneth not too disanull the thing that he commaundeth
vs in so many other texts: which is, that wee should bee myndfull one
of another. Furthermore let vs mark, that in following Gods woord
wee can neuer bee blamed of misbeleef. For how comes it too passe
that men fall to misbeleefe, but by passing their bounds, that they wil
needs adde too that which God hath vttered? As for example: Wee
see that in the popedome men haue forged so many patrones and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocats,
as they wote not which too beetake themselues vntoo. And
whence procedeth that? Euen of that their heads bee ticklish: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gein,
that they distrusted the things that are conteyned in Gods word.
Wee haue this generall lesson,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. c. 15.</note> Call vppon me in the day of thy neede,
and I will heare thee. God then will haue vs too resort vntoo him,
and too looke only at him, assuring our selues that he will neuer refuze
vs, when we pray vnto him in his sonnes name. And our Lord Iesus
Christ commeth afore vs, and offereth himself too vs, saying, that hee
will beare woord too and fro for vs, and that as long as we hold vs in
that path, wee neede not feare that wee shall not fynd accesse vntoo his
father, or that he wil not receyue vs familiarly. So dooth the holie
scripture report. But what haue the papists doone? O, (say they)
wee haue neede of aduocats too make intercession for vs. It is trew:
but our Lord Iesus Christ who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God his father hath assigned vnto vs,
ought to suffyze vs, forasmuch as he only is appoynted to that office.
Contrariwyse the papists make Aduocats in paradyse at their owne
pleasure,<note place="margin">Psal. 110. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dignitie which is giuen him of God his father, yea euen with a sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
othe. The papists are not contented with that, but haue made such
a patching to it, that their cace is become a horrible confuzion. As for
vs, if wee followe that which is taught vs by Gods woord, then shall
wee walk in fayth, and wee neede not feare any straying, or that wee
shall bee blamed of vnbeleef: for God wil alwayes guyde vs aryght.
That then is the answere to this question and doubt which myght bee
cast, whether it bee not a poynt of distrust too desyre other men too
pray for vs, seeing that euery man may be heard him self, bycause that
what things God hath ioyned toogither, men must not presume too
put them asunder. For wee must alwayes beare in mynd howe it is
sayd, that euery man must occupie himselfe in praying, and moreouer
drawe his neyghbours too bee matched with him: and so shall wee


<pb n="339" facs="tcp:23289:357"/>
neuer bee turned from the fayth.</p>
               <p>Now if any man obiect further, that our Lord Iesus Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee the onely aduocate and patrone, if wee make supplication one
for another: the answer theruntoo is easie. For it is sayd, that Iesus
Christ is the onely mediator, and that all men both great and small
must resort too him too obteyne our sutes.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2. a. 1.</note> For vnlesse our prayers bee
dedicated by his holinesse, surely they shall euer bee foule and infected.
When Esay was commaunded too beare the message that God had
appoynted,<note place="margin">Esay. 6. b. 5.</note> he sayd, Alas my God, I am a man of vncleane lippes,
and dwell among a people that is vncleane also. How shall I doo then
when I must call vppon my God, and speake familiarly too him as it
were mouth too mouth, seeing wee bee full of vncleannesse and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Now then, all our prayers must be sanctifyed by our Lord Iesus
Christ, or else wee shall neuer fynd fauour at Gods hand. Also it is
most certeyne that Christ is the only aduocate and Intercessour, and
that all the auncient Patriarks were fayne too hold that rule, and lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
the Prophets and Apostles in their tymes, and so must wee also
continew in the same. And yit for all that, wee bee not letted therby
too pray one for another, inasmuch as wee haue albut one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon head,
which is our Lord Iesus Christ, in whom all our prayers must bee
ioyned toogither, too the intent wee may all with one accord, and with
one wel tuned melody protest, that wee haue none other welfare, than
that it pleaseth God too haue care of vs, insomuch that that is our full
felicitie, and vppon that trust wee come ryght foorth vntoo him. The
meane then for vs too continew euermore in the ryght way, and too see
that our Lord Iesus Christ bee not defaced, is too take him for our on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aduocate, and not too turne asyde one way nor other after our
owne fond fancies, as is come to passe in the popedome. And wee see
that the papists haue not bin ashamed too alledge this text, too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
vs too pray too Saint Peter and Saint Paule, yea too Saints
of the Popes owne forging, or rather to the Idols whom the diuell
hath blowen intoo his eare. But heere wee haue too consider that
wee bee commaunded too praye mutually one for another, bycause
God hath also commaunded vs too seeke helpe and comforte at
our neyghbours handes. And our Lord willeth it so, and promiseth
that wee shall fynd it. After the same maner also dooth Saint
Iames speake of it.<note place="margin">Iames. 5. d. 16.</note> Acknowledge your sinnes (sayeth he) one too
another, and pray one for another: that is too say, when yee bee pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed


<pb facs="tcp:23289:358"/>
with any temptation, and yee feele many infirmities and vyces in
you: let euery man vnburthen him self towards his neyghbours, and
say, Alas, I haue such a thing that greeueth mee, I haue offended
my God after such manner and such. And if yee doo so bewray the
infirmities that are in yee: it wel stiree yee vp to pray one for another.
But now is there any lyke thing betweene the Sayncts deceassed and
vs? Will Saint Peter and Saint Paule come tell vs their sunnes,
too the end wee myght pray for them? Or haue they eares long y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
too heere our prayers? (No:) wee see then that God intended
too restreyne mennes mutuall praying one of another, to such as are
conuersant in this world, and are yit in the battell. They therfore that
haue neede of our prayers, shall also pray on their syde for vs, and
wee must doo the lyke for them on our syde. But as for them that are
departed out of the world, it is not in vs too make them our aduocats
before God. For if wee cannot make an Aduocate in a matter of law,
that shal not be past fyue shillings, but it is in the Iudges power too
appoynt such one for aduocate as he listeth, and too put him in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
what a presumptuousenesse is it, if wee will take vppon vs too
make aduocats in heauen? What a pryde and presumptuousnesse is
it? Is it not a plucking of Gods maiestie and authoritie from him?
Now then, let vs learne too pray so one for another, as wee passe not
our bounds, nor wander out one way nor other euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his owne
conceyt, but bee contented too haue a care of all the members of the
Church, as wee bee bound too doo, and too take comfort and ioy our
selues, in that God hath voutsafed too bynd all his Churche vntoo vs,
and that by the same mutuall communicating, we (shewe our selues
too) bee members of the bodie of our Lord Iesus Christ. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
let vs all tend too our head, knowing that our prayers should
not bee woorthie too bee receyued, but rather bee foule, filthie, and
stinking, if our Lord Iesus Christ hallowed them not by his holinesse
and perfection. Knowing this, let vs neuer presume too open our
mouth too call vppon our God, but in the name of our mediatour, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
our selues that it is his office too bearewoord for vs, and too
make vs to bee heard, so as wee may fynd God fauorable and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
too help vs. That then is the meane for vs too pray vntoo God
boldly and with open mouth, as is sayd in the texts which I alledged
euen now both out of eyghth to the Ramans, and out of Saint Iames,
and also as wee haue seene in the third chapter of this Epistle. Wee


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:23289:358"/>
must call vppon God through the beleef which wee haue in Iesus
Christ, assuring our selues that he not only came downe intoo the
world too shead his blud once for the remission of our sinnes: but also
is incessantly before God too pray for vs, so as wee bee fully resolued,
that although wee bee but wretched earthwoormes, yit God accepteth
vs, and auoweth vs for his children by his meanes, &amp; will alwayes be
mercifull in receyuing our prayers and supplications, bycause wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them not too him in our owne name, nor by our selues, (for in good
sooth that were a foolish presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our owne imagination) but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath commaunded it, and shewed vs the way which we should
hold vs too.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maiestie of our good God, with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him too pardon them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that wee deserue too bee quyte cut of from the hope of
saluation. And forasmuch as it hath pleased him too call vs too him,
and too promis vs that wee shalbee receyued too mercie, if wee come
too him with fayth and humilitie: let vs pray him too prepare our
hartes in such wyse, as wee may make such requestes too him, as he
alloweth: and that therewithall he so beare with our infirmities, as
wee may not fayle to obteine fauour, though there be many imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in our prayers. And so let vs al say, Almyghtye God heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee sawe this morning how wee ought too
bee carefull in praying one for anther, and
the frute that commeth thereof: namely
that euery man which is a member of the
Sonne of God, must assure him selfe,
that the whole Church laboreth for him,
and that generally both Iesus Christ and
all his must bee refuzed, if God pitie vs
not. But heerewithal wee haue to marke
also, that Saint Paule in commending
himselfe too the prayers of the Church, is not so myndfull of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
as of the thing that is much excellenter, that is too wit, of the due
executing of the charge and office committed vntoo him. If a man
bee sicke, or in necessitye in this world, or trubbled by his enemyes,
wee bee woont too crye out for helpe and succour, and wee would
haue euery man too occupye himselfe for vs. And why? For inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as wee bee fleshly: as soone as wee feele any disease in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
wee bee sorye at the harte: but in the meane whyle wee forget the
cheef poynt: that is too wit, the things that concerne the euerlasting
saluation of our soules. Agein, when it comes too the seruing of God,
euery man thinkes he is sufficient ynough of himselfe too doo it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
helpe of his neyghbours. But Saint Paule sheweth heere, that
he thinkes not himselfe sufficient too execute the charge that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
too him of preaching the Gospell, without help from aboue:
and therefore he requyreth the prayers of the Church. And afterward
he sheweth therwithall, that he maketh more account therof, than of
his lyfe, notwithstanding that he were hild as then in prizon, yea and
euen cheyned. Ye see here that Saint Paule is hild in streyt ward, as
a sory offender, and looketh dayly for nothing but death: and yit for all
that, he careth not so much for his lyfe, as for the aduauncement
and preferment of Gods woorde: insomuch that he had leuer dye,


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:23289:359"/>
than too bee slothfull in dooing the thing that was inioyned him.
That is the effect of the thing which wee haue too remember vppon
this text.</p>
               <p>Trew it is that in the Epistle too the Thessalonians,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 3. a. 2.</note> he noteth
also the reason why he desyred too bee deliuered from the wicked and
faythlesse, which ceassed not too lay snares for him. And why? It
was lawfull for him too set store by his lyfe: but yit for all that, he
did not set the Cart before the horse (as they say:) for wee see by this
text,<note place="margin">Coloss. 4. a. 3. 4.</note> and also by that which is written too the Colossians, that he had
alwayes more regard too discharge his dewtie toowardes God, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in respect of the Church, by preaching the Gospell faythfully:
than too ease himselfe, or too eschew the daunger wherein he sawe he
was. Then first of all if our Lord call vs too any charge whatsoeuer
it bee, let vs learne too vnderstand our owne infirmitie, that wee may
bee succored of him as wee neede, and not presume any whit vppon
our owne strength or cunning, but consider that God must bee fayne
too hold vs vp by strong hand, and that wee haue neede too resort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him, yea and too desyre (after the example of Saint Paule) to bee
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to the prayers of al the members of our Lord Iesus Christ,
as in deede it is good reason that wee should pray mutually also for
them. That is for the first poynt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, although it be lawfull for vs to desire men to pray for vs
when wee bee sicke, or when we bee pinched with any other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
yit notwithstanding, lyke as wee must afore all thinges pray
for the comming of Gods kingdome, and seeke the aduauncing of
his glorie,<note place="margin">Math. 6. d. 33.</note> and make but an income of all other things else: So in
this cace, wee must learne not too bee so wedded too the world and too
this transitorie lyfe, as too cry out for helpe when wee bee pinched
with any aduersitie or neede, and in the meane whyle forget the thing
that ought too bee preferred before them. Wherefore let vs learne
too bee chare in such wyse of our lyfe, as wee may couet aboue all
thinges that God should be glorified in our persons, whether it bee by
life or by death, as S. Paule sheweth vs by his owne example in the
Epistle to the Phillippians.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. c. 20.</note> And so ye see what we haue to remember
in the first place.</p>
               <p>And he sayeth expresly, <hi>that Vtterance myght bee giuen him
in opening of his mouth.</hi> As if he should say, that God myght
giue him such corage and constancie, as he myght not speake fayntly,


<pb facs="tcp:23289:360"/>
but freely preach the Gospell, and not conceale any thing that myght
serue too let foorth the grace of our Iord Iesus Christ, and the infinite
benefytes that hee hath brought vs. That is the thing which Saint
Paule ment by the opening of his mouth. Now experience shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that he did not without cause desyre of God that his mouth myght
bee opened as a gate or doore: for he vseth the same terme in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged
place of the fourth too the Colossians. For such as shun
death, (that is too wit, the most parte of them that professe the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospell,) will not sticke too say somewhat too the matter:
but yit they doo oftentymes so disgyze the ryght, or else speake it so
fearfully: as the hearers wot not what they meane by it, their woords
shalbee so intangled. Too bee short, whereas they should shewe with
loud and shirle voyce, what our Lord Iesus Christ is, what Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
is, what the trew religion is, what fayth and repentance is:
they touch them as it were at glaunce: but as for too rip vp matters,
and too serch them too the bottom, they cannot away with that. And
why? For they see perill hanging ouer their heades, if they should
vse such freenesse. Howbeeit, Gods trew seruantes must practize
that which Saint Paule sayeth too Timothie:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. b. 7.</note> namely that they haue
not a slauish and cowardly hart, but march foorth freely in their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
too ouerpasse all the furiousnesse of the world, and to haue a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
forehead,<note place="margin">

hard battelles, and that they cannot please the world in dooing their
dewtie, but that they shall haue the enmitie of many men for exalting
the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ as they ought too doo: yit let them
not ceasse too go foreward, and too ouercome all lettes. Howbeeit
forasmuch as wee bee fearfull and feeble, God must bee fayne too

               <p>Then is it not ynough for vs too bee warned of our dewtie, but
wee must also adde this poynt of resorting vntoo God with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of our wantes and defaultes. And furthermore let vs all
take notice in generall, that the preaching of the Gospell is too hygh
and weyghtie a charge, vnlesse wee bee gouerned by Gods spirit: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

whereby men should bee reconcyled vntoo God, and certifyed of their

haue witnesse of the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and whereby the blud
of our Lord Iesus Christ is giuen foorth too wash vs from all our
steynes: who is of abilitie meete for it (sayeth Saint Paule) except
God make vs able by woorking in vs? For wee cannot so much as
thinke too doo good. Yea wee bee so farre of from hauing power too
doo any thing in deede, that wee cannot so much as thinke one good
thought, vnlesse God giue vs it. Now then, let such as are called too
the office of teaching Gods Church, vnderstand their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and put themselues wholly intoo Gods hand, too bee made able
too discharge themselues, knowing that they shall neuer bring it too
passe, no nor the hundreth part of it, vnlesse it bee giuen them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.
And therefore let all men pray for those that are so ordeyned too
bee teachers and ministers of the woord: for it is a singular gift of
God, when wee haue such Shepherdes of our soules, as are able too
guyde vs well. Wherfore bee it knowen both too great and small, that
too maynteyne the Church in hir perfect state and soundnesse, God
must bee fayne too giue power and strength too such as should teache,
and men must pray for them: for in so doing, euery man procureth his
owne welfare and saluation. And if we be negligent therin, it is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that wee make no reckening, nother of our spiritual life, nor of the
common welfare of the Church.</p>
               <p>And heerin wee see what wee ought too deeme of such as pretend
too preache Gods woord in these dayes, and in the meane whyle are so
fearefull, that they dare not open their mouth, vntill they haue well
bethought them, whether the things that they intend too speake, may
offend or delyght the eares of him and of hir. What a sort see wee in
the Popedome which rowe betweene two streames, and would fayne
haue it knowen, that they bee such as would fayne haue leaue too
preache purely? But yit for all that, they doo so beepeynt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
which they vtter: as they play the craftie merchantes, and
there is nothing but falshood in them, according also as Saint Paule
vseth the same similitude,<note place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

too purchace the fauour of the world, and too maynteyne it. Now the
saying of such men is, that they must stryke sayle, hold with the hare,
and hunt with the hound, eschew occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of stumbling blocks, and that
it is not for a man too stryue ageinst the streame. As who should say,
they bee much wyzer than God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ho speaking by Saint Paule, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that Iesus Cerist must bee preached throughly, and men must


<pb facs="tcp:23289:361"/>
not go about too bury him any more: for seeing he is rizen vntoo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
he will haue the voyce of his Gospell ring loud and shirle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any dissimulation, as I sayd afore. Moreouer, euen where there
is no persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sword nor fyre, the world sees that they which name
themselues ministers of the Gospell, would fayne currye fauell in such
wyse, as there should bee no shift but our Lord Iesus Christ must
stoope, and wrythe his truthe too and fro at mennes pleasures. Now
adayes when the preachers perceyue, that it is no pleasant thing for
them too put men vnder the yoke of our Lord Iesus Christ: what, say
they? Shall wee offend greate men, and such as are in authoritie ouer
vs? Should wee not rather win them by gentlenesse? Yis, but they
bee wyld beasts dossing with their hornes ageinst our Lord Iesus
Christ, and cannot abyde that there should bee any disciplyne in the
Church: and yit for all that, men must preache still too their lyking.
What a trayterousnesse and villanie were that? Yit notwithstanding,
a man neede not go farre too fynd such preachers of the Gospell, that
is too say, of leaud choppers and chaungers, which turne all topsiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
knowing not what their dewtie is. The world sees such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
too manifestly before their eyes. Therfore it standeth vs so much
the more on hand to mark well this text, where Saint Paule sheweth
that the Gospell is not preached as God hath commaunded it, except
men go too it fully and openly, and with full mouth (as they say.)</p>
               <p>Now he speaketh of the secret of the Gospell, too magnify this
doctrine, which else should be despized of many that wil needs play the
suttle &amp; sharp witted fellowes, according as yee shall see a sort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
fellowes which think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues so wyse, that the Gospell is
not for them: for there is such a simplicitie in it, as they cannot brucke.
They would stye vp and sore aboue the clouds, &amp; haue such speculations
as myght amaze them, and (nother they themselues) nor any man
else vnderstand them. It is very trew that at the first syght, when men
reade the Gospell, they shall see that God dooth after a sort play the
nurce there (as he him self sayeth) and that bycause he knoweth our
rudenesse, how we bee as little children: he lispeth with vs. But yit
for all that, the doctrine therof passeth all the wit of man. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Angels doo woonder at it,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3. b. 10.</note> and are inforced too honour it, as it is
sayd in another place.<note place="margin">

which is seen in the Gospell, there is such wisdome of God as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,

wee fasten vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing (there) vnlesse God inlyghtned our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as is sayd of it in the two first chapters of the first Epistle to the
Corinthians. That therfore is the cause why S. Paule telleth vs, that
there are great secrets in the Gospel which we vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, further
foorth than God woorketh in vs: and that no tung of man is able to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, except God guyde both them that heare them, and
are too bee taught them, and also those that speake them, so as all bee
gouerned, by his holy spirit.</p>
               <p>And he addeth, <hi>as it becommeth mee too speake.</hi> Wherin hee
sheweth yit agein, that it is not ynough too preache by rote whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
comes at the tungs end: but all must bee ruled by Gods woord, so
as it may perce mens harts, and win them too his obenience: and that
(as is sayd in another place) there bee not only language or speache:<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. d. 20.</note>
for the kingdome of heauen consisteth not in gay Rhetorik, but in the
power of God. Too the end then that there may be such a lyuelinesse,
as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may know that such as teache vs, are stirred vp of God, to be as
his instruments, and too doo him seruis: Saint Paule desyreth men
too pay for him. Wherfore let vs learne, that too step vp into the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and too expound some text of scripture, is not all that is too bee
doone, but there must be a special handsomnesse, which groweth not in
the gardens of men, but proceedeth of the extraordinarie goodnesse of
God.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. c. 15.</note> And herein he sheweth that which he speaketh in another place,
namely that noman can performe the dewtie of a good and faythfull
teacher, vnlesse he bee sent. Now this sending importeth, that God
giueth men that which is requisyte for the executing of their charge,
bycause they want it of themselues.</p>
               <p>There is yit further, that Saint Paule gloryeth of his bearing of
the Ambassage of the Gospell, notwithstanding that he bee a poore
prisoner, yea and in cheynes, as if a man should now set a man in the
stocks, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etter him. Therfore he vseth the woord Ambashadour, too
the intent that his imprizoning should not preiudice the doctrine of
God. No, no (sayeth he) God auoweth mee for his Ambassadour.
Albeeit that men hold scorne of mee, though I bee thus afflicted, and
although men myght lothe mee too looke vppon mee: yit is all this no
derogation too the office wherin God hath put mee, that is too say, too
my Ambassadourship of preaching the Gospell in his name. And
it is not only in this text that Saint Paule dooth so magn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fye the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable


<pb facs="tcp:23289:362"/>
dignitie that was giuen vntoo him, in declaring that men
cannot any what diminish it: but (which more is) he glorieth greatly
in that he was hild so in yron cheynes and streyt prizon. For surely it
serued for a good record that he had preached earnestly, and that men
ought to receyue his doctrine quietly &amp; without gey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>saying. Trew it
is, that if we go through with our charge, &amp; follow Gods calling with
a free hart, we shalbe his seruants. But yit for all that, there is not so
good proof of vs as when God sendeth some tryall, so as wee bee one
whyle in prizon, another whyle driuen from place too place, and trub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and vexed dyuers wayes. If wee see that, and agein, that wee bee
wrongfully blamed, and torne in peeces, and yit neuerthelesse doo hold
out still, without swaruing one way or other for any thing that may
befall: then dooth God ratifye and authentikly seale our Calling, and
shewe that he hath made vs his seruants. Now then seeing that Saint
Paule was in prizon, and moued too deny him self, and could haue
gone out if he had would, by forsaking the truthe of the Gospel, and yit
hild out stedfastly, so as his lyfe was nothing too him, but his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newall
seeking was too magnify the name of our Lord Iesus Christ:
when such Constancie was seene in Saint Paule, it myght well bee
concluded, that there had bin no counterfetting in him before. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a man shall but only preache, and afterward when he commeth but to
the aking of the tippe of his finger, he starteth backe, and would plucke
his pennie from the stake (as they say:) dooth not the world see that
he was but a niggler, and a player of enterludes before? If a man be
a great wryter, and as excellent a teacher as can be deuyzed, and yit
notwithstanding wil not shed one drop of blud when God calleth him
too it? too shewe that the doctrine which hee caryed abrode was not
his owne: it appeereth that he was but a mocker, and that he is woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
too haue men spit in his face, and too haue more shame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche,
than if he had bin an ignorant beast. So then, Saint Paule
gloryeth of his bands, saying, that although the world made no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
of him, but disdeyned him, yit neuerthelesse God auoweth
him for his Ambassadour.</p>
               <p>And heerupon let vs learne not to bee so scornful as to despize Gods
seruantes, when we see them hild in prizon, but let vs vnderstand, that
God dooth then exalt them too much greater dignity and honour, than
those that are mounted aloft into pulpites. He then that is in prison,
and persi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>steth in the pure confession of the Gospel, is in much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable


<pb n="344" facs="tcp:23289:362"/>
degree, than al they that preach at free liberty. Marke that
for one poynt.</p>
               <p>And agein, in the tyme that God spareth vs and giueth vs ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,
let vs learne too fence our selues so afore hand with corage and
constancie, as wee may bee his Ambassadours whensoeuer it shall
please him, both in prizon, and in the middes of the threatenings of
enemies, and in all the rages of death that can bee put ageinst vs.
That is the thing which wee haue too marke vppon this streyne. And
so let vs not bee dismayed as a number of vnconstant persons are, who
when they heare that a great sort are imprizoned in such a place, and
such a one was burnt in another place, are by and by out of hart, and
the Gospell is no more accounted with them. They that forge too
themselues such stumbling blockes, shewe well that they neuer had
any liuely roote in fayth. But contrariwyse, when wee see that our
Lord Iesus Christ dooth so serue himselfe by those whom he calleth
too tryall, by putting them intoo the handes of Tyrantes, and of the
enemies of his truth, and yit giueth them inuincible constancie: it is
a goodly strengthning of our fayth, and wee haue cause too bee the
more inflamed. For vnlesse God wrought in them, it is certeyne that
there should no such strenght bee seene in any man liuing. Therefore
wee must pray God too arme vs at our neede, and therwithal to shewe
vs that the doctrine of his Gospell which is of sufficient authoritie of
it selfe, must bee further authorized by a manner of prouision. But yit
must the blud of the Martirs, and of such as God hath sanctified to his
glory, serue too that purpose, bycause they bee as it were his Proctors
before men.</p>
               <p>Now heereuppon Paule addeth, <hi>that he hath sent Tychicus
too Ephesus, too the intent that the Ephesians myght knowe in
what state he was.</hi> This also is sayd too the common edifying of the
Church. For whereas Saint Paule speaketh of his state and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he meaneth not the things that concerne his bodie or his health,
nor any thing else that belongeth too this present lyfe: but he referreth
it specially too the confession of the fayth, and his free maynteyning
of the Gospell. Wee know that if a man bee in prison, specially a
man of renowme: folke will bee in some care of him, (saying) Alas,
will God giue him constancie? And agein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diuell sleepeth not at
that tyme. There shall neuer any man of credit which hath edifyed
Gods Church, bee cast in prison, or impeached: but there shall some


<pb facs="tcp:23289:363"/>
thing or other bee sowed abrode, too disgrace him, and too bring him
as it were intoo a slaunder, and all is too deface the things that God
hath doone by his meane, and too ouerthrowe that which he hath
builded. That is one of Satans policies. And therefore Saint
Paule knowing that men myght sowe abrode many lyes, and say,
ho, see yee, I warrant yee he should not bee so long borne with at
Rome, specially hauing the Emperour and all the Court ageinst
him: except he did yeeld: it may well bee sayd, that his cace is not
cleere. And others, Tush, men make no account of him, they see he
is but a doting foole. And others: some one thing, and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
euery man after his owne fancie: Saint Paule (I say) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
that many poore we akelings myght be hindered by him, and
cast intoo perpleritie, and that othersome myght bee kept backe from
comming too the Gospell: will haue his state knowen, and the diuell
with all his slaunders put too the foyle, and the mouthes of all backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
stopped, and lykewyse of all Colcaryers which seeke nothing
but too set trubble in the Church. Also for feare least they that had
begun too profit in the Gospell, myght bee hindered, and the same an
occasion too shet the gate ageinst such as were not yit come in: Saint
Paule intending too preuent all those respectes, sayeth, that he hath
sent Tychicus.</p>
               <p>And wee see yit better in this text, what care he had alwayes too
make the Churches continewe in goodnesse. For he could haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that he was letted ynough for himselfe, and that he was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched
with enemyes: &amp; he could haue made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue, that he had
had no leyzure too thinke of other folkes, and that for his owne part, it
was ynough for him too doo his dewtie at Rome, without sending
here and there ouer the sea, too confirme the Churches: for there
were a great sort of others besydes him. Agein, forasmuch as God
had shet him vp: it had bin ynough (as a man would haue iudged in
common opinion) that he swarued not a syde euen too the death. But
he contenteth not him self with his only being of a faythfull witnesse
and martir of our Lord Iesus Christ: but he thinketh therwithall, that
it became him too preuent all stumbling blocks which the diuell stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp one way or other, too defame the Gospell withall, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth
himself therto, as wee see heere by example. Now then let vs
learne to serue God in such wyze, euen too the laste gaspe of our lyfe,
as wee may haue a care of our neyghbours also, and procure their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are


<pb n="345" facs="tcp:23289:363"/>
as much as wee can, accordingly as God hath bound vs thertoo.</p>
               <p>And to the intent that Tychicus should be receyued, he calleth him
<hi>brother and faythfull minister in Christ:</hi> and that is too giue him
credit, that men myght receyue his record. And in very deede, wee
must iudeuer too the vttermost of our power, that such as can serue the
Church, may bee aduaunced, and men knowe what they bee, and that
they may haue as it were their mark, so as they may haue authoritie
as is requisite. That is the example which Saint Paule sheweth vs:
For it was not for any vaynglorie or fauor of men, that he commended
Tychicus after that maner: but his desyre was, that men should know
Christs faythfull minister too their owne benefyte, so as he myght
haue accesse too them, and not be reiected as one woorth nothing, but
that his woord myght be receyned as it deserued.</p>
               <p>Theruppon, too end and knit vp his Epistle withall, Saint Paule
prayeth, <hi>that the brethren myght haue peace, loue, and Fayth
from God, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Now this woord
<hi>Peace</hi> is commonly taken in Saint Paule, for all welfare and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
In deede it signifyeth properly concord: but the Apostles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accustomed too the Hebrew tung, haue vsed the word that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
both. And when Saint Paule sayeth, Grace and peace bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vntoo you: by the first he wisheth Gods fauour and mercie, and by
the other, that he should prosper vs in all goodnesse and good things.
Therfore in this text he sheweth, that all the prosperitie of the godly
commeth of Gods mere goodnesse, and not from elswhere. Therunto
he addeth also, fayth and charitie. Wherin wee see that God reserueth
too him self the office, not only of sending vs these outward goods
which wee want, but also and specially of giuing vs the spiritual gifts,
wherof wee bee vtterly voyd and destitute. Howbeit, it is hard too
make men beleeue it, bicause they be alwayes drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with this pryde,
of imagining themselues too haue some abilitie of mynd too beleeue
the Gospell, and too discerne betweene good and euill, insomuch that
too their seeming, it is a needlesse thing to pray God too inlyghten
them. But yit must wee needs bee punished for our ouerweening, if
wee think wee haue eyther fayth or charitie of our selues. So then let
vs conclude, that bothe of them bee the singular gifts of God, and let
vs confesse, that both of them come of him, and that on the other side he
must bee fayme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

not so, it is certein that when our eares shal haue bin beaten with good
doctrine all the tyme of our lyfe, it shalbee but lost labour. And it is
not only in this text that it is sayd so: but a man shall scarsly fynd any
leaf in the holie Scripture, wherin God reserueth not too him selfe
the giuing of fayth. And in good fayth wee our selues see well, that
the holie scripture inlyghteneth vs, and how vtterly wee bee destitute

on the other syde enter intoo our selues, and examin our selues in such
sort, as we fynd our selues vtterly destitute of all goodnesse: it is good
reason wee should confesse, that vntill God giue vs fayth, wee haue no
fayth at all. That is the thing which wee haue too mark vppon this

wee cannot loue our neyghbours, but would rather oppresse them.
So then, we must needs haue Charitie from elswhere, and God must

as wee must indeuer too doo our dewtie towards them. And so
yee see that fayth and charitie are iustly called the speciall gift of God,
and that Saint Paule dooth iustly in this text say: <hi>Charitie and
Fayth bee vntoo you frow God our father.</hi> It is certeyne that
his wish was not made feynedly, but that in saying so, he doth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that wee must haue it at Gods hand. Wherfore let vs lay
downe all foolish ouerweening, and let vs vnderstand that all the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
benefyts which wee haue, are the free gifts of God, wherby hee
sheweth and declareth his liberalitie effectually towards vs. And it
is certeyne that all the perfection of Christians consisteth in faythe
and charitie. Wherfore let vs conclude, that whatsoeuer belongeth to
the saluation of our soules, or is woorthie too bee esteemed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
wee haue none of it of our owne growing, but it commeth too
vs from aboue.<note place="margin">Math. 16. c. 17.</note> Accordingly as it is sayd of the confessing of our fayth,
that nother flesh nor blud doo shewe vs that Iesus Christ is the sonne
of God,<note place="margin">Math. 11. d. 25.</note> but the father reuealeth it too vs. And lykewyse also our
Lord Iesus Christ sayeth,<note place="margin">Luke. 10. d. 21.</note> Father, I thank thee that thou haste
hidden these things from the wyse, and reueled them too the little ones.
Therfore let vs learne to bee little ones, that we may bee Gods schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and too bee fooles in our selues, that wee may bee filled with his
wisdome, and yeeld him honor, according too the measure of the gifts
which wee shall haue receyued of him, and not bee soo wicked as too
chalendge the prayse vntoo vs, which he dooth iustly and ryghtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
too him self.</p>
               <p>Howbeeit, Saint Paule matcheth our Lord Iesus Christ with
God the father, too doo vs vnderstand, that wee can obteyne nothing
but by the meanes of him, which hath reconcyled vs vntoo God. For
what is the cause that wee bee so corrupted in our nature, as wee bee
voyd of all goodnesse, and full fraught with all vyces, and too be short,
that we be altogither abhominable: but for that we be vtterly estraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 14. &amp;. Coloss. 1. c. 19. &amp;. 2. b. 9.</note> who is the fountayne of al goodnesse?
And for the same cause was he indewed with all fulnesse of grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

requisyte and necessarie for our welfare, in respect that he is our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
(as wee haue seene in the .iiii. Chapter:) but also Saint Paule
yeeldeth him here moreouer, that he giueth vs faith and charitie by his
owne authoritie and power: for he setteth him in equall degree with
his father. Now then let vs vnderstand, that our Lord Iesus Christes
office of inlyghtening vs by fayth, and of reforming our harts, not only
belongeth too him as now in respect that he is our mediator &amp; Gods
minister: but also that it is his owne: for this maner of speeche of S.
Paules would not otherwyse agree.</p>
               <p>But heere by the way a man myght aske a question. For Saint
Paule prayeth not God too giue fayth too the faythlesse, and charitie
too them that are fleshly: but vntoo <hi>the brethren,</hi> that is too say, too
the bodie of the Church. Now if they be of the Church, they bee Gods
children alredye, they bee begotten agein by the holie Ghoste, and by
that meane they haue both fayth and charitie. But herin Saint Paule
sheweth vs, that it is not ynough for that God begin fayth in vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he continew in it too the end: and that lyke as wee call fayth the
gift of God, so must he also make it too growe and increace day by
day.<note place="margin">Phil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. d. 29.</note> And that is it which is ment by this saying, that it is giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
vs not only too beleeue in Iesus Christ, but also too suffer for him.
Therfore Gods giuing of fayth vntoo vs, is not in such wyse, as that
he dooth but only prepare vs, that wee myght beleeue the Gospell, if
we listed, and that afterward we should bring a consent of our owne, &amp;
go foreward of our selues by our own power: No: but when God hath
once dispozed vs too beleeue, he must also giue vs such an affection, as
may touche vs too the quicke, and afterward driue vs forewarde, and
giue vs abilitie too perseuer, so as we may profit, &amp; go foreward, &amp; be
confirmed euen to the end. That is the cause why S. Paule speaking
heere of the faythfull which were brought alredie intoo the good way,
and to whom the grace of God was manifested, sayeth neuerthelesse,
that God must bee fayne too further them &amp; giue them the gift to hold
out, euen by growing more and more as wel in fayth as in loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:23289:365"/>
And therby we haue warning to pray God to increase &amp; strengthen
our fayth, and to inflame vs with charitie, and therwithall to make vs
knowe our imperfections, so as although wee see a number that come
not neere vs, yit wee conceyue not any pryde too stand in our owne
conceits, as though wee were come too fayth already. Wherefore let
vs assure our selues, that we be but in our way as long as we bee in
this worlde, and therefore let vs inforce our selues foreward. For
what perfection of fayth so euer wee can fynd among men: it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
that God will fynd much amisse in it, and how farre foreward
soeuer wee bee, and how well so euer wee haue profited in charitie, a
man shall come farre short, of fynding that any of vs hath forgotten
him self, and thrust couetousnesse and ambition vnder foote, with all
other things that may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and the imploying of our selues too doo them seruis. Sith it
is so, let vs learne (as I sayd) too knowe our owne imperfections in
such wyse, as wee may mislyke of our selues for them, and bee induced
therby too doo better than wee haue done hithertoo. And although
men prayse and commend vs, yit let vs learne too confesse with all
humblenesse and meeknesse, that wee bee yit farre short of atteyning
too our mark.</p>
               <p>Now hereuppon Saint Paule addeth agein, <hi>Grace bee too all
them that loue our Lord Iesus Christ vncorruptly.</hi> Wherin he
sheweth who bee the brethren that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that professe themselues too liue after the Gospel, but such as loue our
Lord Iesus Christ, yea (sayth he) with such soundnesse, as it bee not
an affection that corrupteth and banisheth away out of hand. And not
without cause is this sayd. For wee see how fewe there are which
loue Iesus Christ ryghtly and soundly. The multitude of them that
pretend too holdwith the Godspell, is greate ynough: but what a
number are there which renounce God in their works, when they haue
confessed him so in their words? Agein, if a man examin them nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly,
which haue yit some good tokens, and liue orderly ynough and
without blame, so as it myght bee sayd, that there is no hipocrisie in
them: he shall see them ouershoote themselues in the turning of a hand.
As for example, wee see how the persecutions now adayes discouer
