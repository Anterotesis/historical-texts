            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>CAlling to minde the Grounds and Ends of the late War and Bloudſhed in theſe Nations; how ſignally you were owned by God in your former management of the Government of this Commonwealth, and how miraculouſly, even beyond the expectation of moſt men, after a long Interruption, (which the Lord in his infinite wiſdom ſuffered, to try and humble both you and us) you are again peaceably reſtored to the performance and exerciſe of your Truſt, (as you are the Peoples Repreſentatives:) And withal conſidering, to our great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and ſatisfaction, your late Declaration, <hi>That you will endeavour (by the Lords aſſiſtance) to s;ettle the Government of this Commonwealth upon ſuch a Foundation as may aſſert and ſecure our Liberties both as Men and Christians,</hi> and that <hi>without a ſingle perſon or Houſe of Peers</hi>; we cannot but bless the God of all our mercies for putting this opportunity into your hands, and inclining your hearts (notwithſtanding all the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which lie before you) to a further proſecution of your duty, in reference to the ſafety and freedom of this Commonwealth; and do judge it a duty incumbent upon us, cordially to cloſe with this miraculous Providence of God, whereby his precious Cauſe is again vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and the hearts of the good People of this Land in a great meaſure revived and comforted; and to contribute our utmoſt endeavours for ſtrengthning your hands, in the further carrying on the great Work of Reformation in this Commonwealth: it being our earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that your laſt works may be your beſt, and that you may have ſuch a ſpecial and more then ordinary preſence of God with you in your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Reſolves, that both we, and the generations to come, may have abundant cauſe to bleſs his Name for you, as the moſt famous and memorable Parliament that ever engaged for the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that we may the better expreſs our cordial Affections to this Commonwealth, and to your Honours, as you are intruſted therewith, we ſhall take the boldneſs as others have done (with whom we are engaged in the ſame Cauſe) humbly to lay before you the ſincere Deſires of our hearts, and to particularize a few of thoſe things, which may by the bleſſing of God conduce to the eſtabliſhment of Common Right and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and may anſwer the expectations of our dear Country-men, Who have hazarded their lives and eſtates in that precious Cauſe which you and your victorious Army have ſo ofen and ſo eminently aſſerted in your Remonſtrances and Declarations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Magiſtracie and Milicia of this Commonwealth may be ſpeedily ſetled in the hands of confiding perſons, ſuch as fear the Lord, and have given teſtimony of their love to all his people, and of their faithfulneſs to the Cauſe of this Commonwealth; according to your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the 7th of <hi>May,</hi> 1759.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That care may be taken (according to the minde of God) for propagating the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt in this Commonwealth, and the due encourgement of all the faithful, godly and peaceable Miniſters and Profeſſors thereof: And that all Penal Laws and Statutes which do intrench upon the Liberties of conſcientious Chriſtians of different perſwaſions in matters of Religion, may be repealed and made void.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no perſons whatſoever may continue too long in Power, either Civil or Martial; but that they may be in a capacity to be governed and ruled, as well as to govern and rule: And that no perſon, by vertue of any Tenure, Grant, Charter, Patent, Degree, Birth, or Military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, may be priviledged or exempted from ſubjection to the Laws: And that the Liberty and Freedom of the people may be ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecured, both in their perſons and goods, that they may not be proceeded againſt but upon the tranſgreſſion of ſome known Law; and that all Trials for life may be onely by Twelve ſworn men of the Neighbourhood; and no conviction had or made, but upon the teſtimony of two or more ſufficient Witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all Puniſhments inflicted upon Delinquents in this Commonwealth, may be equally proportioned to their ſeveral Offences, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of God and Nature) that ſo the precious lives of our dear Country-men may not be forfeited upon trivial and ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Legiſlative power of this Commonwealth may be ſo aſcertained in the Repreſentatives of the People, (duely choſen by them) that neither a Single Perſon, Senate for life, nor Houſe of Lords, may have any ſhare therein, nor be co-ordinate therewith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That you will abbreviate and regulate the proceedings at Law, and in your grave Wiſdoms deviſe a way that the people may have juſtice duly adminiſtred; and their Suits ſpeedily determined, neer their dwellings: And that the Laws may be ſo modeled and framed, that they may not in the leaſt countenarce or ſupport Monarchy, but be every Way ſuitable and ſubſervient to the Government of a Free State.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That you will endeavour ſpeedily and effectually to revive and reſtore the Trade of this Nation, and encourage the Manufacture of Clothing, wherein many thouſands are concerned, and which hath no ſmall influence upon this Commonwealth: And that you will uſe ſome means to keep the people from Beggary and Idleneſs, in ſuch a good and fruitful Land as this is.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That ſatisfaction may be given to thoſe well-affected perſons who lent money on the Publike Faith, and are now in great Want and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That you will take into conſideration all ſuch Corporations and Charters as do any way Monopolize or abridge the Birthrights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of Engliſh men, and which are no other then Badges of Kingſhip and Royal Prerogative, and therefore unſuitable to the Government of a well-regulated Free State, which we humbly deſire may be ſpeedily ſetled by your Honours, for the benefit of the preſent and ſucceeding Generations.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That you will appoint a Committee to receive ſuch Rational Propoſals as ſhall be made by ſober diſcreet perſons, in order to ſuch a Settlement, as hath been practiſed in the firſt forming and introducing of other Commonweals or Free States.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That a ſtrict Survey may be taken, and a Pious and Publike Improvement made of the ſeveral Hoſpitals of this Commonwealth; that ſo the Profits and Revenues thereof may not be converted to private uſes, contrary to the intention of the Donors.</p>
