            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are met here on the greateſt Occaſion, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>England</hi> ever ſaw: having upon your ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Intereſt of three Great Nations, with the Territories belonging to them. And truly (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) I may ſay it without an Hyperbole, You have upon your ſhoulders the Intereſt of all the Chriſtian People in the World. And the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that I ſhould let you know (as far as I have cognizance of it) the occaſion of your aſſembling together at this time.</p>
            <p>It hath been very well hinted to you this day, That you come hither to ſettle the Intereſts before mentioned: for, it will be made of ſo large extention in the Iſſue and conſequence of it.</p>
            <p>In the way and manner of my ſpeaking to you, I ſhall ſtudy plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and to ſpeak to you what is truth, and what is upon my heart, and what will in ſome meaſure reach to theſe concernments.</p>
            <p>After ſo many changes and turnings which this Nation hath labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, to have ſuch a Day of Hope as this is, and ſuch a Door of Hope opened by God to us; Truly, (I believe) ſome Moneths ſince, would have been above all our thoughts.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe it would have been worthy of ſuch a Meeting as this is, to have remembered that which was the Riſe, and gave the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all thoſe turnings and toſſings that have been upon theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And to have given you a Series of the Tranſactions (not of men, but) of the Providence of God, all along unto our late changes: As
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137201:3"/>
alſo the ground of our firſt undertaking to oppoſe that Uſurpation and Tyranny that was upon us, both in Civils and Spirituals: And the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Grounds particularly applicable to the ſeverall Changes that have been.</p>
            <p>But I have two or three Reaſons which divert me from ſuch a way of proceeding at this time. If I ſhould have gone in that way, that which is upon my heart to have ſaid (which is written there, that if I would blot it our, I could not) would have ſpent this Day: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and Diſpenſations of God have been ſo ſtupendious. As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid in the like caſe: <hi>Many, O Lord my God, are thy Wonderfull Works which thou haſt done: and thy thoughts Which are to usward,<note place="margin">Pſal, 40.5.</note> they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: If I Would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more then can be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, another Reaſon, new to me, you had to day in the Sermon. Much Recapitulation of Providence; much Alluſion to a State, and Diſpenſation in reſpect of Diſcipline and Correction; of Mercies and Deliverances; the onely Parallel of Gods dealing with us, that I know in the world: which was largely and wiſely held forth to you this day: <hi>Iſraels</hi> bringing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through a Wilderneſſe, by many Signes and Wonders, towards a place of Reſt; I ſay towards it. And that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo well remonſtrated to you this day, is another Argument why. I ſhall not trouble you with recapitulation of thoſe things: Though they are things, that (I hope) will never be forgotten; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe written in better Books then thoſe of Paper; I am perſwaded, written in the heart of every good man.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon was this, That which I judge to be the end of your Meeting; the great end; which was likewiſe remembred to you this day; to wit, Healing, and Settling. And the remembring Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too particularly, perhaps inſtead of healing (at leaſt in the hearts of many of you) may ſet the wound freſh a bleeding.</p>
            <p>I muſt profeſſe this to you (what ever thoughts paſſe upon me) that if this day, that is, this Meeting prove not healing, what ſhall we do? But as I ſaid before, ſeeing (I truſt) it is in the mindes of you all, and much more in the minde of God, which muſt cauſe healing: It muſt be firſt in his minde; and he being pleaſed to put it into yours, it will be a day indeed; and ſuch a day, as Generations to come will bleſſe you for. I ſay for this, and the other Reaſons have I forborne to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137201:3"/>
make a particular remembrance, and Enumeration of things, and of the manner of the Lords bringing us thorow ſo many Changes and Turnings as have paſſed upon us.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, I think it will be more then neceſſary, to let you know (at the leaſt ſo well as I may) in what Condition this; nay, theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, when this Government was undertaken.</p>
            <p>For Order ſake. Its very naturall for us to conſider, What our Condition was in Civils; in Spirituals. What was our Condition? Every mans hand (almoſt) was againſt his Brother; at leaſt, his heart. Little regarding any thing that ſhould cement, and might have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in it to cauſe us to grow into one. All the Diſpenſations of God, His terrible ones, (he having met us in the way of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a ten years Civill War, a very ſharp one;) His mercifull Diſpenſations, they did not, they did not work upon us: but we had our Humours, and Intereſts: And indeed I fear our humours were more then our Intereſts, And certainly, as it fell out in ſuch Caſes, our Paſſions were more then our Judgements.</p>
            <p>Was not every thing (almoſt) grown Arbitrary? Who knew where, or how to have right without ſome obſtruction or other intervening? Indeed we were almoſt grown Arbitrary in every thing.</p>
            <p>What was the face that was upon out Affairs as to the Intereſt of the Nation? to the Authority of the Nation? to the Magiſtracy? to the Ranks, and Orders of Men, whereby <hi>England</hi> hath been known for hundreds of years? A Nobleman, a Gentleman, a Yeoman? (That is a good Intereſt of the Nation, and a great one.) The Magiſtracy of the Nation, was it not almoſt trampled under foot, under deſpite, and contempt, by men of Levelling principles?</p>
            <p>I beſeech you for the Orders of men, and Ranks of men; did not that Levelling Principle tend to the reducing all to an equality? Did it think to do ſo? or did it practiſe towards it, for Propriety and Intereſt? What was the Deſigne, but to make the Tennant as liberall a fortune as the Landlord? which I think if obtained, would not have laſted long. The men of that Principle, after they had ſerved their own Turnes, would have cried up Intereſt, and Property then faſt enough.</p>
            <p>This Inſtance is in ſtead of many, and that it may appear that this thing did extend far, is manifeſt; becauſe it was a pleaſing voice to all poor men, and truly not unwelcome to all bad men. To my thinking it is a Conſideration, that in your Endeavours after Settlement, you will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137201:4"/>
be ſo well minded of, that I might well have ſpared this; But let that paſſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed in Spirituall things, the Caſe was more ſad, and deplorable; and that was told to you this day eminently. The prodigious Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Contempt of God and Chriſt, denying of him, Contempt of him and his Ordinances, and of the Scriptures: A ſpirit viſibly acting thoſe things foretold by <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi>; yea, thoſe things ſpoken of by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>: who when he would remember ſome things to be worſe then the Antichriſtian ſtate, of which he had ſpoken in the firſt to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Tells them what ſhould be the Lot, and Portion of the laſt times,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1. 2.</note> and ſayes, <hi>in the laſt dayes perilous times ſhould come,<note place="margin">2 Tim 3. 2, 3, 4.</note> for men ſhould be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Parents, unthankfull</hi> &amp;c. And when he remembers that of the Antichriſtian State, he tells them, <hi>that in the latter dayes,</hi> that State ſhall come in, <hi>wherein there ſhall be a departing from the faith, and a giving head to ſeducing ſpirits,<note place="margin">1 Tim 4. 1. 2.</note> and doctrines of Devils,<note place="margin">1. 2.</note> ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie,</hi> &amp;c. By which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he makes the ſtate of the laſt times, worſe then that under Antichriſt. And ſurely it may well be feared theſe are our times: For when men forget all Rules of Law and Nature, and break all the Bonds that fallen man hath upon him, the Remainder of the Image of God in his Nature, which he cannot blot out, and yet ſhall endeavour to blot out, having a form of Godlineſſe, without the power; theſe are ſad ſtokens of the laſt times.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Character, wherewith this ſpirit, and principle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in that place, is ſo Legiole, and viſible, that he that runs may read it to be amongſt us: for by ſuch the Grace of God is turned into wantonneſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Chriſt, and the Spirit of God, made the Cloak of all villany, and ſpurious apprehenſions. And although theſe things will not be owned publikely, as to practiſe, (they being ſo abominable, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>:) Yet how this principle extends it ſelf and whence it had its Riſe, makes me to think of a ſecond ſort of men; who, its true, as I ſaid, will not practiſe, nor own theſe things; Yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tell the Magiſtrate, That he hath nothing to do with men thus holding in for theſe are matters of Conſcience, and Opinion; they are matters of Religion; what hath the Magiſtrate to do with theſe things? he is to look to the outward man, but not to meddle with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137201:4"/>
the inward. And truly it ſo happens, that though theſe things do break out viſibly to all, yet the principle wherewith theſe things are carried on, ſo forbids the Magiſtrate to meddle with them, as it hath hitherto kept the offenders from puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Such Conſiderations, and Pretentions of Liberty; Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Liberty of Subjects two as glorious, things to be contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, as any God hath given us; yet both theſe alſo abuſed for the patronizing of villanies; in ſo much as that it hath been an ordinary thing to ſay, and in Diſpute to affirm, That it was not in the Magiſtrates power; he had nothing to do with it; not ſo much as the Printing a Bible to the Nation for the uſe of the people, loſt it be impoſed upon the Conſciences of men; for they muſt receive the ſame Traditionally, and implicitly, from the power of the Magiſtrate, if thus received.</p>
            <p>The aforementioned abominations, did thus ſwell to this height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
            <p>The Axe was laid to the Root of the Miniſtery. It was Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: It was Babyloniſh. It ſuffered under ſuch a Judgement; that the truth of it is, as the Extremity was great on that, I wiſh it prove not ſo on this hand. The extremity was, That no man having a good Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, having received Gifts from Chriſt might Preach, if not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. So now, many are on the other hand, that he who is Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hath a nullity, or Antichriſtianiſme ſtamped upon his Calling; ſo that he ought not to preach, or not be heard.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it may not too to juſtly be ſaid, that there was ſeverity and ſharpneſſe; yea, too much of an in poſing ſpirit in matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; a ſpirit unchriſtian enough in any times, moſt unfit for theſe; denying Liberty to thoſe who have earned it with their blood, who have gained Civil Liberty and Religious alſo, for thoſe who would thus impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>We may reckon among theſe our ſpirituall evils, an evil that hath more refinedneſſe in it, and more colour for it; and hath deceived more people of integrity then the reſt, have done: for few have been catched with the former m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

A thing pretending more ſpiritually, then any

thing elſe: A Notion I hope, we all honour, wait, and hope for; that Jeſus Chriſt will have a time to ſet up his Reign in our hearts, by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing thoſe Corruptions, and luſts, and evils that are there, which reign now more in the world, then I hope, in due time they ſhall do; And when more falneſs of the Spirit is poured forth to ſubdue iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, then will the approach of that Glory be. The carnall diviſions, and contentions amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſo common, are not the ſymtoms of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But for men to entitle themſelves, upon this Principle, that they are the only men to rule Kingdoms, Govern Nations, and give Laws to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to determin of Property, and Liberty, and every thing elſe, upon ſuch a pretence as this is: Truly, they had need give clear manifeſtations of Gods preſence with them, before wiſe men will receive, or ſubmit to their Concluſions. Beſides, certainly though many of theſe men have good meanings, as I hope in my ſoul they have, yet it will be the wiſdom of all knowing and experienced Chriſtians to do as <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, (when he had reckoned up thoſe horrible things done upon pretences, and haply by ſome upon miſtakes,) <hi>Of ſome,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>have compaſſion, making a difference; others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> (I fear they will give opportunity too often for this Exerciſe,) and I hope the ſame will be for their good.</p>
            <p>If men do but pretend for juſtice and righteouſneſs; and be of peaceable ſpirits; and will manifeſt this; let them be the ſubjects of the Magiſtrates encouragement. And if the Magiſtrate by puniſhing viſible miſcarriages, ſave them by that Diſcipline; (God having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him for that end,) I hope it will evidence love, and no hatred, to puniſh where there is cauſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed this is that which doth moſt declare the danger of that ſpirit; for if theſe were but Notions, I mean the inſtances that I have given you both of Civil conſiderations and Spiritual; if I ſay they were but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they were to be let alone. Notions will hurt none but them that have them. But when they come to ſuch practiſes, as to tell us, that Liberty and Property, are not the Badges of the Kingdom of Chriſt; and tell us, that inſtead of regulating Laws, Laws are to be abrogated, indeed ſubverted; and perhaps would bring in the Judiciall Law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of our known Laws ſettled amongſt us: This is worthy of every Magiſtrates conſideration: eſpecially where every ſtone is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring confuſion. I think, I ſay, this will be worthy of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:137201:5"/>Whilſt theſe things were in the midſt of us; and the Nation rent and torn in Spirit, and Principle, from one end to another, after this ſort and manner I have now told you; Family againſt Family; Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band againſt Wife; Parents againſt Children; and nothing in the hearts and minds of men, but over-turning, over-turning, over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: (A Scripture very much abuſed, and applied to juſtifie unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able practices, by all men of diſcontented ſpirits) The Common Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary in the mean time he ſleeps not, and our Adverſaries in Civil, and Spirituall reſpects, did take advantages at theſe Diviſions, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and did practiſe accordingly in the three Nations, of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know very well, that Emiſſaries of the Jeſuites never came in thoſe ſwarms, as they have done ſince theſe things were ſet on foot. And I tell you, that divers Gentlemen here, can bear witneſs with me, how that they have had a Conſiſtory abroad, that rules all the affairs of things in <hi>England,</hi> from an Arch Biſhop, with other Dependants upon him. And they had fixed in <hi>England</hi> (of which we are able to produce the particular Inſtruments in moſt of the Limits of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,) an Epiſcopall power, with Arch-Deacons, &amp;c. And had perſons authorized to exerciſe and diſtribute thoſe things, who pervert and deceive the people. And all this while, we were in this ſad, and, as I ſaid, deplorable condition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time all endeavours poſſible were uſed to hinder the work in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Progreſs of the Work of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by continuall Intelligences, and correſpondencies, both at home and abroad; from hence into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and from hence into <hi>Scotland,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſtirred up, and encouraged from theſe Diviſions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of affairs, to do all they could to encourage, and foment the War in both theſe places.</p>
            <p>To adde yet to our miſery; whilſt we were in this Condition, we were in War, deeply engaged in a War with the <hi>Portugal</hi>; whereby our Trade ceaſed, and the evil Conſequences by that War, were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and very Conſiderable.</p>
            <p>And not only this, but we had a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> conſuming our Treaſure; occaſioning a vaſt burthen upon the people. A War that coſt this Nation full as much as the Taxes came unto; The Navy being one hundred and ſixty Ships; which coſt this Nation above one hundred thouſand pounds a moneth, beſides the Contingencies; which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137201:6"/>
would make it fixſcore thouſand pounds a moneth. That very one War did engage us to ſo great a charge.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time alſo we were in a War with <hi>France.</hi> The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that were taken at the diſcontents, and diviſions among our ſelves, did alſo foment that War; and at leaſt hinder us of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace; every man being confident we could not hold out long. And ſurely they did not calculate amiſs, if the Lord had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding gracious to us.</p>
            <p>I ſay at the ſame time we had a War with <hi>France.</hi> And beſides. the ſufferings, in reſpect of the Trade of the Nation; it's moſt evident, that the purſe of the Nation had not been poſſibly able longer to bear it; by reaſon of the advantages taken by other States, to improve the'r own; and ſpoil our Manufacture of cloth, and hinder the vent thereof; which is the great Staple Commodity of this Nation.</p>
            <p>This was our condition: ſpoyl'd in our Trade; and we at this vaſt expence; thus diſſettled at home; and haying theſe engagements abroad.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus; (as I am perſwaded it is not hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every perſon here, they were thus,) What a heap of Confuſions were upon theſe poor Nations? And either things muſt have been left to have ſunk into the miſeries theſe premiſes would ſuppoſe, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy muſt be applied.</p>
            <p>A remedy hath been applied: That hath been this Government: A thing that I ſhall ſay little unto. The thing is open and viſible to be ſeen and read by all men; and therefore let it ſpeak for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Only let me ſay this, becauſe I can ſpeak it with comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, before a greater then you all; that is, before the Lord, That in the intention of it, as to the approving our hearts to God, let men judge as they pleaſe: It is calculated for the Intereſt of the people: for the intereſt of the people alone: and for their good, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to any other intereſt. And if that be not true, I ſhall be bold to ſay again, let it fpeak for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Truely, I may (I hope humbly before God, and modeſtly before you) ſay ſomewhat on the behalf of the Government: That is, (not to diſcourſe of the particular heads of it,) to acquaint you a little with the effects of it: and that not for oftentation ſake, but to the end that I may deal at this time faithfully with you, by acquainting you with the ſtate of things; and what proceedings have been upon this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:137201:6"/>
Government; that ſo you may know the ſtate of our affairs. This is the main end of my putting you to this trouble.</p>
            <p>It hath had ſome things in deſire. And it hath done ſome things actually. It hath deſired to reform the Laws, to reform them; and for that end, it hath called together perſons (without reflection) of as great ability, and as great integrity as are in theſe Nations, to conſider how the Laws might be made plain and ſhort, and leſſe chargeable to the people; how to leſſen expence for the good of the Nation, and thoſe things are in preparation, and Bills prepared, which in due time I make no queſtion will be tendered to you. There hath been care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to put the Adminiſtration of the Laws into the hands of juſt men; men of the moſt known Integrity and Ability.</p>
            <p>The Chancery hath been reformed; and I hope to the juſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all good men. And the things depending there, which made the burthen and work of the honourable perſons intruſted in thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, beyond their Ability; It hath referred many of them to thoſe places where <hi>Engliſh</hi> men love to have their rights tryed, the Courts of Law at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath endeavoured to put a ſtop to that heady way (touched of likewiſe this day) of every man making himſelf a Miniſter, and a Preacher. It hath endeavoured to ſettle a way for the approbation of men of Piety and Ability for the diſcharge of that work. And I think I may ſay, It hath committed that work to the truſt of perſons both of the Presbyterian and Independent judgements, men of as known Ability, Piety, and Integrity, as I believe any this Nation hath. And I beleeve alſo, that in that care they have taken, they have laboured to approve themſelves to Chriſt, the Nation, and their own Conſciences. And indeed I think if there be any thing of quarrel againſt them, it is, (though I am not here to juſtifie the proceedings of any) I ſay it is, that they go upon ſuch a Character as the Scripture warrants, to put men into that great Imployment; and to approve men for it, who are men that have received gifts from him that aſcended up on high, and gave gifts for the work of the Miniſtry, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It hath taken care, we hope, for the expulſion of all thoſe who may be judged any way unfit for this Work; who are ſcandalous, and who are the common ſcorn and contempt of that Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>One thing more this Government hath done. It hath been Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:137201:7"/>
to call a free Parliament: which, bleſſed be God, we ſee here this day: I ſay a free Parliament. And that it may continue ſo, I hope is in the heart and ſpirit of every good man in <hi>England,</hi> ſave ſuch diſconted perſons as I have formerly mentioned. It is that which as I have deſired above my life, I ſhall deſire to keep it ſo, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove my life.</p>
            <p>I did before mention to you the plunges we were in, in reſpect of Forreigne States; by the War with <hi>Portugal, France,</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi>; and the little aſſurance we had from any of our Neighbours round about. I perhaps forgot it, but indeed it was a Caution upon my minde, and I deſire that it might be ſo underſtood; That if any good hath been done, it was the Lord, nor we his poor Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>I did inſtance in the Wars which did exhauſt your Treaſure; and put you into ſuch a Condition, that you muſt have ſunk therein, if it had continued but a few moneths longer. This I dare affirm, if ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability can give me a ground.</p>
            <p>You have now (though it be not the firſt in time) peace with <hi>Sweathland</hi>; an honourable peace, through the endeavours of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſon here preſent, as the Inſtrument; I ſay you have an honourable Peace with a Kingdom that not many years ſince was much a friend to <hi>France</hi>; and lately perhaps inclineable enough to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</hi> And I believe you expect not very much good from any of your Catholick Neighbours: nor yet that they would be very willing you ſhould have a good underſtanding with your Proteſtant friends. Yet thanks be to God that peace is concluded; and as I ſaid before, it is an honourable Peace.</p>
            <p>You have a Peace with the <hi>Dane</hi>: A State that lay contiguous to that part of this Iſland which hath given us the moſt trouble. And certainly if your enemies abroad be able to annoy you, it is likely they will take their advantage where it beſt lies to give you trouble there. But you have a Peace there; and an honourable one: Satisfaction for your Merchant Ships, not only to their content, but to their rejoycing. I believe you will eaſily know it is ſo.</p>
            <p>You have the <hi>Sound</hi> open, which was obſtructed. That which was, and is the ſtrength of this Nation, the Shipping will now be ſupplyed thence. And whereas you were glad to have any thing of that kinde at the ſecond hand, &amp;c. You have all manner of Commerce, and at as much freedom as the <hi>Dutch</hi> themſelves there, and at the ſame Rates
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:137201:7"/>
and Toll; and I think I may ſay, by that Peace, they cannot raiſe the ſame upon you.</p>
            <p>You have a Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi>; a Peace unto which I ſhal1 ſay little; becauſe ſo well known in the benefit and conſequences of it. And I think it was as deſirable and as acceptable to the ſpirit of this Nation as any one thnig that lay before us. And, as I believe, nothing ſo much gratified our enemies as to ſee us at odds; ſo, I perſwade my ſelf nothing is of more terrour nor trouble to them, then to ſee us thus reconciled.</p>
            <p>As a Peace with the Proteſtant States hath much ſecurity in it; ſo it hath as much of honour, and of aſſurance to the Proteſtant Intereſt abroad, without which no aſſiſtance can be given thereunto. I wiſh it may be written upon our hearts to be zealous for that Intereſt: for if ever it were like to come under a condition of ſuffering it is now.</p>
            <p>In all the Emperours Patrimoniall Territories, the endeavour is, to drive them out as faſt as they can. And they are neceſſitated to run to Proteſtant States to ſeek their bread. And by this conjunction of Intereſts I hope you will be in a more fit capacity to help them. And it begets ſome reviving of their ſpirits that you will help them as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhall ſerve. You have a Peace likewiſe with the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which Peace though it hung long in hand; yet is lately concluded. It is a Peace that your Metchants make us beleeve is of good concernment to their Trade; their aſſurance being greater, and ſo their profit in Trade thither, then to other places. And this hath been obtained in that Treaty; (which never was ſince the Inquiſition was ſer up there,) That our People which Trade thither have liberty of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>(Indeed Peace is as you were well told to day) deſirable with all men, as far as it my be had with Conſcience and Honour.</p>
            <p>We are upon a Treaty with <hi>France.</hi> And we may ſay this, That if God give us Honour in the eyes of the Nations about us, we have raſon to bleſſe him for it, and ſo to own it. And I dare ſay that there is not a Nation in Europe, but they are very willing to ask a good underſtanding with you.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry I am thus tedious; but I did judge that it was ſomwhat neceſſary to acquaint you with theſe things. And things being thus, I hope you will be willing to hear a little again of the ſharp, as well as the ſweet. And I ſhould not be faithfull to you, nor to the Intereſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137201:8"/>
theſe Nations which you and I ſerve, if I ſhould not let you know all.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, when this Government was under taken, we were in the midſt of theſe Diviſions, and Animoſities, and ſcatterings; Alſo thus engaged with theſe Enemies round about us; at ſuch a vaſt Charge; Sixſcore thouſand Pounds a moneth for the very Fleet; (which was the very utmoſt penny of your Aſſeſſments) I, and then all your Treaſure was exhauſted and ſpent, when this Government was under-taken; ALL accidentall wayes of bringing in Treaſure, to a very inconſiderable Summe conſumed; That is to ſay, the Lands are ſold, the Treaſures ſpent; Rents, Fee-farms, Kings, Queens, Princes, Biſhops, Dean and Chapters, Delinquents Lands ſold. Theſe were ſpent when this Government was under-taken.</p>
            <p>I think it is my duty to let you know ſo much. And that's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Taxes do yet lie ſo heavy upon the People, of which we have abated thirty thouſand Pounds a moneth, for the next three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. Truly, I thought it my duty to let you know, that though God hath dealt thus with you, yet theſe are but entrances and doors of hope, wherein through the bleſſing of God you may cuter into Reſt and Peace. But you are not yet entered.</p>
            <p>You were told to day of a People brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> towards the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; but through unbelief, murmuring, repining, and other temptations and ſins, wherewith God was provoked, they were fain to come back again, and linger many years in the Wilderneſs, before they came to the place of Reſt.</p>
            <p>We are thus far through the mercy of God. We have cauſe to take notice of it, that we are not brought into miſery; But as I ſaid before, A door of hope open. And I may ſay this to you, If the Lords bleſſing and his preſence go along with the management of Affairs at this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will be inabled to put the Top-ſtone to this Work, and make the Nation happy. But this muſt be by knowing the true ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, that you are yet like the People under Circumciſion, but Raw, your Peaces are but newly made. And it is a maxime not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, Though Peace be made, yet it is Intereſt that keeps Peace. And I hope you will truſt it no further then you ſee Intereſt upon it. And therefore I wiſh that you may go forward, and not backward, and that you may have the bleſſings of God upon your endeavours. I'ts one of the great ends of calling this Parliament, that this Ship of the Common-Wealth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:137201:8"/>
may be brought into a ſafe Harbour: which I aſſure you it will not well be, without your Counſeil and Advice.</p>
            <p>You have great works upon your hands. You have <hi>Ireland</hi> to look unto, there is not much done towards the Planting of it: though ſome things leading and preparing for it are. It is a great buſineſſe to ſetele the Government of that Nation upon fit Terms, ſuch as will bear that Work through.</p>
            <p>Yot have had I kewiſe laid before you the conſiderations intimating your Peace with ſome Forreign Status; but yet you have not made Peace with all. And if they ſhould ſee we do not manage our Affairs as With that Wiſdom which becomes us, truly we may ſink under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages for all that's done; And our Enemies will have their eyes open, and be revived, if they ſee Animoſities amongſt us; which indeed will be their great advantage.</p>
            <p>I do therefore perfwade you to a ſweet, gracious, and holy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of one another, and of your buſineſs, concerning which you had ſo good Cousſell this day; that indeed, as it rejoyced my heart to hear it, ſo I hope the Lord will imprint it upon your ſpirits, wherein you ſhall have my prayers.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long ſince I met you in this place, upon an occaſion which gave me much more content and comfort then this doth.</p>
            <p>That which I have to ſay to you now, will need no Preamble to let me in to my Diſcourſe: For the occaſion of this Meeting is plain enough, I could have wiſhed with all my heart there had been no cauſe for it.</p>
            <p>At that Meeting I did acquaint you what the firſt Riſe was of this Government which hath call'd you hither, and in the Authority of which you came hither.</p>
            <p>Among other things that I told you of then, I ſaid you were a free Parliament: And ſo you are whilſt you own the Government and Authority that call'd you hither. For certainly that word implyed a <hi>Reciprocation,</hi> or it implyed nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was a Reciprocation implied and expreſſed: and I think your actions and carriages ought to be ſuitable.</p>
            <p>But I ſee it will be neceſſary for me now, a little to magnifie my Office, which I have not been apt to do. I have been of this minde, I have been alwayes of this minde ſince firſt I entered upon it, That if God will not bear it up, let it ſink. But if a Duty be incumbent upon me, ro bear my Teſtimony unto it, (which in modeſty I have hitherto forborn) I am in ſome meaſure now neceſſitated thereunto. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that will be the Prologue to my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I call'd not my ſelf to this place; I ſay again, I call'd not my ſelf to this place; of that God is Witneſſe. And I have many Witneſſes, who I do beleeve could readily lay down their lives to bear Witneſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137201:9"/>
to the truth of that: that is to ſay, that I call'd not my ſelf to this place. And being in it, I bear not Witneſſe to my ſelf: But God and the people of theſe Nations have born Teſtimony to it alſo.</p>
            <p>If my Cilling be from God, and my Teſtimony from the People; God ard the people ſhall take it from me, elſe I will not part with it. I ſhould be falſe to the Truſt that God hath plac'd upon me, and to the Intereſt of the People of theſe Nations, if I ſhould.</p>
            <p>That I call'd not my ſelf to this place, is my firſt Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>That I bear not witneſſe to my ſelf, but have many Witneſſes is my ſecond.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the two things I ſhall take the liberty to ſpeak more fully to you of.</p>
            <p>To make plain and clear that which I have ſaid, I muſt take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to look back,</p>
            <p>I was by birth a Gentleman, living neither in any conſiderable height, nor yet in obſcurity: I have been call'd to ſeverall imployments in the Nation: to ſerve in Prliaments: And (becauſe I would not be over tedious) I did endeavour to diſcharge the duty of an honeſt man in thoſe ſervices, to God, and his peoples Intereſt, and of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; having, when time was; a competent acceptation in the hearts of men, and ſome evidences thereof. I reſolve not to recite the Times and Occaſions, and Opportunities that have been appointed me by God to ſerve him in: nor the preſence and bleſſings of God bearing then Teſtimony to me.</p>
            <p>I having had ſome occaſions to ſee (together with my Brethren and Countrey-men) a happy period put to our ſharp Wars and Conteſts with the them common enemy, hoped in a private capacity to have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fruit, and benefit together with my Brethren, of our hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and hazards; to wit, the enjoyment of Peace and Liberty, and the Priviledges of a Chriſtian, and of a man, in ſome equality with others, according as it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to diſpence unto me.</p>
            <p>And when I ſay, God had put an end to our Wars, at leaſt brought them to a very hopefull iſſue very near an end, (after <hi>worceſter</hi> Fight) I came up to <hi>London</hi> to pay my ſervice, and duty to the Parliament that then ſate; and hoping that all mindes would have been diſpoſed to anſwer that which ſeemed to be the mind of God, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to give peare and reſt to his people; and eſpecially to thoſe who had bled more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137201:10"/>
then others in the carrying on of the Military Affairs, I was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of my expectation: For the iſſue did not prove ſo, what ever may be boaſted, or miſ-repreſented, it was not ſo, nor ſo.</p>
            <p>I can ſay in the ſimplicity of my ſoul, I love nOt, I love not, (I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined it in my former ſpeech) I ſay, I love not to rake into fores, or to diſcover nakedneſles. That which I drive at, is this; I ſay to you, I hoped to have had leave to have retired to a private life: I begg'd to be diſmiſſed of my Charge: I begg'd it again and again. And God be Judge between me and all men if lie in this matter. That I lie not in matter of faſt, is known to very many; but whether I tell a l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in my heart, as labouring to repreſent to you that which was not upon my heart, I ſay the Lord be Judge: let uncharitable men that meaſure others by themſelves, judge as they pleaſe. As to the matter of fact, I ſay it is true. As to the ingenuity and integrity of my heart in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, I do appeal, as before, upon the truth of that alſo: But I could not obtain what my ſoul longed for. And the plain truth is, I did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards apprehend, that ſome did think my judgement not ſuiting with theirs) that it could not well be. But this I ſay to you, was between God and my ſoul, between me and that Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe I am in ſome ſtrait, to ſay what I could ſay, and what is true of what then followed.</p>
            <p>I preſſed the Parliament, as a Member, to period themſelves, once and again, and again, and ten, and twenty times over. I told them (for I knew it better then any one man in the Parliament could know it, becauſe of my manner of life, which was to run up and down the Nation, and ſo might ſee and know the temper and ſpirits of all men, the beſt of men) that the Nation loathed their ſitting: I knew it. And ſb far as I could diſcern, when they were diſſolved, there was not ſo much as the barking of a dog, or any generall and viſible repining at it. You are not a few here preſent that can aſſert this as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And that there was high cauſe for their Diſſolving, is moſt evident, not only in regard there was a juſt fear of the Parliaments perpetuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; but becauſe it was their deſign. And had not their heels been trod upon by importunities from abroad, even to threats, I believe there would never have been thoughts of Riſing, or of going out of that Room to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>I my ſelf was ſounded; and by no mean perſons tempted; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes were made to me to that very end, that it might have been thus
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:137201:10"/>
perpetuated, That the vacant places might be ſupplied by new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo continue fiom Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p>I have declined, I have declined very much to open theſe things to you: yet having proceeded thus far, I muſt tell you, that poor men under this Arbitrary Power, were driven like flocks of ſheep, by fourty in a morning, to the Confiſcation of Goods and Eſtatus, without any man being able to give a reaſon that two of them had deſerved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a ſhilling. I tell you the truth, and my ſoul and many perſon, whoſe faces I ſee in this place were exceedingly grieved at theſe things, and knew not which way to help it, but by their mournings, and giving their negatives when occaſions ſerved.</p>
            <p>I have given you but a taſt of miſcarriages. I am confident you have had opportunities to hear much more of them: for nothing is more obvious. It's true, this will be ſaid, That there was a remedy to put an end to this perpetuall Parliament endeayoured, by having a future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative. How it was gotten, and by what importunities that was obtained, and how unwillingly yielded unto, is well known.</p>
            <p>What was this remedy? It was a ſeeming willingneſs to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Parliaments. What was that Succeſſion? it was, that when one Parliament had left their Seat, another was to ſit down immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the room thereof, without any Caution to avoid that which was the danger; (<hi>viz.</hi>) Perpetuating of the ſame Parliaments; which is a ſore now that will ever be running, ſo long as men are ambitious and troubleſom, if a due remedy be not found. So then, What was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; It was a Converſion from Parliament that ſhould have been, and was perpetuall, to a Legiſlative Power, alwaies ſitting: and ſo the Liberties, and Intereſts, and Lives of People, not judged by any certain known Laws and Power, but by an Arbitrary Power, which is incident and neceſſary to Parliaments by an Arbytrary Power: I ſay, to make mens eſtates liable to confiſcation, and their perſons to impriſonments; ſometimes by Laws made after the fact committed: often by takirg the judgement both in capital and criminal things to themſelves, who in former times were not known to exerciſe ſuch a Judicature.</p>
            <p>This I ſuppoſe was the caſe; and in my opinion the remedy was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the diſeaſe: eſpecially coming in the Rear of a Parliament, ſo cx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the Power and Authority as this had done, but immediatly before.</p>
            <p>Truly, I confeſs upon theſe grounds, and with the ſatisfaction of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:137201:11"/>
divers other Perſons, ſeeing nothing could be had otherwiſe; that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was diſſolv'd, we deſiring to ſee if a few might have been call'd together for ſome ſhort time, who might put the Nation into ſome way of certain ſettlement, did call thoſe Gentlemen out of the ſeveral parts of the Nation for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And, as I have appealed to God before you already, I know (and I hope I may ſay it,) though it be a tender thing to make appeals to God; yet in ſuch exigenc es as theſe, I truſt it will not offend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, eſpecially to make them before Perſons that know God, and know what Conſcience is, and what it is to lie before the Lord. I ſay, that as a principal ead in calling that Aſembly, was the ſettlement of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo a chief end to my ſelf was, That I might have opportunity to lay down the Power that was in my hands, I ſay to you again, in the preſence of that God, who hath bleſſed and been with me in all my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities and ſucceſſes, that waas to my ſelf my greateſt end. A deſire perhaps (and I am afraid) ſinful1 enough, to be quit of the power God had moſt providentially put into my hand, before he called for it; and before thoſe honeſt ends of our fighting were attained and ſettled. I ſay, the authority I had in my hand, being ſo boundleſs as it was, I being by Act of Parliament Generall of all the force in the three Nations, of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (In which unlimitted condition I did not deſire to live a day) did call that meeting for the ends before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>What the event and iſſue of that meeting was, we may ſadly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It hath much teaching in it; and I hope will make us all wiſer for the future.</p>
            <p>But this meettig ſucceeding, as I have formerly ſaid to you, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch a diſappointment to our hopes, I ſhall not now make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition thereof; only the effect was, That they came and brought to me a parchment ſigned by very much the major part of them, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their reſigning and re-delivery of the Power and Authority that was committed to them, back again into my hands: and I can ſay it in the preſence of divers perſons here, that do know whether I lie in that; that I did not know one tittle of that reſignaton, untill they all came and brought it, and delivered it into my hands: of this there are alſo in this preſence many witneſſes.</p>
            <p>I received this reſignation, having Formerly uſed my endeavours and perſwaſions to keep them together; obſerving their differences, I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:137201:11"/>
thought it my duty to give advices to them, that ſo I might prevail with them for union: But it had the effect that I told you: and I had my diſappointment.</p>
            <p>When this was ſo, we were exceedingly to ſeek how to ſettle things for the future. My power again by this reſignation, was as boundleſs and unlimited as before; all things being ſubjected to Arbitrarineſs, and a perſon having power over the three Nations boundleſsly, and unlimited; And upon the matter all Government diſſolved, all Civill Adminiſtrations at an end; as will preſently be made appear.</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen that undertook to frame this Government, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult divers dayes together, (they being of known Integrity and ability) how to frame ſomwhat that might give us ſettlement; and they did ſo: and that I was not privy to their Councels, they know it.</p>
            <p>When they had finiſhed their modell in ſome meaſure, or made a very good preparation of it, it became Communicative. They told me that except I would undertake the Government, they thought things would hardly come to a Compoſure and Settlement; but blood and confuſion would break in upon us. I denied it again and again, as God and thoſe perſons know, not complementingly as they alſo know, and as God knows.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, after many Arguments, and after the letting of me know that I did not receive any thing that put me into any higher Capacity then I was in before, but that it limited me, and bound my hands to act nothing to the prejud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of the Nations, without conſent of a Councell untill the Parliament; and then limited by the Parliament, as the Act of Government expreſſeth, I did accept it.</p>
            <p>I might repeat this again to you if it were needfull, but I think I need not. I was arbitrary in Power, having the Armies in the three Nations under my command: and truly not very ill beloved by them; nor very ill beloved then by the people, by the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and I believe I ſhould have been more beloved if they had known the truth, as things were before God, and in themſelves; and before divers of theſe Gentlemen whom I but now mentioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>I did, at the intreaty of divers perſons of honour and quality; at thein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of very many of the chief Officers of the Army then preſent, and at their requeſt, I did accept of the place, and title of Protector, and was in the preſence of the Commiſſioners of the Seal, the Judges, the Lord
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137201:12"/>
Major and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Souldierie, divers Gentlemen, Citizens, and divers other people, and perſons of quality, &amp;c accompanied to <hi>Weſt minster-Hall,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e I took my oath to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This was not done in a corner: it was open and publick.</p>
            <p>This Government hath bin exerciſed by a Councel, with a deſire to be faithfull in all things; and amongſt all other truſts, to be faithfull in calling this Parliament.</p>
            <p>And thus I have given you a very bare and lean diſcourſe; which truely I have been neceſſitated unto, and contracted in, becauſe of the unexpectedneſſe of the occaſion; and becauſe I would not quite weary you nor my ſelf. But this is a Narrative that diſcovers to you the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Providence, and of Tranſactions leading me into this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein I now ſtand.</p>
            <p>The next thing I promiſed you, wherein I hope I ſhall not be ſo long, (though I am ſure this occaſion does require plainneſſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) is, That as I brought not my ſelf into this Condition, (as in my own apprehenſion I did not; and that I did not, (the things being true which I have told you) I ſubmit it to your Judgements, and there ſhall I leave it, let God do what he pleaſeth.) The other things I ſay that I am to ſpeak to you of, is, That I have not, nor do not bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to my ſelf I am far from alluding to him that ſaid ſo; yet truth concerning a member of his he will own, though men do not.</p>
            <p>But I think (if I miſtake not) I have a cloud of witneſſes. I think ſo, let men be as froward as they will: I have witneſſe within, without, and above. But I ſhall ſpeak of them that are without, having fully ſpoken before of the witneſſe above, and the witneſſe in my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, upon the other Account; becauſe that ſubject had more obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in it, and I in ſome ſort needed appeals; and I truſt might lawfully make them, as well as take an oath, where things were not ſo apt to be made evident. I ſhall enumetate my witneſſes as well as I can.</p>
            <p>When I had conſented to accept of the Government, there was ſome ſolemnity to be performed; and that was accompanied with ſome perſons of conſiderableneſſe in all reſpects, who were the perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſed, who accompanied me at the time of my entring upon this Government to <hi>weſt minſter</hi> Hall to take my oath.</p>
            <p>There was an explicite conſent of Intereſſed perſons, and an implicite conſent of many, ſhewing their good liking and approbation thereof. And (Gentlemen) I do not think that you are altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:137201:12"/>
to it in your Country: ſome did not nauſeate it: very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did approve it.</p>
            <p>I had the approbation of the Officers of the Army in the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſay of the Officers, I had that by their Remonſtrances, and under ſignature: There was went along With that explicite conſent, an implicite conſent of perſons that had ſomewhat to do in the World, that had been inſtrumentall by God to ſight down the enemes of God and his people, in the three Nations And truly, untill my hands were bound, and I limited, (wherein I took full contentment, as many can bear me witneſſe,) when I had in my hands ſo great a power and Arbitrarineſſe, the Souldiery were a very conſiderable part of the Nations, eſpecially all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being diſſolved: I ſay, when all Government was thus diſſolved, and nothing to keep things in order but the Sword, and yet they (which many Hiſtories will not parallel) even they were deſirous that things might come to a Conſiſtency, and Arbirrarineſs might be taken away, and the Government put into a perſon (limited and bounded, as in the Act of Settlement) whom they deſtruſted the leaſt, and loved not the worſt: this was another evidence.</p>
            <p>I would not forget the honourable and civill entertainment, with the approbation I found in the great City of <hi>London</hi>; which the City knows whether I directly or indirectly ſought. And truely I do not think it is folly to remember this: For it was very great and high, and very publick; and as numerous a Body of thoſe that are known by names, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ttles, (the ſeverall Corporations and Societies of Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in this City, as hath been at any time ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> and not without ſome appearance of ſatisfaction alſo.</p>
            <p>I had not onely this witneſſe, but I have had from the greateſt County in <hi>England,</hi> and from many Cities and Boroughs, and many Counties, explicit Approbations, not of thoſe gathered here and there, but from the County of <hi>York</hi> and City of <hi>York,</hi> and other Counties and Places aſſembled in their publick and generall Aſſizes, the Grand-Jury in the name of the Noblemen, Gentlemen, Yeomen, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that County, giving very great thanks to me for under-taking this heavy Berden at ſuch a time, and giving very great Approbation and incouragement to me to go through with it. Theſe are plain. I have them to ſhew. And by theſe in ſome meaſure it will appear, I do not bear witneſs to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:137201:13"/>This is not all: the Judges, (and truly I had almoſt forgotten it.) they thinking that there was a diſſolution of Government, met and conſulted, and did declare one to another, that they could not admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Juſtice to the ſatisfaction of their conſciences, untill they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Commiſſions from me: And they did receive Commiſſions from me. And by vertue of thoſe Commiſſions they have acted. And all the Juſtices of the Peace that have acted, have acted by vertue of like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, which was a little more then an implicit Approbation. And I believe, all the Juſtice adminiſtred in the Nation, hath been by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which alſo I lay before you, deſiring you to think, whether all theſe Perſons before-mentioned, muſt not come before you for an Act of Oblivion and Generall Pardon, who have acted under, and teſtified to this Government, if it be diſ-owned by you.</p>
            <p>I have two or three witneſſes more, equivalent to all theſe I have reckoned, if I be not miſtaken, and greatly miſtaken, If I ſhould ſay, All you that are here are my Witneſſes, I ſhould ſay no untruth. I know you are the ſame perſons here that you were in the Countrey. But I will reſerve to ſpeak to this at the laſt, for this will be the iſſue of my Speech: I ſay, I have two or three Witneſſes that are more then all I have accounted and reckoned before.</p>
            <p>All the People in <hi>England</hi> are my Witneſſes, and many in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>: All the Sheriffs in <hi>England</hi> are my Witneſſes, and all that came in upon the Proceſs iſſued out by the Sheriffs, are my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Yea, the Returns of the Elections to the Clerk of the Crown, not a thing to be blown away with a breath, the Returns on the behalf of the Inhabitants in the Counties, Cities and Boroughs, all are my Witneſſes of Approbation to the condition and place I ſtand in.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall now make you my laſt Witneſſes, and ask you whether you came not hither by my Writs directed to the ſeverall Sheriffs? And ſo to other Officers in Cities and Liberties, to which the People gave obedience, having alſo had the Act of Government communicated to them, to which end great numbers of Copies were ſent down on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be communicated to them; And the Government alſo required to be diſtinctly read unto the People at the place of Elections, to avoid ſurprizes, where alſo they ſigned the Indenture, with proviſo, That the perſons ſo choſen, ſhall not have power to alter the Government, as it is now ſettled, in one ſingle Perſon and a Parliament.</p>
            <p>And thus I have made good my ſecond Aſſertion, That I bear not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:137201:13"/>
witneſs to my ſelf; but the good people of <hi>England,</hi> and you all are my witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Yea ſurely, And this being ſo, though I told you in my laſt Speech, that you were a free Parliament; yet I thought it was underſtood, that I was the Protector, and the Authority that called you, and that I was in poſſeſſion of the Government by a good Right from God and men. And, I beheve, if the learnedſt men in this Nation were called to to ſhaw a Preſident ſo clear, ſo many wayes approving of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they would not in all their ſearch finde it.</p>
            <p>I did not in my other ſpeech to you take upon me to juſtifie. the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in every particular; and I told you the reaſon of it; which was plain. It was publick; and had been long publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap>ed, and it might be under the moſt ſerious inſpection of all that pleaſed to peruſe it.</p>
            <p>By what I have ſaid, I have approved my ſelf to God, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in my actions; and in this undertaking. And I have given cauſe of approving my ſelf to every one of your conſciences in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, why ſhould we ſport with it? with a buſineſs thus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? May not this Character, this ſtamp bear equall Poyze with iany hereditary Intereſt, which may have, and hath had in the common Law, matters of Diſpute, and Tryall of learning? wherein many have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed more W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and ſpilt more blood then I hope ever to live to ſee, or hear of in this Nation.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I do not know why I may not balance this providence, as in the ſight of God, with any hereditary Intereſt, as being leſs ſubject to thoſe Cracks and Flaws they are commonly incident unto. Which Titles have coſt more blood in former times in this Nation then we have leiſure to ſpeak of now.</p>
            <p>Now if this be thus, and I am deriving a Title from God and men, upon ſuch Accounts as theſe are: Although ſom men be froward, yet that your judgements that are Perſons ſent from all parts of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Notion of acceptance of the Government, for yon to diſown, or not to own it; for you to act Parliamentary Authority, eſpecially in the diſowning of it; contrary to the very fundamentall things; yea, againſt the very root it ſelf of this Eſtabliſhment; to ſit and not own the Authority by which you ſit, is that that I believe aſtoniſheth more men then my ſelf; and doth as dangerouſly diſappoint and diſcompoſe the Nation, as any thing could have been invented by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:137201:14"/>
the greateſt enemy to our peace and welfare; or could well have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
            <p>It is true, there are ſome things in the Eſtabliſhment that are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and ſome things are not ſo, but are Circumſtantial. Of ſuch, no queſtion but I ſhall eaſily agree to vary, or leave out, as I ſhall be convinced by reaſon. Some things are Fundamentals, about which I ſhall deal plainly with you, they may not be parted with; but will (I truſt) be delivered over to Poſterity, as being the fruits of our Blood and Travel.</p>
            <p>The Government by a ſingle Perſon and a Parliament, is a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; It is the <hi>Eſſe.</hi> It is Conſtitutive. And for the preſon, though I may ſeem to plead for my ſelf, yet I do not, no nor can any reaſonable man ſay it. But if the things throughout this Speech be true, I plead for this Nation, and all honeſt men therein, who have born their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as aforſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and not for my ſelf. And if things ſhould do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, then well, which I would not fear; and the Common Enemy, and diſcontented perſons take advantage at theſe Diſtractions, the iſſue will be put up before God. Let him own, or let him diſown it, as he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>In every Government there muſt be ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>what Fundamentall, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that ſhould be ſtanding, and be unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Where there is a Stipulation on one Part, and that fully accepted, as appears by what hath been ſaid; ſurely a return ought to be: elſe what does that Stipulation ſignifie; If I have upon the Tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ms afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid undertaken this great Truſt, and Exerciſed it, and by it called you, ſurely it ought to be owned.</p>
            <p>That Parliaments ſhould not make themſelves Perpetuall, is a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals. Of what aſſurance is a Law to prevent ſo great an evil, if it lie in one or the ſame Legiſlator to unlaw it again? Is this like to be laſting? It will be like a Rope of Sand; it will give no ſecurity, For the ſame men may unbuild, what they have built.</p>
            <p>Is not Liberty of Conſcience in Religion a Fundamentall? ſo long as there is Liberty of Conſcience for the Supream Magiſtrate, to exerciſe his Conference in erecting what Form of Church Government he is ſatiſfied, he ſhould ſet up; why ſhould not he give it to others? Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience is a Naturall Right: and he that would have it ought to give it; having Liberty to ſettle what he likes for the Publick.</p>
            <p>Indeed that hath been one of the Vanities of our Conteſts. Every Sect ſaith, Oh! Give me Liberty. But give him it, and to his power
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:137201:14"/>
he will not yeeld it to any Body elſe. Where is our ingenuity? Truly that's a thing ought to be very Reciprocal. The Magiſtrate hath his Supremacy, and he may ſettle Religion according to his Conſcience. And I may ſay it to you: I can ſay it; all the Money of this Nation would not have tempted men to ſight, upon ſuch an Account as they have engaged, if they had not had hopes of Liberty, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter then they had from Epiſcopacy; or then would have been afforded them from a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Presbyterian, or an <hi>Engliſh</hi> either, if it had made ſuch ſteps, or been as ſharp and Rigid, as it threatened when it was firſt ſet up.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, is a Fundamentall. It ought to be ſo: it is for us, and the Generations to come. And if there be an abſoluteneſs in the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, without fitting allowances, and exceptions from the Rule, we ſhall have our People driven into Wilderneſſes; as they were when thoſe poor and aflicted People that forſock their eſtates and inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here, where they lived Pleat fully and comfortably, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Liberty, and were nece ſitated to go into a vaſt howling wilderneſs in <hi>New England,</hi> where they have for Liberty ſake ſtript themſelves of all their comfort, and the full enjoyment they had, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing rather lots of friends, and want, then to be ſo enſnared, and in Bondage.</p>
            <p>Another, which I had forgotten, is the <hi>Militia,</hi> that's Judged a Fundamental, if any thing be ſo. That it ſhould be well and equally placed, is very neceſſary: For, put the Abſolute Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into One without a Check, what doth it? I pray you, what doth your Check put upon your Perpetuall Parliaments, if it be wholly ſtript of this? It is equally Placed, and Deſires were to have it ſo (<hi>viz.</hi>) in one Perſon and the Parliament, ſitting the Parliament. What ſignifies a Proviſion againſt perpetuating of Parliaments, if this be ſolely in them? Whether without a Check the Parliament have not Liberty to, alter the Frame of Government, to Ariſtocraſie, to Democraſie, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, to any Thing, if this be fully in them? yea, into all Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that without Remedy, And if this One Thing he placed in One, that One, be it Parliament; be it Supreain Governour, They, or He hath Power to make what they pleaſe of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if you would have a Ballance at all, and that ſome Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals muſt ſtand, Which may be wortby to be delivered over to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, truly, I think, it is not unreaſonably urged, That the <hi>Militia</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed as it is laid down in the Government, and that it
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:137201:15"/>
ſhould be ſo equally placed, that one Perſon neither in Parliament nor out of Parliament, ſhould have the Power of Ordering it. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are the Truſtees or the Commonwealth, in all Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vals of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments who have as abſolute a Negative upon the Supream Officer in the ſaid Intervals, as the Parliament hath whilſt it is ſitting. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made uſe of: a man cannot be raiſed, nor a penny charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, nothing done without conſent of Parliament: and in the Intervals of Parliament, without Conſent of the Councill, it is not to be exerciſed.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to ſay, That there is very little Power, none but what is Co-ordinate in the Supream Officer, and yet enough in him that hath the Chief Government, in that particular he is bound in ſtrictneſſe by the Parliament, out of Parliament by the Councill, that do as abſolutely binde him, as the Parliament; when the Parliament is ſitting.</p>
            <p>For that of Money, I told you ſome things are Circumſtantials. To have Two hundred thouſand pounds to defray Civill Officers, to pay the Judges and other Officers, defraying the Charges of the Councill in ſending their Embaſſies, in keeping Intelligence, and doing that that's neceſſary, and for ſupporting the Governour in Chief. All this is by the Inſtrument ſuppoſed and intended. But it is not of the <hi>Eſſe</hi> to much, and ſo limited, as ſo many Souldiers, 30000. twenty thouſand Foot, and Ten Thouſand Horſe. If the ſpirits of men be compoſed, five thouſand Houſe, and ten thouaſnd Foot may ſerve. Theſe things are between the Chief Officer and the Parliament to be moderated as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
            <p>So there are many other Circumſtantiall things, which are not like the Laws of the Medes and Perſians. But the things which ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to deliver over to Poſterity, theſe ſhould be unalterable, elſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſucceeding Parliament will be diſputing to charge and alter the Government, and we ſhall be as often brought into confuſion, as we have Parliaments, and ſo make our Remedy our Diſeaſe The Lords Providence appearing Evils, appearing Good, and better Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will give occaſion for the ordering of things for the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the People. And thoſe Things are the Matter of Conſideration between you and me.</p>
            <p>I have indeed almoſt tired my ſelf. That I have further to ſay, is this, I Would it had not been needful for me to have called you hither to have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:137201:15"/>
expoſtulated theſe things with you, and in ſuch a manner as this is, but Neccſſity hath; no Law Feigned neceſſities, Imaginary neceſſities are the greatest Couſenage that men can put upon the Providence of God, and make pretences to break known Rules by. But it is as legal and as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and as Stupid, to think that there are no Neceſſities that are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Neceſſities, becauſe Neceſſities may be abuſed or feigned. And truly should be ſo, if I ſhould think ſo, and I hope none of you think ſo.</p>
            <p>I ſay, that the willfull throwings away of this Government, ſuch as it is, ſo owned by God, ſo approved by men, ſo teſtified to, in the Fundamentals of it, as is before mentioned, and that is Relat<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You have been called hither together to ſave a Nation;—Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You had the beſt; people indeed in the Chriſtian World in your Truſt, when you came hither. You had Affairs, and there Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to you in Peace and quietneſſe: You were, and we all were put into an uninterrupted Poſſeſſion, no body making Title to us. Through the bleſſing of God our enemies were hopeleſſe and ſcattered. We had Peace at houſe: Peace almoſt with all Neighbours round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: fit to take advantages where God did adminiſter them.</p>
            <p>To have our Peace and Intereſt, that had thoſe hopes the other day thus ſhaken, and under ſuch a confuſion; and we rendered hereby (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſcorn and contempt of thoſe ſtrangers that are amongſt us, to Negotiate their Maſters Affairs; To give them opportunity to ſee our nakedneſſe as they do, a People that have been unhinged this twelve years day, and un inged ſtill, as if ſcattering, diviſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion ſhould come upon us (as if it were deſired) which are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt plagues God ordinarily layes upon Nations for ſin: I would be loath to ſay, they are Matters of our delight; but if not, Why not the matter of our care, ſo wiſely as we ought by uttermoſt endeavours to avoid? Nay, when by ſuch Actions as theſe are, theſe poor Nations ſhall be thrown into heaps of Confuſion through blood, and ruine, and trouble, upon the ſaddeſt account that ever was, if breaking ſhould come upon us, and all becauſe we would not ſettle when we might, when God put it into our hands: Your Affairs now almoſt ſettled every where: And to have all recoyled upon us, and we our ſelves ſhaken in our Affections, looſened from all known and publick Intereſts,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:137201:16"/>
as I have mentioned to you: Who ſhal anſwer for theſe things to God? Who can anſwer for theſe things to God, or to Men? To the people that ſent you hither? who lookt for refreſhment from you, who lookt for nothing but Peace and Quietneſſe, and Reſt and Settlement. And when we ſhall come to give an Account to them, we ſhall be able to ſay; Oh! we have quarrelled for, and we conteſted for the Liberty of <hi>England.</hi> Wherein forſooth for the Liberty of the people? I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Lord, that the deſires and endeavours, and the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſpeak for themſelves; That the Liberty of <hi>England</hi>; The Liberty of the people, the avoiding of Tyranous Impoſitions, either upon men as men, or Chriſtians as Chriſtians, is made ſo ſafe by this Act of settlement, that it will ſpeak ſufficiently for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And when it ſhall appear what hath been ſaid, and done, and what our Tranſact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s have been: for God can diſcover, and no Priviledge will hinder the Lord from-diſcovering, no Priviledge or Condition of men can hide from the Lord: He can and wi1l make all manifeſt if he ſee it for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Glory. And when theſe ſhall by the Providence of God be manifeſted, and the people ſhall come and ſay Gentlemen, What condition are we in? We hoped for Light, and behold Darkneſſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Darkneſſe! We hoped for Reſt, after ten years civil Wars: We are plunged into deep Confuſſion again. I, we know theſe Conſequences will come upon us, if God Almighty ſhall not finde out ſome way to prevent them.</p>
            <p>I had this thought within my ſelf, That it had not been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But this was declined, and hath not been done, becauſe I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſcarce any man could reaſonably doubt you came with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mindes. And I have reaſon to believe, the people that ſent you leaſt doubted thereof at all. And therefore I muſt deal plainly with you. What I forbare upon a juſt confidence at firſt, you neceſſitate me unto now—That ſeeing the Authority calling you is ſo little valued, and ſo much ſleighted, till ſome ſuch aſſurance be given, and made known; That the Fundamentall Intereſt of the Goverment be ſettied and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:137201:16"/>
according to the Proviſoe contained in the Return; and ſuch a Conſent teſtified, as will make it appear that the ſame is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have cauſed a ſtop to be put to your entrance into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Houſe.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry, I am ſorry, and I could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d if things be not ſatisfied, that are reaſonably Demanded. I for my part ſhall do that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me, ſeeking my Councell from God.</p>
            <p>There is therefore ſomewhat to be offered to you, that I hope will (being underſtood with the Qualifications that I have told you of: Reforming Circumſtantials, and agreeing in the Subſtance and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals (which is, the Government Setled, as it is expreſſed in the Indenture) not to be altered; The making of your mindes known in that, by giving your aſſent and Subſcription to it; is that, that will) let you in, to Act thoſe things as a Parliament, which are for the good of the people And this thing ſhewed to you, and Signed, as aforeſaid, doth determine the controverſie; and may give a happy progreſſe and iſſue to this Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Place where you may come thus, and Sign, as many as God ſhall make free thereunto, is in the Lobby without the Parliament door.</p>
            <p>The Government doth declare, that you have a Legiſlative Power without a Negative from me. As the Government doth expreſſe, you may make any Laws; and if I give not my Conſent within twenty dayes, to the paſſing your Laws, they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Laws, whether I conſent or no, if not contrary to the Government. You have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Legiſlative Power in all things that can poſſibly concern the good, and intereſt of the publick.</p>
            <p>And I think you may make theſe Nations happy by this Settlement: And I for my part ſhall be willing to be bound more then I am in any thing that I may be convinced of, may be for the good of the people, in preſervation of the Cauſe and Intereſt ſo long contended for.</p>
