            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

these riuers of mercy, the waters that bee

Mercy from heauen, and mercy

aquarum,</hi> the subiect and sea of miserie,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8473:3"/>
and therefore the fitter vessell to receiue
mercy.</p>
            <p>Mercy doth well to all sorts of men,
but <hi>especially to the houshold of Faith,</hi> Galat. 6.
therefore to <hi>Sion</hi> aboue all the parts of the
earth: And mercy commeth amisse at no
time; but <hi>how faire is mercy in a time of need?
Vt nubes pluviae tempore siccitatis,</hi> 35. Ecclis.
as a clowd of rain in the time of drought,
therefore, when the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>set time</hi> to
haue mercy is come. And mercy is a
gracefull ornament in all sorts of men,
especially in those, that are the children of
God, <hi>Bee yee mercifull, as your heauenly Father
is mercifull.</hi> Luc. 6. <hi>therefore the seruants take
pleasure</hi> &amp;c. But when wee haue all sayd
or done, the mercy of God is aboue all
his works, and therefore aboue the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of all men and Angels, <hi>O let me fall into
the hands of God, for his mercy is exceeding
great, but let mee not fall into the hands of men.</hi>
2 Sam. 24. therefore <hi>Tu exurgens,</hi> Thou
shalt arise and haue mercy vpon Sion.</p>
            <p>All these parcells of my text, when I
consider them aright (me thinketh) they
walke togither, as the beasts and birds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8473:3"/>
that went into the Arke, all by couples.</p>
            <p>First, here is God and his mercy, <hi>Tu
misereberis;</hi> but not without an accent.
<hi>Tu exurgens,</hi> thou shalt <hi>arise,</hi> and haue
mercy: that is, it is not a wishing and
woulding mercy, but a preuailing, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
releeuing mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is <hi>Sion,</hi> and her misery;
for miserable shee must needs bee, that
standeth in need of mercy; but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an accent. When it is come to that
extremitie, that the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thirdly, here is <hi>time,</hi> and times oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
but not without an accent, of the
vtmost exigent, pressure and hazard of
time, that can be imagined; for it is <hi>time,</hi>
and with an <gap reason="foreign">

appoynted time is come.</p>
            <p>Lastly, here are the <hi>seruants</hi> of God, and
their charity; but not without an accent.
For it is such a charity, as bringeth affli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction,

Sion, like the dismembred parts of <hi>Medeas</hi>

<hi>Hos.</hi> 12. (after the Latine) <hi>Assimilatus

beene the manner of Prophets, and the

and expressions of God, from
the fashions of man; who, when he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and giueth ouer his worke, sitteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a stoole, as old <hi>Eli,</hi> or <hi>languidus in cubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>

And thus in a parable and some sort
doth God; His cessation and pawsing to
vs-ward for the time from outward and
apparant help, carrieth some shew of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
and otiation in God, as if he

assure our selues, the Lord will neglect vs

aside for the time, will in hand againe.
To be short, that, that we gaine by <hi>Exur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens,</hi>
is this; that the mercy which God
intendeth to Sion, is not a mentall mercy
alone, <hi>we wish you good lucke;</hi> nor onely
a verball mercy, <hi>Goe in peace,</hi> helpe your
selues, <hi>Iam:</hi> 2. it is a reall and effectuall
mercy, in that God doth <hi>arise,</hi> that is, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
and exalt himselfe, and gather his
forces about him to exhibite this mercy.
And so from his <hi>person, Thou,</hi> and his <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

è manu,</hi> God so forced the heft of the
knife, in the hand of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he
could not smite.</p>
            <p>I haue done with my former part,
Gods part; the latter, which belongeth
to man,<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> followeth. <hi>Quoniam placuerunt.
For thy Seruants take pleasure in hir stones,</hi> &amp;c.
It is but a second reason added to the
former; that in effect was this: Thou
shalt haue mercy vpon Sion, <hi>because the
time requireth it.</hi> This latter importeth, but
thus much: Thou shalt haue mercy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sion, <hi>because thy Seruants desire it.</hi> It is
both subsequent and subordinate to the
other; for, the mercy of God in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
is both the exemplary, and efficient
cause of mans mercy in the latter. That
is to say, God doth both lead the way, and
giue grace to man, to extend his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Therefore, where the vsuall reading
is, <hi>Tu exurgens,</hi> thou shalt <hi>arise,</hi> and haue
mercy; <hi>Ierome,</hi> out of the Hebrew, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
transitiuely, <hi>Tu suscitans,</hi> thou shalt
<hi>raise vp</hi> others. He that brought water
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8473:14"/>
out of the rocke, and honie out of the
stone, can wring mercy out of the heart
of an enemie. <hi>He made all them that led them
away captiue, to pity them.</hi> Man would grow
wilde, and degenerate from nature, forget
that he is a man, become a <hi>wolfe,</hi> a <hi>Deuill</hi>
to man; but that God keepeth him in
tune.</p>
            <p>Amongst these <hi>Seruants</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> they
ranke in the first place, <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi>
Lords ouer men, but seruants to God,
and (as a seruant is defined by <hi>Aristotle)</hi> his
liuing Instruments, to doe their Masters
will. Thus God speaketh to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Esa. 44.
<hi>Thou art my shepheard, and he shall do my desire.
He shall say to Ierusalem, Thou shalt be built, and
to the Temple, thy foundation shall be surely laid.</hi>
The story is very strange, in the booke of
<hi>Esdras,</hi> the first and sixt Chapters especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and shall be opened amongst other
bookes, at the day of the Lord, against
many beleeuers: that a paire of out-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,
and heathen Kings, should not only
giue leaue to the Iewes, to returne to their
Countrey, and build both their City and
Temple, and restore them their vessels
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8473:15"/>
and iewels, that had beene taken from
them; but allow the expence of their
building, out of their owne reuenues, and
supply them beside, for sacrifice and sweet
odours, with a checke to all their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>be yee far from thence,</hi> and a perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>decree,</hi> that whosoeuer should alter that
sentence, the wood should bee pulled
downe from his house, and he hanged
therevpon, and his house made a draught-house.
And lastly, a direfull imprecation
against all Kings and people, that should
put their hands to alter, and destroy the
house of God in Ierusalem.<note place="margin">Esa. 49.</note>

not onely in hir fates and casualties, but
in the very returnes and revolutions of
those fates. After hir first building
(which was 600 after Christ) about 500
yeares, salted with fire, sacrificed to the

<hi>lay his eyes vpon the eyes,</hi> view the lanthorne

some enriched it with reuenue, some with

being such as he is. One that hath kept
<hi>the fire vpon your Altar yet burning,</hi> (I trust e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shall) I meane, that hath nourished the
Gospell of peace, and gouernment of
peace, and liberty, plenty, prosperity the

What a Father, what a Sonne? and such
honour abroad, I wish I were worthy to

these seuenteene yeeres of his raigne, haue
been honored &amp; priuiledged with more
exemplary and spectable workes, in your
City and Suburbs (I named not the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house)
in Countrey and Vniuersities,
where Libraries, Schooles, and Lectures,
prouoke all Christendome to emulation,
and some Colledges haue beene newly
founded, euery Colledge almost hath
cast his old skin with the Serpent, and
gotten a new coat, then in so many yeares
twice told (picke them where you will) of
any his Predecessours; So the re-building
of <hi>Pauls,</hi> may be the <hi>Coronis</hi> and Vp-shot,

the Glory, Garland, and Master-peece to
all the rest.</p>
            <p>I am full as the Moone, and must speak
to take breath, from the abundance of
the heart, my mouth speaketh. <hi>A great
dore and effectuall is opened vnto mee.</hi> I neuer
spake in such an Auditory, neuer shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
But if euer I were in the Spirit (I
trust Gods Spirit is in mee, and affecteth
me thus to speake) I meane, transported
beyond my selfe, now it is, to haue so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of soules within mine eye,
so faithfull and firme (I perswade my selfe)
to God, his Anoynted, the Church, the
State, as with their meanes and assistance,
alliance and friends, are able and ready
(to build a Church, shall I say? yea, and)
to maintaine, and fight for the Church, to
defeat all aduersaries it hath, and debell
proud Antichrist himselfe. <hi>Deum in voco
testem in animam meam,</hi> I speake as I thinke,
I see a <hi>cluster and bunch of the grapes of Canaan,</hi>
the very first &amp; best of the fruits, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdome. Now, you on

Lord; blessed is he that is come vnto you, in the
name of the Lord;</hi> and blessed, blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that comes in the name of the
Lord, and with the Lords errand. Set it,
as a seale vpon your hearts, that your
King is so come vnto you. Such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
are not often; but like <hi>Ludi Saecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
in Rome, once in an age, once in a
Princes raigne, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> once, and
now your Soueraigne once. I hope I
shall not sinne, in wishing that such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings
were more often,—<q>

Such a people, in view of their King,
and such a King in view of his people,
banding their eyes to and fro, the one
from the other, would be as the flowing
and falling of waters, a reciprocall and
enterchangeable motion of loue betwixt
them. I know not what others thinke;
but to mee, it seemeth worthy, to adde a
<hi>Rubricke</hi> more to your Almanacke, and
make a new <hi>Holy-day</hi> amongst you. The
Pope maketh <hi>Iubilees</hi> at his pleasure, why
not this a <hi>Iubilee,</hi> a yeere of extraordinary
joy to your City?</p>
            <p>I doubt not; but our Chronicles will
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8473:31"/>
make report of this, to future ages. Some
will bee so happy, to take the pencill in
hand (none but <hi>Apelles</hi> should doe it) and
describe the honour of this day. But will
it almost be beleeued, that a King should
come from his Court to this Crosse,
where Princes seldome or neuer come;
and that comming to bee in state, with a
kinde of sacred pompe and procession;
accompanied with all the faire <hi>Flowers</hi> of
his Field, and the fairest <hi>Rose</hi> of his owne
Garden; an holy Congregation to bee
called; his desires sanctified before hand,
with prayer and preaching; and in the
hearing of a world of people, to make a
request to his Subiects, not for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
but for the publike; not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but for God; not out of reason of
state and policy, but of religion and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
no lesse fruit of honour and fauour,
with God and man, accruing thereby to
his people, then to his sacred Majesty?
You that see it at the present, and can va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
and prize it, with all due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and merit, haue cause to admire it.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude in a better time, nor

can I make a better conclusion, then a lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle
