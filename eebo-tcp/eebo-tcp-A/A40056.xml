            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO Preface a little; I have set forth to the World a <hi>Breviate</hi> of the late Arch-Bishops <hi>doings</hi> in his life: and made a faitfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his <hi>sayings</hi> at his death. So much haste was desired in it, and such Brevity in all, That truly some lines were omitted, which were prepared. And as his expressions were darke and involved touching his Religion: so I was not so clear and full at that point to the Readers satisfaction as now I shall be. And at one great point about <hi>the Church of England,</hi> I mistooke the Preacher, Blasphemer rather, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for running over that point hastily, I understood not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence of his words, as now I do, so I took the word <hi>Church</hi> in our sence for <hi>the Church indeed:</hi> when as he meant the Bishops, the <hi>church in name,</hi> or of Rome for under that notion (Church) has been meant these three hundred yeers and more. It shall be called by that name no more, unlesse with this addition, the <hi>Malignant</hi> Church. I took but halfe his <hi>confession</hi> neither: And for that the <hi>Malignants</hi> may say, I have done him wrong. Ile make them amends now in clearing before their eyes if they would see (but some will not see, and other-some cannot see, now, having shut-out <hi>light</hi> so long;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What his Religion was.</hi> 2. <hi>What is the church he so bemoanes.</hi> 3. <hi>What his confession</hi> 4. <hi>And prayer:</hi> And that these foure, are four abominations before the Lord God, and all good men: And shall be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Malignants</hi> themselves so to be, an abomination all foure, if their eyes be not quite shut up; Their hearts void of all grace, and their consciences <hi>past all feeling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52067:3"/>
It will be said.</p>
            <p>Why do I trouble the dead, raking, as it were, in his ashes; he is now lanched forth into the Ocean of <hi>Eternity,</hi> entred into his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable condititon; Whether at rest there or restlesse, is not to be disputed; his judgement is from the Lord, let the tongues of men and their pens suffer him to rest now from all uncharitable Sensures, whereever he is. I answer. (1.) I have not formerly, I do not now meddle with the dead. But for the sake of the living, ever-living Soules, I deale in those matters, which live, and spread, eat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume like a canker, to the utter destruction of the unwise and ignorant (<hi>viz.</hi>) The conceit vain men have, they are no other, of this <hi>late</hi> and <hi>last</hi> Arch-Bishops <hi>Religon, Church, Repentance, Prayer;</hi> of high esteem with vain men, but abominations all foure, as we said, before the Lord God, and his faitfull servants. This was one mighty motive with me to do as I have done, not censuring the dead, but condemning a <hi>Dead</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>A false</hi> Church, An unsound Repentance; A Confession of sin, and <hi>prayer</hi> forgivenes more abominable then any of the former; That these may not be received, &amp; approved, to the condemnation &amp; destruction of the <hi>living.</hi> (2.) Because the late Arch. B. Sermon, as <hi>Malignants</hi> will call it (though as cunning a piece of Blasphemie, as by the helpe of the Devill, was contrived this hundred yeers, all the reason why the Devils <hi>first-borne sonnes,</hi> the Malignants, like it so well) is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted over the Seas, there to speak Dutch, and French, (Italian it speaks already pretty treatably) so to perswade all who meet with it, That, what ever this late <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> was all his life long, yet he was an angell at his death; which vain opinion may amuse and abuse the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reader <hi>infinitely,</hi> it may make him beleev that he may be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills servant, doe the Devills worke all his life long: and die as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord dies, the death <hi>of the Righteous.</hi> That I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this dreadfull mistake, I assure thee readed, ile set downe these matters (omitted before through too much haste) faithfully as the Truth is, <hi>So helpe me God,</hi> the God of Truth, and leader into all Truth. And when I have so done, ile post it over beyond sea also as fast as I can, in full assurance, that if this paper happen into a wise mans hand, who hath read the said Sermon, he will finde truth here, and there a <hi>Bishops Sermon</hi> indeed, if not as full of Blasphemies as of leaves. Yet as full of falshods as of lines.</p>
            <p>One word more before I come to the <hi>Resolves,</hi> I must in duty, &amp; ought in manners, forbear, as before, to set down how he quits his Judges, <hi>he chargheth nothing in the least degree upon them,</hi> he said, not considering what he said: for if there be any guilt in his Condemnation it must
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52067:3"/>
ly upon his Judges: But he doth indeed in a full and cleer expression acquit his Judges, saying, <hi>They proceeded by the clearest proofe.</hi> He clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his witnesses too, saying; They were <hi>valuable witnesses:</hi> Yet most unwillingly did hee doe all this, as a man, who could not give Glory to God, nor Honour to men. But his Judges and witnesses all, are now acquitted indeed, as before in their owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and in the Court of Heaven: so also before all the world, who will be at the cost and paines to read their equitable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings throughout his whole Arainment: And they that cannot bee at that charges (as few can for our sins and the Bishops warres have emptied our purses very much) will be so gracious, I hope, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That <hi>the Iudge of all the world</hi> (whose Almighny Arme brought this mighty adversarie to the block) <hi>will do Right:</hi> and so charitable they will be I hope, as to conclude also, That all the gods, the <hi>Lords</hi> under judges here on earth, whom He hath called together so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, preserved to this time so wonderfully, delivered so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously, as <hi>fire Brands out of the fire,</hi> That these Judges, the highest one Earth, will <hi>do right also:</hi> So I proced to the Resolves in Order, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning brokenly, because of the Reference it makes to the Printed Coppie.</p>

And all the Schollers in both Universities, I mean all and none other but those all <hi>Bishop-would-bees,</hi> all that gaped after preferment by his meanes, and to come through his hands:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) What were these <hi>Court-chaplaines?</hi> The same this late Arch-Bishop was, when he was a Court-Chaplaine himself; of the very same <hi>Religion, Faith, Gospel, Iudgement</hi> also, touching the law for <hi>Warre,</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> God, Angels and men will witnesse with mee, That Such they were, as he was. These Chaplaines moulded their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Texts, so they doe now, like a nose of <hi>Waxe,</hi> to the minde of their Lord, and fashion of the times, and then <hi>forced</hi> themselves to speake scarce not more words than blasphemies against God, and <hi>His Holy Ones;</hi> Which Chaplaines and Doctrines this man had opposed with the same zeale, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> shewed at the hearing of <note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> the like <hi>Insidels,</hi> had he had the least sparke of love, or heat of that, in his breast, wee call true <hi>zeal</hi> for God, His Religion, His Faith, His Law, His Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And for his <hi>Civilians,</hi> those that <hi>served his lusts,</hi> as I thinke the most did; What they are now I cannot tell, for I know not where they are: But all the Kingdomes knowes what they were, as <hi>arrand</hi> — Ile say no more touching persons so notoriously knowne all over the land, <hi>burdens</hi> of the earth, <hi>plagues</hi> and <hi>pests</hi> there.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) And for the Doctors, Proctors and Schollers all I meane all, <hi>who loved the wages of iniquity,</hi> hunted after preferment; Ah Lord, how did these mould and fashion themselves to the formes and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52067:4"/>
fashions of this great-man! Very Apes they were, they would imitate him as they could; What he speak, they would speak; What he did in point of service to the Church, they whould doe; his religion was theirs; his faith theirs; his law theirs; his Gospel theirs; his gods theirs, of the very same zize and making! And as stout and stiffe in maintenance of those gods, and service to them Divels, I should say, (such they are in Gods sight,) as he their Lord was. Indeed these all were and still are, as firme and fast to this late Arch-Bishop, as (if I might compare persons so contrary) <hi>Ruth</hi> was to <hi>Naomie,</hi> as fast to his <hi>Formes,</hi> to the <hi>Lawes</hi> of his house; to his gods; to his services: They were fast friends, and walked together, being of the same minde, and Judgement, in all matters till the last: onely there they differed; For <hi>where hee died they would not die;</hi> nor <hi>would they there be buried;</hi> which had been with <hi>the Buriall of an Asse,</hi> had he had the buriall his life deserved; I had spoken more to this, but that the present state and face of things speake the fullest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the forgoing questions, yet for the satisfaction of all that are not <hi>willingly ignorant,</hi> so much I have said: I proceed now to a conclusion of what I was saying, and all that knew him will conclude with mee: That hee breathed after Preferment, moulded and fashioned himselfe, words and Actions, Religion, Faith, Gospel, all to the Times; and most compendious waies, bearing-up towads that Pinacle, He did as a man that Loveth the world, and deifies, makes a god of its Glory; And what havocke he made of Faith and a good conscience, all wise men know. You will say, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>Died with a Iest in their mouthes; other some with an Oath there, others with a Blasphemie there: And other died as he died with an, &amp;c. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 21. All wise men will.</p>

               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Church of England is now in a Storme her selfe, and God knowes, whether or how it shall get out?</hi> This must have a twofold answer, for Church has a twofold acceptation, the one in the Bishops sence, the other in ours; Church in the Bishops acceptation is themselves; Arch-Bishops and Lord Bishops are the Church, the poor Church of England indeed. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that was his meaning, and thus he bemoaned themselves. <hi>The Poore Charch of England is now in a Storme.</hi> Indeed it is, and not one man that is a member of the true Church can be sorry for that. <hi>And God knowes whether or how it shall get out;</hi> He knowes indeed and He hath assured His faithfull servants that the Bishops shall never weather it out: Their Seas shall work so High, and the Storme shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52067:5"/>
lie so long upon them, till their Lordships shall be able to bear-up no longer: but sink they must like a Milstone into the great waters. The men may finde mercy, and God grant they may, but their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships none at all. <hi>And this Poore Church</hi> (<hi>the Bishops</hi>) <hi>is now fallen into a great deal of danger by her own.</hi> We grant this also; The Arch-Bishops and Bishops have more than <hi>endangered</hi> themselves, they have done that which the Parliament, and all the Faithfull servants in all the world could not doe against that cursed <hi>Hierarchy</hi> for the casting of it forth; what the faithfull could not do, they have done against themselves; ruined themselves they have with their own hands; Their villanies, Their out-Rages, their Horrable Impieties, iniquities, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies against God and man; by all these they have ruined <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> They <hi>Intraduced</hi> such prophanenesse and irreligion, cloked all this <hi>While with the</hi> name of imaginary Religion; They dwelt so much upon shadowes that they have quite lost the substance. These are his <note place="margin">Pag. 12. <hi>line</hi> 7.</note> words and they must be understood of his Church, and no other, so he betrayed himselfe with his owne Tokens, and beat himself with his  own staff: for as it followes; They were so fixed upon their <hi>opinion,</hi> a conceit only, so fixed I say, and so fully perswaded, That they the (Malignant) Church Should abide Queen for ever; Their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was so strong, and they so strong upon it, That they thought they should never be moved, Then they advanced their throne above <hi>the Stars of God,</hi> and so <hi>ruined themselves,</hi> and their thrones for ever. He must mean themselues under this notion <hi>Church,</hi> for his words are inconsistent with any other Church but their own. Only these words <hi>clest as under as With wedges</hi> cannot agree with their Church. Indeed on <hi>heed</hi> of that monstrous Church, which has two, is cleft asunder from the body by the Death-mans Axe, as was Goliahs head by the sword in <hi>Davids</hi> hand: But the Bulkly body of that Church, and members of the same are intire: and platted together they are all <hi>like thornes,</hi> in a fast confederacy with the <hi>King of the bottomles pit:</hi> These Adversaries are, as is said of the Leviathans scales, <hi>shut up together</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">lob. 41 16</note> 
                  <hi>as with a close seal one so near to another that no Ayre-can come between them;</hi> They are joyned one to another, <hi>they stick together that they can not be sundred:</hi> so here his old memory failed him. But though here are the turnings and windings of the <hi>crooked Serpent;</hi> though hee <hi>Doubles</hi> here, loving, as some Beasts do, <hi>confus a vestigia,</hi> that we might not track him, or finde him out, yet we understood him very well, That he could bemoane none other Church but his own; hee could not bemoane the <hi>True Church</hi> at his death, whom he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted heartily with his tongue and hand all his life long. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52067:5"/>
his own Church, whereof he was <hi>head;</hi> for thereunto his own words all along do agree, congruous and consistent with that Church, and no other, the enemies themselves being Judges; or if not they we indite them before the <hi>Iudge of all the word,</hi> in their ArchB, words, 1 That they, the Bishops, have <hi>introduced irreligion, and prophanenesse, cloked under the guise or name of Imaginary religion;</hi> 2 That they and only they, have quite <hi>lost the substance,</hi> while they dwelt <hi>too much a great deal upon shadowes</hi> (<hi>in opinion</hi>) so that God would be served a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this command, and expresse will touching the way of His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And so it was of the Lord, That their Church is in a <hi>storme</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and fallen into a great deal of <hi>danger by her own; nay</hi> tuined now by their own hands, that sureiy the Prince of Devills sate in councell with them, when time was, else they could not have consulted such shame to their own house, nor have taken such a ready way to ruine themselves, and their thrones. I will conclude this mighty ruine of these mighty Adversaries, once the Lords of the world, as <hi>Ioshua</hi> doth the ruine of those mighty Kings: <hi>For it was of the Lord to hearden their heart, that they should come against Israel in battle: and that they might hawe no favour,</hi> Iosh. 11. 20.</p>
               <p>So much to his first acceptation of this word <hi>church,</hi> in the Bishops construction, themselves, <hi>a poore church indeed,</hi>

               <p>Touching his <hi>prayer,</hi> I have spoken already, briefly, what the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <note place="margin">IV.</note> Scripture gave me warrant to speak. I have not space to enlarge now; I adde this onely; That his prayer is the highest provocation of all that went before, and the greatest abhomination. He prayes for an heart to dye (1) for <hi>Gods honour,</hi> whom he had dishonoured all his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52067:6"/>
life long; and now most <hi>presumptuously</hi> at his death, giving no <hi>glory to Him at all.</hi> (2) For <hi>the Kings happinesse,</hi> Whom, by his wicked counsels, he hath helpt to make the most unhappie and unglorious King, that now lives upon the face of the earth. (3) And <hi>this Churches preservation.</hi> I grant <hi>This,</hi> in his meaning, not in his intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but by Gods gracious dispensation, preserving <hi>His</hi> Churches by ruining <hi>This</hi> Church, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> Archbishop, Gods, and His Churches Arch-Adversary, the Head of the same. <hi>So let all Thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies perish, O Lord, But let them that love Him, be as the Sun, when</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude, we understand now what this mans <hi>Religion</hi> was. 2 What his <hi>Church</hi> is. 3 And we have read his <hi>Confession</hi> and Prayer full out. There is not one truly wise man in the world, but sayes, all <hi>these four are so many abominations.</hi> Yet there be some who would passe for wise men, but so they cannot do: And would not be accounted Malignants neither (that cannot be) who praise his <hi>doings</hi> and <hi>sayings,</hi> specially all he did and said at his death. Is it possible that men will not <hi>remember themselves and shew themselves men?</hi> If they will not, I will resolve what they are also; They are of the Bishops <hi>Religion;</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> and they verily think, that such 2 <hi>Confession</hi> of sinne, and such a <hi>Prayer</hi> for forgivenesse, the late Archbishop made at his death, will serve their turn too at that dreadfull time. If they think so, and that be their hopes, then they may hope well of <hi>Iudas,</hi> in reference to his Confession, for it is full and free, and no <hi>if</hi> there. And if this mans acknowledgement of his Doings may be thought free and ingenuous, they may say as much and more of the Divels acknowledgement of his wayes before the Lord; <hi>Whence commest thou, Satan,</hi> said the Lord? <note place="margin">Iob 17.</note> The great <hi>Peripatetick</hi> of the world acknowledgeth, saying, <hi>sroin go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro in the Earth,</hi> seeking whom to seduce, and to destroy there. The Divell is summoned again, and he is before the Throne of the Lord; and the Lord said, <hi>Who shall perswade the King, that he may go up to warre, and fall there?</hi> I will layes the Divell; And <hi>the Lord said unto him, wherewith?</hi> With a <hi>lye</hi> sayes he, which I will put into <note place="margin">1 King. 22.</note> the mouth of all the Kings Prophets: give me but <hi>power,</hi> I have <hi>will</hi> enough, and the King has Prophets enough, who will speak what I <hi>will:</hi> I <hi>will</hi> perswade them, and they will perswade the King to <hi>his destruction.</hi> A very ingenious acknowledgment of what he had a <hi>will</hi> to do; he was before the Lord, and then alwayes he speaks the Truth; he is as he is, no <hi>Angell of light then;</hi> He was a <hi>lying-Spirit,</hi> from the beginning; he is the same still; and if he might have power to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52067:7"/>
his <hi>will,</hi> so and so he would do; <hi>power</hi> was given him, and so he did perswade to his <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This man was before the Lord too, as he said himselfe, <hi>before all His holy Angels and men:</hi> but whether his acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wayes before the Lord, be full, and ingenuous, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills was, let the Reader Judge. I could make these <hi>words</hi> very para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell with the Bishops <hi>doings;</hi> But I will forbear there, and to make any conclusion from thence. Nor shall I so much as look towards Gods decree; The <hi>quickest sight therein is but blindnesse:</hi> Nor dare I thrust him into the pit of hell, whom I saw Sometimes walking on the brinke thereof: Nor set limits to infinite <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which may intervene and come-in, <hi>inter pontem &amp; fontem</hi> as we use to say.</p>
               <p>But this I have cleare warrant from the Sacred scripture to say.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That JUDAS his <hi>Confession</hi> was more full and free than this mans was: And that the Devils acknowledgment of his waies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord exceeded this mans acknowledgement also.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) And that we have not a word, no not one word in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, wherefrom to conclude the salvation of this man so <hi>Confessing</hi> his sin, and <hi>praying</hi> forgivenesse of the same: And yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragate nothig at all from the <hi>Height, Depth, Length, Breadth,</hi> of free mercy through the Lord Jesus Christ; And let him that reads this consider on it if he will, and tremble if he can; Tremble he shall one day, if he be perswaded in his heart, &amp; to die in that perswasion, That such a <hi>Religion,</hi> this late and last Arch-Bishop was of, such a CHVRCH, such a CONFESSION of sin, such a PRAYER for forgivenesse will serve the turne at that dreadfull time.</p>
               <p>It is spoken with a deare respect to thy dying, rather dead body, (the <hi>body is dead because of sin</hi>) and never dying Soul.</p>
