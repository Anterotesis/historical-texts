            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <p>THe enſuing Treatiſe <hi>being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmitted to me by a friend from</hi> New-England, with a deſire of its Publication; I did in order thereunto ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly peruſe it; and finding (as far as I am able to judge) an excellent diſcourſe, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and powerfully managed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and thereby moſt likely to redound to the edification of every Reader, (all Divine Truth having an influence and efficacy into Converſion and Sanctificat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when God ſhall command a bleſſing by
<pb facs="tcp:104582:3"/>
it upon the Soul;) but above all, more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly ſuited to the ſupport and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints in this their wayfaring and afflictive pilgrimage: I have been thereby induced to recommend it to ſuch into whoſe hands it ſhall come, being fully perſuaded <hi>that its own worth</hi> will ſpeak for it ſelf with ſuch a conviction upon the minds of all whoſe ſenſes are exerciſed in and about things of another world, and who have any experience of <hi>Chriſt, in them the hope of Glory:</hi> as that they will neither think their time or pains miſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in its Peruſal.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſubject matter of theſe Sermons,</hi> (for ſo they were, as being delivered to a popular Auditory in the courſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Miniſtry,) doth relate to that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come, unto which God hath called his choſen after their ſufferings here, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their abſence from the Lord.</p>
            <p>To add any thing about it beyond what the Reader will find in the Book it ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:104582:3"/>
as it is above my ability; ſo if it were not, I ſhould account it beneath that modeſty which I deſire to obſerve in all things.</p>
            <p>All I ſhall therefore ſay, is this; that whatever is uſually ſpoken of this <hi>Glory,</hi> either as it is objective, or formal the Reader will find much diſcourſed about, both to his ſatisfaction if he come unto the peruſal of it with a pious humble heart; and withal deſiring, to be edified by Spiritual Soul-ſearching Doctrine: But if any ſhall expect thoſe curious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations which may be met with in the diſcourſes of the School-men upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſome of which are perhaps temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to be ſure at beſt un-intelligible to vulgar capacities, they will be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; For our Authors deſign being rather to profit others, then to beget an opinion of his own abilities, (though they were very great) he hath avoided all ſuch matter and manner of handling of it, other then what he had learned from the Scriptures, and choſe to inſiſt mainly on that which may be
<pb facs="tcp:104582:4"/>
helpful to form up the Soul to a meetneſs for that Inheritance amongſt the Saints in light, than meerly to object to mind the high <hi>Idaea's</hi> of that future ſtate, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the heart may be wholly a ſtranger to the very firſt fruits of that Communion with God in Jeſus Chriſt by Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; out of which, as from its root doth ſpring the hope of this <hi>Glory</hi> to come: Yet alſo is there enough ſaid, (conſidering it was deliver'd in an Auditory of plain, humble growing Chriſtians,) to mix plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with advantage; As that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſound Doctrine, and incorruptneſs in ſpeech, hath alſo the ornament of variety of truths handed out in a copiouſneſs of expreſſion, and confirmed, illuſtrated, and urged from moſt pertinent Texts of Scripture, and ſtrongly faſtned as nails and goads by a workman that needed not be aſhamed in his ſervice to the Church <hi>under the great Maſter of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be ſure the called ones <hi>to the hope of this</hi> Glory, will find that full account
<pb facs="tcp:104582:4"/>
given of what is their own Inheritance in that future ſtate, as may be very conducing to ſweeten to them the ſorrows, temptations and afflictions of the preſent, and to mantain themſelves under a fixed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Gods promiſe of Eternal Life made to them in Christ before the World began, without which we can neither live holily, nor die comfortably; Death is only ſweetned to us as we can look upon it, our priviledge is an out-let from ſin and miſery, and an in-let to <hi>Glory</hi> both in Holineſs and Happineſs; And then indeed do We begin to live, when by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving We have everlaſting life, <hi>John 3. ult.</hi> — And when the taſts of it now, and the hopes of its conſummation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are improved in our Chriſtian courſe, as a means &amp; motive to take heed to walk worthy of it, by mortifying our ſins, and purifying our ſelves, <hi>even as he is pure, 1 John 3.3.</hi> and to ſtrengthen our ſelves thereby to a patient enduring the troubles of this preſent time, eſpecially thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are <hi>for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:104582:5"/>
which in the Apoſtles Arithmetick are reckoned not Worthy to be compared with the <hi>Glory</hi> that ſhall be revealed; And withall, to engage us to be ſtedfaſt and immovable, always abounding in, yea faithfully finiſhing of the Work God hath given us to do, as knowing that our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Which ends and purpoſes <hi>as the</hi> Glory <hi>to come</hi> in the Contemplation of it, is of Wonderful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe to effect and perfect them; So the management of this by the Author, as it is ſingularly adapted to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Nature, Properties, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts, Enjoyments and Conſolations of that ſtate; So alſo it is powerfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to the moving the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to endeavouring a making it ſure to our ſelves, partly by miniſtring cloſe matter of ſearch that We be not deceived in our hopes, partly by inſtruction how to live up to them, ſo as to give all diligence, to be found of Chriſt without ſpot, and blameleſs: So that, together with a full
<pb facs="tcp:104582:5"/>
information of the Truth it ſelf, there is carried in with it what may make it (if the holy one teach us to profit) moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to receive it in the love and power of it; which is, and ought to be the great deſign of delivering over to others any thing of moment, eſpecially divine truths.</p>
            <p>And further, I cannot but hope that God may ſanctifie it to ſome ſinners, who have as yet no intereſt in Grace, and ſo no right to Glory, (whilſt they continue ſuch,) if they ſhall to the reading of them ſubjoin prayer to God, that he would by his ſpirit ingraft them into their minds to the ſaving of the Soul. For while on the one ſide they view how great the future portion of Gods now poor deſpiſed ones is and will be, it will naturally lead them to compare the preſent difficulties of Religion, and the ways of holineſs in this World, with the exceeding great glory that ſhall be revealed in the day of the manifeſtation of the Sons of God; when all they that follow holinſs ſhall ſee God, not
<pb facs="tcp:104582:6"/>
only by the light of Faith as now, but in the light of glory ſhall ſee him appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively as he is, though not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively or adequately; ſo ſee him as to be like him, to be ſatisfied in him, and bleſſed with him, and in the Communion of the Lord Jeſus, and his holy Angels and Saints, and then alſo obtain an eternall freedom from the remains of ſin and ſuffering: And this conſideration may alſo lead them on the other ſide to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the pleaſures of ſin, that are but for a ſeaſon, with the everlaſting ſad wages of it, which is death; and that in the loſs of God bleſſed for ever; ſeperation from the Communion with Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and not only in the loſs of God which is unſpeakable, but alſo in thoſe juſt and holy puniſhments from the hand of God, which it is righteous with him to recompence to them that are workers of Iniquity, and who by deſpiſing the glory of Grace now, becauſe of ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies it is cloathed with, (though they are ſo only to depraved minds, and ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:104582:6"/>
whoſe hearts are ſet upon the world, and the luſts of it) do judge themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to find Grace in Glory hereafter; which conſiderations ſanctified, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote very far their turning to God, and that they may have this ſaving effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy on ſuch Souls ſhall be my prayer to God for them, into whoſe hands they may come.</p>
            <p>But further, which ſhall draw this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to a cloſe. I am well ſatisfied, if they find not that acceptance here they may deſerve; yet the revival of theſe Sermons in Print, to the eye and memory of them that were Ear-witneſſes of them from his own mouth, will be an acceptable ſervice to them; who have known from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his manner of life, which was blameleſs, grave, and exemplary, and in ſpeciall his miniſtry to the finiſhing of his courſe, wherein he was a burning and a ſhining light: <hi>among whom, though being dead he yet ſpeaketh,</hi> and his name is a precious ointment, and his
<pb facs="tcp:104582:7"/>
praiſe amongst all the Churches in that wilderneſs, as being a man of ſingular learning profound judgement, a master in that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a Scribe indeed, inſtructed for the Kingdom of God, of whom it may be ſaid (as once was of another) that He was one, not only that had a treaſure, but <hi>was himſelf a treaſure to the Church of God while he lived.</hi> How himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the power of the truth he preched, may be ſeen by the annexed letter to this treatiſe which was penned upon occaſion of a dear friend of his, begging his aſſiſtance about his Soul concerns, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reader ſenſible of ſpiritual things will judge, anſwered with an excellent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſpirit of God, and drawn out of his own experiences, and this, when but newly entring upon his minstry, as he lived holy, ſo he dyed in peace, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods Grace his last dying words (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) being theſe, <hi>Lord thou calleſt me away to thee, I know not why, if I look to my ſelf, but at thy bidding I come;</hi> although hee needs not this recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:104582:7"/>
having received his reward, and ſo is above it, yet we that ſurvive need it, whoſe buſineſs it is to follow the faith and holineſs of ſuch, eſpecially when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the end of their converſation, and not only ſo, but it is in order to the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other things of his, if this find ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; which that it may, and a good ſucceſs, is the Prayer of</p>

The perfection of everlaſting Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is that which the Calling of a Chriſtian (the work of Vocation) aimeth at, tendeth to, and iſſueth in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. and 9.23, 24. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the firſt open work of (Grace upon an Elect perſon, and Glorification is the laſt, ſo 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are upon the laſt great benefit that Believers have by Chriſt, (as we ſee in the Text, it is by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) ſetting forth the Bleſſed Eſtate as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> Glorification. We have ſpoken of the Incoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which is in this life. It follows, to conſider of the Perfection, or Conſummation of it, which ſhall be hereafter in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And this is the Subject now before us from this Text, which plainly ſpeaks of future Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for it ſpeaks of that ſhall be actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and enjoyed after we have ſuffered a while here. There is a Glory now upon the faithful in their ſufferings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. But this Text ſpeaks of that perfect fulneſs of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104582:10"/>
for ever, that ſhall be enjoyed after all their ſufferings are ended. That it is ſo, (or the truth of the Doctrine) is evident in the Text, and in multitude of other Scriptures; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. &amp; 5.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.29, 30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.

Nothing more evident and frequent in the Scripture than this. As it is a matter of Faith not ſeen at preſent, but believed and hoped for, ſo God hath given us abundant ground for Faith, or teſtimony concerning it in his Word.</p>
            <p>Q. But the principal queſtion before us, is, <hi>What this Glohy is that the faithful ſhall enjoy in the world to come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We cannot fully tell you what it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. if not the good and great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, then much leſs the Glory of Heaven, which is the up-ſhot of all thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and whereof the beſt Saints do ſee but ſome glimmerings here. But what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath plainly recorded, we may gather up,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104582:11"/>
and thence draw a little map or general view of that Glory that is prepared for us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, ſuch as may ſuit and reach uſeful practical ends, (to ſtir us up to ſeek after it, to eſteem it above all the world, and make us account it the only great matter and neceſſity to get to Heaven, and may help the Saints to rejoyce in their portion, and comfort them over all their ſorrows in this life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) though not to ſatisfie or feed a curioſity of roving ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>A ſober apprehenſion of Heavens Glory, is ſufficient for us while we are in the way to it; an exact comprehenſion of all particulars will be had time enough when we come thither. But when Earth is full of trouble, and evil round about us, it is not unſuitable to hear of Heaven, and to be looking into that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 18. we ſhall not faint as long as we look upward, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54, 55. We are ready to look on the right hand and on the left, but to be looking up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, is the beſt poſture in evil times. We need bitter things here to drive us off from the Earth; but our hearts had need be reliſhing and taſting the ſweetneſs of Heaven, to draw them up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to the Saints under great and manifold tryals and afflictions, in a time when Judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God, and many amazements and terrours
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104582:11"/>
were ready to ſeize on poor Chriſtians, both men and women, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6, 14. Now he diſcourſes much of Heaven, and of the Glory there. He begins with it 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ends with it in the Text. A diſcourſe on ſuch a ſubject, is not unſuitable at ſuch a ſeaſon. Now therefore for a ſhort view of that eternal Glory that is the portion of the faithful in the world to come, (or of the Glory of the Saints in Heaven) it may be ſet forth and conſidered, 1. In a Poſitive; 2. In a Comparative, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative way, from ſuch Compariſons and Conſiderations as may argue the greatneſs and goodneſs of this Glory. 1. In a Poſitive way, ſo we may take this deſcription of it.</p>
            <p>☞ The Glory of the faithful in the life to come, wherein the benefit of Glorification is conſummate, it is the perfect bleſſedneſs of the Saints, whereby in their ſouls after death, and in ſoul and body after Judgment, (or after the Reſurrection,) being fully freed from all evil both of ſin and ſorrow, they ſhall be filled with holineſs and comfort, and all good, in the full fruition of God, (or compleat communion with God Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,) all together in the higheſt Heavens for evermore.

Sin is the heavieſt burden of the Saints here, and that that makes their lives bitter to them, that they cannot live without ſinning againſt God: Let all the world ſmile on them, this makes them go up and down with heavy hearts. If the Lord ſhould ſay to any gracious heart here, Ask what I ſhall give thee; thou wouldſt ſay, Lord, that I might be rid of ſin; thou wouldſt rather have this, than Crowns and Kingdoms. Why this deſire ſhall be fully granted then. Theſe corruptions that have dogged thee up and down the world and oft prevail'd, ſhall never trouble thee more. The ſins thou haſt been groaning under all thy life long, ſince any ſpark of ſpiritual life was put into thee, once on <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhore, thou ſhalt ſee thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> no more for ever.

mindedneſs, no fleſhlineſs no coldneſs, deadneſs of heart and affections, no uneven walking, no grieving of the Spirit of God, or of the ſpirits of Fellow-Brethren, no unholy action or converſation, ſhall ever be heard of more. There in that <hi>Canaan</hi> above, the Lord will give you reſt from all your Enemies, and from thoſe eſpecially, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.9, 10. Thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> that have been ſo long thorns in your ſides, you ſhall ſee an end of them, (that then will be perfectly fulfilled, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.21.) and triumph over all; behold that fully done, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. and then ſing, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 4.

But he never came in Heaven ſince he was a Devil, nor ever ſhall come there; the higheſt room where he comes in, is the Aire, (<hi>Epeſ.</hi> 2.2. this Elemental world) but never mounts ſo high as the third Heaven. He is caſt down into Hell, and ſhall never come in Heaven, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. While the Saints tread on the earth where that Serpent Crawles, he may bite (nible at) their heel: But when once they are with their head in Heaven in their ſtate of Exaltation, there they are quite out of his reach; though both Chriſt and Chriſtians in their Humiliation-time here on earth, were lyable to be tempted and troubled by the Devil. Then the Saints ſhall fully triumph over this Helliſh <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> (the Devil, him and all his hoſt or train) when he ſhall be caſt into the Sea and deep of that full torment that is prepared for the Devil and his Angels; into which he ſhall be actually caſt after the laſt Judgment. Now is his Tempting, but then ſhall be his Tormenting time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29. His tempting time and his ranging about for that purpoſe (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.) will be then at an end: Satan is ſaid to be ſhut up and bound during the proſperous and flouriſhing times of the Church in this world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.23. But much more fully and abſolutely ſhall he be bound from moleſting the Saints of their

triumphant ſtate in Heaven: then ſhall he and all his Complices be in torment, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.10. While the Saints reign in Peace for ever. Oh the ſad Annoyance that even Gods dear children have from that <hi>Belzebub</hi> here, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1. but they ſhall be fully forced from that hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Injuries and moleſtations from evil and wicked men, there will be none of them in Heaven, neither (as <hi>Job</hi> 3.17, 18. true of the Grave but much more of the ſtate of the Saints happineſs of the life to come.) No wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, no Injurious Adverſary, no Papiſtical or Atheiſtical hater of God and his people ſhall ever come within Heaven doors, (none but Saints ſhall be there alone together) much leſs be able to trouble or moleſt there.

Whatſoever Corner of the earth you retire or remove into and plant in, you ſee the children of wickedneſs can follow you thither and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict you: The Saints ſhall never be planted in a place that is abſolutely their own till they come to Heaven. Oh, get a Patent for that, take up a Lot, and build and plant there in Heaven, and then you ſhall have a place of your own (what you ſend thither aforehand, your Hope, your Treaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſafe; and when your perſons are there once) none ſhall ever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt you more; no fear of invaſion, no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

It may be when you came into this Wilderneſs, you thought that this would be a place of your own, and that none would ever trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to come into this Corner to trouble you. But alas <hi>New-England</hi> is but Earth and not Heaven: No place on Earth is exempted from moleſtation by the Devil and his Inſtruments, but Heaven is that, and that alone, and that fully; there the Children of wickedneſs and the Sons of violence ſhall not afflict you any more as before time; then will thoſe prayers be fully and compleatly anſwered, (which the poor children of God have oft need to power out before him) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 17.4. the Saints may then triumph over all wicked Adverſaries, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.6, 7. Alſo the troubles that ariſe from the mixtures of the Wicked among the Godly (as here there is a mixture of bad with good, and much trouble thence ariſeth,) will there be ended; there is no <hi>Meſech</hi> nor Tent of <hi>Keder</hi> to be complained of, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.5, 6. nor as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.4. nor yet falſe Brethren (unfaithful, unſound, Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redox, or Hypocritical perſons that are ſecret adverſaries to Truth and Piety) as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.

And ſpake of things of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. Then indeed but in order to the carrying on of the Kingdom of Grace, and in ſuch a meaſure as ſuited that end. But why may we not think that he will then in Heaven in ſuch a manner and meaſure, as ſuites the Kingdom of Glory, expound the Scriptures, lay open the depths of the Book of God, and the Myſteries of Divinity, thoſe fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that were here known but in a little part, and other points that were not known at all, the wonders of Law and Goſpel, of the Word and Works of God, the depths and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Wiſdom: But eſpecially the depths of Love and Grace (the things that tend to the praiſe of the Glory of Gods Grace; the great end of all his dealings with his people, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6.) thoſe will he open and lay forth in a glorious manner: And oh the burnings and flames, and ſparkling Impreſſions of Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Affections that all the Saints about him will then be filled with. Never ſuch a Preacher,

and never ſuch Hearers for Attention and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (no Sleeping, no Dulneſs, no Wearineſs) as there will be.

Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſweet Communion do the Saints here enjoy with Chriſt at a Sacrament, in that Ordinance of the Lords Supper: But in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (in the Kingdom of his Father) he will (as I may ſay) celebrate that Sacrament, <hi>i. e.</hi> give them the quinteſſence, comfort and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it in another manner; in new, freſh and immediate Communications of his Grace and ſweetneſs.

The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between Chriſt and the Saints in the Coeleſtial Life, will compleat, perfect, and far tranſcend that that is but in a weak and mean degree, begun in Ordinances here.

We have but the firſt fruits of the Spirit, but an earneſt penny now, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and 5.5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is an Harveſt, the whole ſum, a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit that ſhall be imparted then. And as the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of Grace and Comfort now, by whoſe Preſence and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance we are upheld in both, ſo will he be then; only in ſuch a way, manner and meaſure as ſuits a ſtate of Perfection; then he will reſt upon you as a Spirit of Glory, ſo hath he done in a great degree on ſome Martyrs here, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. but there, in Perfection on all the Saints.</p>
            <p>Hence the Saints in Heaven having the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit, ſhall be repleniſhed with all thoſe Excellencies and endowments that are the Effects and fruits of the preſence and ſpecial operation of the Spirit, filled with all the fulneſs of God. As 1. With ſingular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Guifts of knowledge, wiſdom, inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of underſtanding (as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29.) and utterance, (For there will be uſe of utterance in Heaven, in Glorious Conference and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

With all Graces of Holineſs or Sanctification; thoſe now brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and kept up in act and exerciſe. Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.) will then be perfect (of which further afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Glory of the Soul) and there will be the conſtant un-interrupted Preſence and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit to actuate every Grace, to keep it up in its full exerciſe: The heart ever inlarged for God, ever fixed and tuned to ſing his Praiſe, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7, 8. Thy Glory (Heart and Tongue) ſhall be ever awake, thy Harp ever in Tune then, the Spirit of Grace everlaſtingly filling and quickning thy Heart, and holding thee up in Heavenly, Spiritual activity and inlargement. 3. With abundant Comfort and Conſolation. The Holy Ghoſt will then fully do that work of a Comforter, and dwell in all the Saints as ſuch, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16.) in his Choiceſt and moſt Glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Operations. That in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. will then be fully done: Then perfect Aſſurance and ſenſe of the Love of God, without all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of doubt, or fear, or darkneſs; full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall be wanting to never a Saint in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; the meaneſt ſhall ſee the Love of God more clearly than the ſtrongeſt did here: That
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104582:24"/>
great queſtion, will then be out of queſtion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The light of Gods Countenance ſhall be then lifted up, and ſhine upon your ſouls as a Sun that never ſets, nor is overcaſt with clouds. The knowledge and ſenſe of that one thing, [that the Infinite God loves thee with an everlaſting love] which is more worth than ten thouſand, thouſand worlds, ſhall live in thy heart, and be the Life and Joy of thy Soul; and fill thee with peace that paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The joy of the Holy Ghoſt (that is a manifeſt and eminent part of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Holy Ghoſt) ſhall then be at its full height, which now we have but ſome taſts and drops of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. That that Chriſt hath been ſo long aiming and driving at, will then be attained, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.11. and 16.24. Their Joy is the Element the Saints in Heaven live in, (they breath in no other Aire but that) the Ocean they ſwim in: It is that they enter and go into, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21, 23. Joy at once expreſſes Heaven, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory: It is a Maſs or Heap of Joy, a Region of Joy, an Aire and Element of Joy (the Joy of the Lord God, the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt) into which they are brought, and where they breath and live, and ſwim in the fulneſs thereof for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.</p>

Now in this Life, the Soul is taken up in ſerving the Body; the greateſt part of our time, Labour, Strength, Study, is ſpent in the providing Meat and Clothing, and Comforts for the Body, and feeding that, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.7. But then the Body (not needing thoſe things) ſhall be wholly ſerviceable to the Soul. The Body ſhall be no more ſuch a Troubleſome, Cumberſome thing as now it is, needing ſo much tendance and adoe about it, and oft interrupting Spiritual work thereby. But then it ſhall be a more Spiritual and Heavenly peace, alwayes free and ready for Soul work, for Spiritual Heavenly imployment. Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,

            <p n="3">3. Activity, Agility, Lightneſs Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſpeed in motion, may alſo be imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Spiritualneſs of the Body: Not dull, ſlow, heavy-moulded as now: but in Agility and Activity more like to Spirits. Hence, eaſily made to aſcend to meet the Lord in the Aire, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. and afterward to go up with him to the third Heaven: And able, no doubt, in a very little time, (though not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in an inſtant) to move through thoſe vaſt ſpaces and diſtances of thoſe Heavenly Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and from one quarter of the Coeleſtial World to another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Glorious Company of Saints and Angels is another Additional part of Heavens Glory. The fruition of God is the main Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it. But this is an Acceſſional Adjunct, or Concomitant that is full of Comfort: Yea, it is a neceſſary Concomitant, for God will be enjoyed by his people in a Communion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not in a ſingle ſeperate way, but in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and Society, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11. and that Communion will be an help to their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, a way and means of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God. When we ſpeak of our Immediate Communion with God in Heaven,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104582:31"/>
we are not to underſtand it abſolutely, that there ſhall be no mediums between us and the tranſcendant Majeſty of God; for there will be the Humane nature of Chriſt, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, who in a Coel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Communion of Saints will then be in its Perfection and fulleſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the Church triumphant. And Love, Holineſs and Communicativeneſs, which is the life of Communion, then will flouriſh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. You muſt there enjoy Chriſt your Head, not alone, but in fellowſhip with all his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body. Hence I ſaid in the Deſcription [All together] they ſhall have fruition of God All together, in the Higheſt Heaven for evermore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.22, 23. We now come and are joyned to that body by Myſtical Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but then by way of actual Communion.</p>
            <p>Conſider here. 1. There will be only true and Bleſſed Saints together in Heaven, no mixture of unſound ones, or ſecret enemies; there the Communion will be abſolutely pure, ſuch as is not to be expected, nor no rule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes us to expect or inſiſt upon in the Church on earth; for here there will be a

Though we cannot tell you the particular manner and order of it now, (it will excel in order, as well as otherwiſe.) Yet to be ſure it will be Precious and Glorious, and full of ſweetneſs and Comfort: And there will be full time, ſeaſon and opportunity for it at large. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were talking together with Chriſt in that little repreſentation of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.3.

               </gap>ſt Heaven. 1. It is the Excellency, top and Summity, the Crown and Glory of the whole World: As it is the higheſt in place, ſo in Nature and Excellency the Chief and Choiceſt part of the whole Creation: As <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Type of it was called the Glory of all the Lands, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.6. So is this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Glory of the whole Creation, the Faireſt, Beſt and Goodlieſt piece therein. That may be one reaſon of that Name, the Heaven of Heavens: As Song of Songs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the beſt, moſt excellent Song, ſo this is the moſt Excellent Heaven; all other Heavens, and ſo all other parts of the World are far inferiour to it. It is the choiceſt place in the whole Creation; the beſt Room God hath in this ſtately Houſe that he hath built. Now the Lord lets you ſit without among the Servants in the outer Rooms, in the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin (the Smoaking Kitchin) of the World, this Earth I mean: But then (when grown to full Age, and fully Married to his Son,) he will entertain you in the beſt Room he hath (the Faireſt that ever he built) his own dwelling Room and Preſence Chamber of Heaven. This lower World, (Earth and Aire, and Starry Heaven) they are but as the Out-houſes and Hovels that are ſet up
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104582:40"/>
more incuriouſly: But this Heaven is the dwelling houſe and place of the Great King. And hence it is the immediate Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10. Men build other Cities (and we know they are full of Splendor and Beauty;) but God built this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. It is a City (a place of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of all that Nature and Art could heap together, ſo Cities are among men) and a City of Gods building; whoſe Artificer and Builder is God, the word is: As if God ſhewed his Art, what an Artiſt, what an Artificer, a Maſter-builder he is in making this Heaven: Of all his Works this is the moſt Artificial and Maſter-piece. Now we ſee this lower World is ſtately Fabrick, a Beautiful frame, eſpecially as it would have been if not defiled by ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. and 8.3. and 19.4, 5. What then is that higher ſtory of the third Heaven, which excells in Excellency, Splendor, Glory and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as much as it doth in Height; the the Spaciouſneſs and Local Situation of it, ſpeaks and notifies its Tranſcendant Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. It's ſtately height [the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:] As the Earth the loweſt, ſo the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the higheſt Region, it is above (the higheſt of all) in place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (far above all theſe viſible Heavens, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10. and yet they are of a vaſt height) and as far above all in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

of Nature and in Glory, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.39. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.11. Earthly things are low things, and therefore placed here below down in the Vally: But that is above, on high, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.18. It is the higheſt place of all, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. and 19.38.) there is none above it, and truly you can aſpire no higher than what is there, ſo its ſpaciouſneſs and vaſt largeneſs; the Earth (though 21600. Miles in compaſs) is but as a point, <hi>i. e.</hi> of no conſiderable bigneſs (of no ſenſible quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity) compared with this ſecond, lower, Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heaven; what is it then to that Heaven of Heavens, which is the higheſt and utmoſt Rim and Circumference of the whole Univerſe, containing within the Bowels or Concave of it, this whole lower World: And ſo of greater compaſs than the largeſt of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Heavens. And we may probably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that its own height and wideneſs (I mean from rhe Pavement to the Roof of it) holds proportion with its Compaſs or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, ſo that it is every way of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant vaſtneſs and largeneſs. A Beggar lives in a narrow little Cottage, but a Prince in a ſpacious Pallace. That place that God erected for his own dwelling place (the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Glory) is ſuitable to ſo great a Majeſty, as 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 2.5, 9. Yet is God not contained in it, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.18.) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104582:41"/>
it by his power, and filling it all with his Beatifical preſence and Glory. And as <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. there (in that ſpacious Region) are Manſions and Rooms, and Lots and Dwellings for all the thouſands of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ones. You ſhall be no way ſtraitned when you come there (no Tribe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> complain there of the ſtraitneſs of their Lot.) But may ſay as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.5. the way to it is ſtrait, but the Kingdom it ſelf is great and large.</p>

By that time you are well in, you are put out again: By that time your Harp is well in Tune, and begins to ſound well, you are fain to lay it aſide: Wordly occaſions, Bodily neceſſities take you off, and interrupt your talk with God, and with his Word, and with your own Hearts.

(for they cannot take in all at once) but all ſerving to continue and carry on their fruition of God, and the Bliſs and Glory thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Without End. The Happineſs and Glory of the Saints in Heaven, ſhall never, never have an end, but continue to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as long as Heaven is Heaven, as long as God is God. This implyes that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhall never be loſt by, or taken away from any Saint in Heaven, nor ſhall he ever fall from it, or be removed from it, bereaved of it, once in Heaven, and ever there; once put on that Crown of Glory, it ſhall never fall from thy Head. <hi>Adam</hi> was in a good condition in Paradiſe once; but he loſt it, fell from it, and ſo he was driven out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; being in that honour, he continued not as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 49. and hence we may ſay as <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16. But no danger of that there: All that are carried to Heaven, are there ſet in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable eſtate by Chriſt Jeſus.

            <p>Hence this Heavenly Glory will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly your own, never to paſs away from you, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.12. Nor</p>

No change or alteration ſhall ever put an end to it: But it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue forever and ever, World without end. This is the Crown of that Crown of Glory that it is Eternal, Everlaſting, never to be loſt, never come to an end. This damps and imbitters all Earthly Joyes and Comforts that they are but Temporary, you muſt leave them, or they you; they are but a faſhion that paſſeth away. But this unſpeakably ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Heavens Joyes, that they ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever; it ſhall alwayes be thus. No danger or poſſibility of loſing or ending this Happineſs. This [Ever] is the ſtinging tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the damned in Hell, and it is the the raviſhing Joy of the Glorified in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The length of time that we have or hope to have in any thing, adds unſpeakably to the ſweetneſs and Comfort of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. The Worldling feigns to himſelf a kind of Eternity in his Poſſeſſions and Enjoyments, elſe he could not look at himſelf ſo happy as he does, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. That was <hi>Davids</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 19. Oh then how Joyful is that Joy, how Heavenly that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how Glorious is that Glory that hath this ingredient, to be in truth (not in fancy or dream) Eternal: Not for many years only,

The evil things, the Sufferings, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Tribulations of the World, that lye in the way to Heaven; and that the World does or can bring upon the faithful, they are ſmall matters compar'd with the Glory that they are paſſing to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. for theſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are but for a little while, but that Glory that follows is Eternal, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. who would ſtick at a few moments trouble and travel, to go unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſt and Glory. If God call you to travel for Heaven through a few paces of troubleſome and dirty way, through a few dayes of trouble and tryal (<hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10.) Is it not a ſhame to boggle at this, or to think it an hard bargain; or to be diverted and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the ſtraight way to Heaven by ſuch things, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.

But it hath alſo told us, and ſet before us the Glory that ſhall follow, this ſhould ſwallow up the other, and make us endure them eaſily, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.2. and 11.26.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="1">1. They are at Death immediatly made perfect in Grace and Holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. perfectly freed from all ſin, and endued with all heavenly perfection of mind and will; of which what it is we ſpoke before. Death puts an end to the death of ſin in the Saint, he reſts from the Labour and Burden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and he is clothed with perfect Holineſs, fit for that place of Heaven and Heavenly preſence of God which he is paſſing into.</p>

What ſome of the Saints and Prophets in Scripture have taſted of in raptures and Extaſies, and <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. - 4. for a little (ſee Mr. <hi>Norton</hi>'s Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Evang. pag. 339.341. wherein the Soul abſtracted from uſe of bodily helps and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, had a more immediate viſional Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Objects preſented) that and more then that, doth the Soul departed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy (even a perpetual Viſion of God and frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Joyes of Heaven without the Body) from Death to the Reſurrection.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104582:51"/>
nature of the Soul: And was long ſince largely confuted by <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Pſychopanychia Opuſe.</hi> pag. 449.476. one of the firſt things he wrote.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How kind is God to his people, that he will not put them off ſo long as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection before they enter into this Glory; though the Body cannot (according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed order) come at it before, yet the Soul ſhall have poſſeſſion preſently. When Death muſt ſend the Body to the Grave, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. then he will take the Soul into Heaven and have its company there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This may ſweeten Death to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and make them cheerfully yield up their Spirits into the hand of God, who ſtands ready to receive them. There is a preſent object of Glory before them, a Joy imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to be enjoyed, ſet before them, which may make them cheerfully paſs into it through the dark entry of Death. Though there be a Land and Grave of darkneſs for the Body (which yet is ſweetned by the Burial of Chriſt) yet an Inheritance of the Saints <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n light, which the Soul ſhall preſently paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this is that that over-ballances Death and abſence from the Body, leaving the World, even the preſence of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being with Chriſt which is beſt of all. This ſhould make us willing to leave the Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. leave the old Crazy Rotten-houſe of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104582:51"/>
the Body, to go into the new building, and into the boſome of Chriſt into Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, - 4. And this is preſently to be enjoyed, you ſhall preſently be with Chriſt when you leave this Body; things remote affect not ſo much; but this is near and juſt before you; as Chriſt comforted them with that [this day] <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43. The day of your dying, is the day of your living in Paradiſe, in Glory: The day of your falling into the Earth, (as to the Body) is the day of your aſcending and being taken up to Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.51. Going to the Grave and going to Heaven, they go together to the Faithtful (inſeparably together) and there is more Comfort in the latter, than diſcomfort in the former: No ſooner diſſolved, but you are in the Angels Arms to be carried into Chriſts Boſom, even before you can be upon Friends Shoulders to be carried to the Grave. The ſame ſtep whereby you leave the World, you go to the Father, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. You no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, but you are with Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. are gathered to him, (and that Bleſſed company and people that are with him, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 35.29. Oh how ſhould this lift up all the Saints above the feat of that that can but kill the Body, but pull out the Pins of this old houſe and diſſolve that, that is the furtheſt that all created power can go, <hi>Luk.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Now conſider what further Glory ſhall be added to the Saints (for the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating and Conſummation of their Glory and Happineſs) at and after the Reſurrection upon the re-union of the Soul and Body. It is a more incompleat,<note rend="inter">Bucan. 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But at the Reſurrection of the Body and re-union thereof to the Soul, they ſhall have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fulneſs and Conſummation of their Glory. This compleatneſs of Glory (and ſo the Acceſſion or addition to what they had before) at and after the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may take up in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They ſhall then have full Conqueſt and victory over Death, and full deliverance from the Curſe. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is Death; and that is not fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and ſwallowed up till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26, 54, 56, 57. Though the Soul dye not, yet Death hangs and abides upon the Body, and ſo upon the perſon, and continues to make up a ſeparation between
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104582:52"/>
thoſe two, Soul and Body, (which had it not been for ſin, ſhould never have been parted) untill it be raiſed, and ſhake off its duſt, and the re-union effected hence; the Curſe is not fully, finally and totally abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to the Saints till the Reſurrection: For Death is a fruit of the Curſe. While the Body is turned into, and abides in its duſt, there is ſomewhat of its Ancient Curſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3.19. It hath ſome hold of them while the Grave holds the Body: But when that is raſed, and hath ſhaken off its duſt and Corruption, and this Corruptible put on Immortality; now here is compleat deliverance from the Curſe, and every Rag and Remnant of it: For Chriſt at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection had a compleat Victory over the Curſe, it can hold him under no lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ger; ſo hath the Saint. Here is now a Redemption of the Body, and ſo of the whole man from the Curſe, and from all Enemies; even the laſt of them, which is Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. There is the Redemption of the Soul before (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, as it ſtands in relation to the Body, and naturally deſires Re-union with it, ſo it may be ſaid not to be fully Redeemed; that is, the perſon is not fully Redeemed while any part of it lyes under the Curſe.) But now is the Redemption of the Body from Death and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104582:53"/>
Vileneſs, and ſo now the whole man, the perſon is compleatly Redeemed (delivered, ſet free) from the whole Curſe. Hence it is called the day of Redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. Hence when Chriſt tells us of a full Life that he will give us, he tells us of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40, 54. He hath not finiſht his quickning work (his work of giving life) till then.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Body ſhall then be Glorified; there will be the acceſſion of the Glory of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was not before. That part of each Saint till now (till the Reſurrection) was not Glorified, but lay in the duſt and among the Worms in vileneſs and debaſement: But now the Body ſhall not only be raiſed up and live, and ſo be freed from death, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but alſo be carried and adorned with Glory, Honour, Beauty and Excellency un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable; be made a Glorious Body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. An impaſſible Beautiful, Agile, Strong, Spiritual Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42, 43, 44. Of this Glory of the Body; what it is, we ſpoke ſomething before (touching the Perſonal perfection of a Glorified Saint) I only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it now, as part of the Additional and Compleat Glory that acrew's to the Saints at and after the Reſurrection, which was not before. And this will increaſe the Joy of the Soul, (the Glory of the Body will be an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104582:53"/>
addition to the Joy of the Soul) and ſo the Happineſs and Glory of the Soul conſidered extenſively (<hi>i. e.</hi> in its relation to,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. <hi>Suppl. Qu.</hi> 93. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <hi>Mr.</hi> Nort. <hi>Orthod. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. pag.</hi> 352, 453.</note> and participation with the Body, rejoycing in its Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will be greater after the Reſurrection than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though conſidered inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and intrinſically (<hi>viz.</hi> as to the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Happineſs of the Soul, that conſiſts in its viſion and fruition of God) ſo it is the ſame before and after the Reſurrection. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive additional Glory, or Joy of the Soul will be increaſed, through the Eſſence of the Happineſs of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence the perſon (the whole perſon conſiſting of Soul and Body) of each Saint ſhall then be Glorified, or after an Happy Joyfull meeting of thoſe two old friends, Soul and Body; there will be an enjoyment of compleat Happineſs in and by the whole mar. It was but a peice of a Saint that was Glorified before, (but a part, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the principal part, the Soul) but now the whole, the entire perſon (for neither the Soul alone, nor the Body alone, is the perſon, but the entire whole made up of both) that is now Glorified. And look as the condition of a part is attributed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to an integral whole, as if a Leg or an
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104582:54"/>
Arm be hurt or wounded, we ſay the man is hurt or wounded: ſo the perſon may be truly ſaid to be inglorious (not Glorified) while an Eſſential part (the Body) is ſo: Though the Soul be Glorified (and ſo the man in regard of that part) yet properly the perſon is not till both Soul and Body be, ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. not Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified becauſe his Manhood was not. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>Abraham</hi> properly (<hi>i. e.</hi> the perſon of <hi>Abraham</hi>) does not enjoy God and the good of the Covenant, (Eternal Life) unleſs his Body be raiſed: Indeed the Soul of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might, but not <hi>Abraham</hi> properly; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is a perſon conſiſting of Soul and Body. It is properly but the Soul of ſuch a man that is Glorified before the Reſurrection: But now the man, the perſon is the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire man conſiſting in Soul and Body. And Hence 1. There will be an Happy and Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting or re-union of the Soul and Body, this re-union will be mutually Joyful, and the Joy of the whole. For the Soul of man was naturally made to ſubſiſt in a Body; hence it is incompleat and imperfect without it, (it hath not its perfect and compleat manner of ſubſiſting in its ſeparate eſtate) hence it deſireth and longeth after re-union with the Body, and by re-union it receives, though not any Eſſential, yet an Integral perfection. And as the parting of theſe two
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104582:54"/>
old friends, was ſorrowful, and contrary to nature, or to natural inclination, (though ſwallowed up and over-ballanced by that greater good, the preſence of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 23. yet in it ſelf ſorrowful, and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto nature) ſo their meeting again will be wonderful joyful; they meeting in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Joy and Bliſs. When the Soul is in Glory it now wants but one thing to make its Joy compleat, <hi>viz.</hi> To have the Body with it in the ſame Glory: This is now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and now it is come to its full reſt. 2. There is now henceforth (from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and ſo on to all Eternity) an actual plenary enjoyment of Glory and Happineſs by the whole man in both the parts of Soul and Body. That Glory that was before but in a part, is now diffuſed into the whole: And the Soul acts more perfectly in a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body, (becauſe more naturally) then it did in its ſeperate eſtate.<note rend="inter">Aquinas <hi>ubi ſuprà.</hi>
               </note> Indeed now on Earth, the Body is a clog to the Soul; and hence the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Soul hath a fuller and freer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Happineſs than it can have here: But the Glorified Body being made a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> perfectly ſubject and conformable to the Spirit and Noble ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Soul: It will be an help, not an hinderance, and ſo an advantage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104582:55"/>
to the Soul, and to the whole man in taking in thoſe pleaſures that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. As the Souls (or the Saints) ſtate of ſubſiſting will be more perfect and compleat when re-united, ſo will its operation be: The Saint will then with bodily eyes behold the man Chriſt (this is more then he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) with infinite contentation; that <hi>Job</hi> put an Emphaſis upon, that with thoſe eyes he ſhould ſee God, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. with Bodily Ears hear, and Tongue utter forth the Praiſes of God: With and through Bodily ſenſes act upon, and take in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Heavenly objects, Chriſt and the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is a great Addition to what was before. 4. There ſhall then be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Glory of the Saints unto the whole World: This is an eminent and remarkable acceſſion of Glory that ſhall be to the Saints at the Reſurrection and laſt Judgment: And when the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll the Glory that ſhall be then, it hath ſpecial reſpect unto this. The Glory that the Saints have on Earth, and alſo that which they have now in Heaven in their Souls, it is a ſecret and hidden thing from the World, (they go up and down the World now under a mean outſide, and look like other men, and they do to viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance as others do, and their Bodies are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104582:55"/>
carried to the Graves as others, and turned to the duſt: And whither their Souls go is not known; their Happineſs is an unſeen thing by any other eye but that of Faith.) But then it ſhall be revealed and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the wonderful Glory of God, and to their ſingular comfort and advancement, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. Now the Saints have only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Glory, (hidden under a cloud of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, under the Image of the Earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> which go to the Grave with them) but then revealed not only to them in a word and promiſe, but in, and upon them in real and viſible accompliſhment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.3, 4. Neither Chriſt nor Chriſtians do now appear to a blind World as they be, but then they ſhall; then their Glory ſhall be made manifeſt unto all. So 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Vid.</hi> Dutch <hi>Annot.</hi> Conſider a little here. 1. To whom. 2. Of what this manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall then be.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104582:56"/>
In ſpecial. 1. They ſhall then be manifeſted one to another. We hope well now of the good ſtate of the dying Saints, Friends, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but then we ſhall be fully certain when we ſhall meet them in the Congregation of the Righteous, and at the right hand of Chriſt at the great day, and ſee them finding Mercy of the Lord at that day, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. when the Parents ſhall meet the Children, and the Friend his Friends, Brethren and gracious Acquaintance there among the ſheep at Chriſts Right hand. This happily may be known by the Souls departed before in Heaven: But moſt fully and openly then, which is the time when every one hath his publick and open Judgment to be ſeen of all, though he had his perſonal, private and particular Judgment before. But beſides, they ſhall not only know each others ſtate in General, but in Particular, hear of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Graces, and Gracious Actings of the Faithful (their Brethren in Chriſt) and all the Gracious dealings of God with them, the whole progreſs of his Love from firſt to laſt, laid open then, in that Revelation-day, the day of Judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. this will endear them each to other. 2.

The Saints ſhall Judge wicked Men and Devils, and ſurely they ſhall ſee, and know, and behold them ſit as their Judges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 2, 3. ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.18. They that here counted them mad-men, Fanatical, Frantick, Conceited, Humourſom, Fooliſh Creatures ſhall then ſee that they made the wiſeſt choice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They did not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them now, as they ſhall admire them then, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of what there will be a manifeſtation, or what in ſpecial will then be manifeſted (of and concerning the Saints, and their Glory) to all the World, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Graces and good Works, the ſervice they have done for God, both in doing and ſuffering, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.14. The good works of the Godly, as well as the evil Works of the wicked, ſhall then be laid open, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> Every good man for what is good, ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. A tryed Faith that hath held
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104582:57"/>
out through many tryalls, ſhall then be held up before the World and Commended (Praiſed, Honoured) by the Lord Jeſus, which will not be ſo much the Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves, as of his own Grace and work in them: For all is of him, their good works, the acts and the fruits of their Graces; even ſuch as themſelves can hardly tell how to own: He will own them, and ſpeak of them before all the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. - 40. though they be poor things in themſelves, and as from them; yet as they are the fruit of his Spirit and Grace in them, the ſtamp of his own Image; the effects of ſincere love to him: The poor but childiſh actings of his children here, the things he hath made Gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to, and ſo he will make much of them, and put an honour upon them before the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.5. The Lord Jeſus will confeſs, acknowledge and own every one of them before all the World, and will confeſs all they have done for him: He will ſay, theſe are they that have continued with me in my Temptations, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.28.) that have preferred a good Conſcience before all Riches and Honours; that renounced the World to follow me fully, that forſook all for me, and loved not their Lives to the Death: Theſe are my Brethren, Siſters, Friends, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that have done the will of my Father,<hi>Mat.</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:104582:57"/>
12.49, 50. He will not be aſhamed of us then, if we be not aſhamed of him now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Crown of Happineſs and Glory, which the Lord hath laid up for them, and will then actually and fully put upon them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 8. a Crown of Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> which the Righteous and Faithful God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Gracious Promiſes made to his own Grace in us, and the appointment declared to all that run for the Prize of the Heavenly Calling, will beſtow on the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It is the Saints Coronation-day, and that muſt needs be a day of great Glory to them, when they ſhall be openly Crowned before the World: They are now Heirs and have Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Kingdom, but that is their Coronation-day: He that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince, or lawful King, yet at the Solemnity of Coronation, appears in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Splendor, and hath eminent Honour put upon him: Such a day, is the day of Judgment to the Saints; they are now Princes and Kings unto God by Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then they ſhall be brought forth and Crowned before all the World, Actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled into their Kingdom, and into the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Glory thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.</p>
            <p>So it is the Saints Marriage-day, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of their Marriage with Chriſt after the Eſpouſalls here; wherein therefore
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104582:58"/>
they ſhall be brought forth in Robes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, befitting the Spouſe of the King of Kings, and that in the fight of all the World. The Glory that God hath put upon his own Children, and Chriſt upon his Spouſe and Fellow-heirs, ſhall then be manifeſted and openly revealed. Hence</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Love of God and Chriſt to them in all this, in all his wonderful works of Grace, (of wiſdom power and goodneſs) in all he hath done in and for them, in Electing, Calling, Juſtifying, Adopting, Sanctifying, preſerving and keeping, and carrying on by his power to Salvation, and now fully Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying: The whole Chain and Circle of his Love, all the wonders of Mercy and Grace wherein he hath abounded toward his Saints, ſhall then be revealed and diſcovered, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1, 2. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. The Glory of the Saints ſhall be ſo revealed, as may Glorify God and make him admirable in all he hath done in and for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. As God will then reveal; ſet forth and ſhew abroad his wrath and Juſtice on the Veſſels of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. and 9.22. So he will reveal his Love, Grace and Mercy, towards the Veſſels of Mercy in that day of Revelation. The whole Myſtery of Grace will be then unfolded in the Glory of it, and to the Glory and Praiſe of God, which as it is the laſt end of all Gods Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104582:58"/>
toward the Elect, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.2. So that end ſhall then be attained. We may ſay as <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.26, 27. Chriſt (the whole myſtery of Chriſt) ſhall then appear in his full Glory; and Grace is the ſum and top of the whole myſtery of Chriſt. And this will be to the ſingular Comfort and Joy of the Saints, as well as to the Glory of God; the benefit of the compleat and final pardon of all their ſins, and this opened in its Glory, what refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and joy will it be, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. the like may be ſaid of all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Superiority of the Saints over (above) the wicked, and being preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and in a Condition infinitly better and more Happy then they, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14. They (the upright) ſhall be the better men, and better on't then in a more Happy and Honourable Condition, exalted far above them, while they ſeemed to be the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the world, under Poverty and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution) and this ſhall plainly appear and be ſeen in the morning of the Reſurrection. Then will that plainly appear that the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23. The <hi>Eſau</hi>'s of the World, the great Doers and Buſslers and mighty Hunters therein, ſhall come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the younger Brother; the deſpicable, the more unlikely the <hi>Jacob's</hi>; the plain men that dwell in Tents, the pious and Godly, though
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104582:59"/>
never ſo poor and mean and deſpicable in the World, whoſe out-ſide promiſes not ſo much. Here in this World, men and things are oft miſ-placed, Servants on Horſe-back, (<hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> Servants of Servants; ſo the wicked are of ſervile, buſie, ignoble Spirits and Conditions; yet of him, of ſuch oft are the Nimrods, the mighty Hunters in the Earth.

Piety and Godlineſs ſhall then be honoured and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced however it is deſpiſed now: And the poor if Pious, ſhall have the Crown, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5, and 1.12. that will then appear, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.6. Yea, and then the righteous Cauſe of the Lords people ſhall be judged, owned and maintained, which will tend to their Glory who have oft been condemned unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this World, as Chriſt himſelf was. That Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt Jeſus hath been oft appealed to by Martyrs and Sufferers, and he will then receive thoſe Appeals, and judge them righteouſly; and that openly to the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104582:59"/>
confuſion of all the unrighteous Judgments that have paſſed here in the time of this World. Devils ſhall then receive their doom and puniſhment for all their wicked mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations of the Saints and oppoſitions of Chriſts Kingdom in one way or other; and all enemies deſtroyed and brought down under the feet, not only of Chriſt, but of his Church alſo. And this final and total ſubduing of enemies, and exalting of the Church ſhall be ſeen and known openly and beheld. And this manifeſtation of the Sons of God, is that which the whole Creation and all the works of Providence are in Travel for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. - 22, 23. The Glory of the Sons of God is formed and prepared in the womb of Providence now; but that is the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of the manifeſtation of it, then the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of God is finiſhed, and the work of God upon, and in his Saints is brought forth in its full beauty and perfection.</p>
            <p>Thus of the Manifeſtation of the Saints Glory at the laſt day. Add we another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſhewing the Compleatneſs and Conſummation of their Glory then.</p>
            <p n="5">5. At the laſt day the whole number of the Saints will be compleated, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body of Chriſt entirely filled up, and then will God compleatly and moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly communicate himſelf to the whole at
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104582:60"/>
once. Chriſt will then repreſent his Kingdom and Body compleat and entire, every way come to its full growth and conſiſtency (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13.) as it ſhall abide forever; and in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Eſtate, he with the Father and the Spirit will Communicate himſelf thereto, in the moſt perfect and Glorious manner, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. So the Saints that are now in Heaven, ſhall not be made perfect without their fellows, and till the remnant of their Brethren (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.11.) have run through their militant courſe, and be come in; there is yet a further perfection they ſhall have, when they are all come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: When the Body Myſtical is entire and full, then it hath its fulleſt Beauty, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Glory: For every member addeth ſomething<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is in ſome ſort a defect, while any one is wanting: For the Joy and Glory of every member of the Body, is the Joy and Glory of the whole, and every one ſerves to compleat the Communion and Comfort of the whole. And when the Lord hath all his Children about him, (none are mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſtumble not at Gods work becauſe 'tis now wrapt in Clouds; why it is not yet come to its Iſſue, it is but a doing. Children and fools (they ſay) muſt not look on things half done; we are ſo fooliſh we cannot ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beauty of Gods work while it is but half done, not made up and finiſhed.

gives out of his Common bounty, even to wicked men in this World: What then will he give out of his ſpecial and everlaſting love to his own Children and Friends in Heaven? Worldly and wicked men which are his Slaves, yea enemies and appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; yet in the preſent time of patience and bounty, the Lord cuts out to many of them great things, ſuch things as the World accounts very great, and as are great in themſelves, though compared with Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, are very little; Riches, Wealth, Thouſands and Ten Thouſands of Gold and Silver, Sumptuous Buildings, Houſes full of all Good Things, Lands and Livings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, ſometimes Crowns and Kingdoms, Scepters and Dominions of vaſt extent, the Splendor whereof (even of that Glory that ſometimes worldly men are arrayed with) even dazles the eyes of beholders. Sometimes men of the World do glitter and gliſter with Glory, an earthly Glory and Splendor, ſuch as ſtrikes an awe and admiration into beholders, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49, 16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.31, 37, 38. and 5.18, 19. why if ſuch be the Glory of the earth given to the earthly and wicked men: What will be the true Glory of Heaven that God will beſtow upon the Veſſels of Glory there. <hi>Luther</hi> ſometimes called the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire (that vaſt Empire, containing ſo

Some men of the World which have their Portion in this Life, have a great Portion here, even their Belly full, as much as heart can wiſh; as much of ſenſitive worldly good as they can poſſibly take in, all manner of abundance of earthly delicates, and this out of God his Treaſure, becauſe it is hid and laid up in the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104582:64"/>
ſeveral ſtore-houſes of this lower World, (Earth, Air and Sea) and brought forth by, the workings of his Providence and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them: So that theſe things are given out of Gods Treaſury by his common bounty to the men of the World. And if you ſpeak of what Earth can afford, they are great things that are moſt given to them: But <hi>David</hi> hath a greater perfection than all this, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 171.5. But thus look upon the conſolation that many wicked men have here (<hi>Luk</hi> 16.25. and 6.24.) which muſt needs be a poor thing, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.10, 11.) a nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the portion of the choſen Saints of God in Heaven, (when God ſhall ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to pour out Love and Mercy into thoſe Veſſels thereof) and yet often it is much, it is ſtrange to ſee what God hath given to ſome vile men this way; as that they are ready to be cryed up for the only happy men. This is a ready and uſeful meditation, when we read in ſtory of the Magnificence, Riches and Greatneſs of Worldly men, or ſee and obſerve any inſtances thereof; to think, oh then what is the Glory and Happineſs that God hath prepared (not of the ſame kind, for worldly ſenſitive delights ſcrued up to the height, but an Happineſs of an higher, a Spiritual and Caeleſtial nature) for them that love him, and for the ſubjects of his

Conſider what the Saints enjoy in this World; I mean not of outward things ſo much, (for they often have but little that way; they ſhall not uſually have very much of Earth, leſt they forget Heaven) but of Spiritual and Heavenly Comforts, and good things; their fore-taſts of future Glory, they are often exceeding ſweet and precious, a thouſand times better than all the Earthly outward enjoyments of worldly men: Yet all they have here is but a taſte, but an earneſt, an handfull of firſt fruits, <hi>Epeſ.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. What then is and will be the full draught, the whole bargain, the whole Harveſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

Should you judge by the minds and wayes of moſt of the Sons of men? You would think there were no higher or better thing to be minded than the good of this World: But the point ſhews us, that that is better and more excellent: What is all the Glory and good of this World, to that of the Glory to come? It is no more, nor ſo much as a pebble ſtone to a Pearl, or Husks to Bread, or Dirt to Gold, or Rags to Robes: Who would take up with the former, when he may have the latter?

            <p n="1">1.

Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 21.</p>
            <p>It is through and by means of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt (his obedience whereby being imputed to us, we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Juſtification, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 18.) that Grace powerfully accompliſheth our Eternal Life.

               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. From the work of Vocation, the tendency and ſcope whereof is to bring us to this Eternal Glory. Text.

               </gap>rfect Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God as the end of our Race or Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and to travel towards it, toward that mark of Heavenly Glory which is the prize that we are called to run for, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 25. The Lord calleth us out of this World to be men of another World, to take up our Lot and Portion in Heaven, and to ſeek and wait for it, being as ſtrangers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104582:79"/>

It is a Chriſtians Calling (the buſineſs he is called to attend upon) to get to Heaven, to ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality to come. The Grace begun in Vocation hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable connexion which tendeth to, and iſſueth in (groweth up to) the perfection of Eternal Glory. Glory is but the Harveſt of that ſeed that is ſown in Effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: It is the perfect man which is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in Vocation.</p>
            <p>If the ſeed be ſown, the Child born, as it is in Vocation or Converſion, (Regeneration) then the harveſt muſt needs follow. Calling is the firſt patent link of the Chain (for Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is latent in the Counſel of God the firſt openwork of Grace upon an Elect perſon; and Glorification is the laſt, but the connexion between them is inſeperable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. And alſo Vocation is the ſtrait gate that leads to Life Eternal, through which all muſt paſs that get to Glory, and by which they are prepared for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23, 24. Hence none but ſuch, and all ſuch, all the Effectually Called ſhall infallibly be brought to Eternal Glory: If God have begun the work of Grace in Calling, he will finiſh it in Heavenly Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</p>

            <p>The beſt ſervices and ſufferings of the Saints, do not deſerve or merit any ſuch thing as Heavens Glory: But the Lord is pleaſed according to his free promiſe, and abundant Grace, Richly to reward ſuch poor things above their worth.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:104582:83"/>
take theſe two or three Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every time you neglect or refuſe the Call and offer of the Goſpel, you put away this Glory, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. The Lord Calls you (on his part to Eternal Glory, or) to come and receive both Grace and Glory in and with Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Heaven is offered you when Chriſt is offered. Hence you ſlight and refuſe, and turn your backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Glory of Heaven, when you neglect the Call of the Goſpel, or diſ-accept of Chriſt offered therein. The Salvation of God (Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation) is offered to you (<hi>Act.</hi> 28.28.) and you will not hear on't; you deſpiſe all the wonderfull Happineſs of Heaven that we have been ſpeaking of. Oh fearful wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, monſtrous madneſs and miſerable miſs — of Heaven! So when you will not pray nor meditate, nor hear, nor wait at Chriſt's gates: It is as much as to ſay, that you are not for Eternal Glory, which is to be ſought and obtained in ſuch wayes, and how Juſtly, how unexcuſably do ſuch periſh. The Lord is calling you to Eternal Glory, but you turn away from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, what it is, for the ſake whereof you loſe or turn away from this Glory and neglect the way to it. Why, a vile luſt, a vain World, theſe are choſen, and Heaven refuſed; theſe have your affections,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104582:84"/>
when Chriſt and all his Glory can have none of them: And ſo for the ſake of thoſe, for this preſent World (a heap of vanities, a faſhion that paſſeth away) you loſe all the good of that to come. The voice of the World calling us to Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, cannot be heard for the voice of the World calling us to preſent Objects and things here: And ſo for Earth men loſe Heaven, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.21, 22. What a mad and fooliſh bargain and choice is this! And yet thus it is; there is never a ſinner that miſſes Heaven, but he chuſes Earth before it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You loſe and miſs of this Glory when it was brought near to you in the Call and offer of the Goſpel, when according to the order of means you might have had it: When you were called to Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> by the outward Call of the Goſpel (a real Call, though not to you Effectual) the reflection upon this will be one day bitter and tormenting. From under a Call to Heaven to drop to Hell; from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a word and call and offer of Salvation to Perdition, what a dreadful thing will that be. (<hi>i. e.</hi> in the Eternal diſpenſation of it) you that live in the viſible Church, you had an Intereſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, (it was in your hands as it were, left with you, and you had the offer of it, the diſpenſation of it,

worth ſo doing.

It ſerves to invite, perſwade and draw us to Chriſt Jeſus, to cloſe with him, embrace him, or believe on him according to the Call and offer of the Goſpel; ſeeing by him, and by believing on him you ſhall obtain Eternal Glory. This further great benefit is to be had with and by Chriſt. This is part of the Eſtate and Riches that this great Suitor that makes love to your Souls is poſſeſſed of, and will impart to all that imbrace him: Your believing on him, if you believe in truth, ſhall be to Life Everlaſting, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. All the Doctrine of Chriſt (his Perſon, Offices, Benefits) is attractive unto Faith, (and to improve it that way, is a principlal part of our ſcope in theſe Diſcourſes) and ſo is this part of it alſo that we are now upon. Every one of his Benefits are full of Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on him; and ſo this of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104582:90"/>
Glorification, and this part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſummation thereof in future Eternal Glory. As we improved other particulars before; ſo let us make a little improvement of this to that which is the great end of the whole Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> to make Chriſt ſweet to us, Glorious in our eyes, and to draw us to cloſe with him. And this the Text leads us to, <hi>viz.</hi> Hence to lift up the voice of the Call of the Goſpel in your Ears, and to preſs you to attend and obey it: For God therein Calls us to Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus. Look as by Effectual Calling (<hi>i. e.</hi> by obeying and anſwering the Call of the Goſpel) we are entred into a ſtate of Eternal Glory, ſo as to be infallibly brought unto it by Chriſt Jeſus. So the word (the General Call) of the Goſpel Calls us to come, and take (to enter upon the poſſeſſion of) this Glory in and with Chriſt Jeſus: When the Goſpel Calls us to Chriſt, and fellowſhip with him by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it Calls us to Eternal Glory. Oh then hearken to this Call, and obey it: That is the Exhortation that we are now to preſs upon you here before the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17. All things are ready provided in Chriſt, and ſo this thing Eternal Glory. Come in, and come home to Chriſt Jeſus: Imbrace him withall your hearts, receive and poſſeſs him, and in and with him you ſhall poſſeſs Eternal Glory, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104582:90"/>It is now given you in the promiſe upon the firſt day and hour of your true believing: And it ſhall Infallibly be given to you in the accompliſhment. Attend and obey the Call of the Goſpel (a Glorious Call it is, which Calls unto ſuch Glory) and the Lord will by a firm deed (a ſure promiſe) preſently make over to you both Grace here, and Glory hereafter, Everlaſting Life and Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Oh hearken to this word of the Lord, this voice of the High-calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus; you that have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been ſtooping down to the duſt, minding nothing but Earth and Vanity; yea running down hill in the way of ſin toward the loweſt Hell: Incline your Ear, and hearken to a motion and offer of Eternal Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; open your eyes and ſee the Lord Jeſus ſtanding withall Grace and Glory in his hands and inviting to him, to let out of your hands (<hi>i. e.</hi> out of your hearts) the trifles of the World, and take Eternal Glory in and with a Saviour: Behold Heaven is opened to you, the door ſtands open before you, if once at laſt you will be perſwaded to enter in. And you that have believed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, ſit not by as if this Exhortation did not concern you; but oh believe again, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt again, come to him afreſh with freſh and new ſweetneſs, with more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104582:91"/>
and eſtabliſhment in believing; ſo you ſhould do at every time he calls you, and ſets his Glory before you, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11.) and ſo at this time this day: Renew your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Imbraces of Chriſt Jeſus, and ſo your lively hope of this Glory. Chriſt delights to be often asking for our hearts, and ſetting himſelf before us as the attractive object of them; and we ſhould delight to be often giving our hearts to him, and claſping about him as the only Glorious, Lovely, hope and reſt, and portion of our Souls.</p>
            <p>Now for the purſuing of this Exhortation, or preſſing the Call of the Goſpel by this Argument of Eternal Glory to be had (and which we are Called to) by Chriſt Jeſus. Let us a little improve the point and Text before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of motive or quickning and perſwaſive conſiderations to draw our hearts to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of direction and help to guide us in our believing on him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of Anſwer to ſome Objections that tend to beat us from Believing.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, though it is God only can draw and perſwade, yet he does it by his word; and therefore we muſt apply our ſelves to ſpeak and hear, to liſten to ſuch quickning drawing Conſiderations as the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104582:91"/>
word of the Goſpel does ſuggeſt, and in that way the ſpirit breaths.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Lord Call thee to Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (or to come and receive Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs through Chriſt) then what does he Call thee from or out of? Why from a ſtate of Eternal wo and miſery, which is that that we are naturally in, and that belongs to us as ſinners, and as in our ſelves conſidered, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. The word of Chriſt therefore calls thee from Death to Life. Oh conſider what damnation is about thee; yea upon thee, conſidered in thy ſelf, and in thy Natural Eſtate, whereby thou lyeſt under all ſin, and under all Wrath, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, Spiritual and Eternal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. That work thou haſt done, and that wages (Death, Eternal Death) belongs and is due to thee, thou art ſinking under the burden of the Curſe (lying under it as without Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and it is all upon thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36.) ready every moment to drop into Hell, lyable to everlaſting ſeperation from God; to hear that doom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration from God; thou haſt the beginning on't already in the reſult of the guilt and power of ſin, in that dead, dark and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart of thine, and thy eſtrangement from God thereby, and this ſtrongly tends to perfect ſeparation from God, and that is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104582:92"/>
Hell as <hi>è contra,</hi> &amp;c. Why this ſhould make this word of Salvation, this offer of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and Call to come to Chriſt for it, wonderful ſweet and acceptable. Bread in Famine, Deliverance in Emminent dangers, Life to him that is going down to the pit, how precious is it? <hi>Job</hi> 33.22, 24. It is to one that is going down to the pit, that the Lord ſpeaks this Calling word, ſhould not that go to thy heart? As thou art going down to Hell, the Lord calls thee up to Heaven. When that doom is pronounced in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. and thoſe multitudes going away to Hell, ſuppoſe thy ſelf among them, and that one ſhould then come with a meſſage from God to call th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e back again, and to invite thee to go up with Chriſt in Heavenly Glory; what a raviſhing thing would that be! Why then there will be no place for recovery or hope: But now ſuch a like thing is really done to thee, thou art going down to the Pit among the Uncircumciſed, poſting on in the way to the loweſt Hell, under the Curſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet behold now the Lord Calls to thee to turn about, and accept of a Saviour, and of Eternal Life and Salvation in him. Thou poor periſhing Sinner, if thou haſt any mind to Salvation, it's offered thee freely in Chriſt, (<hi>Act.</hi> 16.31.) Is not this worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:104582:92"/>2. Remember what Glory it is that you are called up unto, or that is to be had by Chriſt Jeſus. Here reflect upon all the promiſes, all that hath been ſpoken of the Excellency of Heavenly Glory; which is indeed above what Tongue can ſpeak, or Heart conceive. Bleſſedneſs, perfect and Everlaſting Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, freedom from all evil, from the worſt of Evils (ſin, all ſin, that deadly and bitter evil that kills thee all the day long) the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and fruition of God, that Ocean of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, compared with which, the whole World is but a drop. Should the Lord offer you heaps of Gold and Silver, and bid you take them freely, what flocking would there be; and what hearkning would there be to ſuch a propoſition; ſhould he tell you of Crowns and Kingdoms, and make Propoſals about them; Should a match be offered to thee that ſhould bring with it Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Treaſures in abundance; how would thy heart ſpring and leap within thee at the thoughts of it, and you would not need much perſwading. We offer you this, (I mean the good and Comfort that is in theſe things) and more, ten thouſand times more, as <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.11. If poor Miniſters had Gold and Silver to tell you of, they ſhould be hearkned to. Why but we have that that is better, as much better as the Heaven is higher
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104582:93"/>
than the Earth, and this we lay before you in the name of our God. The Earth, and the Glory of it is too low a buſineſs to ſend his Son Jeſus to purchaſe for you, and to bleſs you with, or the Goſpel to tell you of. But Heaven, Heaven if you have any mind to that Eternal Glory that is to be had by Chriſt Jeſus, and that the High-Calling of God in Chriſt calls you to. Come, will you leave the Earth, and go up to Heaven? will you throw the World at your feet as dung and duſt, and go up thither into the boſom of God, to have the Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Grace of the Son, the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Spirit to all Eternity? Why then Chriſt is for you; this is that the God of all Grace Calls us to by Chriſt Jeſus, and this is moſt worthy of all acceptation. The Land we tell you of, (that Coeleſtial Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) is an exceeding good Land; ſome Cluſters and Taſts of the Grapes whereof we have ſhewed you: If you be wiſe, go up at once and poſſeſs it, and let nothing hinder or detain you, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.30. and 14.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider what a wonderful heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking thing it is, that the Lord ſhould ſpeak ſuch a word of Salvation to you, or give you ſuch a Call to Eternal Glory. Verily next to that Call that the Saints ſhall have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104582:93"/>
at the laſt day to the immediate fruition of this Glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. is this Call that you now have to the poſſeſſion of it, in and with Chriſt in the Kingdom of Grace: The Lord now ſayes to thee, come, come to Chriſt Jeſus, Imbrace and poſſeſs him as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Goſpel, and in with him Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory; not ſeperating the eſtate from the perſon (think not to have Chriſts Glory without having Chriſt himſelf) nor the end, from the way to it. Heaven from the way wherein you are to walk thither. But take altogether, (Chriſt, and through him Grace and Glory to be obtained in a way of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt in the Kingdom of Grace) and welcome it as the free gift of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11, 12. This the Lord Calls you to come, and take poſſeſſion of; he bids you now enter Heaven, and take your lot there in the promiſe and beginning of it: And what a wonderful thing is this. Remember,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whom he ſpeaks and Calls unto; a vile Sinner and wretched Malefactor, that deſerves to be turned into Hell, and might have expected to hear a doom and Sentence of Wrath only; to hear only news of Woe and Wrath, and Fire, and Blood; to hear ſuch a word as that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. And will the Lord unto thee ſay come, come to a Saviour, and be forever Bleſſed in and with
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104582:94"/>
him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 7.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. The Lord ſpeaks to you of a great while to come, even of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory in the World to come, the offer of it unto you all, and the promiſe of it, if you do believe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who is it that Calls, <hi>viz.</hi> God in Chriſt Jeſus, the God of all Grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. He ſends from Heaven to Call you up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I tell you the Bowels of the Lord Jeſus now in Glory, are now yearning over ſome of you; yea all of you as he is diſpenſing this word of Salvation to you, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15.</p>
            <p>We are but poor Inſtruments, Meſſengers, whom he imployes and ſends: It is from the deſign of Chriſt to ſeek, and ſave poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to bring them to Heaven; therefore he ſets this great Salvation before you, and Calls on you not to neglect it; therefore he lifts up his voice that you might hear it, (as all his ſheep ſhall) and follow him, that he might give you Eternal Life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28. That the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, ſhould call up a worm to the Fellowſhip of his own Glory. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.43. much more the Lord himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of what he ſpeaks, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Glory, <hi>i. e.</hi> Grace and Glory, the beginning of it here, the Conſummation of it hereafter, the former in order to the latter, and to the whole of both at once. He offers and calls to

it at once. The beſt and greateſt thing that God hath to give; God himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. When he thus ſpeaks and Calls to thee, when Earth is full of trouble about you, (and there is no reſt upon it) then he Calls you up to Heaven, and to reſt there. When this lower World is ſtormy and unquiet, then he leads you to the upper region (to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Glory) where Peace dwells, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. when the Sea rages and is tempeſtuous about you, now he diſcovers an Harbour to put into, the fair Haven of Eternal Glory, the Boſom of the Bleſſed God, where your Souls may dwell at eaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.13. In every other dwelling there is ſome Inconvenience, trouble, difficulty, pinching, want or ail; that you do not ſit at eaſe, ſome hard knot in every Worldly Pillow, that you do not lie at eaſe: But there your Souls ſhall dwell at eaſe, lodge in goodneſs as the word is: Goodneſs, univerſal goodneſs ſhall be your

lodging place. Yea when ſin had even thrown you down to Hell, ſeperated you from God, provoked his wrath yet now the Lord ſpeaks of Heaven to you: Yea now he thus ſpeaks,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.33.</note> and Calls after all your neglects and miſpence of time; he is yet calling, yet offering Chriſt, and Life, and Heaven to you, this day, this hour: Behold now an accepted time, a day of Salvation, a day of Receiving, Poſſeſſing and obtaining Eternal Salvation in Chriſt Jeſus: The offers of Salvation might have long ſince ceaſed and ended to you-ward; but behold yet they are continued, and thou haſt this one Call more, not only yeſterday you might, but to day you may hear the voice of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: Oh harden not your hearts from ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It may be thou ſayeſt as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In what way a portion in this Eternal Glory is to be had and obtained (in what way the Lord offers it and calls thee to poſſeſs it) <hi>viz.</hi> in a way of believing on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as I may ſo expreſs it) in a way of leaving and taking: Leaving that that is worthy to be left, and taking, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chuſing that that is worthy, moſt worthy to be taken: Leaving and letting go all evil, miſery and vanity, ſin and world, as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and enjoyed in a way of ſin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33. And taking all good, Chriſt and all his
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104582:95"/>
benefits, Grace and Glory; all ſaving good, in and with a Saviour. This great Eſtate (of Grace and Glory) together with ſo ſweet, deſirable and Glorious a perſon (a match) as the Son of God is: What a wonderful offer and motion is this, and how worthy of all acceptation. Hence</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider that they that now in the day of Grace chuſe this Eternal Glory in earneſt, may, yea ſhall have it. If you chuſe Heaven indeed, you ſhall go thither; if willing to have everlaſting Felloſhip with God for your portion, you ſhall have it. Why, if this be true, what more plain than that the offer of of this Glory is free and real? what more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable or wilful, than the ſin and perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that periſh? What remains, but that you be perſwaded to chuſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Heaven, and Life Eternal, though one would think you ſhould need little perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now this is moſt true and evident. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. if you chuſe life, you ſhall live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Therefore if they had loved light ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then darkneſs, (<hi>i. e.</hi> choſen light, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt and all his Grace) they ſhould not have been condemned but ſaved, ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4, 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30, 173. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3, 4. Every man hath his choice: Do you chuſe Luſt, Sin, Vanity, World, you ſhall have it. Do you chuſe ſeparation from God, to live
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104582:96"/>
at a diſtance and in eſtrangement from him, that will inevitably be your everlaſting por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if you continue in that choice. But if the Lord give you an heart to chuſe Heaven (<hi>i. e.</hi> not meerly as a place of outward eaſe; but of Holy Communion with God, and fruition of him) rather than Earth. If you indeed chuſe God and his Fellowſhip rather than the World, Chriſt and Grace rather than ſin; then you ſhall have that. Why is there any Body that does not chuſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? that would not be ſaved? Yea a great many, <hi>viz.</hi> they that chuſe ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.36. and 1.22. That chuſe this preſent World for their Portions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. That will none of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. For it is the enjoyment of God that makes Heaven; why if you will none of Heaven, if you refuſe Eternal Glory, or the way to it; if you care not for Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no wonder if you miſs of it, and juſt will be your perdition. But oh, who come to be ſo ſottiſh and brutiſh as to chuſe evil before good, Earth before Heaven and Death before Life; chuſe Life and that you may have forever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whither will you turn you, if you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey this Call, and neglect this offer of Eternal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus? Where will you take up your portion? Where will you find any thing Comparable to this, or ought that can make you happy if you refuſe this?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104582:96"/>
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.3. You will go to the Creature, to a vain World, to the pleaſures, profits and preferments of it, you will dig in the Earth for a Portion: But alas there is no Eternal Glory to be found; there is no good here that can make up happineſs, much leſs a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable happineſs. There is no Treaſure on Earth but there is a deſtroyer lies by it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19. There is nothing ſafe in this World; you can lay up nothing where deſtruction may not find it: There is but one ſafe place to lay up a portion in, and that is Heaven: You do but lay up for the fire what you lay up on Earth, for that will be the laſt end of all things here, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. When that day of the univerſal burning of the World comes, what a ſenſible demonſtration will it be of the vanity of laying up our portion on Earth; and ſo are all particular burnings (of Houſes or Towns or Cities) in the leſſer dayes of Gods Judgements now. How many wayes does the Lord proclaim unto men, that here is no ſuitable or durable portion for them to be had on Earth? You muſt to Heaven if you will have any true or laſting Happineſs, any Eternal Glory. There no Moth, nor Ruſt, no Fire, nor Water, no Pirate or Robber comes. Make this World your Inne, and not your Home, and then, when it is fired you may leave it without loſs, (the Traveller
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104582:97"/>
ſuffers little or no loſs when the Inne where he lodged all night is ſet on Fire) and go home to an Everlaſting Habitation. Oh men may call the things of this World a Glory, as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 31.1. but there is nothing here worthy that name; or if it be, it is not Eternal Glory to be ſure; it is but a fading faſhion that paſſeth away. Look upon the various changes, loſſes, deſtructions, wherein the beſt and goodlieſt portions in this World do fade, and fail, and paſs away, you may write on them, <hi>Sic tranſit gloria mundi.</hi> Why then, if you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and refuſe Heaven, and turn to the things below, you do but imbrace ſhadows for ſubſtance, ſhells and ſhews, and vain things that cannot profit you, and what a madneſs and folly is that?</p>
            <p n="6">6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Conſider the peril of refuſing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying this Call and offer of Salvation; or what the iſſue would be, ſhould you neglect it, <hi>viz.</hi> everlaſting heavineſs, miſery and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If you will not have Heaven, you ſhall have Hell, (for you muſt have one of them) yea a deeper and hotter Hell; becauſe you had the offer of Heaven, and refuſed it. The Lord hath brought the matter to this pinch, there is but this choice before you, either Heaven or Hell, either Eternal Glory, or Eternal Miſery: If you refuſe the former, you ſhall not eſcape the latter. If you will
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104582:97"/>
none of Chriſt and Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhall have ſin, and be given up to it: If you will not have the Fellowſhip of God, you ſhall have the Company of the Devil and his Angels: If you will not hear the voice of the call and promiſe of the Goſpel, you ſhall one day hear that dreadful word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. Why, if this be the choice, is it not plain and eaſie to determine which is to be choſen? Shall not thy Soul with fear and trembling groan to God to deliver thee from ſuch a madneſs and miſery as to neglect Heaven and chuſe Hell, to hate Chriſt and love death? And ſuch a madneſs it is to diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>regard the Call of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the voice of wiſdom, and to go after the fooliſh woman, whoſe Gueſts are in the depths of Hell.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Remember that we muſt hear Chriſts call now in the word and Kingdom of his Grace, if ever we would hear his Bleſſed and Glorious call at the laſt day unto the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, actual fruition of Fellowſhip with him in the Kingdom of his Glory. If we would then hear him ſay, come (as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25 34.) we muſt hear, and obey that word from him now. Come now if you would come then. Come now to Chriſt Jeſus, and enter into Fellowſhip with him (as God calls you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.) in a way of Faith and Grace, if you would then come into his Kingdom, and be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104582:98"/>
for ever with him in a way of Glory. Are you willing to hear Chriſt at the laſt and great day; when he ſhall break out of the Clouds, ſet him down on the Throne of his Glory, and call all Nations before him; then to ſay to you: Come you Bleſſed inherit the Kingdom? Then you muſt hear him now who cryes to you in the Goſpel: Come, come unto me that you may have Life and Glory for evermore; (<hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17.) The ſame portion for ſubſtance that the Saints are called to then, you are invited and called to now (<hi>viz.</hi> Fellowſhip with Chriſt and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of all his benefits, Peace, Grace and Glory:) there from an Inchoation you paſs to the Conſummate fruition of them; here from a total want, to an entire poſſeſſion of them, (ſo at the firſt believing, which is in that regard a greater matter than the other) will that word be acceptable and joyful then, why ſhould not this be ſo now? And if you do hear his voice and come to him at his call, you ſhall hear that bleſſed word then, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28. as <hi>è contrà Job</hi> 21.14. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now add we ſome Directions to guide and help us in Believing on Chriſt unto life Everlaſting; or in coming to Chriſt to obtain by him Eternal Glory or Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Know that you may and ought to come
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104582:98"/>
to Chriſt for Salvation, for Eternal Life: For what he gives, we may take, but <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. what he deſignes in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us (which here is to bring us to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13, 14.) we may aim at in receiving him, and coming to him. Chriſt calls us to him, and we may and ought to come to him for all his Benefits: And we ſee this of Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Conſummation thereof in ſpecial; is part thereof, ſee alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. We may come to him for our own Salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> not as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from, or in oppſition to Gods Glory; which cannot be if we underſtand Salvation aright. And that's a ſecond.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be ſure you have a right conception of this Glory, or Salvation, or happineſs of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> Look not at it as conſiſting in external ſenſual eaſe and pleaſures, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from outward evils (though an holy and ſanctified outward reſt and freedom from outward afflictions is a part of the good that is in Heaven, but not the main; that is but an adjunct.) But look at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, Fruition of God and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conformity to his Image as the main thing in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.15. Let Your Hearts and deſires be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſet upon freedom from that great evil
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104582:99"/>
of ſin (which is a choice part of the Happineſs of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23.) and fruitton of that higheſt good the preſence of God, the fellowſhip of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt in perfect Holineſs; let this be the mark and top of thy deſires: Neither deſire the end, without the way; Heaven, without the way to it. Be willing and deſirous by the Grace of Chriſt to begin thy Heaven here, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God here, Holy work, and holy enjoyments in all the wayes thereof here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27 4 For Heaven is but the perfection of what is here b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me. And therefore be inſtant with Chriſt, not only for Grace and Comfort hereafter, or at the point of Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for preſent Grace, ſome beginnings of it at leaſt, (not limiting to meaſures, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ſenſible fulneſs of it, till after you have waited and ſought, and been ſwimming in tears in this World, and therefore not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling nor being diſcouraged becauſe of the weakneſs of Grace at preſent) ſo much as may keep you following after God for more: For preſent change of Heart and Nature, for Grace to enable you in meaſure to Glorifie God on Earth, that ſo you may be Glorified with him in Heaven.</p>

               </gap>) and the knowledge thereof alſo is given on Earth.</p>
            <p>Labour after this: It is that we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. If we
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104582:105"/>
make ſure of Effectual Calling, we make ſure of this Glory; for there is an inſeperable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between them. To quicken thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Great matters cannot be made too ſure, and in all other matters of great moment, common reaſon and nature teaches men to be diligent to make all ſure. If Eſtate or Life be in hazard, how ſollicitous are men to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure grounds: In ſettling of Earthly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, how careful, punctual and exact that no flaw, no matter of doubt or danger be left. What matter is of ſo great a weight, as the matter of Eternity, everlaſting Life and Glory, (<hi>Hezekiah</hi> when like to die, was deſirous of a ſure evidence that he ſhould live and recover out of his ſickneſs, and have his fifteen years time more here, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.8.) How much more ſollicitous ſhould we be, to be ſure of Eternal Life, (Life through all the dayes and years of Eternity) when we were ſo like to die the ſecond death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have it confirmed not by miracles, but by Scripture ſignes and evidences; in great matters, and matters wherein the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection goes out much, men will delight to have the aſſurance and ratification over and over, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.16, 17. Oh when we are making a Covenant with Chriſt, and he with us, about matters of everlaſting Life, that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104582:105"/>
that is for ever after this life, as v. 14, 15. we cannot but deſire him to ſpeak again; yea ſwear again, (as he condeſcends to both, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.) and Eſtabliſh his promiſe to us over and over; our love to him and intence deſire to be ſure of his love, ſhould induce to this. When <hi>Jacobs</hi> heart was upon being buried in the Cave of <hi>Machpolah</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a type of Heaven, and being buried therein of that poſſeſſion that the faithful take of Heaven when they die, when they go to a place of their own properly: the Sojourners and ſtrangers while they live in this World.) He will have <hi>Joſeph</hi> both promiſe and ſwear to bury him there, and gave charge to all his other ſons about it too, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.29, 30, 31. and 49.29, 32. So <hi>Abraham</hi> how careful is he to make ſure his poſſeſſion of the Cave of <hi>Machpelah, Geneſ.</hi> 23.17, 18, 20. He can be content to have never a foot of Land of his own while he lives, but he will make ſure of a good burying place when he dies, <hi>i. e.</hi> of an happy Eſtate after death, of a portion of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and of being buried in the certain hope (as of all the promiſes of God to be made good to him and his, ſo in ſpecial) of an happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to Eternal Glory; that was the meaning of it. Oh though you have never ſo little in this Earth while you live, though
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104582:106"/>
ſtrangers and pilgrims here, yet make ſure of Heaven when you die; make that one bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſure, and you are happy, that you ſhall have a poſſeſſion of your own in that better Country, even an Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have nothing elſe ſure, we had need make ſure of this; we have no portion cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, (nothing to truſt to) if we have not this portion of Eternal Life and Glory. There is no certainty of any thing in this World; Riches have wings, the top of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is a ſlippery place, life it ſelf is but a vapour: All things here lye within the reach of many devourers and deſtroyers, Moth and Ruſt, and Thieves, Pirates at Sea, and other Sons of violence at Land: And what is ſaved from other Deſtroyers, is but reſerved for the fire, that muſt be the end of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the poſſeſſions upon Earth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. All Earthly poſſeſſions muſt turn into a blaze, and end in ſmoak, as <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 19.28. At the great day of Judgment there ſhall be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal burning (all the Earth on a light fire) in particular, previous dayes of Judgment here (which are taſts and hanſells of that) the Lord often contends by fire. Why if men will not ſee by the light of the word, one would think they ſhould ſee by the flames of devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, (though indeed ſeldom do men ſee by the latter, or by any deſtroying Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104582:106"/>
that have obſtinately refuſed the light and voice of the former: But in it ſelf it is a wonderful help to ſee, and it will be ſo to them that regard the word) the vanity, uncertainty and periſhing nature of all things here. But to be ſure our enjoyment of all things in this World (at beſt) hangs but upon the twine-thread of our life, which there are ſo many ſharp edged tooles (Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Diſeaſes, ſad Accidents,) continually ready to cut aſunder, we are not ſure to have it continued one hour longer. Had we not need be ſure of ſomething when all theſe things ſhall fail, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Paul</hi> knows what he hath to truſt to when this World turns him out of doors (he hath then an houſe to hide his head in,) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. Oh it is a Comfortable thing, when temporal habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fail, to be ſure of Eternal ones. Imagine you were now to die, this moment leaving the World, how glad would you be to be ſure of Heaven and of a better life: Why that muſt be e're long, and you cannot think to be ſure of it then (in a dying hour) if you do not labour to make it ſure now in a time of health and peace. Wnen <hi>David</hi> looks over the World and ſees the vanity fading uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all portions (of Riches, Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, fair Dwellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) here, what a thing is it to him to be ſure of a God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104582:107"/>
him into Arms of Love and Mercy when he dies, and of an happy waking in the morning of the Reſurrection to Eternal Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.6. - 15. and 73.17, - 24. when you ſee men ſtand in ſlippery places and one tumbling down after another, (the Rich tumbling into poverty, the Great into Contempt) then look to your feet and to your ſtanding; what foot hold have you, what ſure bottom and foundation have you to ſtand ſteady upon, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.11, 12, 13. The wicked ſtand in ſlippery places, but the godly that walk with God in integrity, ſtand in an even place. The Covenant is ſure (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.) the ſtate of Grace is a ſure ſtanding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7, 8. indeed in regard of themſelves they would fall as ſoon as any, but they have a ſure hand to hold them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23, 24.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Should not we make this uſe of the times we live in, to quicken us to make ſure of Heaven. May we not get this meat out of the eater, this good out of all the evils and troubles that are in the World. Is it now a time to walk at peradventures with God, to live at uncertainties, to hang be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Earth, to be to ſeek of a reſting place when trouble fills the whole Earth. When the Lords anger is burning up and down the World, and his fury poured

Prayer takes up what is left us in the promiſe: The Lord hath left you large portions of all Grace Sanctifying and Comforting; yea Eternal Glory to be enjoyed fully hereafter, and in the aſſurance, hope and Comfort of it here.

Turn all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes into prayer, and deſire him to do as he hath ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.25, 27, 28, 29.

Oh with what ſweet hope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement may you pray for theſe things. And prayer is not only a means for the time to come, but it oft brings in preſent incomes

of the good prayed for. The Bucket of prayer dipt into the well (of Salvation, or) of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life comes up full, and that many times unto feeling as well as unto Faith, (for unto Faith true prayer alwayes does ſo.) How often does the Lord ſweetly comfort and eſtabliſh the Soul while the praying for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſtabliſhment, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 4.6 7. How oft does <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalms cloſe with Praiſe when he began, with Prayer. We have examples in Scripture of extraordinory appearances to Gods Servants, while they were praying, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.20.23. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.5. and 22.17, 18. and much more frequent, are more ordinary Communications of Grace and Conſolation in Prayer: but it muſt be hearty, fervernt, importunate Prayer; empty, lifeleſs Forms and Cuſtomary overly performances, do much harden the heart and quench the ſpirit, and do provoke the Lord to withdraw, inſtead of coming near the Soul: But 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.8, 9. <hi>Hoſ</hi> 12.3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Labour after the mortifying and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of your ſpecial and beloved ſin, your own iniquity. For while that prevails, that darkens the ſincerity and Efficacy of Grace in the Soul; breaks the Peace thereof, grieves the Holy Spirit, who thence withdraws his Comforting work. But when that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and there is a good meaſure of victory
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104582:112"/>
over it, and a plain penitent departing from it, (not only by exchange of one boſome ſin into another, nor by its bring out of date in regard of the natural diſpoſition of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but when really mortified, made better to the heart, the Soul broken from and for it, watchful againſt it, improving Chriſt for Redemption from it) that is a plain evidence of the ſincerity of Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21, - 23. If that maſter ſin be mortified, all ſin is; and where there is true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, there is true union to Chriſt by Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling and a ſtate of Life Eternal. Hence the cutting off of the right hand, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the boſom-ſin, is accompanied with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into life, (that is a thing accompanies Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9.) <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.43, - 47.</p>
            <p>Hence when the Apoſtle would raiſe them up to a Heavenly frame, ſuch as might ſhew them to be indeed riſen with Chriſt: He calls on them to mortifie their ſpecial Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 5.

It is often ſeen that the Lord withholds and denies aſſurance, and lets the Soul be followed with fears, and doubts, and troubles on purpoſe to diſcover, imbitter and break
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104582:112"/>
the power of ſome prevailing luſt, ſome ſweet ſin. If you can tamper with your luſts, and make proviſion for the fleſh and be at truce with your ſins, and entertain the delights of it: Now inſtead of Comforting, the Lord will break your bones, if he loves you, he will let you have no peace till you out with this guile and repent in earneſ,t and throw away this ſweet ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. Oh mind and mark out your moſt prevailing, moſt inticing beloved ſins; and if that be the provocation, the partition-wall between God and you, throw it away. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour to keep Grace in action and exerciſe. Be much in acting all Grace, both in the hearty and ſerious performance of holy duties, and in daily renewing of repentance for dayly ſins, and of Faith by going to the Blood of Chriſt for pardon, and for more of his Spirit; and alſo in the exerciſe of other particular Graces (love, brotherly kindneſs, charity, patience, meekneſs, ſelf-denial, zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as there is occaſion for them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 8, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Exerciſe of Crace is the beſt evidence of Grace: Let a man breath, eat, walk and work, he needs no other demonſtrations that he is a living man; ſo would you ſhew and ſee and diſcern that you have the life of Grace, the life of Chriſt in you, (and ſo are
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104582:113"/>
in a ſtate of Salvation) up and be doing and acting, performing the actions of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, be breathing after Chriſt in Prayer, feed on him in the Promiſes and Ordinances, feed upon the word of God: Can you feed, can you eat at every meal in the ſeaſon of duty, (as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.41, 42, 43. thats an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a living riſen Chriſtian) can you make a meal of a Sabbath and your Souls are refreſhed thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and walk before God, get up and walk in his wayes, work the work of the Lord that is committed to you in Chriſts ſtrength and name; this will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the life of Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</p>
            <p>It is labouring working Grace that is not vain, or Counterfeit, or dead Grace, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.17, 18. And to this end put forth and exerciſe every Grace in its ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. The Lord giveth us ſpecial ſeaſons and occaſions, on purpoſe to draw forth the exerciſe of ſuch and ſuch a Grace, we might have marvelous improvement of them for benefit and comfort, if the fault were not our own, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. there is a ſeaſon to exerciſe love, kindneſs, compaſſion when he ſees and hears that his brother is in need, want or miſery; now bowels ſhould act and ſtir, being made tender by the Grace of Chriſt: If love ſtir not, act not now, ſure the habit of that Grace dos not dwell in him.

Here's a ſeaſon for the Goſpel-fruit; to ſee whether that Grace will bud and bring forth, whether you can forbear and forgive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.13. It may be you are ſtirr'd up by another to an act of Charity and kindneſs, an object and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it preſented to you: The Lord hath now ſent ſeaſon to draw forth ſuch fruit (as you know if there be life in the root of the tree when the ſeaſon comes, the Spring time is, the Sun ſhines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the ſap will riſe, and it will bud and bloſſome. If you ſee neither bud nor leaf, but a dry ſear-top in the ſeaſon, you ſay it's dead) Oh if thy Grace be alive, the ſeaſon will draw it forth: You think you have other Graces, yea but this Grace muſt act now in ſuch a ſeaſon of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7, 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.10, 17. So duties of Religion towards God, zeal for his Glory againſt ſin, duties of Holineſs or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be ready and active therein, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeaſons thereof, this is an excellnt Rule both for the Increaſe and Comfort of Grace,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104582:114"/>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, - 11. He means, add the exerciſe and practice of them: Labour to have each of theſe Graces (according to their ſeveral objects and occaſions and ſeaſons) drawn forth into act and exerciſe, and appearing in the fruits of it. For the Beeings and habits of all Grace are implanted at once and at firſt: And when all ſorts of Graces are found in a Chriſtian, and are lively to put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſeveral proper wayes (for where is one in truth, there is all in the root, and that ſhould appear in the fruit in the ſeaſon thereof) is a choice help to make our Calling ſure, and to have an open entrance.

            <p n="4">4. Be much in Meditation, ſerious ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Meditation on the word and promiſes of God, the condition of thy own Soul, thy own wretchedneſs, emptineſs, vileneſs in thy ſelf; the riches of Grace in Chriſt, the things of Heaven, both in more occaſional, tranſient opportunities; and in more ſolemn ſeaſons ſet apart for that purpoſe.

(For Heaven as we have ſaid, mainly conſiſts in the fruition of God) if that be the portion our Souls fix upon, then we are men for Heaven. That portion is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us, and left with us in our firſt entrance into Chriſtianity, being expreſſed in our Baptiſm, (the name of Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.) And the fruition of that name, the full enjoyment of God Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt in all the manifeſtations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himſelf, this is the end of our Chriſtian race, and makes up the perfection of Glory in Heaven. Conſider, hath the Lord ſo ſhewed thee the vanity of all other portions and things, the emptineſs that is in thy ſelf, and the excellency of this portion, to have the bleſſed God for thine according to the whole Covenant of his Grace, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5.)

            <p>It may happily be ſaid ſtill, how ſhall we know this? Why this one would think ſhould be a ſenſible and palpable thing, what a man makes his chief good, what his heart is ſet upon, and he purſues and ſeeks as the deſigne and deſire of his heart and life, and places his Happineſs, his All in. When the covetous man makes money and wealth his main deſign, his chief good; may not he himſelf eaſily ſee that his heart is ſet there; yea even others may ſee it: He ſubordinates all to that, and makes that the buſineſs of his life, that Intereſt carries him ſtill at every turn, that Byaſſes him. And the ſame you may ſay of the Ambitious man for his honour, the Voluptuous man for his pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And truly this may be ſeen in the Godly man, that he is for God, and for the ſervice and Glory of God, for Communion with him and enjoyment of him in all his wayes, that is his one thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. there his ſpirit runs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. He ſubordinates all to that, directs all his endeavours and labours to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8, 9. That is the Intereſt that carries him, there you ſhall find him in all changes,

(when he is himſelf at leaſt, he may be ſhaken a little by Temptation, and violently hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this way and that way, but the Needle of his Soul returns to that North pole, and reſts not till it ſtand fixed there: As it is with the Needle of a Compaſs touched by the Loadſtone; you may by violence ſhake it this way and that way, but thither it will return, and there will fix and ſtand toward the North.) He will be for God ſtill, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.

Oh wonderful is the Efficacy in the turn, that God gives to the Soul in the work of Converſion, and ſo in the after impreſs of Sactification, that henceforth the Soul ſtands bent for God (ſet for God) and all the temptations, affrightments, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of Hell and the World ſhall never utterly turn it away from him, And truly Chriſtians ſhould ſo act and walk, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare plainly what they are; for (what the chief good and portion they ſeek is) as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14.

And therefore they are more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, Aſs-like ſervile ſpirited) The great things of the World are but ſeemingly great, and therefore it is but a falſe, and ſhady, and ſpurious greatneſs of ſpirit that the great men of the World have: But the true Chriſtian, how poor ſoever in this World, converſes with the things that are indeed great, God, Chriſt and Heaven, and Eternal Glory, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.5. and therefore true and genuine great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, holy magnanimity and bravery, is, and ſhould be found with him.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104582:123"/>
then the Earth, ſo ſhould the ſpirits of true Chriſtians be above that of the World. Hence we find among the Martyrs, poor mean men, women, ſometimes have had a ſpirit above their Perſecutors, when clothed with all Worldly greatneſs, as <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.18, 20. and in their greateſt ſufferings they have been more then Conquerours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37. Sin hath debaſed the ſpirit of man, and made it ſo vile and low, that every temptation, every Worldly allurement or affrightment overcomes it, and tramples upon it. But Grace raiſes the ſpirit of a Believer who is riſen with Chriſt, eſpecially when it grows up to a ſight of Glory and lively hope thereof: when Faith and Holineſs are lively and active, it makes a man to be of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirit; above the ſpirit of the World, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3. So far as this Excellent ſpirit is wanting in Chriſtians, ſo far they are carnal and Earthly and little acquainted with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Oh get thine heart filled with Heaven, that will lift it above the Earth, and above that Earthlineſs and baſeneſs, and weakneſs that ſin and eſtrangement from God doth clog it with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Improve Heaven, and your hope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto Conſolation, or ſpiritual Joy and Comfort. This uſe the Lord expects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you ſhould make of that hope of Glory
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104582:124"/>
hereafter which he gives unto you here, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.18. Heaven when actually enjoyed, is the fulneſs of Joy and Comfort, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. And while it is but promiſed and hoped for, it is a matter of great Joy and Comfort. If any of the faithful live without this Joy, they do either diſcouragedly (and ſinfully) put away, or careleſly neglect the portion that God gives them. Oh we have too much Earthly, but too little Heavenly Joy; an Earthly Carnal heart is the reaſon of that, whereby we live below the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that God calls to. Comfort and Joy is the life of every life, (whether natural, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or ſpiritual) If a man have no Joy of this life, it is a death rather than life. No life ſo full of Comfort as the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is, or may be: Spiritual life hath Glory in the end of it to put Comfort into all the way. Oh what happy and Comfortable lives might we live, if the fault were not our own; when as we have the whole Covenant of Grace, and therein a whole Heaven made over to us to rejoyce in; God and Chriſt and his ſpirit to be our everlaſting portion, and not only an Intereſt in him at preſent, but full fruition of him in Heaven made ſure to us. What though there be tribulations, bitterneſs in the way; there is ſweetneſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104582:124"/>
in the end to ſwallow up all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, and to make it a light thing, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. and therefore notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may rejoyce more particularly therefore, let the fore-thoughts of Heaven be matter of Comfort and Conſolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Againſt the loſs of any of the good things of this World, one or more, ſome (yea) or all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. Though you loſe this or that on Earth, if you have Heaven, you have that that is better, and virtually you have it ſtill: A better good contemns an inferior good in it. For <hi>Major continet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: He that hath White-bread enough need not care though he loſe a Brown-Loaf: He that hath God and Heaven to rejoyce in, can loſe but little, though he ſhould loſe all the the Earth: He hath the beſt good, and the main ſtill and more, enduring a permanent, a never-failing good, a good that cannot be loſt. Whatever you loſe here, you have a portion in Heaven that you cannot loſe; no ſpoiler can ſpoil you of that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.20. He cannot loſe much whoſe portion is in Heaven, for that cannot be loſt, and all the reſt (all the World) is but a little, an inconſiderable thing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.10, 11, 12. The much (the main) the true riches, and that that is your own (your proper portion that is aſſigned to you by God, to have, and to hold forever)
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104582:125"/>
that is whole and ſafe ſtill. They that have great Eſtates, they may bear it to loſe a little, and not feel it much; yea, that that would be to another man the loſs of his whole Eſtate, he may bear it to loſe a little; yea ſhould it be all Earthly Comforts, that to an ungodly man is his whole Eſtate, it is all that ever he hath, he may well wring his hands and waile, and take on as one undone: But the Godly that hath all the Glory of Heaven, all the good of the Covenant of Grace for his own; it is but a flea-biting to him, but a little, nay indeed none of his proper Eſtate and Portion; but Additionalls, but thread and Paper caſt in over and above. <hi>Moſes</hi> can loſe and leave all the Glory, Wealth and pleaſure of the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and make no matter of it, while he looks to this recompence of reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt the fears and dangers of Evils that may befall us in this World, and all manner of afflictions therein; fears and threatning dangers of what may come, is oft no ſmall part of our tryal and affliction. But <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. in times of greateſt fears this is a quieting thought, that there can come nothing that ſhall keep you from Heaven if you be the Lords: Whatever good be taken away, it cannot take away Heaven from you; whatever evil comes it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104582:125"/>
cannot hinder you from Heaven; (It cannot ſeparate you from everlaſting Communion with) nay it ſhall further you rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And if ſo, then you may triumph over all things, and evil inſtruments in the World that do or can annoy you. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.37, 38, 39. If you do or moſt actually go through ſome Tribulations and ſorrows, (ſuch as are pinching and painful to the fleſh,) yet fear them not (with any diſcouraging diſmaying fear) for they are but a ſmall matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Glory that follows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. And alſo you ſhall be ſure to get well through them; if you be ſure to get to Heaven, (as every true Believer is) then you are ſure to get well and ſafe through all the troubles that ly on this ſide Heaven. If a man in his Journey come to a place of mire, or water; if he apprehend danger of drowning, or of not getting ſafe through, that dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ads him; but if no danger of that, if ſure to get well through, why the preſent trouble or hardſhip of wetting his foot, putting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m in the cold water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he makes nothing of that. Why all that are true Believers, God hath aſſured you of this, that you ſhall never come to any bad place, to any trouble or tryal in all the way to Heaven; but you ſhall get well through, and ſafe to Heaven at laſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. Why then the preſent trouble
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104582:126"/>
of a little hardſhip and pain to the fleſh, ſhould be no great trouble to you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. But when troubles are in the Earth, (as they are even to aſtoniſhment to this day) then ſhould you go up and find Comfort in Heaven: If you have Heaven to ſet againſt Earth, and all Earthly evils, you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough. While we tarry below, or look only downward, or round about us, we may ſink as <hi>Peter</hi> on the water: But look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, away to Heaven, (look up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven with <hi>Stephen</hi>) and there all is calm and comfortable, and ſpeaks more peace and Comfort to the faithful, than all the World can ſpeak trouble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againſt all the difficulties, ſtraits and conflicts that lye in the way to Heaven. The way indeed is ſtrait and hard to fleſh and blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14. it is full of troubles from the World of temptations from Satan, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from the fleſh, tryalls from God; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a continual warfare, conflict and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe in all theſe reſpects, and much pains and care both to get into, and keep in the right way. It is ſo way-laid with enemies, that you muſt be fain to fight at every ſtep, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 12. Be it ſo, yet there is that in the end that does infinitely over-ballance all the troubles in the way. It is but going through a miry-lane to a wealthy Palace, or
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104582:126"/>
breaking through a rainy-day to go at the time appointed to take poſſeſſion of a great Eſtate (who ſticks at that?) We have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mentioned that paſſage of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> [<hi>vid. apud Burroughs</hi> on the Excellency of the Soul, page 358.] great difficulties are rendred ſmall when the matter is exceeding great for which they are gone through. Who thinks it much to ride and run through froſt and ſnow, mire and water, night and day; when a Kingdom, nay but a private Eſtate, an Inheritance, a good ſum of Money lyes at ſtake: Men will go through great pains and difficulties and make nothing of it for thoſe things which the World accounts great. But they are all trifles to Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25. Remember the greatneſs of Heaven's Glory that will leſſen and lighten (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) yea ſweeten all your labour and travail to it. Look upon the end when you are preſſed with the difficulties of the way; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. and <hi>Paul</hi> did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. Eternal Glory is worth Travelling for, worth Praying for, waiting, watching for, worth ſweating, ſuffering, ſtriving, fighting for, and it will quit, coſt and make amends to the full. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had good reaſon to venture through hazards and difficulties, and to go on clearly through them all, when as <hi>Canaan</hi> was ſuch an exceeding good Land, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.7,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104582:127"/>
8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24. ſo here. But ſeeing you are called to Eternal Glory, travail on cheerily thitherward, though it be through hardſhips and difficulties, ſtick not at them; there is that in the end, and that promiſe of certain aſſiſtance in the way; that is enough to carry you through. Heaven will make amends for all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Againſt thoſe ſpiritual evils and wants that you are here labouring under, which of all other are the ſoreſt exerciſe and ſaddeſt diſcouragement to a gracious heart: Heaven will cure them all; the very fore-thoughts whereof is full of Comfort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin and remainders of Corruption, that is, the great and bitter complaint and vexation of the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. that they never be free, in no duty, at no time but ſtill evil is preſent with them, and oft in the prevailings of Corruptions, and hurrying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſin, make work for bitter repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And after all means, mercies, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Prayers; yet the indwelling Corruption returnes, and appears again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why e're long you ſhall be rid of this troubleſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; Heaven ſhall ſet you free for ever: No body of death there, none of the old man ſhall accompany you thither. The time is coming (oh happy time, the very thoughts of it may make you leap for Joy) when you ſhall never
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104582:127"/>
have vain thought more, never be troubled with corruption more, never feel any unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury heart more, never vexed with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations more; but among the ſpirits made perfect, ſerving and enjoying God with ſin, without wearineſs, without interruption and end. Heaven was never defiled with ſin, (the Devil did not ſin there, but in this lower World, and was ſhut out of Heaven for his ſin) nor ever ſhall be. In that holy place you ſhall be perfectly holy for ever. Hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Heaven will cure the imperfection of Grace, which we groan under here, having none but the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. We groan under ſpiritual imperfections, wants, weakneſſes. Grace though begun, is is but low, and little, and weak. Hence we are preſſed with ſpiritual wants, both of Holineſs and Comfort, falling ſhort in every thing; our attainments poor and defective: We are mourning and ſtriving after perfection, but reach it not: But in Glory Grace will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that is a ſtate of perfection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. Every Saint will then become to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. no longer a babe and childiſh, rather Carnal than Spiritual, as man 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. and 13.9, 10, 11, 12. Oh glorious and happy day, when the Image of Chriſt ſhall be compleated in us, and we ſhall be fully like him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. you ſhall then
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104582:128"/>
have that fulneſs of Grace and ſpirit, which you are now praying and mourning: Then will all your Prayers be anſwered, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes fulfilled to the height, and as <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.14. The day is coming when every Grace ſhall be full grown; when there ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love, perfect holineſs, perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, perfect unity, perfect conformity to the will of God. A dram of Grace is more worth than all the World, but what will Grace in perfection be, when you ſhall be filled with all the fulneſs of God, as full of God as you can hold, or can deſire to be. Never any more complaints of want or weakneſs; to be ſure then there ſhall be ſuch a time, and that you ſhall come to it, what a joyful thought is this!</p>
            <p n="5">5. It affords comfort againſt that abſence from the Lord and want of enjoyment of his preſence, which here we are mourning under, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8. the greateſt preſence of God that we here enjoy at any time, is but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in compariſon. How often do we find the Lord withdrawing and abſenting himſelf, hiding his face, leaving us at a loſs; and when after mourning and ſeekings, he does draw near, and let out himſelf in any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or promiſe; yet it is but little in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and ſoon interrupted and clouded again, and it will be ſo: Expect not a full
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104582:128"/>
and ſatisfactory and conſtant uninterrupted enjoyment of God, a morning without clouds here: That is reſerved for Heaven; we ſhall be complaining of defects in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God while in this World: But Heaven will anſwer and ſatisfie all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and expectations in this reſpect. It will bring us into the preſence of God, and ſet us before his face for ever, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 41.12. we ſhall then be never abſent, but alwayes preſent with the Lord, I <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. If God had not reſerved this for another ſtate and place, we might wonder that we can reach no more of it, nor that after all our Prayers and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we get ſo little of it, and find ſo many withdrawings, and ſin and World are ſuffered to put in, and make ſo many interruptions: Oh it is to make us look and long for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World; make that uſe of all the defects and interruptions we find in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God: Prize Heaven and be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that day of full Redemption, and think not to enjoy our Heaven here: But be willing to go hence that we may go to God; be willng rather to be abſent from the Body, that we may be preſent with the Lord, that we may be with Chriſt which is beſt of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. willing not only to trade into that Countrey, and with much adoe fetch ſome taſts of the Commodities thereof hither;

but to remove thither, and there poſſeſs the fulneſs thereof, even of Beatifical Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt for evermore. In the mean time let the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts and belief of it (now while we walk by Faith, and not by ſight) be a comfort and rejoycing in hope that we ſhall one day have what now we want; what now we pray and ſeek for, but cannot fully reach.

How hard ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy work be, and how long ſoever kept tugging at it, Heaven will make amends for all.

You will ſerve men, and work hard it may be at your dayes labour (and it is equal you ſhould ſo do) for your penny, and ſhall we ſtick at ſerving the Bleſſed God who ſets before us ſuch a recompenſe of reward as Eternal Glory is?

            <p n="3">3. You have but a little time to do work on Earth, compared with the time of your reſt in Heaven. Our reſting time is hereafter, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.) but our working time now; there will be work in Heaven indeed, but work done without toile, or ſweat, or pain, as it was with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency as bodily labour; the ſweet and pleaſant work of Glorifying God: Now we can do no good work but in the ſweat of our browes, with much conflict, pain and difficulty: But though it be ſo, this our painful labour is but for a while, for an Hirelings day, <hi>Job</hi> 7.1, 2, though you be kept ſweating at it, you may bide it in the duſt, and Sun, and heat, for the ſhort day of this life, when after that follows reſt, Eternal reſt, and that will be ſweet, as the reſt of the Labouring-man is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.23. Methinks we ſhould keep cloſe at our work, and hold out in it till the evening of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104582:140"/>
this life. (It is no long ſummers-day, it is but a ſhort a moment any time, compar'd with what follows,) and then you ſhall go to bed in reſt and peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. It is but a little time you have to work on Earth, and you have much work to do (for your own Souls, for the Name of God, for the good of others) and therefore you had need be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent that you may finiſh in time, and not have your work to do when your time is out, that you may with Comfort in meaſure ſay as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhall loſe the reward of our work, if we do not follow our work to purpoſe, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. working by halves is the way to loſe all our work, <hi>i. e.</hi> working idly, negligently, ſlothfully; or working unconſtantly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully; unſtedfaſtly, going in, and giving over, not holding out, but falling off from the truth or the wayes and ſervice of God (which the Apoſtle in that place, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. ſpeaks of, and gives warning againſt) this brings a Curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing or reward, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Improve Heaven unto fitneſs for, and Comfort in Death. Death unto the Saints is their paſſage from Earth to Heaven, from this place of ſin and tears, into that ſtate of Joy, and Bliſs and Glory we have been ſpeaking of (in their Souls preſently, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.43.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104582:140"/>
and in certain hope of their Bodies Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the ſame Glory) Hence a real ſight, and lively hope, and taſte of Heaven is able to ſweeten death, how bitter ſoever unto Nature: This chief of Joyes is able to maſter the King of Terrours, and to cauſe the Believer to Triumph over it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 57. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.4. Death is a departing out of, if we ſpeak of this life, (this poor, ſorry, ſinfull, weary life) ſuch a one we ſay departed this life: But it is an entrance into life; if we ſpeak of the life to come in Heaven (that ſweet, glorious, ſinleſs happileſs) ſo it is to a Saint. A going out of a ſmoaky Cottage, but an entrance into a Kingdom, the Kingdom of our Lord, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. It is a going from hence: But it is a going to Chriſt, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.23. a going from your people and friends here, but it is a going and being gathered to their people, and Bleſſed Congregation that is above, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 49.33. Hence the fore-thoughts and hopes of Heaven ſhould,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make the Saints willing to die, (of readineſs and fitneſs for it in other reſpects, we ſpeak ſomewhat under the third head) not willing to break away from their work before they have done it, out of frowardneſs, wearineſs and diſcontent, or before Gods time be come: But willing to go home, and to leave all the World, and paſs through the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104582:141"/>
dark entry of Death, that they may go to God, go home to Chriſt in Heaven when ever his time ſhall be come. As a dying Saint ſaid, I have but one dark entry to paſs through, and then I am at my Fathers houſe. Be it that death is a dark entry, yet it leads to thy Fathers houſe. Stick not at paſſing to it through ſuch an entry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5 8. Be not willing and deſirous alwayes to tarry here, among ſins and temptations, and where you are Comparatively abſent from the Lord: But be willing to be abſent from the Body, to be Gloriouſly preſent with the Lord. Though the Body be a near friend, Chriſt is nearer: And your parting with that for a time, is in order to an happy meeting, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. while Gods work, ſervice and Glory, and the good of his people detains him here, he is willing to tarry; but otherwiſe deſirous to be gone, when he looks forward to that that will be the Iſſue and Conſequent of his departure or diſſolution, <hi>viz.</hi> The full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Company, which is better than all the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It ſhould give them Comfort in Death, to be looking up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, unto Jeſus Chriſt there (to whom you are now going) is a good dying poſture, as it was <hi>Stephens, Act.</hi> 7. And it is a ſufficient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port againſt the diſcomfort of Death. Look
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104582:141"/>
to the Glory and Life you ſhall be received up unto, that will ſwallow up the Death you ſhall be received through, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.51. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. When you lay down your heads in the duſt, you at once lay down all ſins and ſorrows; who would not part with the Body, for a time to part with ſin forever. Death will do that for you, that all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, all afflictions, all means could not do, it will preſently carry you near, very near, fully near to Chriſt, into full and everlaſting fellowſhip with him. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Conſolations here, Eternally ſerves to eſtabliſh and ſtrengthen againſt all Sufferings and Death it ſelf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is an afflicting Providence from God, and juſt cauſe of ſhame to me [for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not clear my ſelf from a great deal of juſt blame] that I have not done, nor can now do any thing for you in regard of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings you deſired of me: I have, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preſſed with variety of urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and much time [in the way I am in] is dayly taken up from my perſonal ſtudies, beſides many incident avocations: And alas I can do little, and make but ſlow progreſs in the long race of Learning I have to run! And it is my miſerable guiſe, either by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs or weakneſs, to fall ſhort of that good I ſhould either get or do; and if it be ſo in this caſe towards you, it is no wonder though it ſhould be my deep ſorrow! But yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſome paſſages in your laſt and former Letters concerning your Spiritual Condition, and knowing by experience in my ſelf the reality of ſuch Complaints, I would not be ſo graceleſs as to neglect you wholly therein:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104582:143"/>
And though I can ſay or do very little, yet a word or two might be of ſome uſe; nor do I know what guilt might lye upon me, if I ſhould be ſilent or ſlight in this Caſe! And therefore [Dear —] if my barren heart would ſuffer me, I would preſent you with a few words, as if you and I were alone in a Corner in the preſence of God!</p>
            <p>The Condition you expreſs, is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon [but fearful] Epidemical Calamity of thoſe times and places where the Goſpel is Preached, and among ſuch as outwardly carry fair: Convinced, but not humbled; ſome apprehenſions of miſery and affections now and then, but not deep effectual mournings; ſomething burdened with ſin and miſery, and wrath of God; but yet able to bear it, and contented to live without being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it: Knowing every thing, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing; or rather knowing every thing, and yet indeed knowing nothing; in ſeeing not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my own part, it is that which hath been the baneful miſery of my ſoul [even that very thing which thou ſay and mean] ever ſince I knew any thing; and the Lord knows how little I am delivered from it, and how much of my work in this point [upon which the very hinges of our Salvation turn] is yet to do to this day! Oh [my —] if my heart were not Adamant, I ſhould weep
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104582:143"/>
with and for you: And truly when I am moſt near God, I have no greater requeſt then this for my ſelf and you, that God would uſe any means to make us ſee things really as they are, and pound our hearts all to pieces, and make indeed ſin moſt bitter, and Chriſt moſt ſweet; that we might be both humbled and Comforted to purpoſe! An imperfect work of the Law, and then an imperfect work of the Goſpel, is the bane and ruine of us in theſe dayes! Some fears and affections, and then ſome hopes of mercy [without finding full reſt and ſatisfaction in Chriſt only] men reſt in, and here periſh! But hence is the ground of that you ſpeak of: An heart that doth not, cannot feel ſin [and conſequently, no other thing that Gods word ſpeaks of] and the wrath of God for it to purpoſe: Cannot be ſenſible of ſin or miſery in an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual manner! Now a word or two of Counſel to you in this Caſe!</p>
            <p>Firſt conſider the end and thing you are to ſtrive after. Secondly the way and manner how: Your buſineſs is never to reſt till you come to feel ſin as an inſupportable burden, and then to find reſt and everlaſting ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in Chriſt, imbracing him as your own! To go on humbling to be humbled, and to ſee ſuch intollerable evil in ſin; and be ſo burdened with the wrath of God lying
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104582:144"/>
upon you for it, as it may make ſin ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly odious to you, and force you to fly for refuge to lay hold of the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; and to have ſtrong Conſolation there! This is a great thing, not eaſily and quickly gotten, but fit not down at quiet till you come to this! This is the way to make all ſure! But you will ſay I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ever had any true humiliation; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any thing in me that will ſtand by me, when an hour of Temptation comes? Therefore now reſolve, I will padle and dally with God and my own ſoul no longer, I will never give God reſt till he ſhew me things really, and till I have attained that ſenſe of ſin and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus which is real and effectual! This is the work of our lives, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 29. Let me never reſt till it be put out of all doubt, that God in Chriſt is mine own, and hath made an everlaſting Covenant with me! This I will have, or I will be in bitterneſs before the Lord while I have any Being; and for the reſidue of my dayes, I will dwell with them that lye down in ſorrow, I will have my ſociety with ſuch forſaken ſouls; who being deſolate and deſerted, are free among the dead: If the bleſſed God ſhall excommunicate this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul from his gracious preſence, [which yet is but an Act of his moſt Holy and juſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104582:144"/>
ſeverity] Oh! let me find this favour in his ſight, that I may alſo excommunicate my ſelf from the pleaſures and enjoyment of this preſent World! And reſolve this, if God will not let me ſee the good of his choſen, [and I have nothing to ſay why he ſhould] I will mourn, I will mourn; let me live and dye in the houſe of mourning: If God will not Comfort me, nothing elſe ſhall; if I may not have peace and reſt in God, I'le have none at all; if God will take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in me, I'le take no pleaſure in my ſelf: Let my tears be my meat continually; let me go mourning up and down the World while I have a day to live: If God caſt me off, let this be my condition! Nay, [come to this paſs] I cannot live, unleſs God be reconciled to me: My ſpirit fails, if the Lord redeem not preſently! There is no beeing, no biding for me, unleſs he ſpeak a word of peace to me. [<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2, 3, 17, 8. and 143.4, 7.] And in a time of need God will help, when you are loſt, God will find you, when you are ſick to death, he will heal you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16, 28, 29. His bowels will earn towards you! Never fear want of Conſolatian, if your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation be not ineffectual! And here let me warn you of a thing or two!</p>
            <p>Take heed leaſt ſome leſſer ſorrows and affections heal and eaſe you, and ſo you be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104582:145"/>
kept from great and effectual ſorrows, and from Comfort by Chriſt only! Many a one ſees himſelf in a miſerable Condition; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he goes alone, he prayes [and weeps too it may be] very affectionatly for mercy: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he grows well and whole again! His good affections pleaſe him and heal him, though he be indeed ſtill as far from Chriſt and grounded Comfort as ever! Take heed of this. As alſo ſecondly, Of reſting in ſome hopes of mercy, or in ſome taſts of mercy! Many things give a man good hope that God may ſave him, and the words of Comfort are ſometimes ſweet and refreſhing to his heart, this quiets him: He hath enough now, he runs away with this, when as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not yet his; nor is he ſatisfied with him only! Many periſh here; not but that theſe affctions and hopes are very good, and they may be true [and be ſure to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thankful for any ſuch thing; that you have any deſire to ſeek God, any tears at any time before him, and hope toward him; its more than thouſands have] and very good encouragement to ſeek after Chriſt more; but not to be reſted in without Chriſt! It's a ſign a mans heart is falſe, when a little of any thing will ſerve him!

            <p>Do not ſay there is no hope, and ſo give over ſtriving! Give not way to a ſullen deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateneſs and deadneſs of heart; to a dulled ſunk diſcouraged ſpirit, as it were in vain to ſtir, and will never be better with you! Do not ſay, thus it hath been, and thus it is and you cannot help it, and there tear it! No, no, ariſe and be doing, and God will be with you, is an old and good Rule! What ever your Caſe be, never be diſcouraged: Be humble and afflicted under ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery [the more the better] but never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged! Reſolve, I will yet follow God for all this, come on me what will! See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. Know that God is God, and not man, he can help, nay he will!

Upon this ground [and this is ground enough] go to God and tell him; that the leſs ſenſe you have, the greater is your miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the more need you have of his help: None but God can pull you out of this pit, can inlighten this darkneſs, and break this Adamant; to him therefore you come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Counſel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. Tell him he knows you and ſees you, though you do not know or ſee him, no nor your ſelf neither: He can take hold of you, though you cannot take hold of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. Bring ſuch an heart as you have [longing that it were better] to him, that he would mend it. Bewaile this impenitent heart, cry out of this ſecure ſottifh heart, as the greateſt evil that could befall you; beſeech him to uſe any means to break it, and change it: Fill your mouth with Arguments before him; tell him of his free [oh hang there upon free mercy] his tender, his preventing, his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold rich mercy: Say you are reſolved never

               </gap>ch God to help you. Thirdly, By uſe of time you will find it more eaſie. Fourthly take advantage upon all the evil frames that at preſent you feel, to apply and ſet on ſome ſoaking expreſſion in Scripture: As in caſe of hardneſs, blindneſs, vanity, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104582:148"/>
this heart I feel; and the reſt of it will be verified upon me as well as this. Fifthly, take the advantage of ſpecial ſeaſons for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when your heart is in a feeling frame [as after Prayer, after Sermon, if you cannot before] and lay up what you get: One truth felt in M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ditation, is worth a World, and it will make way for more. Sixthly, do ſomething that is equivalent and helping to it, at leaſt when you cannot ſo directly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate: as reading of a good Book, writing of your former and preſent life: [that is a thing of endleſs uſe] gathering up Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and your ſins in writing ſometimes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Prayer; this is the bleſſed means of getting a poor ſoul to Heaven: And what an happineſs is it that we may pray to God; beſides Family-prayer, get ſome time for ſecret Prayer, dayly leſs or more: Be tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God your heart alone; I know your occaſions and labours [the Lord break my heart for you] would not afford you that liberty that I [wretch] have: But do what you can; love the duty, and God will pitty you, wherein you are juſtly, and by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence [not your own negligence] hindred: and this is certain, he that hath an heart ſhall never want time or place to pray! En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to order your matters, ſo as you may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104582:148"/>
have time for it: And if you could weekly have a piece of an Afternoon [as Saturdy in the Afternoon an hour or two, or as God guids] ſet a part for ſecret and cloſe converſe with God by Meditation and Prayer, thinking, writing, reading, examining, mourning before God; and do this conſtantly you would never repent it: The buſineſs of Salvation is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on in ſecret between God and a mans own ſoul: And by all means provide, that you may have your Sabbaths as free as poſſible all the day, and the Evening before and after, for ſpiritual work: Ply God in ſuch ſeaſons as theſe be, and be very thankful if you get but any little ground of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and miſeries: Go about your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occaſions, not as a liberty to the fleſh, [as to think that now my task of praying is over, now I may pleaſe my ſelf, and refreſh my heart in the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] but as the ſervice of God, and as unto him, becauſe he bids you be thus imployed: As when he bids me pray, I will pray with all my might; ſo I will work too, when he bids me work, and not do it to pleaſe my ſelf, [alas, if I conſider it, what pleaſure or Comfort is there in this evil World] but to pleaſe him: I will buſie and employ my ſelf in this World, [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bids me] but my place and my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104582:149"/>
reſt ſhall be only in God, or no where: As Seamen go to Sea, but build their houſes at land; ſo I'le go into the World, but lay up my heart and comfort and my whole ſupport in God! I will live in the World, but not upon it; I will live only upon God, and have my Portion in him. And do not think that this ſorrow and ſence of ſin, and mourning after God, ſtands in a Monkiſh dooping ſullenneſs and ſadneſs, [though 'tis certain that by the ſadneſs of the Countenance the heart is made better, and one ſhould not give himſelf to unneceſſary mirth, which is very poyſonfull, nor purpoſely choak his ſpirituall ſorrows with temporal delights:] But when you have ſeriouſly ſpent your time with God, and have left your heart with him, and he calls you to your occaſions; go about them with alacrity, and chearfullneſs, ſo as you may diſpatch them comfortably; and carry amiably and delightfully to thoſe about you. And let your ſorrows and ſenſe of your Souls miſeries lie deep and undermoſt, ſo as you may recall them in their ſeaſon; when you come to pray, or be alone with God again; labour to have a conſtant habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall feeling of your ſelf, [and get as many good thoughts and affections as you can at all times] ſo as it may be livelily actual,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104582:149"/>
eſpecially in your ſeaſons of attending upon God, and in them drive on the buſineſs of your Soul, as if there were no World; and as if there were nothinng elſe to be minded but that. And if you find your heart gon when the ſeaſon of ſeeking God comes; then know that you have in ſome meaſure back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden, and forſaken God; and never leave till you have recovered it. Recall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view often the chief ſins of your life that you can remember; confeſs and aggravate them before God in a ſpeciall manner, [but have your times of confeſſing and bewailling all the ſins that ever you can remember] and think of what ſins or courſe it was that cauſed God to leave you, to this wofull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency of heart, and bewail them bitterly. One thing more I muſt add; Do not think it much to have ſome ſpeciall ſeaſons of ſeeking God, beſides thoſe I have named. If you had a friend with whom you might now and then ſpend a little time, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring together, in opening your hearts, and preſenting your unutterable groanings before God, it would be of excellent uſe: Such an one would greatly ſtrengthen, beſtead, and further you in your way to Heaven. Spend now and then [as occaſions will permit] an hour [or ſo] with ſuch a friend more then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104582:150"/>
ordinary, [ſometimes a piece of a day, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a whole day of extraordinary faſt, in ſtriving and wreſtling with God for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mercy.] And be much in quickning conſcience, giving and taking mutuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and directions in the matters of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led today, looking to Jeſus the Author and finiſher of your Faith. But you will ſay [it may bee] and I ſpeak but what I have found in my own heart, [Dear — I deal plainly with you, as I know you would have me do, and therefore let me ſuppose it ſhould be ſaid] This is a tedious hard task, and my heart likes not to be ſo yoaked and toiled in ſuch things: I can take no pleaſure therein; and if I ſhould force my ſelf to it for a while, yet it would ſoon weary me: I have no heart to theſe things; it may be ſomthing might be done in this way, or another might do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but I have no heart to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Wonder not at this, not think the worſe of that courſe, becauſe your heart
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104582:150"/>
luſteth againſt it, but think the better of it. For, the better any thing is, and the more inſtrumentall for our Salvation, the more it is oppoſed by our vile hearts, which are enemies to God, and conſequently to our own chief good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Confeſs to God this naughtineſs of your heart: beſeech him to help you againſt this Devil, to change your nature, and let this occaſion you to ſee and loath the wickedneſs of your nature, and be inraged againſt it.

            <p>3<hi>ly</hi> Conſider what is the reaſon why this way ſeems ſo irkſome and tedious, and you have no heart to it? Is it not becauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward blindneſs and ſecurity? becauſe you ſee not things as they be, nor the weight and worth of them? It is an irkſome thing to a man to riſe out of his bed in the night, when he lies warm and knows no danger, nor urgent occaſion to riſe; but if he awake, and ſee, his houſe on fire about his ears, he will make no demur about the matter, but be glad he may riſe? Verily, one reall glimpſe of the wrath of God burning about us, or of Eternity that is a coming; one reall glimpſe of Gods anger [lying upon our Souls] which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above the moſt awful apprehenſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104582:151"/>
of man or Angel; Oh! this would make us skip at a time to pray in, at an hour to cry out to God for mercy in, eſpecially if we might do it with any hope of being heard, and ſaved, as now we may. So that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I have no heart to this courſe, is not becauſe there is want of reaſon to perſwade me, but becauſe I am blind; and I feel my blindneſs, I know that I do not ſee things as they be, and therefore I have good reaſon to be deaf, to the Counſel of mine own blind ignorant heart, and to ſtrive by all means to ſee better; and in the mean time, to believe what I do not ſee.</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly.</hi> Offer violence therefore to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and be reſolved in this point; let my heart ſay what it will, let Hell and World be againſt me: My God I muſt have, my God I will have; I muſt get ſight of ſin and faith in Chriſt Jeſus, I muſt make my Salvation ſure, or elſe I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever; and therefore pray I will, and follow God I will, in deſpite of the Devil: Unto him will I look, and [in ſuch a Caſe as this] on him will I wait, who giveth the ſame ſpirit of zeal, of indignation againſt ſin and ſelf, as ſometimes was in holy <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal.</hi> Lord, thou haſt

            <p>5<hi>ly.</hi> Know that if you Conſcionably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon God; he will by degrees make it ſweet and eaſie to you: He will ſtrengthen your heart and hands in your way and work, <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
