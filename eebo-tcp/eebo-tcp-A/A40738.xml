         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Paper thou hast a faithful account why we do not use (but testifie against) the Customs of the World in their Salutations, which yet we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon no mans understanding, but singly bear the Testimony of the Lord as we have received it from him, leaving the thing to be witnessed by the Light and Spirit of God alone in every man's Conscience, to which every one must stand or fall, and in which a man ought narrowly to weigh all his deeds; and as he shall finde peace or reproof from the Lord, after due inquest, so let him do; not out of fear, to shun the Cross in any thing, nor for affection, or out of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any, without the sence and feeling of the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, and his leadings; in both which there is danger and an absolute mistake of the way of Truth, in which the Servants of the Lord are led: and such are as far from the true Unity with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, as they that are conformable to the Worlds Customs in blindness, of which I thought good to warn all men every where, that they might come to the true ground, or ground of Truth in themselves, there to find and feel the Iudgements of the Lord against all evil, by the Light made manifest in themselves, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Power of the Lord which leads out of the
<pb facs="tcp:97450:3"/>
evil seen, which Power is received in the giving up to, and answering of, the Convictions of the Light; And that the whole World may know that our Unity stands not in an external conformity of the Hat, Cap, or any other outward thing or action, but in that Light, Life, Power &amp; Spirit which the World know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, neither can receive, in and by which we are all united unto one Spirit, Soul, Mind and Body, of which Christ is the head, even by the living virtue which proceedeth and descendeth from him, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening of each member, according to the measure which it is capable of where it is; so that our <hi>Unity</hi> is not <hi>without</hi> but <hi>within,</hi> nor with any outward practice, though never so apparent to have been the practice of the Saints and holy men of old, whether <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets,</hi> or <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> in the times of greatest purity, further than it is now in this day, and in that person that doth it, found, felt and known to proceed from that One, only Antient and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit and Life, in which alone God hath alwayes been worshipped and honoured, and not at all out of it, at any time; for he that is not in the Spirit is in the flesh, and he that is in the flesh cannot please God; and he that is not in the Life, is in death; and the dead cannot praise our God, who is a living God, and liveth for evermore.

            <head>The Worlds <hi>Honour</hi> detected; and, for the unprofitableness thereof, rejected; and the Honour that comes from God alone, asserted, and reduced to practice, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THat there is an <hi>Honour</hi> from men to each other, which also is to be shewed upon <hi>all occasions</hi> to all men in common; yea, and a special <hi>Honour</hi> from <hi>Inferior</hi> to <hi>Superior</hi> Relations according to the flesh, as from <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Parents,</hi> from <hi>Servants</hi> to their own <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> from <hi>Wives</hi> to their <hi>own Husbands,</hi> from <hi>Subjects</hi> to their own <hi>Emperors, Kings, Princes, Magistrates,</hi> or <hi>Rulers,</hi> and from the People of God to those whom the Lord hath placed as Watchmen over them; yea, and a <hi>double Honour</hi> to all those that <hi>rule</hi> well, and are found doing the Work of the Lord faithfully, is of it self so clear, that it needs no proof, being so clearly asserted in the holy Scriptures, and denyed by no People (that I have ever met with, or heard of) which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to be amongst the number of those things placed by God, immediately from himself in his creature Man; which of all demonstrations, is the most firm and valid that any man can have, because he hath a firm testimony thereof immediately in himself, which being free from all possibility of being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unless by himself, and with his own consent, I call the most firm and stable assurance that man can have, far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any writing, or written testimony, which being never so pure, true, and infallibly so in it self at its first giving forth, may in process of time, through malice of men, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and negligence of Transcribers, be falsifyed, vitiated, and corrupted, or defective, before it reacheth my hands; and so consequently without my consent or guilt: but so cannot this immediate inward living Testimony of the Spirit or Light of God in man be; but here every man must have a hand in corrupting it for himself, and turning this Grace of God, which hath appeared to all men, bringing Salvation, into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97450:4"/>
whereby they justly bring condemnation and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon themselves.</p>
            <p>Now what this <hi>true Honour</hi> is, this is the Question among many, and how it is <hi>given</hi> or <hi>shewn</hi> to men in <hi>general,</hi> and how to each <hi>particular</hi> Relation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>true Honour</hi> then, it self, I affirm (and I hope with the consent of all intelligent men) to be <hi>LOVE,</hi> or a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Love,</hi> Universal <hi>Love,</hi> placed by God, near man, in his heart and mouth; and it is shewn or given to any man in particular (and so in general) by extending it self forth in the Actions of Love towards him, as his condition and necessity requireth.</p>
            <p>This, with me, is the only true foundation of all true and lasting Honour, which cometh from God undeniably; as that without which all honour, so called, is <hi>no honour,</hi> but only in shew, and not in deed; for how can I honour him whom I love not, or indeed love a man, and not honour Him? its impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>These two then are inseparable, yea, they are converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they are one: this <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>Honour,</hi> and this <hi>Honour</hi> is <hi>Love</hi>; where the one is wanting, the other cannot truly be; where and whensoever the Universal Love cools to any member of the body of mankind, there and then the true Honour ceaseth, till the Love be again renewed; and if there yet abideth a shew of honour, 'tis indeed but a shew, a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of hypocrisie; as the worlds honour, and honouring one another, for the most part is; who can, and frequently do, make a shew of honouring one another, while deceit and mischief lodgeth in their hearts, and is covered over with that mantle which they oft assume for that very end: As their own Proverb in the Italian tongue hath it;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chi ti carezza piú che no suole, ò in gannato ti hà ò in gannar ti Vuole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that courteth thee more than he is wont, either he hath deceived thee already, or intends it.</p>
            <p>Now, as I have said, there never was any People so dull, but they have honoured, or had in esteem (which is all one) some or other, at least their Relations; but to honour all men,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97450:4"/>
to love all men, is the perfectian of a Christion, 'tis his work, and his alone, who is in the Lord; none else can, but such as dwell in God, that is, in Love, which is the bond of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>The Heathens they loved their friends, and honoured those that loved them; and the Scribes &amp; Pharisees their Brethren, saluting them with their self-invented and accumstomary salutations and manners: but to love and honour all men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Perfection; unto which Christ, the Eternal Son and Love of the Father, laboured to bring his Disciples, that they might be like unto Him, <hi>perfect, as their Heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this true honour which comes from God, the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant, or at least heedless, they have gone about to establish their own honour, which is of the Earth, comes from men, from the earthly spirit of the World in men and women, and so pleaseth the same spirit in all; <hi>for the World receiveth its own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having now changed this true, natural, genuine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is of God, into their own artificial, feigned, and strained art of Complement, consisting in bundles of foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fond Ceremonies, foolish windings, turnings, crouchings and cringings with their bodies, uncovering their heads, using multitudes of frothy, frivolous, light, vain, yea, and most commonly lying words, in a way of Complement; which being brought forth, the airy, light, vain mind in men, is so taken with it, that it is set up in their minds, as the most accomplish'd piece that can be imagined amongst them, and ratified by a perpetual Law, as unalterable as the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to be the only standard, by which all honour, respect, reverence, esteem or love must be measured; being so enamoured upon it, that they deem it their glory and crown, to be exact in it, to a punctilio, <hi>de cap-à-pé</hi>; and he is amongst them accounted, the most accomplish'd <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> that is most expert at it: Being thus arrived to so high esteem at Court, and had in such venerable reverence among the Grandees of the Earth, and renowned Ones of the World, it provokes the ambitious honour-seeking-spirit in its more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97450:5"/>
Orb (each according to their ability) to seek to render themselves Masters of it, by a certain double-diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and practice of them; yea, it hath such influence upon Professors of God, Christ, Scripture, Spirit, Professors that profess themselves separated from, and chosen out of the World, that the most sober amongst them (not to mention the more light) are found conforming to them so far as their gravity will admit (and somewhat further too sometimes) but wherein themselves fall short, lest they should be too grosly guilty of levity, and justly charged therewith, yet, is it none of their smallest cares, and strenuous endeavours, to use all meanes imaginable (according to their ability) to train up their Children in these <hi>evil manners</hi> (deceitfully called <hi>good manners</hi> now a dayes) and to that end send them to Schools to learn them to walk, and shail their legs in Dancing, to doff their Hats, and wring their bodies in Congees, and how to hold their hands, heads, necks, and make fine Courtesies backwards, with such like things, as young Women learn at such places, that so they may not lose one grain, hair, nor jot of that honour, renown, fame, respect, and worship among men, which their Parents can purchase them by their money: And thus the Fathers having eaten lowre Grapes, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens teeth are commonly set on edge; and such as are not of themselves so, are oft-times made to eat; and so this kind of honour is instilled into them in their tender age, that it may as it were grow up with them, and through custom, and the esteem it hath in the world, become natural to them; that so the true Honour which should take place, is by this bastard honour, supplanted, suppressed, and, as it were, ejected.</p>
            <p>This is the case, and thus it stands with the World, Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and Prophane, and many know it well, but will not see. And therefore those whom the Lord hath in mercy redeemed out of these vanities, and stopped many in their full career, that they cannot run into the same excess of vanity with them; because they forsake all this mock-honour, are (though found in the more excellent, in the Honour which comes from God towards all men) despised, mocked, rendered strange Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Wonders, gazing stocks, Spectacles to all Nations, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97450:5"/>
and Cities, where these things are made the standard or touchstone of all <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Good-manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this is no more then was of old; for there is no new thing under the Sun: as the Prophet of the Lord said, <hi>Behold! I and the Children thou hast given me, are for signs and wonders in Israel.</hi> So it may be said now, for so it is at this day.</p>
            <p>Therefore ye despisers, wonder not at us, that we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken and denied all these things, root and branch, but turn your eyes into and among your selves, and see what strange and antick manners you have among you, see what baubles and toyes you are pleased with, what pittiful sorry things you are delighted in, seek after, covet, and love, and wonder that Man, whom God made upright, and planted a noble Plant in his own Image, to love and take his delight in, him alone, should ever come to be so degenerated, and faln in love with such vanities as these, things more light than feathers: at this, I say, rather wonder, for here is true matter of wonder, of wonder indeed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let every man of sobriety and moderation, weigh the thing, ponder it, and tell me, which of you cannot think in his heart (much less is convinced there) that this is the Honour which comes from God alone, which he requireth that men should yield to each other? who of you all hath faith therein?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But some may say, we do not say that these things are the honour it self which comes FROM GOD, we pretend it not, they are but a kind of civil Worship, honour and respect used to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, as certain signs and tokens of the esteem we have in our hearts towards each other, which we do hereby express; and so the whole is but an indifferent thing, which doth not once in the least touch or concern the Conscience or Religion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If it be not OF AND FROM GOD (call it what you will, and do it for what end you will, it matters not) it is OF AND FROM THE DEVIL; for more than <hi>two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, roots</hi> or <hi>originals,</hi> from whence all Actions proceed, can no man find, there is no <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>Mean</hi> betwixt <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>of God</hi> (which is one) and <hi>evil,</hi> or of the <hi>Devil</hi> (which is the other) it is either a <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> well-pleasing to God; or a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97450:6"/>
               <hi>work of the flesh,</hi> satisfying the carnal mind: either it is of the good root of Faith, or of the evil root of Sin: <hi>For whatsoever is not of Faith, IS Sin.</hi> There's no middle-place, nor middle-nature betwixt these two: Is not the very plowing of the wicked sin; yea, his prayers abomination?</p>
            <p>Or, is there indeed any thing else, truly considered, amongst all the actions of the children of men, so <hi>indifferent,</hi> as that they touch not the <hi>conscience,</hi> or concern not the honour and glory, or service of God?</p>
            <p>But though I thus enquire, yet to this I know its common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said Yea— yea, there is nothing more ready and common amongst men, than to say to us in this case, <hi>What do you talk of this? of Conscience in these things? 'tis folly, there's no matter of Conscience in it, they are indifferent things, putting off the Hat and bowing is but a civil matter, in which there is nothing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, I say, this is no less than the Antichrist, who exalteth himself above all that is called God, The very <hi>Lucifer</hi> that would dissolve the continual everlasting Bond betwixt God and Man, and would absolve the creature Man of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God his Creator, and duty, of continually minding the Lord, and setting him alwayes before his eyes, at least in some things which he termeth <hi>indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was the judgment of one (who I believe knew God better than these men) That a man ought in <hi>all</hi> his actions to obey God, and not to do any thing, but as unto him; nay, not so much as <hi>eat</hi> or <hi>drink,</hi> (things as indifferent (if there were place for such indifferency) as any can be) and far more indifferent than these baubles of <hi>wagging the Hat, &amp;c.</hi> being absolutely necessary to the ordinary conservation of life and being, which these idle things cannot once pretend to.</p>
            <p>His Judgment you may read as well as I, he is one of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Antiquity and Authority enough, even to merit credit with the greatest contenders for, and pretenders to Antiquity, the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>; and may not be slighted by any that have any esteem for Antient Authors— His Judgment then I find recorded in a Letter of his, written and addressed to his dear Friends, the Saints or Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97450:6"/>
since (by the industry of some) divided into chapters and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and there you may read it in his first Letter, written to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from <hi>Philippi,</hi> chap. 10. ver. 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye DO,</hi> (if there can be any thing imagined more indifferent (than these things) yet do it, even that also, yea) <hi>DO all to the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, in another Epistle of the same Author (a faithful Servant, Minister and Apostle of Christ) written from <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> chap. 3. v. 17. (as it is now divided) he saith also to them, <hi>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus,</hi> &amp;c.—who spake on this wise to all that would profess his Name, <hi>If any man will follow me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross</hi> Daily, <hi>and follow me,</hi> as ye may reade it in the history of his life, words and actions, penned by <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 16.24. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. which three Histories, with that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and the several Letters or Epistles of <hi>Paul, Peter, Iames, Iohn, Iude,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are with the Books of the old Testament bound together, and called the Law of God, and Rule for all Christians to walk by. But Oh! that they were found walking in those paths of Holiness there declared of, and imbracing from their hearts the Doctrines in them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and excelling in the Virtues therein recorded! would it not be otherwise with them? Surely yea. But to this they can never come, while estranged from that Spirit who wrought all these things in the Saints: for as no Prophecy of old came by the will of man, so neither the fulfilling of any of these things in man. But to return to the Present case.</p>
            <p>Who can say that he doth thus put off his Hat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the honour of God, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, as a follower of Christ, in a cross to himself? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But your selves say, <hi>We must honour all men; if so, How shall we shew it, or what shall be the demonstration thereof? A man may tell me, that he honours me in his heart, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he hates me, how shall I know it, unless he shews it forth in his outward man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> True, a man may pretend honour, while envy and hatred is in his heart, and no man knoweth what is in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97450:7"/>
heart of man, save the Spirit of man that is in him; and 'tis not the Hat that doth or can discover man's heart, but the Spirit of God. We must not therefore set up things for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, which demonstrate nothing at all: for a man may make as great a shew of honour with his Hat, and his fawning flattering tongue, by <hi>Titles, Complements,</hi> many <hi>Good-morrows</hi> and <hi>Good-nights &amp;c.</hi> when he not onely not honours thee, but hates thee in his heart, and intends thee a mischief, and only covers himself under this cloak; as the German Proverb hath it, <hi>Mehr Feind, Mehr Ehr. The greater Enemy, the more Worship or Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let no man trouble himself about the demonstration of Honour; for where the true Honour is in the heart, it will shew it self enough, no fear; and where it is not, why should any desire a shew of it, seeing it can be no more but a <hi>bare shew</hi> indeed? And why any should delight in, or desire a <hi>shew</hi> without <hi>substance,</hi> I know not, unless to verifie the Proverb, <hi>Populus vult decipi,</hi> People love to be deceived.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But may we then use no external actions or gestures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate this honour by?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, but it must then be by such things or actions as proceed from the true honour, are agreeable to it, and insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from it, which may bring clear demonstration with them; else 'tis but in vain: for, as good not at all, as to no purpose.</p>
            <p>He that useth a thing to this or that end, which cannot answer the end intended, labours in vain: And such are, and thus do, all that use those self-set-up customary ceremonial Gestures and Postures in Salutations, to demonstrate the true honour and esteem by, as experience daily demonstrates, that they are but <hi>a feigned humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As therefore there is a true honour and a false, so there is a true and living demonstration, agreeable to the true honour and inseparable from it, and a false shew and semblance thereof in ceremonies without substance, which may be and is, where the true honour, love and esteem is not, and so is deceitful.</p>
            <p>But as fire and flax, necessarily makes its way through and infallibly demonstrates it self: and as life infallibly shews it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97450:7"/>
self, by natural heat and motion, to such as are alive and can discern or feel it; so this true honour which comes from <hi>God alone,</hi> dwelling in the heart, as necessarily shews it self, by certain natural, lively actions, that are inseparable from it, and so consequently true and infallible, according as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling honour leads, moves, guides, directs and puts forth it self, either by <hi>giving the hand,</hi> falling on <hi>the neck, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, kissing,</hi> and at all times, upon all occasions, by <hi>doing good</hi> to all, helping them, walking towards all men in <hi>Love, Patience, Meekness</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> so far as in them lieth, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hungry,</hi> cloathing the <hi>Naked,</hi> visiting the <hi>Sick,</hi> the <hi>Widdows</hi> and <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herless,</hi> which, with many other such like things, are pure Religion and undefiled; which also are more infallible demonstrations of true honour, than those dirty customs of bowing the body, bidding <hi>Good-morrow</hi> and <hi>Good-night,</hi> wagging the <hi>Hat,</hi> and such like things, practised in a bare custom, while the heart and thoughts may be full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and compassing evil against the person pretended to be honoured thereby: and thus these things, being the customs and fashions of the world now, do exactly answer to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and traditions, and lip-honour among the People of old, in which there neither was nor is <hi>any substance at all,</hi> and so for the unprofitableness thereof to be rejected, and a more true, right and undeceiveable used instead thereof.</p>
            <p>For, as a man afar off, perceiving a thing to move, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved, should thence infer life to be in it, when he drew nearer to it should find himself grosly deceived, and that the cause of the motion was only artificial, from without, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally intrinsecal.</p>
            <p>Even so, he that should conclude that a man honoureth or esteemeth him, because he worshippeth his person, and greets him in the Market-place, when he comes to look well into it, and to have occasion to try it, may find himself ex<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reamly deceived, and instead of <hi>true honour</hi> indeed, onely find an <hi>empty shew,</hi> and no<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing else; instead of <hi>true love,</hi> nothing but <hi>false complements,</hi> wind, vanity and deceit, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand the tryal.</p>
            <p>And as that motion which comes from life, the more any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97450:8"/>
man draws towards it, the more it appears to be natural, not artificial, and so shuns no tryal, feareth not the most piercing search, but rather willingly imbraces it that it may be manifest.</p>
            <p>Even so again, These true natural, genuine demonstrations of honour, or actions and gestures when they proceed from the inward life, ground, principle and nature of the true Honour, moving in the heart, and putting forth it self in them, they fear no search, no tryal, but are free, open and willing to be weighed and looked into, yea rejoyce in the most narrow and exact observation, and prying eye, and come willingly to the Light, that so they may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to be of God.</p>
            <p>This then, forasmuch as it can deceive no man, why should it not be by all Christians willingly imbraced and preferred, before a deceitful, weak, beggarly Rudiment, Ordinance and Fashion of the world, as the doffing the Hat is, in which there is no substance?</p>
            <p>Is it not because the one is light, easie and pleasant to the fleshly mind in men and women, the other hard, uneasie, and a great cross to that mind? Is it not a clear demonstration that men are more inclined to a <hi>shadow,</hi> than <hi>substance</hi>; more affected with <hi>vanity</hi> than <hi>well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet is this no great wonder that it is thus in the world; for what can be expected from <hi>thistles,</hi> but <hi>thistles?</hi> or, do men gather <hi>grapes</hi> on <hi>thorns</hi>? This kind of honour is their own invention, therefore they love it. And no wonder to see the world love its own. The other is from God alone, the author and fountain of all true Honour, Love and Esteem; therefore a cross to the world, rejected, and not received by them, for the world only loveth and receiveth its own.</p>
            <p>But why this <hi>pretty Idol,</hi> this <hi>feigned humility,</hi> this <hi>will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> this <hi>earthly thing,</hi> this <hi>fashion of the world,</hi> should be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Professors of this Age, who profess themselves to be God's Elect, chosen out of the world, I understand not; seeing its said to them that were so indeed, that <hi>the fashion of this world passeth away</hi> (and alwayes did from the Saints) and they were commanded, <hi>not to fashion themselves according to the world,</hi> and forbidden to be conformable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97450:8"/>Why these, I say, should be so zealously conformable to such an empty shew, and plead for it, and be offended at Us, who are indeed separated from the world, and dead with Christ to the <hi>Rudiments, Traditions, Fashions, Customs,</hi> and <hi>carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> thereof, and so can no more, as living in the world, be subject to them, as they are, I cannot apprehend, unless because, though they profess themselves to be chosen out of the world, they remain yet in the nature thereof, and so may as fitly be called the <hi>Professors of this World,</hi> as <hi>of this Age.</hi> Which name if they did bear and own, it would be no more strange; for it was alwayes as great a cross to the Professors of the World to break any of their light, frothy, fond, foolish <hi>customs</hi> &amp; <hi>traditions,</hi> as for the most profane. But Friends! is it enough for you to profess your selves <hi>chosen out of the world,</hi> and yet never know your selves <hi>redeemed</hi> out of any of their <hi>Customs, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Institutions,</hi> excepting in a few <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> (so called) <hi>Ceremonies</hi> about the Worship of God; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise abiding <hi>wholly conformable</hi> to all its <hi>Manners, Fashions</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> either in will or act in your selves, or approbation thereof in your children whom you train up in them. But your Reasons you have for its use, you commonly render, are these.</p>
            <p>First, That common Plea, of <hi>the indifferency of these things,</hi> which is answered, and found to be a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> not to be found in <hi>Rerum Natura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Your next, commonly grants that honour of which we speak, to be <hi>good, serviceable</hi> and <hi>necessary.</hi> But adding, <hi>These things ye must do,</hi> (we also do the same) <hi>and not leave the other undone,</hi> Mat. 23.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But where is this written? No where. And admit it had, wherefore might they not since have been done away for the unprofitableness of them, as <hi>(Tything Mint and Anise)</hi> the thing of which Christ speaks there, though once a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God? as <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12.</p>
            <p>Doth not the <hi>Moon,</hi> and also the <hi>Stars,</hi> disappear before the light of the <hi>Sun</hi>? wherefore then should not this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable <hi>shadow</hi> cease before the serviceable <hi>substance?</hi> what needs <hi>a Candle</hi> where the <hi>Sun shines?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, if I do a man good, exercise meekness, patience and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97450:9"/>
love towards a man, be ready to help, inform him, do him good; Is not this demonstration clear enough that I honour that man? What need then of any thing else? if none, then whatsoever is more, is of the <hi>Evil-one,</hi> and of the <hi>superfluity of naughtiness.</hi> Or, may I not believe all this, unless it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Cap and Knee, Good-morrow Sir, Good-night, Madam I kiss your hands, Your humble servant Sir,</hi> with the rest of that phanatick fry of insignificant Complements? may I not certainly conclude that a man lives and speaks to me, when I see him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feel him, and hear him, unless I also see his shadow? what mad <hi>Phanaticism</hi> is this! But</p>
            <p n="3">3. Your third Pretence is made up of an acknowledgment again on the other hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That it's true, there is great abuse got into these <hi>Al-a-mod<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sh Greetings</hi> and <hi>Hat-Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> much superfluity and deceit, which is evil; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ye tell us the <hi>abuse must not take away the use of a thing</hi>; that if others be too superfluous therein, we should let our modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear; if others <hi>do it in deceit</hi> and <hi>pretence only,</hi> we may do it <hi>in uprightness</hi> and <hi>singleness</hi> as it ought; if others do it only, <hi>per forma,</hi> in a custom and usage, we should do it <hi>with an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing?</hi> Or, say some, <hi>Will you not eat and drink, because others eat to excess, and add drunkenness to thirst?</hi> or <hi>will you not set meat and drink before your friend, because others do it in deceit somtimes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This bears a fair shew, and at first blush seems something; but being well weighed, proves nothing, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away. First, prove <hi>wagging the Hat,</hi> with that whole phanatick Regiment of <hi>Al-a-modish Complements,</hi> as good, serviceable and necessary, as eating and drinking, or setting meat and drink before him that hungers or thirsts, and then we'l grant more than can now in reason be desired of us.</p>
            <p>Besides, be it well observed, we have never opposed or contradicted any necessary, or any way serviceable kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of honour, nor are we in the least against it, but do, and alwayes have, pleaded for the same, in opposition to this <hi>cripple, ceremonial, shadowy, modish worsh<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pping of mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> consisting in <hi>Idle, Street,</hi> or <hi>Market-Salutations,</hi> by dof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing the Hat, &amp;c. which is below the dignity of a man: which, as none stand in need thereof, so neither can it do them any good, but may much hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97450:9"/>Now that which in it self is needless, and can do no man good, but may many harm, that is <hi>ABUSE it self,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ought to be avoided, and therefore we have thus denied them.</p>
            <p>But admit that these things had once been serviceable, and that it could yet clearly be made appear wherein, or for what end they were first instituted by men; yea, admit they had once been undoubted Institutions of the Lord, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently serviceable, yea necessary for that time, place and people to whom they were so given; yet cannot this prove them to be still so; and that they cannot, through the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and egregious abuse of them, become not only <hi>needless,</hi> but <hi>unlawful</hi> for the People of God once to touch, taste or handle; and therefore he that from the once legitimacy of an outward practice, shall go about to infer and urge the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of its perpetual duration, may be found resisting his Maker, as many have been, in seeking to perpetuate and bind his People to that which the Lord is about to annihilate and bring his People out of.</p>
            <p>For the universal abuse, or degenerating of a thing, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceremonial, in it self neither essential to the <hi>Being</hi> nor <hi>well-being</hi> of any man, doth <hi>ipso facto,</hi> take away the necessity of the use thereof from the People of God.</p>
            <p>Now whether any can doubt that these things have not been so corrupted or degenerated, is to me a great question, the thing is so apparent to the meanest of capacities. And if any doubt of the truth of the Position, I refer them for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther testimony to the Scriptures of Truth, in which they may search, and see whether it be not so. For tell me,</p>
            <p>What became of the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> for the abuse thereof? no doubt the Idolatrous People were as unwilling to part with it altogether, as now-a-dayes with their Idols; and if a Plea of Reformation from the <hi>Abuse</hi> to the <hi>Right Vse</hi> could have prevailed with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to have spared it, it had never been so ground to pouder. And did it fare any better with all the <hi>Types, Figures, Shadows</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> all once avowed Institutions of God? were they not for the weakness, unprofitableness and abuse thereof all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97450:10"/>
done away, even the very use of them?</p>
            <p>How much more then shall the Lord for the <hi>mis-use, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, weakness</hi> and <hi>unprofitableness</hi> of these earthly things, which never could pretend Divine Institution, nor lay claim to any better Original, than the Noisom dunghil of Humane Custom, lead his People out of them, and not suffer them to touch, taste nor handle them, as nasty, polluted, defiled things, defiled with the despising or slighting of the poor, and exalting of proud flesh, because rich? unless any will say that the Lord is more bound to, and tender over the <hi>idle devices of men,</hi> than of <hi>his own</hi> once <hi>pure Institutions,</hi> when they have been defiled by the sons of men, which would be little less than blasphemy; and therefore few are so shameless as to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it in words, though most do in their works.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be said in this manner which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, <hi>The Rich may indeed honour the Poor,</hi> viz. <hi>by doing them good, &amp;c. and this is to them sufficient without the Hat, or Street-Salutatious, which also (we judge) doth not so well become them as the Rich: Nor can the Poor any other way demonstrate or shew honour to the Rich but by those things; for, as the Rich stand not in need of their help, assistance, doing good, &amp;c. so neither have the Poor wherewithal to do it, and for this cause was this standing bare-headed, bowing, scraping, titling, &amp;c. set up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, for the Poor to honour the Rich, and the Rich each other, by each according to their quality, who yet stand not in need of each others help, assistance, doing good, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is well confest, and the plain truth indeed, though some seek to hide it, to wit, That these Manners and Titles are invented to maintain a Respect of Persons, and to exalt the Person of the Rich man that wears costly garments, gay attire, and Gold-Rings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> over the person of the Poor mean man, clad in vile rayment, that he may (<hi>cum Privilegio</hi>) say to such a one, Come behind me, sit at my footstool, stand off, with thy Hat in thy hand, I am more noble, more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, more worshipful than thou. This their practice plainly speaks to every discerning eye, though many with their tongues may dissemble the contrary.</p>
            <p>But Friends, this was honestly and plainly reproved by a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97450:10"/>
good man, who had been educated in good manners, and wanted for no Tutors to teach him any; this good old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, named <hi>Iames,</hi> plainly calls this matter, <hi>committing sin and transgression of the Law,</hi> in the 2d chapter of his Letter written to the scattered Tribes, and the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse, as it is now divided.</p>
            <p>Now blame us not for rather adhering to Antiquity in this case, than to Novelty; rather to the good manners of Christ and his Apostles and Followers, than to the evil manners of men, falsly called good.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is a very great mistake; for the Rich have as much need of the Mean and Needy, as the Needy have of them, else the Great man must be his own servant (and 'twere well he could so be) his own Taylor, Weaver, Ploughman, and what not.</p>
            <p>Thus hath the all-wise God ordered it that men stand in need of each others aid and assistance, that so they may not despise, contemn, trample upon, and scorn each other, as it nevertheless often happeneth, not for want of stupid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>For the Rich, as is said, do as much (or more) stand in need of the Poor, as they of the Rich; and a poor man that is faithful in all his actions, is as honourable, worthy of as much honour, love and esteem, both before God and man, as the greatest Peer in a Nation; yea the Lord hath more regard unto, and honour for such a mean, faithful, upright-hearted, Gentle-(minded)-man indeed, than for a high, proud, false, angry, imperious, tyrannical, perverse-minded Gentleman, falsly so called.</p>
            <p>What difference is there betwixt the person of the Rich and of the Poor, the person of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> the beggar? hath not the Eternal Being made all men of one blood, from the King upon the Throne, to the Beggar upon the Dunghil? He hath not made such a difference as to the persons, as that he should bring forth the one person to honour, serve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the other, but all to worship and honour him. And if he hath given to any, or they have fraudulently gotten to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a little more wealth, or a larger portion of this worlds
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97450:11"/>
goods than others, they must even thereof render him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; <hi>for the Earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof.</hi> And if any one man be invested with more Power, Authority, or preferred to higher Offices than another, it is not of, nor for himself, but of and from the Lord; for preferment cometh neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South, but God is Judge, to whom he must, even of it also, give an account, as a servant according to the flesh, as well as another man; and to him, <hi>as a person according to the flesh,</hi> belongs no more honour than to another man; but Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to the Power in the Office: and what doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern proud flesh, or the person of any man? we regard no mans person. And assuredly that is the pride of flesh, which the Lord will stain, which saith, I am a Magistrate in Power, in Authority, in God's stead; therefore I must, I will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in my Person: for what is this but to assume the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God to self? Consider and beware, for thou art but a Steward, whatever thou art, and the Lord is Judge, who put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down one and setteth up another, as it pleaseth him, and rewardeth every one according to his deeds.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>To respect Persons,</hi> say some, <hi>is sin,</hi> James <hi>testifies that clearly enough; but we, respect or honour [every body] we do it to all alike, Poor as well as Rich, and then there is no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Ye may imagine so, but it is not truly so, ye do put a difference: for which of you will keep a stir in the streets to give a mean man or woman the wall, or upper-hand, as it is accounted amongst you? or make a bussle to put them up to the upper end of the Table (as you distinguish it) as ye do many times (even to loathing) to the Rich? but your Reason is ready, It doth not so well become them, as the Rich. And so—</p>
            <p>Behold here, ye mannerly Christians! ye Professing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! the use and service of your decent, good manners (so called) to exalt the person of the Rich-man, though proud, and abase the person of the Mean-man, though humble; which is quite contrary to the Lord, <hi>who resisteth and abaseth the Proud, and sheweth favour, and giveth honour to the Humble,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97450:11"/>
it's an abomination to the righteous impartial God.</p>
            <p>Nor are they to the Rich any otherwayes serviceable, than a fifth Wheel to a Waggon, to hurry them headlong to destruction, raising and strengthening the spirit of pride in them, which is ready enough to shew and put forth it self, although it should have no such excitations and provocations from without, by which the love and lust after such things is fed, and that mind satisfied which delighteth in them.</p>
            <p>Now, this mind cannot we feed, satisfie or please; for, as he that is in the World, or in the flesh, cannot please God; so they that are in God, and do walk in his Light and Spirit, by which the World, and spirit thereof, is crucified in and to them, cannot please the World, nor that carnal mind which is enmity to God, and therefore cannot own these things.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Yea, but some there are, and many too, that take no delight in these things, that seek them not, desire them not, regard, value them not, and are dead to them; and why can you not do it to them! what danger is therein? To others, it's true, it may, as you say, do them more hurt then good; yea say some, If we knew such as expect it, look for it, seek it, thirst and hunt after it, we could not give it to such our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Twere well such as speak on this wise, were indeed come so far, so said and so done, were, so far, well; But as for us, we cannot do it to them, because it can do them no good, none at all, but may do others harm, as is granted.</p>
            <p>Now, why I should be urged to do that which can do no man good, but may do many, yea most men harm, I know not, nor can see any reason for it.</p>
            <p>But yea, even to such there is a danger also; for, although some, may at present stand in such a condition, and retain their integrity therein; yet it is said, <hi>To him that thinketh he standeth, let him tak<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Did not <hi>Adam</hi> soon fall from his innocency, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and desiring a thing pleasant to the eyes, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired? To get honour, to be worshipped! what more pleasant! what more desirable! though indeed there is no honour nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

at all in it, nor ever was it so accounted by the people of God, to put off the hat, but a shame and reproach rather, as may be seen by the Priests being forbidden to uncover their heads, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 10. But seeing the frothy minds of people, have imagined to themselves an honour in it; why should we add unto any mans temptation by this vain thing? nay rather let us leave off this thing.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But, say some again, it is their due, and we must not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from any man his due, lest he should abuse it; and much less from him that is not likely to abuse himself with it, because others do; for the Apostle saith,</hi> Give unto every man his due, honour to whom honour is due, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> True, honour is due to the honourable, but then we must see to give them the honour which is due, and not a strange far-fetcht device instead of it, in which is no honour at al, as where is it written, that puting off the hat, bidding <hi>good-morrow,</hi> and <hi>good-night,</hi> saying (though a lie) <hi>I kiss your hands Sir, your Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant Madam,</hi> and such like, is the honour due, or that there is any honour, real, true honour in any of these things; that there is honour so called, so esteemed, a pretence, and shew of honour in these, and every of these things, I know, but to what mind doth it so seem? by what spirit are these things accounted honour? but by that mind which delighteth it self in vanity, and by that spirit and generation which calleth light darkness, and darkness light.— Now doth the Apostle recommend Christians to follow this mind, to be instructed from it, to count that honour which it might esteem so, and accordingly to give it them as their due? or doth he not rather refer them to the Spirit of the Lord which teacheth all things honorable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is the Author of all true honour, and to render that to every man in the Lord, and not an empty shew? the former we deny (nor can't be proved) and this we assert; therefore</p>
            <p>What the Apostle saith, we willingly own and acknowledge, neither would we upon any pretence withhold from any man his due; but as for your common-far-fetcht-fine-spun consequences, you must give us leave to deny them, till you can better prove them; If you be so willing to be deceived, we are not willing to deceive you, to put you off with Cap and Knee, a few fine <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

words, shaddowy scrapes and cringes, when a better substance is your due.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it's said again, you give offence to the weak; Now the Apostle saith,</hi> Judge this rather that ye give no occasion or offence to the <hi>Iews</hi> nor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor to the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a meer shift, and blind subterfuge for ignorance and deceit both, a something, though nothing to the purpose; for the Apostle speaks here of things that <hi>offended the week Consciences of some in those dayes,</hi> and so plainly speaks of <hi>matters of Conscience.</hi> But our Adversaries generally, with one mouth cry out (and think it an invincible Argument against us) <hi>There is nothing of Religion in these things, they are no matters of Conscience, they are things of Civil concern, indifferent, may be left or done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these two Pleas, or Shifts, are diametrically opposite, and cannot stand together; onely if you cleave to the first (as I think all do) to call them <hi>civil, indifferent things, no matters of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> then your Plea is good against your selves, in that ye are found offending us (so far as in you lies) by doing that which we in Conscience to the Lord cannot do, and your selves may leave undone if you will.</p>
            <p>But besides, 'tis granted the good and humble, the meek, lowly are not offended at it, matter it not, whether they have it or not, and evil-minded men we are not to please, in their Haughty, Proud, Ambitious Minds. The Apostles were not <hi>men-pleasers,</hi> and warned the Christians not to <hi>become such,</hi> nor to be <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Ordinances</hi> or <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the world.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Tis true, the good and meek are not offended for their own sakes, because they are not honoured,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But for your sakes, who thereby seem to them, Proud, High-minded, Obstinate, Self-willed, Self-conceited men, and of a Contentious Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> — Let it all come out — And then know, that if any judge us with a rash, false judgement, according to outward appearance, to their <hi>forward, froward minds</hi>; we appeal from their judgement, to him that cannot err in judgement, and knows the inmost frame of our hearts and Spirits, and judgeth us with Righteous Judgement; Have therefore but a little patience to observe our conversations, and if the rest of our converse doth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97450:13"/>
not plainly demonstrate the contrary, let your judgement stand upon that person till it doth.</p>
            <p>But withal, Friends! who are more proud than those that are ready at giving and receiving this thread-bare honour? who are so handy in it, that they have every jot thereof at their fingers and tongues ends as it were? Oh! that ye were indeed enemies to Pride, and offended at it, then would ye suspect your selves and your own manners more then us and ours, and then ye would abstain from that whole bundle of aiery manners, which are as Oyl poured into the fire of Ambition, to increase the flame and burning thirst thereof.</p>
            <p>Yea, commonly, those that are so expert in this <hi>mannerly trade,</hi> do willingly receive again, what they give, with encrease, and so do often give the more liberally, that they may receive their returns in more abundance, as the <hi>Germane</hi> Proverb, saith, <hi>Ehr wil geehrt sein, Honour would be honoured</hi>; but both the <hi>giver</hi> and the <hi>receiver</hi> are out of the <hi>Truth, Way,</hi> and <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi> in that matter, for, he received not honour of men.</p>
            <p>So it is not <hi>true Humility,</hi> nor <hi>morigerosness</hi> to be exact in the <hi>Academy of Complements,</hi> nor yet in a self-pleasing-way of simply putting off the <hi>hat,</hi> and bidding <hi>good-morrow</hi> and <hi>good-even</hi> (which some hope to excuse themselves with) as not being conformable to the worlds <hi>abused customs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, nay, these are not the right <hi>badges</hi> of <hi>true Honour, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>good manners</hi> — but rather of <hi>feignedness, vanity</hi> and <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</hi> — But he that joyns himself to those of low degree, going before them in honour as a good example, — honouring and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all men in that which is good and serviceable, in his place; as well the poor as the rich, the mean as the mighty, without respect of persons; he bears the <hi>badges</hi> of <hi>Humility,</hi> and shews his <hi>good breeding</hi> and <hi>manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! how empty are our <hi>modern mannerly Ones</hi> of these things! when shall we see these things in our streets? in which of our Cities shall we see a great man or a rich man proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his service, and lending his helping hand to a mean despicable man, upon any occasion? Nay either his hands or his cloaths are too fine to stoop to it, and to give them the <hi>upper hand</hi> as they tearm it. Oh nay! that would not be seemly; yea, are they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97450:13"/>
not generally rather ashamed to pass along the streets with one in a mean <hi>habit,</hi> unless he be on the <hi>lower hand,</hi> so called, or with his <hi>Hat</hi> in his hand a-loof off at a distance, as if he were made of some <hi>courser Nature</hi> or more <hi>ignoble matter</hi>: — And if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture some mean man, who sees through the <hi>pittiful hood</hi> of <hi>Lord-ship,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Hood, Worship, Master-ship,</hi> and such like <hi>gay titles,</hi> should, meeting such a <hi>One,</hi> pass by <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaws,</hi> without the observance of giving him the <hi>wall, cap</hi> or <hi>knee,</hi> more than to another mean person; then oft-times <hi>Cain</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>fury, Shimei</hi> in <hi>railing</hi> and <hi>reviling,</hi> or <hi>Ishmael</hi> in <hi>scoffing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these are thy <hi>manners,</hi> nay thy <hi>good manners</hi> (so called) O <hi>Christendom</hi>! are these the <hi>badges</hi> of thy <hi>Humility</hi>? away with them, they stink in the nostrils of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But as concerning the <hi>offence</hi> pretended; we in sincerity say, We would not willingly give offence to any thing that is good, or any thing of God in any man, how weak, mean or low soever; but rather do desire, that all men may come to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and to walk in the <hi>Light</hi> thereof, in which there is no occasion of stumbling nor offence.</p>
            <p>But there are that do, on the one hand make Conscience of that which (to do) is not sin, and on the other hand make no Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or scruple to do that which is sin: — As the <hi>Papists</hi> in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from <hi>meats</hi> at certain <hi>Seasons</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; and again, in <hi>Worshiping Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Honouring Images</hi> of <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>doffing their Hats, bowing</hi> and <hi>cringing</hi> to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (the very Actions here in question) and so zealous they are for these things, that they are possest with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bitterness (where they may shew it with Authority) against such as conform not to them.</p>
            <p>Will ye now say, that we must abstain from the <hi>one,</hi> and do the <hi>other,</hi> to avoid giving them offence? if yea, then why do you not so your selves, but call that <hi>Superstition,</hi> and this <hi>Idolatry</hi>? If not, then why should we be more conformable to your <hi>Customs</hi> to avoid giving you offence, then ye are to theirs upon the same account? are ye not as great or a greater offence to them, then we are to you? seeing they are offended upon a certain <hi>Religious</hi> or <hi>Conscientious,</hi> and ye but upon a <hi>pettish, pevish, wilful account.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And what then!

            <p>Object. <hi>But these are the Customs of the wicked onely in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which though they be the most or greatest part of Nations, yet good Customs are derived from the better part (though the smallest) for we must not follow a Multitude to do evil; But this is the Practice or Custom, not of the wicked onely, but also of the sober, Godly and Wise, unless ye think there are none such but your selves.</hi>

Do not the <hi>Papists</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so say, <hi>Their Practice is not Idolatry?</hi> surely yes; for say they, <hi>Idolatry, is a giving the Divine Honour which is due to God alone, to the Creature; which</hi> (say they) <hi>we do not to the Images of the Saints, nay nor to the Saints themselves neither; but it is a certain due, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, decent respect, Worship or Ecclesiastical Honour, which our Holy Mother the Church requires of us her Children, thereby to shew forth the esteem and reverence which we in our hearts do bear unto the Saints deceased, of blessed Memory, who are represented by their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and not at all do we worship the Image it self, which is but wood, or stone,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>as other wood and stone is, onely they are by our Priests Consecrated and set a-part for such an use,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in vain it will be for you to defend your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us with the same weapons wherewith the <hi>Papists</hi> defend their practice, which you call <hi>Idolatry,</hi> against you; — For, what you say for yours, that they do for theirs; and whatsoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you would return to them as proof to evince unto them, that their practice is <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superstition,</hi> and <hi>unlawful,</hi> that take to your selves, — and so either go back to them or come forward with us out of all <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>; halt not thus betwixt two, as you do, so long as you continue in the one, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the other, being blinded by affection to your own wayes.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Action</hi> is the same amongst <hi>you</hi> as <hi>them, viz. Putting off the Hat,</hi> or <hi>bowing</hi> in a way of <hi>Respect, Honour, Worship</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> to an <hi>external Object</hi>; — all the difference is, they do it to <hi>lifeless Images,</hi> ye many times to wicked <hi>men,</hi> who are dead whilst they live.</p>
            <p>Now, why is the putting off the <hi>Hat, &amp;c.</hi> to an <hi>Image, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and to a <hi>degenerated Wicked ambitious man</hi> (who is worse) not? Is it the Image makes the difference? For, they do put off their Hats to <hi>Images,</hi> and ye say, they <hi>Worship Images</hi>; and ye do the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97450:15"/>
same to men; — may we not then say, that ye <hi>worship men?</hi> — And where doth the Scripture say, the <hi>Worshiping</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaetry,</hi> and of <hi>men, good?</hi> or are not men also Images?</p>
            <p>In vain again will be your distinction of a <hi>Civil Worship,</hi> and so no <hi>Idolatry</hi>; for then, in comes the <hi>Pontifician</hi> with his <hi>cover</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Worship,</hi> and not <hi>Divine,</hi> and so as little <hi>Idolatry</hi> as yours.</p>
            <p>Can ye now reject (which foundation) their <hi>distinction</hi> of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi> we upon the same ground deny yours of <hi>Civil Worship</hi>; for they stand both in one ground.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Some now say the</hi> Papists <hi>do intend a Religious, Divine, Honour and Worship; we not; therefore though the Action be the same, yet the intention makes their's Idolatry, ours not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They, or at lest most of them deny it, would you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to say the same of you? But, this opens a wide door, and gives liberty to be present at the <hi>Mahumetan, Mass-worship,</hi> or any other gross <hi>Idolatrous Worship,</hi> and to the <hi>Worship,</hi> the worst of <hi>Idols externally</hi>; for if the inward intent of the mind makes that Idolatry, which otherwise is not <hi>evil</hi> but <hi>good</hi>; then you may lawfully put off your <hi>Hats</hi> to <hi>Images, bow the Knee</hi> to the <hi>Wafer-Idol</hi> as you meet it in the streets, — or are present in the <hi>Idol-Temples</hi> and <hi>Mas-houses,</hi> — if ye do not intend, in your minds any honour to that, but do it to some other end, especially if ye do but (in your way) worship your God at that time. And then, if this be <hi>Orthodox Doctrine</hi> amongst you, how much less excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are ye, in giving offence to the <hi>Papists</hi> in these things which ye believe ye may do without sin, then we in offending you, in that which we cannot, <hi>sine laesâ Conscientiâ,</hi> conform unto?</p>
            <p>If any say, <hi>All things are lawful, but all things are not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi>; and therefore though it be <hi>lawful</hi> for us to put off our <hi>Hats</hi> passing by an <hi>Image,</hi> or bow the <hi>Knee</hi> before an <hi>Idol,</hi> yet it is not <hi>expedient</hi>; for that, we should thereby strengthen those <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers</hi> in their <hi>Idol-worship,</hi> and confirm them in the blindness of their minds; which we may not do, but rather labour to inform their minds both by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> and therefore in love to their Souls we cannot do it.</p>
            <p>We also say to you, Though putting off the <hi>Hat</hi> in it self might seem nothing, and be done, yet we having therein found the <hi>Cross</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97450:15"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in the <hi>Cross,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we cannot make the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to cease; but considering the great abuse therein, and error of Peoples minds, and what mind is pleased and fed therewith, we cannot but walk in the <hi>Cross</hi> to that mind in others, which is crucified in our selves, that so they may come also to take up the daily <hi>Cross</hi> to that mind in them, which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> after <hi>honour,</hi> and seeketh <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>men, earthly honour, honour below,</hi> which that of the <hi>Hat</hi> is, and not from above.</p>
            <p>Moreover, your practice is to us as plain <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> is to you; and that you will not see it to be so, is as little our fault, as that they will not confess theirs so to be.</p>
            <p>For what is an <hi>Idol,</hi> but <hi>something</hi> made of a <hi>thing</hi> of <hi>nothing; For we know</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that an Idol in the world is nothing; onely they make something of it, — and there's the Idol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is <hi>Superstition?</hi> but to stand — upon an <hi>empty formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and to be bound up, and bowed down to it, this is <hi>Superstition</hi>; or to take <hi>up,</hi> and stand <hi>in,</hi> and not move from a <hi>Formality,</hi> nor suffer others so to do, because it is a custome.</p>
            <p>Now what is a <hi>Hat,</hi> or what is in it, that ye will needs have that put off as the onely <hi>honour</hi> due to <hi>Magistrates</hi>? Is there any thing more in it then in the <hi>Coat, Cloak, Glove</hi> or <hi>Shooe</hi>? but as the inventing <hi>Idol</hi>-making-mind hath placed something in it; and therefore its no <hi>dishonour</hi> to <hi>Magistrates</hi> to deny it, but rather an <hi>honour,</hi> because it tendeth to the opening of their eyes, and leading them out of Bondage to Fruitless Customs and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>And ye that think to cover your selves with the pretence of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Worship,</hi> and say, <hi>We must be subject to the Civil Magistrate in all Civils, and he commands it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have ye never read how that <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> the King, commanded that all his Subjects should <hi>Bow and Reverence</hi> Haman? and yet <hi>Mordecai</hi> refused to bow himself or obey the Kings Command, though but in a <hi>Civil Matter,</hi> or a <hi>Civil Worship</hi> (as ye call it) whereupon your Predecessors presently said to him, <hi>Why dost thou transgress the King's Command?</hi> At which <hi>Haman</hi> also being wroth, he procured the King's writing <hi>to slay all the Iews,</hi> but the Lord frustrated his purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97450:16"/>Certainly had you lived in his day, you would have said much more, <hi>This man is an obstinate, self-willed fool, that will not do such a trifle to save his own life, and the lives of all his Brethren, the whole Nation of the Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore O ye <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> whether called <hi>Emperors, Kings, Princes,</hi> or by what other Title soever distinguished, listen not to the <hi>Complaints</hi> and <hi>dissembling Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations</hi> of such <hi>envious, ambitious Hamans,</hi> who though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> to have all your <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet trust them not, 'tis their own <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> they seek under that cover, therefore beware of them; neither lend your Ear to that <hi>Haman</hi>-spirit in your selves, when it would rise up in <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> and put you upon drawing the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Iustice</hi> against a harmless, innocent, peaceable people, onely for the law of their God, and tenderness of their Conscience, if you have no other just matter against them; for that Spirit is not to be your <hi>Counsellor,</hi> neither ever was sent by God to be your <hi>Guide</hi> unto <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and therefore is to be Judged and Condemned in its appearance and rising in you, by that more <hi>Noble Principle</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in you, which the Lord hath placed near you, to guid, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and direct you, to lead your feet into the <hi>Path</hi> of <hi>Peace, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> in which the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> is established — and to be his sure and everlasting <hi>Record, Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> and <hi>Witness</hi> for him against you, in every thing that you act contrary to it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if ye neglect this, and reject its Counsel, ye reject the Counsel of the Lord against your selves; and by giving heed to that <hi>seducing Spirit,</hi> which tempts and hurries you into <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> and to offer violence to any Innocent man, for his Conscience to God-wards, in such a thing of nought, as a few pittiful, dead, dull, groundless <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> ye will be thereby found fighters against God, and justifie the violence offered to your selves, for your Consciences, by your Enemies, when they had power over you; and not onely so, but also contract the guilt of all the <hi>Innocent Blood,</hi> shed from <hi>Righteous Abel</hi> to this day, by all the Persecutors that ever were; for whosoever is found in the <hi>Persecuting Nature</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> is a <hi>Member</hi> of that <hi>Body,</hi> let his profession now, differ never so much from many of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97450:16"/>
the old <hi>Persecutors</hi> in other ages, and agree with the greatest and meekest of Sufferers; it matters not, 'tis not a few <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> that changeth the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Murtherer</hi> is the Murtherer still, though got into a peaceable mans Habit; He that was a <hi>Lyar</hi> from the beginning, is so still, though he may change his garbe; The <hi>Wolf</hi> retains his Nature, though in the <hi>Sheeps</hi> cloathing.</p>
            <p>Therefore upon you will lie the guilt of all, and where the guilt lies, there the wrath abides, and the stroak of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will assuredly follow and not tarry, and <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> will it be when it comes.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Awake, awake,</hi> take <hi>heed,</hi> I say, <hi>beware what ye do</hi>; and it is for your sakes that we thus call unto you, more then our own; for as for us we are nothing <hi>careful,</hi> nothing <hi>Solicitous</hi> in these <hi>matters,</hi> but are freely given up to the Lord our God, patiently, and rejoycingly to suffer whatsoever ye shall have power to inflict upon us (for ye are limited, though ye may be apt to think it is not so) as hath often been manifest, both in our <hi>Native Country,</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places under the <hi>Pope's</hi> Dominions, — and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>New England</hi> Persecutors.</p>
            <p>If any deem themselves in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and believe us to be in the wrong; and because their <hi>Bishops, Pastors, Teachers, Priests,</hi> &amp;c. — tell them, they may without any more adoe, use the Power they have to Oppress, Suppress and Ruine, us and ours, or any, for their tender Consciences and exercise of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is every mans due, and no man (<hi>de jure</hi>) doth hold at the Will or Pleasure of any earthly <hi>Ruler</hi> whatsoever, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the God of Heaven, whose immediate Subjects they ought to be in all such things: — I say, If any hereupon shall begin; attempt or undertake such a thing, they will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by manifest themselves to be no Christians, in that they do unto others, that which they would not that others should do unto them, under which Law, Christ Jesus hath indispencably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all his Disciples, that are, ever were, or ever shall be so, from the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>Peasant,</hi> none excepted, whether in, or out of Authority.</p>
            <p>And that man or company of men will be found in the Great and Notable day of their Account and Tryal, before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97450:17"/>
of Jesus Christ the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> Arch-<hi>Rebbels</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi> to, Invaders and Subverters of (so far as in them lies) his <hi>Kingdom, Rule</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Oppressors, Tormentors,</hi> and <hi>cruel Murtherers</hi> of his Innocent, Peaceable, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Subjects; — Therefore again I say <hi>Beware,</hi> and look to the <hi>end,</hi> — sit first down and reckon the <hi>Charge,</hi> the <hi>Trouble,</hi> the <hi>Cost,</hi> and the <hi>Reward</hi>; and further know, — That it is in vain to attempt such a thing; its impossible to effect such a thing; it demonstrates weakness, want of understanding in him that shall begin it; — for the work is endless; it will be alwayes doing, and alwayes to do, and never have an end;— besides the Curse of God attending such an enterprize.</p>
            <p>If it were but to <hi>Banish, Ship off, Imprison, Impoverish, Ruine</hi> or <hi>cut off</hi> a certain number of men, now visible, admit it were five or ten hundred thousand in a Nation, Male and Female, Old and Young; perhaps some Tyrannical men might perswade a Prince this might be done, and perhaps some bloody Tyrant might think it could be effected, and say in himself, Well! i'le rid my Land of all these Sects and Schismaticks, of all these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Seducers, — and then I shall be quiet in my Land, I shall have Peace and no Division, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this hath a fair shew all to tempt.</p>
            <p>But alas! a wise man will see that these men are all absolutely deceived and seduced in themselves, these <hi>Counsellors</hi> are besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hastening to their own destruction; for no man can see a day nor hour before him in this wretched work; for when thus, this number now seems ruined, or rather while it is doing, the number is doubled, yea seven times doubled; And this is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to every ingenious man, that hath but been observant, and taken notice of the Histories that he hath read of old, and things he hath seen of late years, that the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,</hi> the <hi>Oppressions</hi> of the <hi>Oppressed,</hi> are as <hi>Seed</hi> cast into the ground, which brings forth <hi>increase, thirty, sixty,</hi> and a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold</hi>; and thus the work hath alwayes, and alwayes will swell under their hands, and the guilt of innocent blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, and the measure of their iniquity is filling up, till at length <hi>the Cry,</hi> the strong and <hi>vehement Cry</hi> of <hi>innocent blood</hi> pierceth the Heavens, and enters the Ears of the Lord of Hosts,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97450:17"/>
who ariseth to render vengeance upon these <hi>Cains</hi> and mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the earth, and deliver the <hi>remnant</hi> of his <hi>people</hi> out of their <hi>Iaws,</hi> and then their torment will be <hi>great,</hi> yea, greater than they shall be able to bear, though they should have many <hi>Kingdoms</hi> under their <hi>Dominions,</hi> and as much <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Pleasures</hi> as their vain hearts can invent for their diversion, yet a little <hi>contemptible worm</hi> from our God shall gnaw at the <hi>root</hi> of it all, and cause it to <hi>wither,</hi> and take away their <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayedness</hi> shall be their <hi>inseperable Companion; paleness</hi> shall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their <hi>Faces,</hi> and the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful Witness</hi> and <hi>Rewarder,</hi> shall open the <hi>Books,</hi> and produce the <hi>Records</hi> that are written against them, and the <hi>works</hi> of their <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Counsels</hi> of their <hi>Hearts</hi> shall be their <hi>perpetual</hi> torment; for, <hi>Suum invidia tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet auctorem, Mischief brings torment upon him that deviseth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>— And in that day, it will appear, that we had more ground to deny these things, then you had to keep them up, when the Lord had, by us his People, brought forth a Testimony against them, and endeavoured the removal of them, — meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was your <hi>custom,</hi> and ye would have it so, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would breed <hi>disorder</hi> and <hi>confusion</hi> amongst you, — and for no other ground at all indeed; — whereas we have forsaken and denyed them in our own practice, and testified against them in others, for these several weighty <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Forsaken them in our own Practice, because we have not found the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> leading us unto them, nor saw any ground in the same for them; which yet ought to be, and is the guide of every <hi>true Christian,</hi> as it is written, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God, and no more</hi>; and what we find not the Spirit of God leading us unto, we can have no faith in, <hi>and whatsoever is not of Faith,</hi> the Scripture saith, <hi>is six</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we leave them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have moreover found the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> limiting us in them, and leading us out of them, in which practices we also li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (yet not without the Judgement of the Lord oft-times in our selves for them, though we knew it not) while we walked in the <hi>vanity</hi> of our <hi>minds,</hi> after the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> darkened thereby in our <hi>understandings,</hi> and greatly strangers from the <hi>Life</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:97450:18"/>
of <hi>God</hi>; unto which <hi>life</hi> being now turned, and come to receive the <hi>enlightnings</hi> thereof day by day in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> we have chosen it for our Leader, and it leadeth us out of all <hi>dead works,</hi> of which sort these are; therefore we forsake them, and as it is required at our hands, testifie against them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this <hi>Light,</hi> springing from the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> shining in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> we see the whole <hi>Mass</hi> of it to be a weak unprofitable thing; not able to answer the end for which it is said to be <hi>practised, viz.</hi> to shew <hi>Honour, Respect</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> — and so ought to cease especially when a better and more serviceable means is discovered; which we being found in; are altogether careless to answer the <hi>Will</hi> of any <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>Custom</hi> of any <hi>Nation</hi> therein, but do lay it a side, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it under our feet as a thing of nought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We find it tending meerly, and solely to strengthen, feed and please the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Ambition</hi> in men and women, by which they are led to destruction; wherefore we cannot practise those things, lest we should be found guilty thereof, which so far as in us lies, we desire and seek to prevent, even of our enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We find it the very same kind of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Salutation</hi> which Christ so sharply reproved in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and strictly forbad to his Disciples, and hath severely <hi>judged</hi> and <hi>broken down</hi> in <hi>us</hi>; and therefore if we should be found in them, we should return to build that which God hath thrown, and is throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an everlasting destruction, and so we should become more <hi>lovers</hi> and <hi>pleasers</hi> of <hi>men</hi> than of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. We find it, even the whole <hi>Corps</hi> of it, to be an Invention of man, <hi>degenerate man,</hi> springing from a <hi>corrupt vain mind,</hi> in a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>groundless conceit,</hi> to <hi>corrupt ends,</hi> and is waxed more and more corrupt in the use thereof every day than other; for which causes we can have no unity with them, nor touch, but avoid them as <hi>defiled</hi> and <hi>polluted,</hi> which the <hi>Lord</hi> loatheth, as much as ever he did any of his own <hi>Institutions,</hi> when they became <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>defiled</hi> by the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> as the Scriptures plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare; but this <hi>custom</hi> of <hi>doffing</hi> the <hi>Hat,</hi> especially, as an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> never had its <hi>rise</hi> from God but from men of <hi>corrupt minds</hi>; as will very readily appear, if we do but consider,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97450:18"/>
that no <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Nation</hi> but those called <hi>Christians</hi> since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy do practise it: for neither the <hi>Iews,</hi> who had their <hi>outward Law</hi> both in relation to the <hi>Worship of God,</hi> &amp; respect to <hi>Magistrats,</hi> never were commanded any such thing, neither ever practised any such thing among themselves when they entred into their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues</hi> (nor yet do there) nor before their <hi>Magistrates,</hi> nor to one another, but in these <hi>Countries</hi> where they follow the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi>; Neither do the <hi>Turks</hi> observe it as an <hi>honour,</hi> but look upon it as a <hi>shame,</hi> or <hi>reproach,</hi> or an <hi>odious</hi> thing; Nor do we read that the <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Primitive Chrstians</hi> ever practised any such thing to <hi>Magistrates</hi> or to each other.</p>
            <p>Yea admit further, (which cannot be proved) that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves had practised it among themselves, to each other, yea, to all they met, good and bad, as now its practised, that cannot bind us now, nor limit the Lord to it, more than to other of his <hi>Institutions,</hi> for several <hi>Reasons</hi> before mentioned.</p>
            <p>But as for us, we believe the <hi>Hat</hi> to be an <hi>Earthly thing,</hi> not the <hi>Honour</hi> which is from <hi>Above,</hi> but from <hi>Below,</hi> made for covering the <hi>nakedness</hi> as well as the other <hi>cloaths</hi>; and with which God nor man, neither is nor can be truly <hi>worshipped,</hi> more than by putting off the <hi>Shooe, Glove, Coat,</hi> or any other Garment; neither do we believe that its any part of the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> nor renders the <hi>Worship</hi> any thing the more well-pleasing or acceptable to the Lord, but is far below the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> yea, or <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> that is a man indeed; and therefore all that are contending for the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> are contending for the <hi>honour</hi> which is <hi>below,</hi> which the Saints and People of God never did, and therefore this <hi>honour</hi> will into the dust.</p>
            <p>If any now urge upon us the <hi>example</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> of any of the <hi>Holy men</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for <hi>bowing,</hi> because they <hi>bowed</hi> both to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi>; — we say, that bindeth us not now, to do the same things, — we must take heed to another <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> in this day, — than their Actions.</p>
            <p>As for example, its said of <hi>Abraham, He bowed himself to the Earth, before the three Men or Angels; and also before the People of the Land</hi>; — Concerning <hi>Iacob</hi> it is said, <hi>He bowed seven times to the Earth, till he came past his Brother</hi> Esau; and concerning
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97450:19"/>
               <hi>David, That he fell upon his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Object. Now say people, <hi>Will ye condemn these Holy Men of God, or will ye be more holy than they?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Far be it from us to <hi>condemn</hi> those <hi>Worthies</hi> of the <hi>Lord; the Lord hath justified them, and who shall condemn them?</hi> but to desire to be even more holier than they, if it can be, we hope will offend no true Christian, nor be used as <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>accusation</hi> against us.</p>
            <p>Yet if these, or any other at any time, did any thing without <hi>command</hi> or <hi>approbation</hi> from the <hi>Lord,</hi> or against his <hi>Will,</hi> we are not to take them for our example in such things, I judge all will grant: — well then,</p>
            <p>That they did <hi>bow,</hi> &amp;c. — is indeed written; but that they had any command for it, nor <hi>praised</hi> or <hi>approved</hi> in it, where is that written? search and tell us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> went to <hi>buy</hi> a <hi>Burial place</hi> of that strange people; <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was <hi>afraid</hi> its plainly said, and called <hi>Esau Lord</hi>; though there was a promise that the <hi>Elder</hi> should serve the <hi>Younger</hi>; yea he said (in his fear) <hi>that he beheld his face, as if he had beheld the Face of God</hi>; may we therefore speak such words to any wicked man? consider it; — <hi>David</hi> was also in <hi>great Trouble</hi> and <hi>sore Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these things considered, what might move them so to do, or how far they were approved, or not, by the Lord in that day, I rather leave to the Lord than determine.</p>
            <p>Object. But some perhaps may say, <hi>They were not reproved for it, therefore it was not evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As it is not written that they were <hi>reproved,</hi> so neither is it recorded that they were <hi>approved.</hi> Besides, we find not that <hi>Abraham</hi> was by the Lord reproved, for saying that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his <hi>Sister</hi>; nor <hi>Isaac</hi> in the like case, for <hi>fearing</hi> the <hi>people</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi>; nor <hi>Ioseph</hi> for swearing by the <hi>Life of Pharaoh</hi>; the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> where he dwelt, no dout; nor lastly, any of the <hi>Patriarks,</hi> for having more wives than <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, who believes not these things to be unlawful? much less doth any man look upon it to be his duty to do so, though these <hi>Worthies</hi> did so? — so that it is not their <hi>example</hi> without <hi>command,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97450:19"/>
Warrant</hi> or <hi>Approbation</hi>; nay nor yet their <hi>approved Actions,</hi> that must be our ground or rule to act by in this dispensation, unless the same things should of us be required in this <hi>Dispensation</hi>; Nay 'tis not what others now do by the infallible <hi>leading</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> even in this day, that must be a ground for me to do the same thing; but my <hi>Ground, Rule</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> must be in my self from the <hi>Lord</hi>; Nay further, it is not what the Lord led me to do yesterday, by his <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>unerring Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in my own particular, that must be my ground for doing the same thing this day, without the same <hi>movings, leadings</hi> and <hi>guidings</hi> also this day, yea, at that instant of time, when I go about the thing.</p>
            <p>And herein we differ from all <hi>Sects</hi> who are set down in a form, either of what they take up by <hi>Tradition written</hi> or <hi>unwritten,</hi> it's all one to the Lord, of which they have felt nothing from the Lord in themselves, or at the best, having found something of God <hi>stirring</hi> in them, and <hi>leading</hi> them to it in dayes past, are setled down in their <hi>Form,</hi> and going on in the <hi>Practice,</hi> satisfied with what they have felt, whether they feel the same still or not, and so are <hi>withered,</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> up a <hi>dead Sacrifice</hi> to the <hi>Living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we plainly say, That he that goeth one <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>Hour,</hi> or <hi>Moment</hi> before the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> is a <hi>will-worshiper,</hi> and his <hi>worship</hi> is not accepted, — for I may do that this <hi>Day,</hi> this <hi>Hour,</hi> in the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in which I may be justified of the Lord, in my obedience to him; which to morrow if I should go to do again, I might do it in my own will, and so instead of being <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>justified,</hi> being not covered in the Action with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> shame before the Lord, though not before men, who only see the outside, would cover my face.</p>
            <p>And thus the Lord hath led his people out of many things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return unto them again, as <hi>Warring, Killing, Slaying, Fighting</hi> for <hi>outward Possessions, Lands</hi> and <hi>Inheritances, Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in <hi>Temples</hi> made with <hi>hands,</hi> and upon <hi>Mountains,</hi> as <hi>Holy Places,</hi> with all the whole Body of the <hi>Iewish Worship, Ceremonies,</hi> and observing <hi>Dayes, Sabbaths, Months</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> once Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Lord; but long since rejected and done away, for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97450:20"/>
the <hi>abuse, weakness,</hi> and <hi>unprofitableness</hi> of them; yea abhorred of the Lord, and unlawful for his people to touch.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If any say these things are unlawful now, because the Scripture testifies against them; but shew us where the Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids to honour men by bowing, putting off the Hat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These things were unlawful, because <hi>Paul</hi> testified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; but <hi>Paul</hi> therefore testified against them, as in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> because they were become unprofitable, yea <hi>abominable,</hi> and so <hi>unlawful,</hi> else <hi>Paul</hi> had testified against that which was lawful, that so he might render it unlawful for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is <hi>ridiculous</hi> to imagine.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>doffing</hi> the <hi>Hat,</hi> bidding <hi>Good-morrow,</hi> and such like <hi>stuff,</hi> they are meer <hi>upstart Novelties,</hi> which in those dayes no man once dreamed of; but those things which were then practised as instead of these things, were <hi>forbidden</hi> and <hi>reproved</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> and particularly <hi>Greetings</hi> and <hi>Salutations</hi> in the <hi>Market places,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>wayes,</hi> calling <hi>men Master,</hi> and <hi>Bowing,</hi> whether before <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> though formerly practised by divers Friends of God.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Angels</hi>; though <hi>Abraham, Lot</hi> and others <hi>bowed</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before them, yet <hi>Iohn</hi> was forbidden so to do, see <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow Servant, Worship God.</hi> — and, —</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Men</hi>; though many have bowed themselves to the <hi>earth,</hi> yet <hi>Cornelius</hi> was by <hi>Peter</hi> reproved for so doing (when he fell at his feet) with a, <hi>stand up, I my self am also a man</hi>; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>at the Name of Iesus,</hi> not of any man, <hi>every knee shall bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again Christ saith, <hi>I receive not honour of men,</hi> and testified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this very kind of <hi>honour,</hi> these <hi>ceremonial toys,</hi> and <hi>evil manners,</hi> in the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and publickly reproved them for being called of men <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or <hi>Master,</hi> and for these <hi>Crooked, Market-street-Salutations,</hi> and therefore certainly did not give them himself.</p>
            <p>Object. Its said, <hi>Christ did not reprove the thing it self, but only such men as loved, desired and sought for that honour, and those Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations in publick, and to be called of men Master,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This <hi>cover</hi> is too narrow, and <hi>pretence</hi> too <hi>short</hi>; for it is apparent, that Christ reproved them simply for receiving those
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97450:20"/>
things, saying, <hi>How can ye believe that receive</hi> (not only ye that seek, but also ye that receive) <hi>honour from men, and seek not the honour that comes from God alone,</hi> [Mark] that honour alone, — and sets himself as an example before them; <hi>I receive not honour of men,</hi> — he saith, <hi>not, I seek it not, I desire it not, love it not, take no pleasure in it, but simply I receive it not</hi>; and forbade his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples strictly to be called <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Rabbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this <hi>Doctrine</hi> all his <hi>Disciples</hi> abode, and all the <hi>Apostles</hi>; as may be seen in their <hi>Writings, Epistles</hi> and <hi>Letters,</hi> which they occasionally wrote to each other, — in none of which is any mention made of Mr. <hi>Paul,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Matthew, Iohn or Iames</hi>; — neither are any of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Letters, <hi>To the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father in God, his Grace,</hi> Timothy, — <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> — nor subscribed <hi>Your Honours most Humble and Devoted Servant</hi>; nor to the <hi>Reverend and very Learned Mr.</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, <hi>Minister of the Word of God, or Minister of the Gospel at</hi> Crete; As the <hi>Bold</hi> and <hi>Irreverend Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Pragmatick Priests</hi> of our <hi>times,</hi> do without <hi>blushing</hi> bedaub each other with the <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Titles</hi> of <hi>Reverend, Right Reverend, Divines, Fathers, Doctors</hi> or <hi>Masters,</hi> while they at the same time make profession of being <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Flock</hi>: And in their Prayers cry out no less <hi>Hypocritically</hi> then <hi>Audatiously, To thee O Lord, to thee alone belongs all Honour, Glory, Reverence, Thansgiving and Dominion, for thou alone art worthy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And yet so soon as they are out of their <hi>talking Stool,</hi> will be looking for <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> from the people whose <hi>Servants</hi> they pretend to be; and if they do any man a good turn, as they count it, are presently offended if they have not many returned them for it, and had in esteem as good <hi>Benefactors</hi>; what thinkest thou <hi>Reader,</hi> of these <hi>seeming holy-humble-Servants</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi>? are they not over Faithful to their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> whom in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they serve? but in <hi>reality</hi> themselves:—for though in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> with <hi>fained Words</hi> and <hi>fair Speeches</hi> they confess themselves (and 'tis true enough, though they intend nothing less that they are) <hi>unworthy,</hi> and <hi>that he alone is worthy of all Praise, Honour, Reverence and Thanksgiving</hi>; yet as unworthy as they really are, they will put in for a share with him, of his <hi>Praise, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Thanks,</hi> and <hi>Persecute</hi> for want of it; yea, and least the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97450:21"/>
should according to their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> give all <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Thanks</hi> to God, and so scruple giving any to them, they will be sure to give to one another, partly to remove that <hi>scruple</hi> out of the peoples <hi>minds,</hi> as a thing very consistent with their <hi>Doctrine</hi>; knowing that people look more at their <hi>Actions</hi> than their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and expect more from the <hi>Comment</hi> than the bare <hi>Text</hi>; — and partly because in so doing, they are sure never to go without their <hi>Idol Honour,</hi> so long as there's two alive to give it to each other: — Oh <hi>abominable!</hi> how far were any of these loathsome things from the thoughts of the <hi>poor despised-self-denying Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ?</hi> Yea, how do they to this day stink in the Nostrils of all <hi>Sober-minded Christians?</hi> Are these <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> of that <hi>world contemning Honour</hi> and <hi>Pomp</hi> despising <hi>Iesus?</hi> Where, or who then are the <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ?</hi> — But I shall leave these, and turn to another sort of <hi>Professors,</hi> — who are more finely covered; saying,</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>It was in matters of Faith or Church matters that they shun'd this Worldly Honour and Titles, and respect of Persons; but in the world in Civil Matters and Stations there, as they tearm it, there they used them; and so the Apostle</hi> James <hi>is to be understood, Have not the Faith of our Lord Iesus Christ in Respect of Persons; for if one come into your Assembly (that is Church) with a Gold Ring, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apparel, and another in vile rayment,</hi> — &amp;c. — <hi>there in such Places and such Cases, where all are one in Christ, there was, nor is, to be no respect of Persons; but to one another in worldly Concerns, and to the World, they did, and might,</hi> Paul <hi>called</hi> Festus <hi>Noble, and gave</hi> Agrippa <hi>his Title of King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It were well ye were all come thus far: for I have seen very few that call themselves <hi>Disciples</hi> whether <hi>sprinkled</hi> or <hi>dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> that have left off calling each other <hi>Master,</hi> (I mean as a <hi>Title,</hi> not as an <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi>; for <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Scholars</hi> may acknowledge their Masters according to the <hi>flesh,</hi> and are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to them) in Discourses about <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith, Church</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi>; I believe the number of them is very few, but where doth it appear that the <hi>Apostles</hi> or <hi>Disciples</hi> in other outward occasions, gave titles to each other; — I read indeed that <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to bring his <hi>Cloak</hi> with him, which he left at <hi>Troas</hi> with <hi>Carpus</hi>; but do not find that he calleth him Mr. <hi>Timothy</hi> there, no more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97450:21"/>
then when he chargeth him to <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and to be <hi>instant</hi> in <hi>season</hi> and out of <hi>season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also in your <hi>Churches,</hi> so called, or <hi>Meeting-houses,</hi> Is it not ordinary to find <hi>finer, handsomer,</hi> (so called) <hi>easier, warmer stools, seats</hi> or <hi>Pillows,</hi> for the <hi>Rich, well-bred,</hi> and <hi>gay-clad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> than for the <hi>meaner sort</hi>? Yea, and in many <hi>Steeplehouses</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> these fine Seats are lockt, lest some of their mean <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> or <hi>Sisters,</hi> being weary, should step in, and sit down by them; yea, many times they are lockt, and none in them; if any now be better reformed, and farther removed from such unrighteous <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> it's well.</p>
            <p>And for the rest, as that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> did use those things to the world, and in <hi>worldly Assemblies,</hi> it is a meer <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Suggestion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For first, Christ did as sharply reprove that spirit that made distinctions in places at <hi>Feasts,</hi> as in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> as much the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And secondly, In all the actions both of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> with <hi>unbelievers,</hi> or men of the <hi>World,</hi> before <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Military</hi> or <hi>Civil, Lords Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> (as they will now again be distinguished) of what degree or quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, we find not that they ever used, or gave them any <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> so called,—But onely bare distinctions of <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> as to call a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>King</hi>; a <hi>Governour,</hi> a <hi>Governour</hi>; a <hi>Centurion,</hi> a <hi>Centurion</hi>; a <hi>Priest,</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi>; a <hi>Scribe,</hi> a <hi>Scribe</hi>; and the <hi>High-Priest, High-Priest</hi>; and so a <hi>Father Mother, Master,</hi> were to be owned in the several Relation i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Or as an Assembly of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (blasphemously so called) <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> would expect should be given to them or their <hi>Prolocuter,</hi> an Officer as little to be read in the History of Scripture, as <hi>Deans, Chapters, Apparitors,</hi> &amp;c. with that whole Rabble of <hi>Exotick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi>; but all Language we perceive them to use, was, <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that would see more of this, let him reade <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Defence</hi> before the Governours, <hi>Felix, Festus,</hi> and <hi>King Agrippa,</hi> with his <hi>Appeal</hi> to <hi>Cesar</hi>— in all which, not <hi>one word</hi> again of <hi>your Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-Priest, nor <hi>Excellency</hi> to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, nor, <hi>May it please your Majesty, your Sacred Majesty,</hi> your <hi>most Excellent Majesty,</hi> nor <hi>your Grace,</hi> nor any such like fond fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Titles to <hi>King Agrippa,</hi> as are commonly used, and looked upon as due, to all in any Authority, from the <hi>feeblest Iustice of Peace</hi> in a Country, to the <hi>mightiest Prince</hi> upon his Throne.</p>
            <p>Which Baubles are now looked upon as the only badges, signs or tokens of <hi>Honour, Respect, Reverence</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, by the silly, sorry <hi>Dry-Vines</hi> of these dayes: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? but because they come in their order, for their share! but their deceit is palpable, and folly manifest: For as certain as the Apostles <hi>taught Obedience</hi> to Magistrates, and <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> so certainly they <hi>practised it,</hi> did <hi>honour</hi> them, and were <hi>obedient,</hi> though they offered them none of these <hi>worthless Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:97450:22"/>
nor had their <hi>persons in admiration for advantage sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, O ye professors of all sorts, how have you been cheated into these things by these <hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>blinders of the People?</hi> Can ye not see that all these things came up in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy? can ye discern any footsteps for them on the other side? Look back and see if ye cannot find that all these Titles, of <hi>his most Sacred, Imperial, Invincible Majesty, Emperour of the Holy Roman Empire; His most Sacred Catholick Majesty of</hi> Spain; <hi>His most Christian Majesty of</hi> France; <hi>His most Excellent and Sacred Majesty of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.— Eminency</hi> to Cardinals, <hi>Grace</hi> to Arch-Bishops, <hi>Highness</hi> to Princes, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to Lords, <hi>Worship</hi> to Knights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— came not all from the <hi>same root</hi> from whence his <hi>Holiness</hi> came to be <hi>Pope?</hi> who hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that pitch of Blasphemy, which can dispence other more petty blasphemous Titles at his pleasure, to such as did him a pleasure, and became sworn Vassals to his Grandure.</p>
            <p>How he (the <hi>Pope</hi>) came by this Title of <hi>Holiness,</hi> I think most Professors are able to see, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was partly by flattery, and partly by force, and ungodly Usurpation in the night of Apostacy; not all at once, but by degrees from step to step; and he had a great while, several hundred years work, and watching for opportunities to encroach and grasp all his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body, Kings</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> here and hereafter, so long as his <hi>Purgatory Prison</hi> lasts.</p>
            <p>And can ye see this, and refuse to give it him, and yet not see all the rest that are but as so many <hi>branches</hi> and small <hi>twigs</hi> springing from the same <hi>Root?</hi> Oh ye <hi>foolish people</hi> and <hi>unwise!</hi> who hath bewitched you, that ye cannot obey the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> that hath been so clearly born, so evidently held forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you against these things? How is it that ye cannot see all these <hi>flattering Titles</hi> to have had their <hi>ground, rise</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> in the <hi>Apostacy</hi>; and that your selves are there, so long as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the <hi>use, practice,</hi> and <hi>upholding</hi> of these things? Is there the least footstep of these things to be seen or read in the <hi>simple, single, upright carriage</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Followers?</hi> How came your <hi>first Reformers</hi> to deny some of these <hi>Titles,</hi> and retain other of them? was it not out of <hi>jugling deceit,</hi> or for fear of men at the best? For shame therefore leave these things, now the day
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97450:23"/>
is so far dawn'd, and return to <hi>simplicity,</hi> for you shall no longer <hi>slumber</hi> nor <hi>sleep</hi> at <hi>rest</hi> in them, but <hi>judgement</hi> shall <hi>awaken you, smite you,</hi> and call you up to shake off these <hi>night-cloaths,</hi> and appear as Children of the Day, who fear not man, but God.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling <hi>Festus, Noble,</hi> which some would catch hold of to save themselves by, just as <hi>sinking men,</hi> that earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grasp at the least twig to keep themselves above water; but alas, it will not bear them, it sinks with them, — for this is nothing like your <hi>Priest-flattering Titles,</hi> neither was it an accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary thing with them to every one in Authority, &amp; that at every turn almost in their speech to them, as is now usual and expected from <hi>Rulers,</hi>— for we find none using it but <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> not to every <hi>Ruler</hi>; for to <hi>Felix</hi> he did not, though the <hi>Iews</hi> set him an example, and but once to this <hi>Festus</hi>; so that the thing was not an useless title of <hi>Honour</hi> (so called) or thing of custom, but only a <hi>reasonable, just</hi> and <hi>worthy acknowledgment</hi> of his <hi>reasonable, just</hi> and <hi>noble carriage</hi> towards him; which not finding from <hi>Festus,</hi> but a <hi>partial covetous spirit,</hi> that would have had money, he neither did nor could call him <hi>Noble.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is further objected by some (that would gladly render these Ceremonies purely <hi>Christian Manners</hi>)— <hi>That Christ did expresly command his Disciples to use Salutations to all men, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> (Mat. 5.47.) <hi>saying, If ye salute your Brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the Publicans so?</hi> — from hence directly inferring <hi>(O monstrum horrendum!)</hi> that Christ teacheth his to out-do the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> in these <hi>Ceremonial manners</hi>: whereas it is very apparent, that he himself minded nothing less, shunning and reproving them; yea, his whole simple conversation was a living testimony against them, respecting or regarding no mans person, as it is confessed of him by his adversaries themselves when they came to ensnare him.— But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is particularly evident, that it was far from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to teach them <hi>worldly manners,</hi> his drift being to learn them to exceed all, both <hi>Professors</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi> in that which was <hi>good, necessary,</hi> and of service to all, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>love to all, which is the bind of perfection,</hi> putting before them the goodness of their heavenly Father, which extendeth to all, <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Unjust</hi>; For he <hi>causeth</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:97450:23"/>
(saith he) <hi>his Sun to rise upon the Evil and the Good, and Rain to fall upon the Iust and Unjust</hi>; which he sets before them, I say, as that which they were to <hi>press after,</hi> yea, and <hi>attain to,</hi> if they would <hi>be perfect, as their heavenly Father is perfect,</hi>— which Perfection the manners of the world never brought any to, but all that come to it, or press after it, do first turn their backs perfectly upon, and leave behind them.—</p>
            <p>But, because all men, both <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners, Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all sorts of people, <hi>Professors</hi> and <hi>Prophane,</hi> did by their Salutations, use to shew or express the seeming love, favour and respect they bear to each other; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Christ in this place mention them (as <hi>Paul</hi> in another place doth, <hi>running of Races for a prize</hi>; not thereby intending to render that practice Christian-like, no more than he intends to legitimate <hi>Swearing,</hi> contrary to the manifest Doctrine of Christ, (as some think) because he saith, <hi>Mon</hi> (that are in strife) <hi>swear by the greater, to end all strife.</hi>) Even thus Christ mentions the <hi>Salutations</hi> and <hi>Greetings</hi> of men to his Disciples, to inform them, that their Salutations, or the demonstration of their Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Respect, Esteem and Good-will to men, which was to <hi>hold forth the Peace of God to men,</hi> to <hi>do good to all,</hi> to <hi>bless and pray for them,</hi> &amp;c.— ought to extend (beyond their empty Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their Friends only) <hi>to All, to Enemies,</hi> to those that <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>persecuted them</hi> for their <hi>love</hi> and <hi>good-will</hi>; and herein stood or consisted their Perfection above all other men, their <hi>likeness to their heavenly Father</hi>; and not in such <hi>fond manners</hi> as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> (and the modern) <hi>Salutations</hi> and <hi>Complements</hi>: Of which there would be no end, if, by these words, every man were bound to put off his Hat, and bid <hi>Good-morrow</hi> and <hi>Good-night Sir,</hi> or <hi>Mistris</hi> to every man or woman he should meet betwixt <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Whitehall</hi> in <hi>Westminster</hi>; for all that he meets are either Friends and Brethren, or not.</p>
            <p>But Friends, Christ did not only say to his Apostles, <hi>Salute,</hi> but he also taught them <hi>how, when, who, where,</hi> and upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions they should salute.</p>
            <p>So we shall now try and compare your Salutations to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Salutations, that so you may see how unreasonably you infer your <hi>self-invented Salutations</hi> from the <hi>Salutation</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:97450:24"/>1. Then, The Apostles saluted by command from the Lord, with a Salutation which had no correspondence with that manner of Salutation then used by the world: Therefore ye salute with a Salutation contrary to the Command of the Lord, which is wel-pleasing to the world, yea their own invention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apostles when they came into a City or Village, were to enquire who were <hi>worthy,</hi> and to <hi>salute such only.</hi> Therefore, ye salute all, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad, worthy</hi> and <hi>unworthy,</hi> if not too poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apostles saluted that <hi>worthy house</hi> when they entered into it, but were expresly forbidden <hi>to salute any man upon the way:</hi> Therefore ye salute upon the way, Streets, Markets, or any other publick place; And though Christ reproved it in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that's no matter.—</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Apostles entring into that <hi>worthy house,</hi> and saluting it, saluted it thus, saying, <hi>Peace be to this house.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.5. — Therefore ye salute any man upon the Street or Market, by <hi>bowing, doffing the Hat,</hi> and saying, <hi>Good-morrow Sir, Good-night Madam, Your Servant,</hi> or, <hi>humble Servant Madam</hi>; every man according to the mode he judgeth best. What fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences are these, O ye unchristian wresters!</p>
            <p>Christ commanded his Apostles to <hi>salute,</hi> and expresly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them how, and gave them their Salutation, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly abstracted from all honouring or worshipping of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, far removed from all shew of worldly pomp, estate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons, flat contrary to the worlds customs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and a cross to them — and ye reject that, and set up another manner of Salutation, every way correspondent with the worlds manners, and wel-pleasing to their vain minds, yea the very device of their own brain. And herein all Sects agree to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the worlds manners and traditions — though they call the Scripture their Rule.</p>
            <p>But would the <hi>Bishops</hi> approve of this Argument from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists?</hi> Christ said, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore, we, besides Water, use <hi>Salt, Spittle,</hi> and the <hi>Chrism,</hi> making three Crosses, one in the Name of the <hi>Father,</hi> one in the Name of the <hi>Son,</hi> and a third in the Name of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O nay! we should then assuredly hear, that Christ had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded <hi>to baptize,</hi> but he had taught wherewith, <hi>viz.</hi> with fair <hi>Water</hi> only.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:97450:24"/>Now, would the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> admit of that, as proof, for the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Priests crossing the Infant in the forehead, nor the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> for the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> sprinkling water in the face of an Infant, and calling it the <hi>Baptism of Christ</hi>—</p>
            <p>Nay, nay, then and in this case they would say, Christ did not only command his Disciples to <hi>baptize,</hi> but he told them <hi>who</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Believers, not Infants) <hi>wherewith</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> with, or rather <hi>in water</hi> alone) and <hi>how</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>plunging</hi> the body under <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and not by sprinkling a little water in the face.) —But they are also mistaken, for this neither is, nor ever was, the <hi>Baptism of Christ,</hi> no more than the <hi>Circumcision outward</hi> was Christ's, he was Minister of <hi>another Circumcision,</hi> and Author of <hi>another Baptism</hi>; he baptizeth in <hi>another Water,</hi> which washeth not away the filth of the flesh <hi>outward,</hi> but washeth and cleanseth the <hi>inward parts,</hi> and circumciseth or cutteth off the <hi>foreskin</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> of which the outward Circumcision and Baptism were in their times <hi>figures</hi> and <hi>types,</hi> the one by <hi>Moses,</hi> the other by <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> both Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but this is <hi>the Lord from Heaven</hi>; and as he is, so is his Ministration and Operation, heavenly, spiritual and invisible— and so is his Kingdom, and not of this world—<hi>He that is wise will understand these things, but fools will despise knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Salutation.</hi> I say, in this all parties can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them in the practice of a thing for <hi>Salutation,</hi> and urge the Scripture and Command of Christ for it; when as, amongst the Apostles and Disciples of old, such practices were never used as their Salutation, who always walked in a cross to the <hi>wayes, manners</hi> and <hi>customs</hi> of the world.—</p>
            <p>And then also use it towards people whom the Apostles were not to salute; for they saluted none in any City or Village where they entered, with <hi>Peace,</hi> save onely such as were represented to them, upon enquiry, <hi>as worthy</hi>: But ye all bid <hi>Good-morow, Good-night,</hi> &amp;c.—to every one of your acquaintance, <hi>worthy</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> Gamsters, Drunkards, Adulterers, Harlots, Proud, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, Ambitious persons, such as live in pleasures, who are not worthy the Name of <hi>Christians</hi>; yea, there is none so unworthy, but he is worthy enough to receive your Salutation, from which there is no other bar but Poverty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But say some, <hi>The Primitive Christians did not salute as ye
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97450:25"/>
pretend, by vertue of a particular command to each of them, as the Apostles had, but it was a custom amongst them so to do, as appears from the second Epistle of</hi> John <hi>to the elect Lady and her children, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> If any man cometh unto you, and bringeth not this Doctrine (<hi>the Doctrine of Christ</hi>) receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed (<hi>or</hi> salute him not, <hi>as the same word is rendred in</hi> Acts 15. <hi>and</hi> James 1.) <hi>By which</hi> (say they) <hi>it appears they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by custom, without waiting for a command or motion to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The contrary appears from the <hi>very words,</hi> that they were expresly forbidden to salute any by custom, as you do, but to try before they saluted; so that their Salutation stood not in a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of saluting all they met, or, all that came to them; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such <hi>as abode in the unity of the Spirit of Christ, and brought his Doctrine</hi>; so that their Salutation stood in the unity of the Spirit and Life to such as were in it; but as for such as came to them, not bringing this Doctrine, not abiding in the Spirit, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, such they were not to salute, because it was the custom of the Country — but were told by the Apostle, if they did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute such, they should <hi>partake of their evil deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can you think upon this Scripture without blushing? Is not your custom quite contrary to it? Do you try before you salute? are your Salutations within-doors, as this was, or abroad in the streets, in Market-places, among the world, after their manner?— If you should forbear saluting all those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in the Doctrine of Christ, how few would there remain for you to salute? At the most you might not salute any but those of your own Faith (if ye judge your selves to have abode in the Doctrine of Christ) and to be sure, no covetous, proud person, no Idolater, no Swearer, no Drunkard, no Whoremaster, no Gamester, no vain person, no Liar, no Swearer; for none of these have abode in the Doctrine of Christ, it allows of no such things: <hi>For whoso transgresseth, abideth not in the Doctrine, but hath turned his back upon it</hi> — Were it not now more commendable that you had no fellowship with such, that ye saluted them not, even after your own manner, in bidding them <hi>Good-morrow, Good-night?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For, though both <hi>morning, evening</hi> and <hi>night</hi> are all good, as they were created; yet to the wicked and such as abide not in the Doctrine of Christ, in the Anointing, Spirit and Light within,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97450:25"/>
there is nothing good, <hi>to the unclean all things are unclean,</hi> both day and night, yea their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>consciences</hi> are defiled. Are ye not then partakers of their evil deeds while ye have fellowship with them, bless them, and salute them therein? assuredly yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But all cry out with one consent, <hi>That is not our meaning or intent, God forbid that we should salute, bless, or wish prosperity to people in their evil deeds or purposes, then we should have fellowship, or partake with them of their evil deeds indeed; but nay, it is not so, we rather by wishing them a</hi> good day, <hi>saluting them, &amp;c.— we wish or desire for them all good, even their own conversion from evil, that so they might have</hi> a good day indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Oh fair shew, Oh subtil deceit! how fain would men cover themselves! Might not the Woman to whom <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, and her Children, have returned him that Answer? and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of answer it would have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Apostle let the wise judg. Surely these men must think themselves wiser than Christ and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or they would not so plainly set themselves against them.</p>
            <p>But O that ye were indeed as zealous and earnest in seeking or desiring the <hi>conversion of people from evil!</hi> how gladly would we see such a mind in you, with understanding! then you would assuredly leave your <hi>Hat-doffing, mastering,</hi> and bidding <hi>Good-morrow</hi> and <hi>Good-night,</hi> &amp;c.— and mind the <hi>Requirings of the Lord,</hi> and in obedience thereto, speak to people; and in plainness of speech which they might understand, exhort them to <hi>leave off their evil,</hi> whether upon the streets or in their houses.</p>
            <p>This is a very easie, but also an exceeding deceitful and dull way, of seeking the conversion of people, and to bring them out of evil. If it could be done so easily, every one would be a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher up of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and reprover of <hi>Vice</hi>; but alas! friend, it's another-guess matter— believe it—</p>
            <p>Neither can any reasonable man perswade himself that an <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Priest meeting a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Parson in the streets, and being saluted by him with <hi>cap</hi> and <hi>congie,</hi> and <hi>good-morrow Sir,</hi> would be able to infer, understand or know from that, that he was thereby admonished by the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Salutant (as being a false prophet) to cease deceiving the People, and give over seducing them any longer, and turn to the true Religion — as a Professor lately in discourse with me said, about his saluting the <hi>Priests,</hi> whom he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97450:26"/>
deemed and adjudged <hi>false Prophets,</hi> That he thereby wished and desired their conversion, from deceiving the People, to the right way;— But assuredly, if such a one did understand, or were informed that <hi>that</hi> was the meaning or interpretation of his Salutation, he would not another time resalute him, with <hi>I thank you Sir.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Neither would a <hi>Drunkard</hi> perceive any reproof for his <hi>sin,</hi> in any such Salutation, but rather would conclude that <hi>Mr. such-a-one</hi> his neighbour, had been very friendly to him to day, and honoured him before the People; so far would he be from being sensible of a reproof in it, or admonition to repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that so he might have a good day, <hi>&amp;c.— O Fraus Fraudum!</hi> deceit upon deceit, madness added to folly! that men should seek to pacifie themselves or others, and stop the mouth of Conscience with such conceits; yet thus it seems it is, and such covers are used—</p>
            <p>But would you not account him a mad-man that should take singular care how to get safe over the Sea, and to effect it, should provide himself a Coach with six horses, and therewith furiously drive into the waters? And what is this less? to go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a man for his Pride and Ambition, and pretend endeavours to bring him out of it, and great care to do it well; and to the purpose that he may understand it, and return and repent of it, and to effect it, do nothing but <hi>salute, honour, worship,</hi> respect him in the <hi>Street,</hi> in the <hi>Market-place,</hi> before the People; and so (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his understanding at least) bless and flatter him in his Pride and Ambition? Is this a likely mean think ye? Away with such deceit.</p>
            <p>But the man replied to me again, <hi>It was not alwayes convenient to speak plainly to me upon the streets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe indeed that you do judge so; yea, that you think it never convenient neither abroad nor at home, but in the Pulpit, where it follows of course; and it is your custom to cry out against <hi>sin</hi> in general, and sometimes against <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Conformity to the World</hi> in particular; for which some of you are too well paid; but to reprove any <hi>great, high, proud, ambitious man in particular,</hi> that suits neither your spirits nor occasions at any time; but to <hi>doff your Hats, bow,</hi> and cry, <hi>God save you, Good morrow Sir,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97450:26"/>
and such like deceit as that, this you can very conveniently do almost at any time, in any place, upon any occasion, and unto any person; provided alwayes that he be not too mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable: and wherefore is it that the one is so unseasonable, and the other never, as it were, out of season? is it not because the one is <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> to you, and <hi>acceptable to others?</hi> and the other is so <hi>uncouth</hi> and <hi>strange,</hi> so hard a task, and cross to all? and therfore it is not all one. And this he should find that should let his <hi>Hat stand,</hi> and be sparing of his <hi>Good-morrows, &amp;c</hi>— and in obedience to the Lord, should in the Spirit of true Judgment and meekness <hi>reprove sin in the gate,</hi> and admonish people both high and low, <hi>to fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any were found so doing, although he should call this <hi>saluting,</hi> he would be more acceptable to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>us</hi> his People (for we are not offended, neither quarrel at the word <hi>Salute</hi>) than to the <hi>common Saluters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for these <hi>idle, foolish, good-for-nought, Ceremonious Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> we reade that Christ expresly forbad his Disciples to use them upon the way, either to friend or foe; although when they entred into a house they saluted it with the <hi>salutation of Peace,</hi> and that not only to their <hi>known Brethren,</hi> but also to such as perhaps <hi>would not receive it,</hi> but <hi>scorn and persecute them for it,</hi> and this was their reward in that case, <hi>the Peace of God returned upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as I said, alas! this is too hard a task, too great a cross to our <hi>modern, modish, world-conformable Christians,</hi> who, oft-times to make good their exposition of Christ's words, with their deeds are found, even <hi>out-aping</hi> the world in their own <hi>Apish Customs</hi> and <hi>Complements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these people (though oft-times seeing the thing) there can be no greater cross. Oh! shall I meet a great man, a rich man, a person of Honour, <hi>Earl, Lord</hi> or <hi>Knight</hi> in the streets, a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace,</hi> my <hi>Friend,</hi> my <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> one that may do me good, if I <hi>honour, worship</hi> and <hi>respect his person,</hi> and mischief if I do not; nay, when perhaps he will <hi>honour me first, shall I not honour him again? this is hard, who can bear it? what will he say of me? he will judge me a Fool, a Clown, a Mad-man; I shall become a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, a laughing-stock, a by-word, the talk of the Town and Country I shall bring much trouble upon my self: why! 'tis but a small thing, let
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97450:27"/>
me avoid all this, let me be excused when I bow! A man may be a Christian surely, and hold a fair correspondence with the world too.</hi> Is not this the sound in many mens ears? even when the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to let them see.</p>
            <p>Well! but stay a little, Friend, whosoever thou art, and tell me, whose voice is this? is it not the voice of <hi>old Satan,</hi> who said of old, <hi>Master, save thy self,</hi> whom Christ reproved in <hi>Peter,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan?</hi> and tell me, dost thou hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voice return upon thee, saying also to thee, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me, and relisheth not the things of God, but only those things which concern thy self, thy own ease, profit, pleasure and repute in the world; but whosoever will be my Disciple, must forsake himself, take up his cross, and follow me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Yet, that the god of this world may still keep possession, at least in one of his territories, his servants plead hard for this Honour, as due, and to be given at least to the Magistrates, more peculiarly, because the holy Scripture saith clearly, that there is a peculiar Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to them, and what is that?</hi> (say they) <hi>doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call them gods?</hi> —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, the Scripture called them <hi>gods,</hi> to whom the Word of God came, as Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.34. but he that judgeth amongst the gods hath also said, <hi>they shall dye like men, as one of the Princes</hi> — But where are those <hi>Magistrates, Princes,</hi> or <hi>men,</hi> to whom the Word of the Lord is come in this Age? or who are they?</p>
            <p>Yet a peculiar Honour due to Magistrates, <hi>as Magistrates,</hi> we grant and own; but that consisteth not in these things, as hath been plainly enough shewn, and evinced from the <hi>Answers</hi> and <hi>deportments</hi> of Christ and his Apostles in their <hi>converse</hi> and <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> being brought before Magistrates, who alwayes honoured all, from <hi>the King</hi> to the <hi>least Officer</hi> deriving authority from him; yet were never known to use those flattering and blasphemous Titles of <hi>most Sacred Majesty, Highness, Mightiness, Grace, Honour, Lordship, Worship,</hi> &amp;c. — nor yet the customary <hi>cap and knee Complements</hi>; but with the simple plain language of <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> to them, honoured them more, than ye do with all your <hi>vain Titles,</hi> and <hi>empty Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if these be (in your judgment) the peculiar Honour due to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97450:27"/>
Magistrates, so recommeded in Scripture; how is it that you make that which in your judgment is peculiar to them, common to all, giving it to each other? doth not your practice contradict your plea, and lay open your deceit?</p>
            <p>But certain it is, that the <hi>Peculiar Honour</hi> due to Magistrates, <hi>as Magistrates,</hi> is another thing than such baubles, viz. <hi>A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Obedience and Subjection to their Authority, to the Power,</hi> which <hi>whomsoever resisteth</hi> (whatsoever person of Magistrate or Subject) <hi>resisteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> But what is this to the persons of men, <hi>as men,</hi> though in <hi>Authority,</hi> that they should assume this <hi>honour</hi> to themselves, and plead for it as due to them, when they are to be subject to the <hi>Power,</hi> which is the <hi>Ordinance of God</hi> as well as others.—</p>
            <p>Therefore rightly do we distinguish betwixt the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> with which a man <hi>is invested,</hi> and the <hi>person</hi> or <hi>man invested therewith</hi>; who as a <hi>man,</hi> or <hi>person,</hi> is in his Office, a <hi>Servant</hi> to the <hi>Power,</hi> and ought to be personally subject to it as well as others.—</p>
            <p>If any man slights or rejects this distinction, I shall only ask him, whether the Obedience be due to the <hi>person</hi> or <hi>will</hi> of any man, or no? and whether he thinks himself in conscience bound, or will obey a Magistrate in all things that he shall command of himself, or in his own will, though pretending the Name of the Authority, if it be without, besides, or contrary to the Law, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Power, which is the standing Ordinance of God, and abides, when the persons of men invested with it pass away? but on the contrary, if an Ordinance comes forth from the Power, unquestionably so, what conscientious man doth resist and not submit, at least passively, though in a bad cause? Is not then our distinction betwixt the <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> sufficiently establisht by your own practice?</p>
            <p>And for our parts, other Honour due to Magistrates we find none mentioned in Scripture, nor know any required by God in our selves, nor ever rendred by Christ and his Apostles, Then <hi>Obedience</hi> or <hi>Submission for the Lord's sake to every humane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> stiles all Magistrates, from the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>meanest Officer</hi> in the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, 14. Now if we be found ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>this honour,</hi> and any continue yet clamoring against us, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97450:28"/>
crying out, <hi>to Magistrates belongs a peculiar Honour,</hi> and will not see that this is it, even more than we owe to the will of any man; I judge it altogether needless to speak any more to such, for to the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> here is enough already spoken, and to the <hi>sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> too much.</p>
            <p>Yet one Scripture there comes to my mind more, by which the <hi>sons of delusion,</hi> or <hi>deceivers of the Nations,</hi> the <hi>carnal Clergie,</hi> have endeavoured to render us <hi>odious</hi> to the <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and themselves as <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>good Subjects,</hi> very <hi>tender</hi> of, and <hi>zealous</hi> for their <hi>Honour,</hi> &amp;c.— falsly belying us, as <hi>not owning Magistrates,</hi> and so not fit to be tolerated, of whom (say say) the Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> did plainly testifie, saying, <hi>These filthy Dreamers defile the flesh, despise Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities</hi>; and by <hi>Dominion</hi> said one to me, is here to be understood the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> and by <hi>Dignities,</hi> the <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> &amp;c.—Poor carnal men!</p>
            <p>But do we so? do we despise these? it seems then you do not, but do hunt, thirst and lust after both, and would fain have both at your will, that so you might once satiate the <hi>blood-thirsty</hi> spirit which so lusteth in you after the blood of the Saints, and thereby you would propagate your <hi>carnal, formal Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> in the rooting out of others.—</p>
            <p>But stay a little, Friends, and here our Defence before we be condemned: We say, though after outward Power, Authority, Rule, Government or Dominion we seek not, nor do desire it, yet we despise it not, but do own it in its place, and do <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> unto it for <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>conscience sake,</hi> as Christ who was above all outward Rule also did. The like for <hi>Titles,</hi> as being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of several Offices, as names are of divers persons, we both own and use them; yet <hi>Titles</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here are flattering and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, in which the Honour of God is attributed to man whose breath is in his nostrils; and these, we freely confess we own not, and do trample upon that deceitfull mind from whence they came; — and whether we be the men there mentioned, guilty of despising that Dominion and those Dignities which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles there spake of, or not, we shall put to the issue of a tryal: and the words of Christ we own and stan<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to, where he saith, <hi>Beware of false Prophets and Seducers, by their fruits you shall know them</hi>;—
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97450:28"/>
and the words of the Apostles shall serve as a <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrying the marks and tokens, or fruits, by which these <hi>filthy drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> and <hi>ungodly men,</hi> may be known and discovered, that so all such persons, whosoever they be, in whom all, or most, or any of these marks are to be found, may be deemed, held, adjudged and apprehended to be those Deceivers; what can ye desire more?</p>
            <p>First then, saith <hi>Iude, They speak evil of those things which they know not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this common among your selves? do ye not profess that you know nothing of <hi>Revelations from God</hi> in these dayes, that you have <hi>no manifestation</hi> nor <hi>discoveries</hi> from God, that ye know not the <hi>immediate teachings</hi> and <hi>inspirations</hi> of God? And if any do witness the <hi>Word of God abiding in them,</hi> the <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>eternal Word,</hi> which lives and abides for ever, in which all the Mysteries of God and Christ, and eternal Life are hid, and by which all that hath hitherto been made manifest unto the <hi>Patriarchs, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> or any other the sons of men in all Ages, from the least to the greatest <hi>Manifestation</hi> that ever was, hath been revealed; and in which much more lyeth hid, which shall be revealed and made manifest in the Sons of God in these latter dayes. If any, I say, do witness this, and testifie of the <hi>Operations, Manifestations, Revelations,</hi> and <hi>Discoveries</hi> thereof, in and unto them, do ye not cry against it as <hi>delusion</hi> and <hi>fancy,</hi> and against them as <hi>deluded Phanaticks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, saith <hi>Iude, —but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in that they corrupt themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this necessarily the condition of all such Teachers as do deny <hi>this Word to abide in them,</hi> and <hi>know not the Revelation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? and so consequently deny Christ, who is <hi>this Word,</hi> to be come in the flesh, or to dwell in their flesh? having nothing but the Scripture and the Writings of men, whereby to come to the knowledge of God? For not having this <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> which is <hi>CHRIST the Light and Life</hi> abiding in you, what have you else that is <hi>divine?</hi> or what can you have more than that which is <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural?</hi> and whence comes then all your knowledge of God which you profess, all your Religion, Faith, Hope? &amp;c. but by getting the <hi>natural notion</hi> of them into your <hi>natural understanding, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> or <hi>memory,</hi> by <hi>natural reading, hearing,</hi> and <hi>observation?</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97450:29"/>
what that is more than to know things <hi>naturally,</hi> as <hi>brute beasts</hi> do; by that which is natural to them? And hence it is that all your Learning, Languages, Wisdom, Knowledge and Religion, being but <hi>natural</hi> at the best, standing in, and flowing from the <hi>first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which neither doth nor can know, see, comprehend, nor understand God, nor the things of the Spirit of God; it is not able to change, purifie, nor cleanse your hearts; and that which is able so to do, and should so do, not knowing it, ye deny it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, reject it, speak evil of it, and then cry out, <hi>We cannot be delivered from the body of sin and corruption so long as we live.</hi> Oh corrupt men! and more corrupt faith! But this is one sign more that ye are the men there declared of, for saith <hi>Peter</hi> of them, <hi>They cannot cease to sin</hi>; and this is your very profession, you bear this mark in your forehead with open brazen face; yea, boasting in it as a badge of <hi>Orthodox Christians,</hi> counting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Heterodox Hereticks,</hi> that believe a <hi>finishing of transgression,</hi> and <hi>ending of sin</hi>; and witness the <hi>bringing in,</hi> and <hi>possession of everlasting Righteousness on this side the grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, saith <hi>Iude, —They have gone in the way of Cain,</hi> &amp;c.—The way of <hi>Cain!</hi> what way was that? <hi>Answ.</hi> to hate and murder his Brother for Religion, or about the Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God. Now who are they that have gone in this way for Ages past, and in our time, more than the <hi>Clergie</hi> or <hi>Publick Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> of the Nations, whether under the <hi>Popish, Prelatick, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> form? Search the Records, and see who have stirred up <hi>Persecution</hi> about <hi>Religion,</hi> and cryed out to have <hi>Prisons filled,</hi> and <hi>Meetings</hi> (yea &amp; <hi>Countries</hi> also by banishments) <hi>emptied,</hi> Ye or We? Do we need proof, or compurgations? can any be so void of shames as to demand it, much less to deny the thing that is so palpably evident? Yet hereby I accuse none that in the presence of the Lord is clear, and so can in truth speak it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They say both, —<hi>They ran greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for reward, having</hi> (saith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>forsaken the Right way,</hi> (mark that) <hi>and have their hearts exercised with covetous practices,</hi> and so shal <hi>through covetousness, with feigned words,</hi> pretending the <hi>Honour and Glory of God, feeding the Flock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Salvation of Souls,</hi> &amp;c. with these fair pretences <hi>they shal make merchandize of the people,</hi> saith he; <hi>whose judgment,</hi> as it then <hi>lingred not,</hi> so it is now <hi>come</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:97450:29"/>
and <hi>coming upon you,</hi> and your <hi>torment began,</hi> even the <hi>day dawned upon you,</hi> that you can no longer lye and <hi>sleep at rest</hi> upon your <hi>beds of ease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Need I to stand forth and make enquiry whether ye be the men here deciphered or not? or among whom this is fulfilled. Have not the Proverbs of old even made you manifest to your Flocks? that it's so common amongst them, <hi>No Penny, no Pater-noster</hi>; and, <hi>The Covetousness of the Priests endures for ever,</hi> as the <hi>German</hi> Proverb saith: and many other such-like Proverbs in divers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, expressing the nature and spirit of your Generation in this particular.</p>
            <p>And which of you can in this day clear your selves? which of you have, or yet will open your mouthes without <hi>Hire, Tythes, Glebe-land,</hi> or some such <hi>super-valuable</hi> consideration? yea, are ye not as all other Merchants, watching all opportunities to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your Ware to the best Markets? and not throughly satisfied till you have gotten to the highest pitch, if you can possibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to it? only the greediness must be covered over with the Pretence of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> or <hi>a Call,</hi> and then all's well with you. But which of you was ever called by your God, from the <hi>City</hi> to a <hi>mean Country Village?</hi> or from a place of <hi>great ease, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> to a place where there is but little or none of all these <hi>carnal accommodations?</hi> Oh nay! to such a Call as this (if a Place be vacant, or a People want a Teacher) you are dull of hearing, and slow of foot. Nay, your god is not there, that's not his voice, unless it be to one that is wholly destitute, and so accep<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of it, ministring in hope of a better: and so you are all pressing forward towards the mark of your calling, <hi>(viz.) Money and Honour among a great People,</hi> that so you may (as good profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents) answer the <hi>end of your Parents</hi> in putting you to that Trade; this being the Mark which many of your Paren<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that, and a third to be a Minister of Christ, or of the Gospel, as they term it; and as they put forth the other to some <hi>Master</hi> for a term of years to learn their Craft, so they put you to the <hi>Vniversity</hi> to learn the Art of <hi>speaking by rote,</hi> and <hi>trading in words</hi>; and when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97450:30"/>
any of you hath been a competent time there, and is grown pretty cunning at cutting out of discourses, wresting plain words, and handling your tongue deceitfully, then you are fitted for the work of your Ministry; and the next thing is but to seek out for a Stage to shew your Art to the People, first in one place and then in another, as <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> till you can meet with some so silly as to bargain with you for your Ware by the year, and allow you a shop to sell it in, and this is your Call to the Ministry; for till some or other will thus buy your Merchandize, you have no Call: but let the Scriptures with which you trade, bear witness whether this was ever the Call to the Ministry of Christ. — But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, saith <hi>Iude, While they feast with you, they feed themselves without all fear</hi>; and saith <hi>Peter, esteem it pleasure to live deliciously in the day-time.</hi> Come forth and answer for your selves: Who are more tender and delicate, than <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>Dames</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</hi> Who fare more deliciously? who justifie Feasting and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in plain terms? and who more often present at them? Which of you will go from a Lecture, to a poor mans habitation to eat a little fish and barley-broth, and drink water, as Christ did many times? nay, your weak stomachs cannot bear such mean food, nor your <hi>honourable Calling</hi> such <hi>low company</hi>; but the <hi>Mayor, Deputy-Mayor of a Corporation,</hi> or <hi>Iustice in the Country</hi> you must go along with— and so the Rich receive your Gospel, and are found only worthy to entertain you. It's not for nothing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb doth so mark you out, viz. —<hi>As fat as a Bishop, Parson,</hi> or <hi>Priest.</hi> But the Scripture cannot be broken which saith, <hi>Your god is your belly,</hi> and you <hi>are enemies to the Cross of Christ.</hi> What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess is there in which you are not, as it were, a standing Service? at Feasts of all sorts, <hi>City-Feasts, Company-Feasts, Election-Feasts, Rogation-Feasts, Christmas-Feasts, Christening-Banquets</hi> (so called) <hi>Wedding-Feasts,</hi> in which people oft <hi>fiddle</hi> and <hi>pipe, sing</hi> and <hi>roar, dance</hi> and <hi>prance,</hi> more liker mad wild horses than civil people, much less seasoned Christians. In all which the <hi>Parson</hi> must be present <hi>to crave a blessing</hi> upon your ungodly designs, and when he hath <hi>fed without fear, rise up to play</hi> among the rest; or else, at the best, play the dumb-dog and not bark, nor stand up to save his Flock, nor defend the Honour and Glory of God, in testifying against this <hi>excess</hi> and <hi>rioting:</hi> but this would be too great a cross,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97450:30"/>
to which you are many times inveterate enemies; and it may be ye judge it no part of your work, to which you are called or hired (for these are convertible terms among your Tribe) being only hired <hi>to reprove sin in the Pulpit,</hi> and cry out against <hi>vanity, excess,</hi> and <hi>wantonness there,</hi> and so being only paid for it <hi>there,</hi> cannot afford to reprove it in <hi>private also</hi> into the bargain, as the Proverb again saith, <hi>De Pries ter doet géen twée Missen Uoor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>éen Geld. The Priest doth not say Two Pater-nosters for One Penny.</hi> But,</p>

O ye <hi>Deceivers!</hi> can ye not see that ye are not sent forth by him, are none of his Ministers, yea know him not? for verily if ye did, ye would go to none else for power, but believe that he is sufficient to uphold his Servants in his Work without the help of Man; what do ye take wages for of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and of the Nations, if ye cannot do the work belonging to it? from henceforth be ashamed to call out for help, and to say ye want power, or be so honest as to carry back the <hi>wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> and confess ye are not the men fitted for that work, nor able to carry it on, and so will not cheat them in taking the wages for nothing: and give way for them that can and do wage war against <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and do preach the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> which is <hi>nigh, in the mouth and the heart, sharp as a two-edged sword,</hi> which being laid to <hi>the root,</hi> cuts up all <hi>Heresie, Blaspemy, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>every evil,</hi> and this freely, without <hi>hire, gifts</hi> &amp; <hi>rewards,</hi> without <hi>money</hi> or <hi>price,</hi> only eating and drinking what is set before them, not taking care for to morrow (much less indenting for a year, or term of life, as some fearful Hypocrites I have heard of) <hi>not taking thought what to eat, or what to drink, or what to put on,</hi> as ye <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> do, but even <hi>with their own hands</hi> oft <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring to their</hi> own and others <hi>necessities.</hi> Here is a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, a Ministry of Christ indeed, which he will own, defend, and provide for so long as they abide <hi>faithful</hi> unto him, <hi>following the Lamb whither soever he goeth.</hi> But these ye call <hi>Hereticks, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, Blasphemers,</hi> and would have them restrained, and rooted out as such: O Zealous men! But alas, it's evident enough that your Zeal is not so much against <hi>Blasphemy, Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Heresie</hi> (as ye apprehend it) as for your <hi>Bellies</hi>; and against others who (ye know) see you, and that torments you, that ye cannot live according to your lusts or desires and not be seen— and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against these ye complain and murmur, yea, and (if ye can make a party amongst the Magistrates) against those Magistrates also, that will not satisfie your cruel appetite. But otherwayes, if

the Court can unanimously <hi>blaspheme,</hi> ye can do so too; if they be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> ye can be so too, or at best be silent when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you <hi>to speak no more in that Name</hi>; which is an evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken he never commanded you <hi>to speak in his Name,</hi> else ye would with the Apostles, have judged it more right <hi>to obey him than men,</hi> which with one consent set up <hi>Idolatry,</hi> impose the <hi>Mass,</hi> inforce the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book, Surplice, &amp;c.</hi>— ye can <hi>conform,</hi> nay and pretend <hi>Conscience</hi> in it too — But if these things be expelled the Court, O then ye'l not touch them as <hi>unholy, defiled, polluted</hi> things; so that the <hi>variable humour</hi> of the Court is the <hi>standing ballance</hi> and <hi>measuring reed</hi> of your <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>precious</hi> and the <hi>vile.</hi> And yet though by this your cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as brute beasts, ye can (with the <hi>Cat</hi>) be sure to <hi>pitch upon your feet</hi> from whence-soever ye be cast down; yet such is your impudence and insolence (though shame should cover your faces rather) that ye cannot be content, unless ye may trample upon the works of all others that are more righteous than your selves— But,</p>
            <p>Eighthly, saith <hi>Iude, They speak with their mouth great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration for advantage sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are ye not here depainted to the life? for what great swelling words, and Titles of <hi>most Sacred, most Excellent Majesty, Highness, Mightiness, Excellency, Holiness, Eminency, Grace, Honour, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Worship,</hi> &amp;c.— can ye give to <hi>Emperours, Kings, Princes, States, Protectors, Generals, Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Lords, Knights, Iustices,</hi> &amp;c. for advantage sake, <hi>Admiring their persons for advantage sake,</hi> saith <hi>Iude</hi>; and is it not so with you? Yes verily.</p>
            <p>And this all <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>great men</hi> may know, &amp; I believe many do see, that if ye got no more of them, or had no more to expect from them, than from the <hi>mean people,</hi> ye would have their persons in as little <hi>admiration,</hi> as the persons of the <hi>meanest</hi>; but it is <hi>for advantage sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>these are they which despise the Dominion, and speak evil of the Dignities,</hi> which the Apostles speak of; and these can one while have mens persons <hi>in admiration,</hi> and then again <hi>despise them</hi> as the worst of men; but when? it is but when the Advantage comes no more from them, but from another hand, and so they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keep in with the Advantage; as that shifteth, they turn, and are alwayes found in its quarters.</p>

            <p>But certainly both Kings and Bishops cannot but see your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and who you serve, and will trust you no more than they would professed Hypocrites;— and doubtless they see enough, that what ye at one time have in <hi>admiration</hi> for advantage sake, and cry up as the <hi>only Dominion, Government</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97450:33"/>
time ye <hi>speak evil of and despise,</hi> when the advantage is to be reaped from the adverse party.</p>
            <p>Therefore O ye Kings, Princes and Rulers, of what degree so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, think not that such as do thus honour, worship and respect your Persons, are therefore the more free from being of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly crew of <hi>false Teachers,</hi> which (<hi>Iude</hi> saith) do <hi>despise Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and speak evil of Dignities,</hi> — for it is but for the advantage and <hi>Emolument</hi> sake that they do it, try them else. Besides (mark it) this very <hi>having mens persons in admiration,</hi> or <hi>respecting their persons for advantage sake,</hi> is one of the <hi>marks</hi> by which these <hi>filthy dreamers</hi> are to be known, as you plainly see in the Apostle's words.</p>
            <p>Therefore also, judge not us rashly, to be those <hi>despisers of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, &amp;c.</hi> because we cannot honour, reverence, worship, or respect your Persons, nor have them in admiration for any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage sake that we might thereby enjoy, or disadvantage that we might thereby avoid. For that is no good consequence; nay, the contrary is the Affirmation of the Apostle, <hi>viz. That such as have mens persons in admiration for advantage sake, are the very false Teachers which</hi> (he saith) <hi>do despise Dominion and speak evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi>—</p>
            <p>From whence it is yet further evident, That the <hi>true Honour</hi> of Magistrates consisteth not in <hi>worshipping, respecting,</hi> or <hi>admiring their persons for advantage sake,</hi>—but in <hi>yeelding all due Obedience to the Power and Ordinance of God in all things</hi>;— And the same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due <hi>in all things</hi> from all inferiour Relations to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; as from <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Parents, Servants</hi> to their <hi>Masters,</hi> and <hi>Wives</hi> to their <hi>own Husbands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet that none of these Relations may think, that they may command what they list, and then look upon all under them as bound actually to obey them <hi>in all things whatsoever,</hi> because the Scripture saith <hi>be obedient in all things</hi>; they may plainly see that <hi>universal</hi> is every where limited again, to that which is good — as is here shewn, as also what that honour is.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Rulers.] Honour the King.</hi> Qu. <hi>How,</hi> or with what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? <hi>Answ.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>To Masters.] Let as many Servants as are under the yoak, count [their own Masters] worthy of all honour,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.1. <hi>Qu.</hi> How? <hi>Being obedient to their Masters (according to the flesh) in all things,</hi> Col. 3.22. <hi>Qu.</hi> But how in all things? in all what things? <hi>Ans.</hi> In all things that may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour; in all things agreeable with a good conscience, with simplicity, or singleness of heart, and in the fear of the Lord; in all things which ye can do as unto the Lord, or as unto Christ: for thus are ye required to be obedient in all things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in any evil thing. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8.</p>

            <p>So that it's plain that these general terms, [<hi>Be obedient in all things; Submit your selves in every thing, to every humane creature, whether to the King as Supream, or to the Constable, as deriving his Authority from him</hi>] doth not require inferiours to be subject to the will of man in any of these relations, but to have their eye in all things to the Will of God, to do what they do, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, submitting themselves in the fear of God, which keepeth the heart <hi>clear, upright</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> and so out of obeying in <hi>any evil thing.</hi>— And,</p>
            <p>As these Inferior relations, in their places are exhorted to <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> so also are the Superiors charged even to do the same thing, that is <hi>just, good, fitting</hi> and <hi>well-pleasing to the Lord,</hi> as in his fear.</p>

            <p n="4">4. Husbands] <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as your own bodies, and be not bitter against them.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Yet though these should so be in their several stations, this <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Subjection in all good things,</hi> is that which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as well to him to be rendred, <hi>not only to the good and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, but also to the hard</hi>; for the obedience is unto the Lord, for <hi>his sake,</hi> for <hi>conscience sake,</hi> (and not for their sakes) and he is the <hi>reward</hi> of those that <hi>obey him in the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they go beyond these bounds in their Commands, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding things unfitting, evil, and not well-pleasing to the Lord, but contrary to his Will, it is then neither honour to God nor them, to obey them actually; but a dishonour to the Name of God, that any should fear Men more than Him, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer for the Name of Christ, and the Testimony of a good Conscience.—</p>
            <p>But good, wise and prudent Rulers, who know their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fear the Lord, will not require such things; and such will also be satisfied, with that honour which comes from God alone, and be content and count it honour enough if the Power, which is the Ordinance of God, be but honoured with Subjection, through a good and blameless Conversation; well knowing, that as to their persons there is no such peculiar honour due to them, more than to other men,— Though possibly some self-willed, ambitious persons may not be satisfied therewith, as being too mean and plain, too much like the upright, world-despising and self-denying <hi>Iesus,</hi> and his mean, single-hearted Followers and Disciples, who of old, could not, and yet cannot, honour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,

or prefer the <hi>Rich-man</hi> with a Gold-Ring &amp; gay Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, before a <hi>Poor-man</hi> in vile rayment,— at which such, I say, may be disturbed, it being the chief thing which they perhaps aimed at in getting into Authority.—</p>
            <p>Why! how saith he! wherefore am I in Authority! wherefore am I call'd a <hi>Duke, Earl, Marquess, Lord, Knight,</hi> or <hi>Esquire?</hi> &amp;c. why have I bought these Places and Titles so dear? why do I put on all these gay cloaths? why have I so many waiting upon me, so many running by my horse or coach side (as dogs?) why such feathers in my hat, and such a fine sword by my side? why do I build or purchase such stately palaces? If, notwithstanding all this, I shall be honoured before the People no more than one of the people out of Authority, no more than a common, simple, plain fellow in a leathern jacket or dublet? what is it all worth without this, unless I be honoured the more for it? tush, 'tis not all worth twopence without it, 'twas for that I sought and bought all this, and now to lose my cost and pains, and to get nor <hi>cap,</hi> nor <hi>knee,</hi> nor <hi>bow,</hi> nor <hi>congie,</hi> nor <hi>your Grace, Honour</hi> nor <hi>Worship,</hi> nay not so much as <hi>good-morrow</hi> nor <hi>good-night,</hi> nay to have no better language, nor reverend Addresses made to me in speech than to my <hi>Foot-boy,</hi> or than I my self give my <hi>Foot-boy,</hi> nothing but <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi>— it's intolerable, it torments me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I will not bear it from them; I will not leave till I have rooted them out, but I'le have my will of them, and prove it by the Scripture too, that they must honour me; am I not a good Christian then?</p>
            <p>Well! if there be such a <hi>Haman</hi> yet living, I say unto thee, Friend, stop a little, run not head long to thy own destruction;— call thy fury a little in question, examine the cause, consider whence is it, from Heaven or Hell? who blows the fire? who captivates thee thus? who rageth thus in thee against a harmless people? yea, who tyrannizeth thus over thee? Whose voice is this? Surely not the Voice of God thy Creator, whom thou oughtest to fear, nor yet the natural genuine voice of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creature; but of him that possesseth thy heart, and reigneth over thee. Consider then, who is it, and whither he is leading thee?</p>
            <p>And if thou wilt not be advised, and nothing can satisfie thee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97450:35"/>
but to have thy own will; — Go on— but know, the Lord hath determined to deliver <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and all his generation, out of the hands of <hi>Haman,</hi> and thou shalt not prosper that seekest their destruction, though thou mayest be backed with the King's Command; for even also the <hi>heart of the King is in the hand of our God,</hi> whom alone we fear, and not man, and in him alone is our confidence.—</p>
            <p>And now all ye that profess the Name of Christ, behold what a Serpent ye nourish in the bosom of the ambitious man, and how by your slavish conformity ye increase and strengthen the bands of the Innocent; consider also whether ye therein please <hi>God</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> the <hi>flesh</hi> or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and with whom ye partake in it.</p>
            <p>And thou Ambitious <hi>HaMan,</hi> consider also who is thy greatest friend, he that piles up fuel upon fuel upon the flame of thy am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious spirit, by satisfying it; or he, that refusing to feed and satiate thy amb<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ious appitite, becomes as a stumbling-stone in thy way, and as thorns under thy feet, that thou mayest be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, stumble and fall, and return to rise; and consider what thou art doing, whither thou art posting, and in whose service, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou dost obey <hi>God, Christ,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Soul, or the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and thy <hi>flesh,</hi> to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?</p>
            <p>Consider it, I say, and know that thou art warned, and he not deceived, for God is not mocked; what thou sowest, that shalt thou assuredly reap, whether unto the flesh destruction, or unto the Spirit, life eternal.</p>
