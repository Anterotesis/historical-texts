            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>In the month of February, you shall not let bloud for wantonnesse, but néede: you shall forbeare Hearbe-pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for at that time onely they are least wholesome: you shall kéepe the soles of your féete from wet, and vse euery morning your former friction.</p>
               <p>In the moneth of March, the signe being good, you may let bloud according to your youth, strength, and necessitie: you may take hot and swéet meats and drinkes, especially Almonds, Figs &amp; Reyzins, &amp; vse also your former friction.</p>
               <p>In the month of Aprill, you may bléed as in the month of March: in it also you may purge, by the order of a learned directer: let your dyet be hot and fresh meats, and your drinke temperate: also in this moneth your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friction is excéeding wholesome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:12348:13"/>In the month of May be no sluggard, for the bed is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome, cléerified Way is this moneth a most soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne drinke, and Sage with swéet Butter is a most excellent breakefast: yong Lettuce is an approued good Sallet, and the inthrals or offall of Beasts would by all meanes be refused, it is also good to let bloud in this month onely for necessitie, and not for pleasure, and beware by all means, not to go weishooed in the dew in the morning.</p>
               <p>In the month of Iune obserue the dyet of May, or if you be of youthfull bloud it is not amisse if it be a little cooler, and for bléeding let it be for vrgent necessitie.</p>
               <p>In the month of Iuly eschew all wanton bed-sport: and if each morning you take a draught of clarified Butter-Milke it is very wholesome: vse coole Iulyps, and meats that are fresh, and not stirring: now forbeare Lettice, and bléede not, except it be in cause of great extreamitie.</p>
               <p>In the month of August forbeare all manner of Worts, and Cabadges, and generally all meats and Spices which are hot and inflaming: but by any meanes bléed not at all, except by the direction of most approued learning.</p>
               <p>In the month of September you may eate any sort of ripe Fruits: you may bathe in hot bathes, for colde causes, at your pleasure, and you may let bloud according to your necessitie: those foods are best which are of lightest disgestion, and those drinkes most wholesome which are rather strong then scouring.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:12348:14"/>In the Moneth of Nouember open also no vaine, but for great néed, because the blood is then gathered together into the principall vessels: Bathing in this Moneth is vtterly to be refused, onely let your body be kept warme, and euery colde humour or obstruction, rather dissolued by moderate frictions, as is shewed in the moneth of Ianuary and February, then by the violence of any other inward medicine. Shell-Fish in this moneth is very wholesome, and so are all other sorts of Fish, which are not too rawe or slymie.</p>
               <p>In the Moneth of December blood-letting should be also forborne, except vpon some especiall dayes, as after the fiue and twentieth day at the soonest: and for your diet let it be meate which is hot and nourishing, but by no meanes that which bréedeth melancholie bloud. Use strong Wine and sharpe Sauces: as for the warmth of your body, next vnto good cloathing, let it euer procéed from exercise that is moderate, then from toasting, or broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your selfe against the fire, for in this Month that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can hardly be sound whose shinnes are made pyde and motley with the fiers scorthcing.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the experience of the English Husbandman in these fore-knowledges, and ayming after the times to come, being drawne from the obseruations and rules left vs by succession of times of those learned Fathers, and other best knowne and approued in these knowledges: yet I doe not binde-euery Husbandman to make as it were new Créeds of these Principles, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue them to his memory, as things that will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppresse nor hurt it, and if in any seldome-séene parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularitie, any shall vary from the purpose of the relation, to remember that there is aboue vs a God of all Truth and Knowledge, who will dispose and gouerne all things, according to his good Will and Pleasure: to which let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Creature submit, in as much as hee onely knoweth what is for mankinde most best and most conuenient.</p>

one from another, and be most sure that your séedes be hard and sound (for any softnesse in them sheweth rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) then couer them foure fingers thicke with the like mould: then within seauen or eight dayes, after you shall sée them appeare aboue the earth, but in any wise let them continue still till the principall leaues be come forth, and they begin to créepe out in length, then with your hand griping the whole plant, take it vp by the rootes with the earth and all, and plant it in a bed new digged &amp; trimmed for the purpose with a rich loose mould, and so replant and remoue each roote seuerally one after another, and they will grow and bring forth in great plenty. Now by the way you must obserue, that as soone as you haue sowne your séedes you shall prouide a Mat, Canuasse, or other couering, which being placed vpon stakes ouer the dung bed, shall euery night after Sunne-set be spread ouer the same, and not taken away till the Sunne be risen in the morning, for this will defend the séedes from frosts and other cold dewes which are very dangerous. Now if any demand why these séedes are thus sowne first on the bed of dung, they shall vnderstand that besides the warmth and fertility thereof, that the séedes are so pleasant and tender, that wormes and other créeping things in the earth will destroy them before they can sprout, which this bed of dung preuenteth. The months most fit for sowing these séedes, are Aprill, May, and Iune onely, for other are much too colde, and in this manner you may sowe any tender séede whatsoeuer.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing written sufficiently of Pot-hearbs and Sallet-hearbs, which are the ornaments of the Husbandmans Kitchin or Table, I will here speake of flowers, which either for their smels, beauties, or both, are the graces of his Chamber. And first, because my maine ayme and scope is English Husbandrie, I will begin with those flowers which are most proper and naturall for our climate, of which because I holde <hi>Roses</hi> both for their smell, beauties, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse to excéede all other, I thinke it not amisse to giue them the first place and precedencie before all other.</p>
               <p>You shall vnderstand then that <hi>Roses</hi> are generally and aunciently but of thrée kindes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Roses.</hi>
                  </note> the Damaske, the red, and the white, and what are different from these are but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuations from them, being by grafting, replanting, and phisicking, somewhat altered either in colour, smell, or doublenesse of leafe.</p>
               <p>To speake then first of the Damaske <hi>Rose,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske Rose.</hi>
                  </note> it is fit that all husbandmen know, that <hi>Roses</hi> may as well be sowne from the séede, as planted from the roote, Syen, or branch onely, they are the slower in comming vp, more tender to nourish, and much longer in yéelding forth their flowers, yet for satisfaction sake and where necessitie vrgeth, if of force or pleasure you must sowe it from the séede, you shall chuse a ruffish earth loose and well dunged, and you shall cast vp your beds high and narrow: the moneth which is fit for their sowing is September, and they must be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not aboue foure fingers déepe, they must be defended well all the Winter from frosts and stormes, and then they will beare their flowers plentifully all the next
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12348:24"/>
Spring following; yet this is to be noted, that all <hi>Roses</hi> which rise from the séede simply, their flowers will be single like the <hi>Eglantine,</hi> or <hi>Cyphanie,</hi> therefore after your plants are two yéeres olde, you must graft one into another, as you doe other fruit, and that will make them double and thicke: also you must remember that those yellow small séedes which are in the midst of the <hi>Rose,</hi> are not true <hi>Rose</hi> séedes, but those which lye hid in the round peare knob vnder the <hi>Rose,</hi> which as soone as the leaues are fallen away, will open and shew the séede. And thus much touching the sowing of all sorts of <hi>Roses,</hi> which is for experience and knowledge sake onely, for indéede the true vse and property of the <hi>Rose</hi> is to be planted in short slips about fourtéene inches long, and the small tassels of the roote cut away, they would be set halfe a foote into the ground, in the same manner as you set ordinary Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, and of like thicknesse, rather a little slope-wise then vpright: and though some thinke March the best season, yet doubtlesse September is much better for hauing the roote confirmed all the Winter, they will beare the sooner and better all the Sommer following; you must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to plant them in faire weather, and as néere as you can vnder shelter as by the sides of walls, and such like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert where the Sunne may reflect against them, and if they be planted on open beds or borders, then you must with Poales and other necessaries support and hold them vp, least the winde shake their rootes and hinder their growing.</p>

                     <hi>Diuersities and vse of Pastures</hi>
                  </note> which are of two kindes: the first, such Pastures as lye in wood land, mountainous, or colde climes, and are enclined to hardnesse and barrennesse, and therefore onely imployed to the bréeding and bringing forth of Cattell: the other such as lye in lowe, warme, and fruitfull soyles, and are most fertile and aboundant in encrease, onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to the fatting and féeding of Cattell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of barraine Pastures.</hi>
                  </note>And now to speake of the first sort of Pasture, which being some-what barraine, is preserued for bréeding, you shall vnderstand that it is generally dispierced ouer all this Kingdome, and particularly into euery Countrey, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the veanes and mixture of the earth, such is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the richnesse or pouerty of the same, and of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall mixtures I haue spoken sufficiently before in that part of this Booke, which entreateth of errable ground. Then to procéede to my purpose, it is the first office of the Husbandman when he séeth and knoweth the true nature of his earth, and perceiueth from perfect iudgement that it is of very hard encrease,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainnesse.</hi>
                  </note> which as the temper and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the soyle assures him, so also he shall better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by these fewe signes and Charracters, which I will deliuer: as first, if he sée grasse flow of growth, and that no Spring will appeare before May. If in stead of Clouer grasse, Dandylion, and Honisuckle, you sée your ground furnished with Penigrasse, Bents, and Burnet. If you
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12348:48"/>
sée much Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, or if you perceiue the scorching of the Sunne burne away the grasse as fast as the raine had brought it forth: or if you finde quarries of stone néere vnto the vpper swarth of grasse; or if your ground bring forth Lyng, Bracken, Gorse, Whynnes, Broome, Bilburie, or Strawburie: or if your ground be morish, full of quick-myers, mossie or full of blacke Flint, any of these signes make it to be most apparant that the soyle is barraine and of hard encrease.</p>
               <p>And then as before I said it is the Husbandmans first<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Battering of soyles.</hi>
                  </note> office to prouide for the bettering and perfecting of his earth, which he shall doe in this sort. First, if he perceiue that the barrainnesse of his ground procéedes from want of good Plants,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sovving of good seedes.</hi>
                  </note> as from want of Clouer-grasse, Dandylion, Honisuckle, Cowslop, and other swéet flowers, then he shall repaire into the fruitfull Countries, and there buy the hay séedes and swéepings of hay-barne-flowers, which he shall euery Spring and fall of the leafe sowe, as thin as may be, vpon such Pastures, as he shall either lay for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or preserue for the latter Spring after Michaelmas. But if he respect not the goodnesse of grasse,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>For abundance of grasse.</hi>
                  </note> but the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grasse, as those husbands doe which liue in or about great Cities, then he shall dung those grounds which he will lay for meddow at Candlemasse; or those which he will graze or eate in the first beginning of the Spring, at Michaelmasse before, with the oldest and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennest meanure he can get, of which the best is the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten staddell or bottomes of Hay-stackes, or for want of it the meanure of horse-stables, swéepings, and scowrings of yards and barnes, the mudde of olde ditches, or else good Oxe or Cow meanure, any of which will bring forth abundance of grasse.</p>
               <p>Yet thus much I must aduertise the Husbandman;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</hi>
                  </note> that this meanuring of Pasture grounds carries with it diuers imperfections, for though it occasion abundance of grasse to growe, yet the meddow or hay which comes thereof, is so ranke, loggie, and fulsome in tast, that a beast
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12348:49"/>
taketh no ioy to eate thereof, more then to holde very life and soule together. Also the grasse thus meanure which you intend to graze or eate with your Cattell, is by meanes of the meanure so loose at the roote, that Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell as they bite plucke vp both the grasse, roote, and all, which being of strong &amp; ranke sent in the mouth of a beast, maketh him loathe and cast it out againe, and so not striue to eate to be fat, but onely to maintaine life.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>To helpe a slovv Spring.</hi>
                  </note>Now if your Spring be slow, and late in the yéere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your grasse will appeare aboue ground, it is méete then that you enclose your ground, and not only maintaine the fences with high and thicke Quick-sets, but also with tall Timber-trées, whose shade and strength may defend many colde blasts from the earth, and adde vnto it a more naturall warmenesse then it had before, for it is onely the coldnesse of the soyle which makes the grasse long before it grow. Also in this case it is méete that you lay (as the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman tearmes it) all such Pasture as you intend to graze at the spring following, in Nouember before, &amp; so not being bitten from that time till Aprill following, no doubt but your spring will be both good and forward. There be others which helpe their slow springing grounds by stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the latter end of the yéere with great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of shéepe, who although they bite néere to the ground, and leaue little grasse behinde them, yet they so tread and meanure it with their hot meanure, that it will spring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it commeth to rest, much more early and faster then it was wont. So that to conclude in a word, to make a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ground spring earely, is to kéepe it warme, let it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </note>If your ground be troubled with Knot-grasse or Speare-grasse, it is a signe of too much colde moysture in the earth, and in this case you shall with a great common Plough, made for such a purpose, turne vp great furrowes through your ground, and make them so descend and fall one into another, that not onely the moysture bred in the earth, but that which falls vpon the earth, may haue a swift passage
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12348:49"/>
from the same, and so your soyle being drayned and kept dry, all those wéedy kindes of grasse will soone perish.</p>
               <p>If your ground be subiect to the scorching or burning of the Sunne,<note place="margin">

                  </note> vnlesse that such soyles be vpon Limestone ground, or néere vnto other quarries of hard stone, which lying néere vnto the vpper swarth of the grasse, doth so burne the roote, that the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per branches cannot prosper. In this case the bringing in of water doth rather hurt then good, wherefore your best course is partly by your owne industry, and partly by the labours of others, who are traded in such commodities, to let forth your ground to Stone-diggers or Lime-makers, who digging the quarries out of the earth, and then fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp the emptie places with rubbish and other earth, the soyle will in short space become as fruitfull as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it is onely the want of taking roote; or the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of the roote, which makes this kinde of earth bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</p>

                  </note> except you haue the Art and skill to know the same, you shall obserue these few rules following, and they will sufficiently instruct you in the same. First, when you sée your beast in the generall shape and composure of his body shew most faire and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, each member being comely, and each bone couered, in such sort as a perfect shape requireth, as no eye is so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as cannot tell when a beast looketh well or ill-fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, you shall then guesse the beast to be well fed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you sée his huckle-bones round and not sharpe, his ribs smooth, not rough, his flankes full, his natch thick, and his cod round. This when you shall perceiue, you shall handle him, and griping him vpon the neathermost ribs, if you féele the skinne loose, and the substance soft vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your hand, you may be well assured that the beast is very well fed outwardly, that is vpon the bones. You shall then lay your hand vpon his round huckle-bones, and if that féele, vnder your hand, soft, round and plumpe, you shall be assured that the beast is well fed both outwardly and inwardly, that is, both in flesh and tallow: then you shall handle him at the setting on of his taile, and if that handle bigge, thicke, full, and soft, it is a true signe that the beast is very well fed outwardly: then handle his natch-bones which are on both sides the setting on of his taile, and if they féele left and loose, it is a signe that he is well fed, both outwardly and inwardly. Lastly, you shall handle his cod and nauell, if it be of an Oxe, and the nauell onely if it be a Cowe, and if they handle thicke, round, soft, great, and plumpe, it is a most assured signe that the beast is very well tallowed within. And thus when any of these parts or members shall handle in contrary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, you shall indge of the contrary effects. And thus much touching the knowledge of a fat beast.</p>

                  </note>The best times for laying of meddowes to rest, is, if the meddow lye high, as in vp-land Countries, or if the soyle

be cold, or the springing thereof slow, at Candlemasse: but if the ground be more warme, temperate, &amp; of some more fertility, then you may lay it at our Ladies day in March: but if the ground be most fruitfull, then if you lay it at May day, it will be early enough. Also in the laying of your med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes to rest, you shall consider the state of the ground, as whether it be eaten néere and bare, and with what Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, as Horse, Oxen, or Shéepe: if it haue béene eaten bare with Oxen or Horse, then you shall lay it earlier in the yéere, for it will aske a longer time to grow againe: but if it haue béene eaten with Shéepe (although they bite née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to the ground) yet you may lay it so much later, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the meanure which they bestow vpon such good ground, will quickly hasten on the Spring: but if your meddowes haue not béene eaten bare, but haue a good déepe fogge vpon them still, then you may lay them the latest. Also in the laying of meddowes, you shall consider whether they be common or priuate, if they be common meddowes, and that no olde custome binde you to the contrary, you shall lay them to rest earely in the yéere, that recouering a forward Spring, you may cut them so much the sooner, and so haue the better after-crop, and the longer time to eate it: but if your meddow be priuate, and at your owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular disposing, then you shall lay it according to your owne necessitie, and the goodnes of the soyle, obseruing euer to giue it full time of growth, and not to cut it till the grasse be full ripe, for it is better to let it grow a wéeke too long (so the weather be seasonable for the withering of it) then to cut it two dayes too soone, because when it is too earely cut, it not onely looseth the strength and goodnesse, but also the substance and waight, and in the drying shrinketh and wasteth to nothing.</p>

and without question it is a very good time for all men to begin that labour, if their grounds be fruitfull and of earely growth: but in as much as diuers grounds are diuers in their growth, some being much more hastie then other some: and for as much as some meddow may as well grow too long as too little a time, as in high land Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where the heate and reflection of the Sunne will burne and consume away the grasse, if it be not gathered in a due season, I would therefore wish euery good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman about a wéeke before Midsommer, and a wéeke after, to view his meddowes well, and if he sée them turne browne, if the Cock heads turne downeward and stand not vpright, if the Bels and other vessels of séede open and shed their séedes, if your Honisuckles haue lost their flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and the Penigrasse be hard, dry, and withered, then you shall truly vnderstand that your meddow is ripe and ready to be mowne, and the longer it standeth, the more it will loose of the substance, and when any of the contrary signes appeare, as when the meddow lookes gréene and fresh, the Cock-heads looke vpright, the Bels are close and hard, the Honisuckles flowring and purple, and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigrasse soft and moyst, then is your meddow not readie to cut, nor will the Hay that is so gotten be other then soft, fuzzie, and most vnwholsome, no beast taking delight to eate of the same.</p>

The next day, after the Sunne hath taken the dewe from the ground, you shall turne that which the day before you tedded, and then if you haue any more new mowen, you shall ted it also. The next day following, as before, when the dewe is from the earth, you shall turne your Hay againe, and so letting it lye till the Sunne be at his height, begin to stir it againe, at which time if you finde it is reasonably well withered, you shal then draw it into windrowes, that is, you shall marke which way the

winde standeth, and the same way that it bloweth, the same way with Forks &amp; Rakes one after another, gather in the Hay into long, great, thicke rowes: then you shall make those windrowes into large Cockes, of which the biggest is euer the best, for they will defend themselues from raine, if happily any shall fall, whereas the little small Cocke lying light together, taketh in the raine like a spunge, and so makes the Hay a great deale much worse then otherwise it would be; when your Hay is thus set in safe Cocke, you shall let it rest a day or two, that it may take a little sweat therein, which will make the Hay won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous pleasant and swéet, then when the Sunne is got vp to a pretie height, you shall open those Cockes, and after the sunne and winde hath passed through them, you may if the grasse be cleane &amp; fine of it selfe, without ranke grasse, load it, and carrie it either into the Barne, or such other place, as you haue appointed for the receit thereof: but if it haue any ranke grasse, which you sée vnwithered amongst it, then you shall make it vp againe into safe cockes, and so let it rest a day or two more before you leade it away.
