            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALL abroad every where, think it not ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fiery Tryal, which is but to try you;
for is it not written, <hi>Every man's work muſt be try'd?</hi>
neither think the time long; neither look at Sufferings, nor
at the Potentneſs of thoſe that cauſe you to ſuffer; but look
to the Lord, that is able to deliver: Did the Lord ever leave
or forſake his People in a ſuffering Condition, that ſtood for
his Name, or gave up themſelves freely to whatever the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors
could do: For there were Informers, and Laws, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98214:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Decrees made in <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi>'s time, but the Lord fruſtrated
them; &amp; thoſe that ſtood for the Name of the Lord came over
all at laſt, when the Lord ſaw their Faithfulneſs, and the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of their Faith. <hi>Haman</hi> was an Informer, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
King <hi>Ahaſuerus, There is a certain People ſcatter'd abroad, and
diſpis'd among the People in all the Provinces of thy Kingdom,
and their Laws are divers from all people's, neither keep they the
King's Laws, therefore it is no<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the King's profit to ſuffer them
ſo; if it pleaſe the King let them be deſtroy'd, and he would give
ſo much Money,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 9. and this was
but for want of poor <hi>Mordecai's</hi> bowing to him: So the King
granted this great Informer's Requeſt, to deſtroy all the
ſeed of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were within his Provinces: But read
on in the third and fourth Chapters of <hi>Eſther,</hi> and ſee what
came to paſs in a little time; the <hi>Jews</hi> were deliver'd, and
the Informer went to the Gallows: Now if <hi>Haman</hi> had
been quiet, it is a queſtion, if he had been deſtroy'd, or not;
for the Adverſaries lifting up themſelves againſt the Lord's
Remnant never lengthens their dayes: For when the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of his People, and Uprightneſs of their Hearts to him
are ſeen, he ſoon brings Deliverance; they need not find
the Lord a way out to deliver.</p>
            <p>Therefore all Friends every where, give up all you are and
have, and wait to find a Godly Reſolution ſpringing up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you; and ſay, <hi>The God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us;
if not, we are reſolv'd to Serve and Worſhip the Lord.</hi> In <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezer</hi>'s
time (as you may read in the 3d of <hi>Daniel</hi>) how
there were Informers; in the 8th verſe, <hi>Certain</hi> Caldeans
<hi>came to accuſe the</hi> Jews: in the 10th verſe, <hi>Thou, O King,
made a Decree, That they that would not fall down and worſhip
the Image, at the ſound of the Muſick, ſhould be caſt into the
Burning-Fiery-Furnace;</hi> and ſo they go on, and tell the King,
<hi>There were ſuch three Men, which regarded him not, neither</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98214:2"/>
               <hi>ſerved his Gods, nor worſhipped the Image that he had ſet up:
Then the King, in his Rage aud Fury, commanded the men to be
brought before him;</hi> and he asked, <hi>If theſe things were true,
That they ſerv'd not his Gods, nor worſhipp'd the Golden Image
which he had ſet up; now if ſo be they would be ready at the ſound
of the Muſick, to fall down and worſhip the ſaid Image that he
had made; but if not, in the ſame Hour they ſhould be caſt into
the mid'ſt of the Burning-Fiery Furnace:</hi> Now their Anſwer
was, <hi>The God whom they ſerv'd was able to deliver them; but
if not, we will not Bow:</hi> And he did d<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liver them to his own
Praiſe and Glory, but they that caſt them into the Fire were
ſlain with the Flame; but <hi>Shadrah, M<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego
came out of the Furnace without harm, which did aſtoniſh the
King; and he bleſſed the God of</hi> Shadrach, Meſhech, <hi>and</hi> Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego.
Now Friends, if ſuch a Work ſhould be brought
forth through your Faithfulneſs, would it not make your
hearts glad, that God ſhould be ſo honour'd by your Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
For if theſe men had ſhrunk and bow'd, the Lord's
Power had not been ſo manifeſted: For the Faithfulneſs of
Friends puts an opportunity into the Lord's Hand to make his
Power known. For, Did not the Lord raiſe up <hi>Pharoah</hi> to
make his Power known; when <hi>Moſes</hi> led the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
out of <hi>Egypt. Pharo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h</hi> with his Hoſt follow'd in great
haſte, and purſu'd them to the Red-Sea, thinking to have
deſtroy'd them <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll; and ſome began to Murmer againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi>
why he would bring them thither, to be deſtroy'd; yet <hi>Moſes</hi>
his Faith was in God, and he bid them but <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee
the Salvation of God, and the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>whom they had ſeen
that day, they ſhould never ſee again:</hi> and ſo it came to paſs;
<hi>for</hi> Iſrael <hi>had a Way through the Sea, but</hi> Pharoah <hi>and his Hoſt
were drown'd, and not a man eſcap'd.</hi> Now Friends, if thoſe
that were with <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have <hi>drawn back to</hi> Pharoah <hi>in this
ſeeming Diſtreſs, thinking to go to</hi> Moſes <hi>again when the Danger</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:98214:3"/>
               <hi>was over, had they not run from their Safety to their Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now Friends, none to draw back again, neither to be
ſlack in keeping your Meetings; <hi>For he that draws back, the
Lords Soul has no Pleaſure in him; and the Back-ſlider in heart
ſhall be fill'd with his own wayes:</hi> And therefore Friends, be
of a Noble Mind, and Valliant for the Truth upon the
Earth; the Noble Seed brings to be of a Noble Mind.</p>
            <p>And Friends, it is convenient that Tryals come, that the
Chaff may be ſeperated from the Wheat, for they who are
of this noble Seed will not be Treacherous nor Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
but have a faithful Reſpect to the Honour of God
forever.</p>
            <p>And obſerve in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s day, how that they could not bring
him to ſuffer, but concerning the Worſhip of his God (ſo
they can find nothing againſt us but concerning the Worſhip
of our God, for which Bleſſed be the Name of the Lord fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
ſo a Decree was made, <hi>that whoſoever ask'd a Petition either
of God or Man, for thirty dayes, ſave of the King, ſhould be caſt into
the Den of Lyons; and</hi> Daniel <hi>was conſtant to pray to the Lord
three times a day, with his Window open towards</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as
his manner was:</hi> Now <hi>Daniel</hi> might have ſhut his Window,
and forbore to pray to his God for ſo many dayes; <hi>but then
how could the Lord have appear'd in his Deliverance, if he had
not kept to his Worſhip as his manner was, by which the Name of
the Lord came to be exalted:</hi> And he that made the Decree,
<hi>Commanded all to call upon the God of</hi> Daniel. So that you
may ſee alwayes it was Faithfulneſs and Conſtancy that
brought Honour to God, and Deliverance to themſelves, and
Deſtruction upon the Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>So Friends, ſtand in the Fear and Dread of God, and
you will become <hi>a Dread to all Nations:</hi> what need you fear
any but the Lord God, that made Heaven and Earth? <hi>What,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98214:3"/>
               <hi>will a Living Man be afraid of a Dead Man?</hi> So you th<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t are
alive in Chriſt Jeſus, what need you fear them that are dead
in <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Tranſgreſsion, a body of Sin</hi> and <hi>a body
of Death? What need a living Body be afraid of a dead
Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So F<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iends, be of a valliant Mind; they who are of the
noble Birth, will be of a valliant Mind, and I know will give
their Appearance for God, who <hi>hath appear'd for us, and in
us, and among us:</hi> Many comfortable and peaceable Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
we have enjoy'd, wherein we have been refreſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſatisfied together, and our Hearts made glad toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the en<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oyment of the <hi>Goodneſs of our God;</hi> which
is (I know) <hi>not wanting in this ſuffe<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the conſideration of theſe things Friends, hold
up your heads; <hi>for God he will be our Deliverer:</hi> I dare be
bold to ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, <hi>That the Lord will
bring a Calm;</hi> for, was the Old World ſo rude and cruel as
this Generation? they let <hi>Noah</hi> build the Ark, and did not
go about to make a Spoil of his Work, though they were
againſt him, and call'd him, <hi>Old Fool,</hi> yet they let him
alone with his Work.</p>
            <p>But this Generation will not let the Lord's People
work the Works of God, nor Worſhip Him whom the Ark
was a Type of.</p>
            <p>And if the Lord overthrew the old <hi>World</hi> for their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
and their ſlighting of <hi>Noah</hi>'s warning of them;
what will he do to this Generation, that not only rejects
the Warnings of them <hi>that are call'd and choſen of God to
work his Works,</hi> but <hi>ſeek to deſtroy them?</hi> I ſay, how can
the Lord hold his Hand, but let it fall heavy upon thoſe
that have dealt thus cruelly with his People; ſeeing he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
thoſe that never <hi>dealt</hi> ſo cruelly?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98214:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So Friends, let your confidence be in the Lord God that
made Heaven and Earth; truſt in his Arm; let him be your
Shield; he will ſet up a Standard for you, that all Nations
of the Earth ſhall never be able to pull down; for the Lord
never leaves nor forſakes his Heritage: Or where was there
ever any that ſuffer'd for God, but their Enemies fell before
them? Though they ſought to ruin the Lord's People, yet
the Pit they had digg'd for others, themſelves fell in<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it; and
it wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l never fall otherwiſe to them that think to deſtroy the
Lord's Heritage.</p>
            <p>Friends, let none think that the Beaſt's worſhip ſhall ſpread
again, neither ſhall People wonder after him, as they have
done; neither ſhall the great Whore ſpread her Skirts over
Nations, as ſhe has done, neither ſh<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll ſhe be heard to make
her boaſt; for the Lord hath and will confound her, with thoſe
that have committed Fornication with her: And his own
Name, and Power, and Kingdom he will ſet up over all the
<hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Two things the great Whore has boaſted ſhould never come upon
her, yet ſhe ſhall meet with them both; that is, <hi>loſs of Children, and
Widdowhood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerved in the North part of the Nation, what ſort
of men they are that are Infomers, the moſt part of them are
either High-way-men, or ſuch as have been a raigned for <hi>Fellony,</hi> or
