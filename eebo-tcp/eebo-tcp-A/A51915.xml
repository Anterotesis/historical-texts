         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

our King, Men of <hi>Belial,</hi> like <hi>Judas,</hi> selling their
Master, and in this at least more wicked than
He, in that they were guilty of far greater Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.
But tho men have committed these and
much greater Abominations, yet they are angry,
if they be not styled the Godly Party. They must
still be believed to have tender Consciences, tho
they have been found harder than Adamants, far
more bloody and cruel than ever <hi>Scythia</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
Tender Consciences indeed! that could
stretch and comply with all Interests besides that
of Loyalty and the true Religion. So tender are
they, that they must not be touched tho with
the most wholesome and seasonable Reproofs.
Men in these days are come to such a height
of wickedness,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 26. Am I become your enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I tell you the truth?</note> that if you tell them the truth,
you must be accounted their enemy; and tho

pass for a Railer, and perchance for a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

her Chaplains not only to mind her of her evils,
but also of the very appearances of evil too?

the madness and phrensie of the Patient, tho it
may possibly make the Physitian more<note n="*" place="margin">Intemperans aeger crudelem facit medicom.</note> cruel,
ought not to hinder his charitable assistance:
It were no less than cruelty at such a time to
please and humor the sick party; and in such
desperate Maladies, we know it is the height of
kindness to be cruel. And sure if we may at
any time be allowed to speak, we should most
of all on such occasions as these. The dumb

And can we remember the Martyrdom of our
late Gracious Soveraign, the unheard of indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that were heap'd upon Sacred Majesty, and
not express our Just and Loyal indignation?
Though an Act of Indemnity may be allowed

We must also wash the paint from off the face

I. Let us reflect a little upon the occasion of
these words. About the middle of this Chapter
we find a poor Levite travelling with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine
from <hi>Bethlebem Judah</hi> towards the side of
Mount <hi>Ephraim.</hi> He was now got as far on his
Journy as <hi>Gibeah,</hi> one of the Cities of the Levites.
And here, if any where, this poor I evite, one
would think, might have promised himself kind
entertainment. But alas! the poor m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<note n="*" place="margin">Ver. 15.</note> is
forced to sit down in the streets of the City; for
no man offered to receive him into his House.
It seems the World at that time afforded no<note n="†" place="margin">Vide Bocha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Inns; and at barbarous <hi>Gibeah</hi> no Hospitality is
to be expected; no good <hi>Abraham</hi> to be found
sitting at the door of his Tent, that he might
espy poor wayfaring men, and invite them to
his House. But at last<note n="x" place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> behold there came an
Old man from his work out of the field at Even,
who was also of Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and sojourned
only at <hi>Gibeah,</hi> and he took pitty on these Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.
Where by the way two reasons are
remarkable, why this Old man shews more
kindness to these strangers than the rest of the
City.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because he was an honest man, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by his painful Labour, though he was now


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95934:7"/>
Old; whereas the rest of the City were<note n="*" place="margin">Otia si tollas, periere Cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis arcus.</note> idle
and Luxurious, and more at leisure to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and wicked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because he was also of Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
and but a Sojourner at <hi>Gibeah;</hi> by reason of his
little stay at this place, he had not yet been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with their wickedness; and being Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man
to the <hi>Levite,</hi> he shews him more
compassion in this day of his distress: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
therefore the <hi>Levite</hi> and his Concubine to
his House, and provides a Lodging, and all
things necessary for them. But they are no
sooner got into the Old man's House; but the
men of the City, Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> beset it round,
beat at the door, and demand the strangers.
They had before it seems espyed them in the
streets; and had been all this while making a
party, and entring into a League &amp; Combination
to commit some Villany upon these passengers:
And when they had gathered such a strength,
and made such a body as was able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
their wicked design; we find the <hi>Levites</hi>
Concubine barbarously Murther'd. <hi>v.</hi> 26. And
in the words foregoing my Text, her body is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into Twelve pieces, and sent into all the
Coasts of <hi>Israel; And it was so, that all that saw
it, said, There was no such thing done or seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

in Israel; consider of it, take advice, and speak

the occasion of the words, I proceed now to
the</p>
               <p n="2">II. Particular, which was to shew how they
may be accommodated to the present Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Though I dare not pretend so much skill
in Holy Writ, as that I am able to suit a Text of
Scripture, exactly to every Text of Providence.
Though I am not able with some of our<note n="*" place="margin">

the great ones of the Nation, marked out and

boldly affirm, that, excepting only the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion
of our Saviour; there is not any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
recorded in the Bible, that can parallel this
days Murther. And though the Text I have
chosen run as high or higher than any I know;
yet upon serious examination we shall find it
fall short of this days Tragedy; and that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we consider the Prologue, or preparations
to it, or the Catastrophe and horrid fact it self.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider the Prologue and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that were used to accomplish this horrid
design. The Text as you have heard, presents


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95934:8"/>
us with Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> making parties and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into bodies to perpetrate their wickedness.
And does not this day present us with combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of a far more direful Nature and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence?
with men entring into Solemn Leagues
and Covenants; and binding themselves by the
most Sacred Oaths, to accomplish a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
far more abominable than any thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
at this time by these Monsters of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah?</hi>
as will be made clearer than the Sun, by
these following considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us consider what it was these men
Covenanted and Combined to do, even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy

                  <hi>Falkland,</hi> tho

right to his own Learning and Conscience, as to
declare in the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> That we have
the same Universal uninterrupted tradition for
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> that we have for the Sacred Oracles
of the Bible. I have the rather insisted on this
Argument drawn from Tradition, because the

this time in his Prison; we had not needed so
many tears to wash away the stain of this Day's


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95934:9"/>
guilt. Since therefore <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is warranted
by Scripture, confirmed by Councils, owned by
so many Confessors and Martyrs, and, which is
more, sealed by the bloud of this Days Martyr,
who as he lived so he dyed a Defender of this
Faith, I think I may without offence take up the
words of the Judicious <hi>Calvin,</hi> which use not at
other times to be ungrateful to our Adversaries,
<hi>Nullo</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Having premised these things in favour of
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> if we now reflect a little upon the
Text, we shall find the Covenanters of <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
much out-strip'd by the Covenanters of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi>
and these Monsters of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> as great as

than the men of <hi>Israel</hi> had to use the words of

thing done or seen in Israel as we have seen done this
day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us consider the Circumstances both
Parties lay under, and we shall find the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Text much out-done by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the day. <hi>Episcopacy</hi> had not only flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in the Church of God for so many Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies
as you have heard, but was also establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Kingdom by no fewer than<note n="f" place="margin">Ibia.</note> Thirty
two Acts of Parliament, so that none of these
Covenanters who were of any note, whether
Clergy or Laity, but stood obliged by many
Oaths to maintain that Form of Government,
which was thus established by the Laws of the
Land. To enter therefore into a League, and
solemnly conspire the overthrow thereof, must
render them guilty of horrid perjury. A Sin so
hainous in it self, as that it puts a cheat both on


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95934:10"/>
God and Man, and therefore was antiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

has threaten'd as many <hi>Woes,</hi> as his flying Roll
could contain, against such as swear falsly<note n="c" place="margin">Zach. 5 4.</note> by
the Name of the Lord. And I the rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Sin of Perjury as matter of this Dayes
Lamentation, because our late Gratious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
thought fit to brand the Covenant by
Proclamation for a Traiterous and Seditious
Combination, and that not only against his
own most Royal Person, but also against the
Established Religion and Laws of the Realm.
But these men who could act quite contrary to
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> who could make themselves
Popes, and dispence with their own Oaths, knew
also how to despise the express Commands of a
Royal Proclamation. Nay to such a degree of
Impudence did these furious zealots at last ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
as to term his Majesties Proclamation<note n="d" place="margin">Jo. Vicar's <hi>Gods Ark.</hi> p. 91.</note> a
Satanical Slander, a most impious and audacious
Paper, Atheistical boldness, impious and Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
pleasure. Thus these bold Rebels more
wicked than the barbarous <hi>Scythians,</hi> did <hi>contor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
peccata, twist sin with sin,</hi> till at last they made


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95934:10"/>
the Sin of this Day thicker than the largest Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
And sure the men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> must now
yield the right hand of fellowship to these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Rebels; for they had<note n="e" place="margin">Judg. 19. 1.</note> at this time no
King in <hi>Israel</hi> whom they could contemn, no
Royal Proclamations to withstand, no Oaths of
Allegiance, Supremacy, or Canonical obedience
to violate; and therefore we have too much
cause to take up the words of the Text, and say,
that <hi>There was no such thing done or seen in Israel, as
we have seen done this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider that their black and bloudy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
were varnish'd with the colours of Piety
and Religion, and we shall find the men of
<hi>Gibeah</hi> much out-done by the Villains of this
Day. It is the highest degree of Hellish Policy
to make Religion a stalking horse for Rebellion:
and intitle Heaven to all the wickedness we
design. <q>You may never expect (saith our

<hi>Wales.</hi>
                     </note> Blessed Martyr to his Son) less of Loyalty,
Justice and Humanity, than from those that
ingage in a religious Rebellion; their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is alwayes made God's under the colour of
Piety. Ambitious Policies do thus march not
only with greatest security, but also applause
as to the popularity. You may hear from
them <hi>Jacob</hi>'s voice, but you shall find at last


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95934:11"/>
they have <hi>Esau</hi>'s hands.</q> Thus <hi>Absolom</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a solemn<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 7, 10.</note> Vow at <hi>Hebron,</hi> when he
raised Rebellion against the King his Father.
Thus<note n="c" place="margin">2 Kings. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Jehu</hi> destroys <hi>Ahab</hi>'s posterity out of a
counterfeit zeal for the glory of God, while he
intended chiefly the Establishment of his Throne.
These holy Cheats may seem the original of our
late hypocritical Transactions: For we have
known men, that carried the hearts of <hi>Jews,</hi> and
the demure looks of <hi>Pharisees; Their language was
smoother</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Psalm 55. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>than butter, but war was in their hearts:
their words were softer than oil, and yet were they
drawn swords.</hi> What more pretended than a
glorious Reformation, when nothing intended
but the subversion of the Church? They stamped
on their Coin, <hi>God with us,</hi> while nothing but
Rebellion was stamped on their hearts. With
hands and eyes lift up to Heaven they sware to
defend the King and his Crown, and yet drew
Swords and shot hot Bullets against his Person.
But sure to swear thus with hands lift up to
Heaven, is without a metaphor to sin with a
high hand. The men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> wanted their
<hi>Machiavel</hi> to teach them these black Arts: they
durst not make so bold with an holy God, or
call down Heaven to be a vizor for Hell.<note n="e" place="margin">Judg. 19. 22.</note>
With blunt simplicity they come and demand


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95934:11"/>
the <hi>Levite,</hi> and tell their errand in plain terms,
that they designed to humble him. If they
must be Villains, Religion shall not share in the
shame: And though God will be judge, yet
they dare not make him a party in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
What now does hinder, but that since our
Covenanteers themselves have told us in the
<note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Church Hist.</note> Preface to their Covenant, that we read
not either in Divine or Humane Histories the
like Oath extant in any Age as to the matter,
persons, and other circumstances thereof; I say
what now does hinder, but that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
say after them in the words of my Text,
that <hi>There was never any such thing done or seen in
Israel, as we have seen done this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have heard the Prologue, and seen
the preparations that were made to carry on this
black design. I shall now proceed unto the
Catastrophe or horrid fact it self: and here we
shall find that the monstrous Rebels of this day
have not only out-done the men of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> but
have in some sort even out-done themselves.</p>
               <p>The Text and the Day do both present us
with the Sin of Murder: a sin indeed of the first
magnitude, such as raseth the very Image of
God, and stabs the Almighty as it were in Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.
This Sin derives its pedigree from cursed

ever was made since the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and has
put Heaven to the expence of more Miracles to
see it punisht, than all the Sins recorded in the
Bible. But as Murder in it self is no ordinary
Sin, so the Murder of the day is no ordinary
Murder, as will appear, if we consider</p>

He was a King, who, as he had the

the most Learned, and of all Learned Men


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95934:12"/>
the most Noble. Thus excellent were his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Indowments, and not to be exceeded
but by those of his Morals. For he was more
Chast than <hi>Scipio,</hi> more Valiant than <hi>Caesar;</hi> nor
did he yield in Temperance to the severest
Stoick. He was so free from Tyranny, that he
never entertain'd jealousie; so far from severity,
as that he could imbrace the very basest of his
Subjects. His Justice, Clemency, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were great to such a proportion, that his
Subjects had no fairer Pattern to imitate, and
even Virtue her self might have been<note n="a" place="margin">Ex quo virtutem dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere virtu pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set. <hi>Beza in Epitaph. Amici.</hi>
                  </note> taught
by him. And as he was thus admirable for a
Man; so he was much more Excellent, if we
consider him as a Christian. His Graces like
his Person were truly Royal. He was like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
a Man after Gods own heart,</hi> wise like <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
and Patient like <hi>Job:</hi> For his Zeal he was
a <hi>Josias;</hi> a <hi>Moses</hi> for his Meekness: and tho
none deserved less to endure the Cross, yet none
knew better to wear it above the Crown. In
his Devotions he was constant, regular, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick:
In his Love to the Protestant Religion
so firm and valiant, as that he durst own it in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and dye its Martyr in <hi>England.</hi> He was
the truest Defender of the Faith, that ever sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Scepter; for when he could no longer


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95934:13"/>
support it by his Arms, he would assert it by his
Pen, and durst at last seal it with his Bloud. In
a word, he was a King, a Christian, nay more, a
Protestant, and perchance the very best of men.
And can we now find words enough to express
the horrours of this Hellish Murder? We should
in some sort seem guilty of it our selves, should
we think it but parallel to the Murder of the
Text. For these men of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> as wicked as they
were, slew no other than a private person, nay
one that was a<note n="b" place="margin">Judg. 19. 27.</note> Concubine, and who might
have seemed to have faln a just sacrifice to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
had Law and not Lust been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it. But we lament this day the Murder
of no private person, but a Prince: no Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
but a Martyr; nay one who trod so near
the Footsteps of his Saviour, that Providence
has been pleased to draw a more honourable
parallel, by appointing the Passion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
as the fittest Lessons for this Days Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And sure now we may boldly take up
the words of the Text, and say, that <hi>There was
no such thing done or seen in Israel, as we have seen
done this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider the persons that Murder'd him,
and we shall still find the wickedness of the day
much surpassing the wickedness of the Text.


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95934:13"/>
The Text and the Day run parallel indeed thus
far, that they were both private persons that
committed these Murders, they had no power
of life or death, but usurped that<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 12. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 4.</note> vengeance
whose execution belongs only to God and his
Vicegerents. But tho they run parallel thus
far, as to other Circumstances they are vastly
different. For the Men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> murder only a
Stranger, one that was at most but their Equal,
and to whom they stood obliged by no bonds of
Religion, Gratitude or Subjection: But the
Bloudy Murderers of this Day slew no Stranger,
but the Father of their Country: not their Equal
but their Superior; nay one who had clothed
them with Scarlet and other delights: one who
had put ornaments of Gold upon their apparel,
and whom by many Oaths, even by their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant, they were bound
to defend. For Subjects therefore who stood
obliged by all these Circumstances of Religion,
Gratitude and Subjection, to imbrue their hands
in the Bloud of their Soveraign, makes the Sin
of this Day a Crimson and a Scarlet Sin. They
can expect no City of Refuge, the Horns of the
Altar will push away these Parricides. There is
therefore a vast difference between the Text and
the Day; so great indeed, that if the men of


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95934:14"/>
                  <hi>Gibeah,</hi> like <hi>Cain</hi> deserve to be avenged seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
these of this Day like <hi>Lamech,</hi> truly seventy
and seven fold, nay more, in as much as we are
told that <hi>the Life of a King is more worth than Ten
thousand of his Subjects.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> We may therefore claim
a right to the words of the Text and say, <hi>There
was never any such thing done or seen in Israel, as we
have seen done this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us consider the manner of this Bloudy
Murder, and we shall still find the wickedness
of the Day surpassing the wickedness of the
Text. The men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> committed their
Murder in a secret corner of the World, they
chose also the silence and darkness of the<note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 19. 22.</note>
night: But this was a publick Tragedy, the Sun
and the World were made spectators of their
audacious Villany. Here was no less than a
Pageantry of Justice, a High Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with all its Formalities erected; as if it had
not been enough to have abused the name of
Religion before, but the name of Justice too
must suffer with their King. Many Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have dyed by the Sword, the Dagger, and
the Pistol, many by Poisons and other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of clandestine revenge. But never any
did thus mock God, defie Heaven, and stain the
very light of the Sun, whilst they kill their


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95934:14"/>
King by the Executioner's Ax, upon a publick
Scaffold, and in the front of that Palace, where
he used to give audience to the greatest Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours.
By such aggravations of villainous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
as these the Rebels of this Day do not
only surpass the Monsters of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> but all the
<hi>Fauxes</hi> and <hi>Ravilliac's</hi> in the World, and commit
snch a thing as <hi>was never done or seen in Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one Circumstance still remaining in
the Text, which must be dispatched before I
come to Application, and it is the <hi>Levite</hi>'s divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the carkass of his Concubine, and sending
her by piece-meal to the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi>
a Barbarous Act indeed, as being against

which have always commanded due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and respect to be performed to the Bodies
of the dead. But in this dreadful Circumstance
too we shall find the Wickedness of the Text
exceeded by the Villany of the Day. It was
not enough for the Miscreants of this Day to
offer all these Indignities we have heard, to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Innocent Majesty: but their rage does
prove more cruel than death: these Vipers tear
in pieces the very Bowels of their Prince, and
make the Carkass of their Soveraign sensible of
their fury. But alas, their <hi>Lyncean</hi> Malice found


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95934:15"/>
not the least tincture of any noysome Disease,
his Body was pure and innocent as Heaven, and
fit to be the Mansion of so chast a Soul. Had
the inhumane Tyrant, who made the search,
been but half so chast himself, his carkass had
never stunk almost as bad as does his memory, it
had not killed those Physitians that imbalm'd it;
and if the Spices of <hi>Arabia</hi> had not prevented far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mischief, the noysome vapours of his body
had perhaps committed as many Murders as his
Sword. But this their unparallel'd Wickedness
does far exceed the wickedness of the Text. For
the <hi>Levite</hi>'s action, though Barbarous in it self,
was capable of excuse from its intended design:
This horrid<note n="†" place="margin">Segnius irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant animos demissa per aurem quam quae sunt oculis sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecta fidelibus. <hi>Horat.</hi>
                  </note> Spectacle was prepared chiefly
to incense the wrath of the Tribes, not so much
to the dishonour of his Concubine, as to raise
the spirits of the <hi>Israelites</hi> to revenge her death.
But these Prodigies of wickedness intended only
to expose Innocent Majesty, to murder his good
Name, as well as his Person, and by an unheard
of piece of Cruelty destroy the Saint as well as
the King. And since these things are so, if we
now have any breath left that is not wholly
stopt by grief and sorrow, we cannot but cry
out in the words of the Text, that <hi>There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any such thing done or seen in Israel, as we have


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95934:15"/>
seen done this day.</hi> And thus I have dispatched

from this Days Barbarous and Bloudy Regicide.
For let the Papists wipe their mouths as clean

in his<note n="c" place="margin">See the Kings Works.</note> Answer to the Parliament, That there
