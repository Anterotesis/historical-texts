            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A zealous Cobler did neare Morefields dwell:</l>
               <l>A holy Brother of the Separation,</l>
               <l>A sanctified member by Vocation.</l>
               <l>One that did place his principall delight,</l>
               <l>To set such as doe walke aside, upright,</l>
               <l>To mend bad Soales, and such as go astray,</l>
               <l>Discreetly to support, and underlay.</l>
               <l>This Reverend translating Brother (HOW)</l>
               <l>Puts both his hands unto the spirituall Plow;</l>
               <l>And at the Nags head, neare to Coleman-streete,</l>
               <l>A most pure crew of Brethren there did meete,</l>
               <l>Where their devotion was so strong and ample,</l>
               <l>to turne a sinfull Taverne to a Temple,</l>
               <l>They banish'd Bacchus thence, and some smal space</l>
               <l>The drawers and the Bar-boy had some grace.</l>
               <l>There were above a hundred people there,</l>
               <l>With whom few understanders mingled were,</l>
               <l>Who came to heare the learned Cobler HOW,</l>
               <l>And how he preach'd, pray mark, Ile tell you now:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:111692:6"/>
He did addresse himselfe in such a fashion</l>
               <l>As well befitted such a Congregation.</l>
               <l>He made some faces, with his hands erected,</l>
               <l>His eyes (most whitest white) to heaven directed:</l>
               <l>His hum, his stroking of his beard, his spitting,</l>
               <l>His postures, and impostures done most fitting.</l>
               <l>A long three quarters prayer being said,</l>
               <l>(The good man knowing scarce for what he prai'd)</l>
               <l>For where his speech lack'd either sence or weight,</l>
               <l>He made it up in measure and conceit.</l>
               <l>A worthy Brother gave the Text, and than</l>
               <l>The Cobler (How) his preachment strait began</l>
               <l>Extemp'ry without any meditation,</l>
               <l>But only by the Spirits revelation,</l>
               <l>He went through-stitch, now hither, &amp; now thither,</l>
               <l>And tooke great paines to draw both ends together:</l>
               <l>For (like a man inspir'd from Amsterdam)</l>
               <l>He scorn'd <hi>Ne su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or ultra crepidam;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Text he clouted, and his Sermon welted,</l>
               <l>His audience (with devotion) almost melted,</l>
               <l>His speech was neither studied, chew'd or champ'd,</l>
               <l>Or ruminated, but most neatly vamp'd.</l>
               <l>He ran beyond his latchet I assure ye,</l>
               <l>As nimble as a Fairie, or a Furie:</l>
               <l>He fell couragiously upon the Beast,</l>
               <l>And very daintily the Text did wrest;</l>
               <l>His audience wondred what strange powerdid guide him,</l>
               <l>'Tis thought no man can do the like beside him.</l>
               <l>Yet some there were, whose censures were more quicker,</l>
               <l>Said Calveskin doctrin would hold out no liquor.</l>
               <l>'Gainst Schooles, and learning he exclaim'd amain,</l>
               <l>Tongues, Science, Logick, Rhetorick, all are vain,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:111692:7"/>
And wisdome much unfitting for a Preacher,</l>
               <l>Because the Spirit is the only teacher.</l>
               <l>For Christ chose not the Rabines of the Jewes,</l>
               <l>No Doctors, Scribes, or Pharisees did chuse:</l>
               <l>The poore unlearned simple Fisherman,</l>
               <l>The poling, strict tole-gathering Publican,</l>
               <l>Tent-makers, and poore men of meane desart,</l>
               <l>Such as knew no degrees, or grounds of Art;</l>
               <l>And God still being God (as he was then)</l>
               <l>Still gives his Spirit to unlearned men,</l>
               <l>Such as are Barbers, Mealmen, Brewers, Bakers,</l>
               <l>Religious Sowgelders, and Button-makers,</l>
               <l>Coopers, and Coblers, Tinkers, Pedlers, Weavers,</l>
               <l>And Chimney sweepers, by whose good endeavours</l>
               <l>The flock may fructifie, encrease, and breed</l>
               <l>In sanctity, that from them may proceed</l>
               <l>Whole multitudes of such a generation,</l>
               <l>As may hold learning in small estimation.</l>
               <l>The Latine is the language of the Beast,</l>
               <l>Of Romes great Beast, that doth the world molest;</l>
               <l>Besides the Bishops speake it when they will,</l>
               <l>And all the Preachers babble Latine still;</l>
               <l>Then since it is the Romish tongue, therefore</l>
               <l>Let us that doe not Antichrist adore,</l>
               <l>Leave it to Lawyers, Gentlemen, and such</l>

               <l>THis was the very summe, the root, and pith,</l>
               <l>The Coblers Lecture was full furnish'd with:</l>

               <l>He blest his Brethren, and came to his Laste.</l>
               <l>And in some points, the Coblers case is cleare,</l>
               <l>Christ chose not learned men when he was here,</l>
               <l>Not Masters, or expounders of the Law,</l>
               <l>(For he knew all things, and all things foresaw)</l>
               <l>For had he chose great men of wealth &amp; arts, (harts)</l>
               <l>The Jewes (with slanderous tongues and hardened</l>
               <l>Would then have said that what he did, or said</l>
               <l>Was done by their assistance, and their aide.</l>
               <l>He therefore chose poore men in meanes &amp; tongue,</l>
               <l>That by weak means he might confound the strong.</l>
               <l>Yet this is certain, that at Pentecost,</l>
               <l>(When on th' Apostles fell the holy Ghost)</l>
               <l>Each of them spake, each severall language then,</l>
               <l>And were, and ne're shall be such learned men.</l>
               <l>Not all the Universities that are,</l>
               <l>Or were, or will be, with them may compare,</l>
               <l>For never Bishops, or Divines inferiours,</l>
               <l>But did acknowledge them for their superiours</l>
               <l>For sanctity, and working Miracles,</l>

               <l>And that the Spirits mighty operation</l>
               <l>Gave them the language of each severall Nation:</l>
