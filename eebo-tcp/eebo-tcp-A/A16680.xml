            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this fearfull fall, if thou
wilt but doe so much as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent thee of thy sinnes
committed, and henceforth
abstaine from those sinnes
whereof thou hast repented.
For I, most tender in my

out of meere love descended
from the royall Throne of

all which I willingly suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to the end that I might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thee from the eternall
torments of hell, and bestow
on thee the joy of Heaven.
Doubt nothing therefore
touching thine offences: I
will forget them all, so thou
forget thine evill affection,
and depraved custome. I
will forget, (I say) and blot
out thine iniquity, and as
farre distant as the East is
from the West, so farre will I
divide thee from thy sinne: I
will cleanse thee: Neither
will I cease till I fulfill thee
throughout: that, <hi>Where sin
hath abounded, grace likewise
may superabound.</hi> Yet I would

was my will to sweat blood

with sensible signes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale

For to this end have I suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <p>Surely most worthy art

and none <hi>good</hi> but <hi>God alone:</hi>
And because thou art the

And because thou <hi>art

none forgiveth but <hi>God alone:</hi>

<hi>I love those that love mee:</hi>

And because thou hearest

heare mee.</hi> Thou also, as the
peace of charity, comming
into the world, to warme
and inflame the cold and

that they might have life:</hi> to

is hee, in whose heart
the fire of love is not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
when hee considereth
these things, wherein the
Charity of God hath chiefly
appeared. But, ô thou only
begotten of God, suffer not
my heart to bee so frozen, or
benummed with this icy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation,
but rather through
thy mercy, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of these thy Words,
like Snow melting by the
heat of the Sunne, let me say
with that princely Prophet:
<hi>My heart is become as melting

                  <p>Humane impiety before
the time of my passion, tooke
occasion of being unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6451:16"/>
For man being created,
but not as then redeemed,
said, <q>I am no more bound

be: For he spake the

hath bestowed no more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
on me than any other
brute creature.</q> But now
the mouth of these that speak
wickedly is stopped, and no
place now is left for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse.
For I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
more in the sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of man, than in
the whole frame and fabrick
of the World. For of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

that I might enjoy that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,

recount unto me, I beseech
thee, the reasons which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that most dolorous paine
in thy most holy soule. For
thou saidst, right now, that in
the wombe of thy blessed
Mother, thou receivedst the
Crosse of thy Passion, and
bore it continually to the
houre of thy dissolution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
                  <p>To this end, that thou
mightst by affection &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
become an acceptable
sacrifice unto God, wholly
inflamed with the fire of
Charity, all the rust and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
of sin being consumed,
and wasted: Consider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
with a lively heart,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6451:18"/>
how I suffred a double Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome;
one in my body,
another in my soule or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
As touching the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi>
of my <hi>Body</hi> consider,
that there was never the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of any martyr so sharp,
so painfull, that it might be
compared with my suffering:
which I will prove unto
thee, by authority, by signe,
by reason. First, by <hi>authority.</hi>
For I my selfe crying out of
the greatnesse of my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
said, <hi>O all yee, who
passe by this way, consider and
see, if ever there were sorrow like
unto my sorrow!</hi> as if I should
have said, there was never
any.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by <hi>Signe;</hi> Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as there were never so
many Signes seene in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6451:18"/>
Martyrdome of any, as at my
Passion, implying the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and painfulnesse of it:
to wit, When the Sunne was
darkned, the Earth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
&amp;c. As if by the dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
clamours of my passion
they had conceived a sense
of devout compassion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
me the Son of God,
hanging on the Crosse. For
it was not in the creature to
indure the injury done to
the Creatour. Wherein
wicked and obdurate hearts
are justly reproved, who will
not be wrought to compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor softned with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
devotion, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I prove unto
thee the bitternesse of my
passion by <hi>reason.</hi> Forasmuch
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6451:19"/>
as my complexion was most
excellent, both by reason of
the incorruption of my flesh,
as also by reason ofthe most
proportionable union or
mixture of the Elementary
qualities. For I tooke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
flesh of the Virgin,
for the freeing of all Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sinne, that is, of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
concupiscence. Now to
such a complexion, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
comelinesse of beauty,
and strength of body. Because
therefore, by how much
more proportionable the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is of those Elements
and qualities, whereof man
is composed and compacted:
by so much more difficulty,
and violently is he dissolved:
hence it appeareth, that the
separation of my body and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6451:19"/>
soule was more painfull,
than the death of others. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
my blessed flesh, by how
much more it was freer from
all spot or blemish of sin: by
so much also it became more

my Soule (as I said before
unto thee) it began at such
time as I was first conceived
in the wombe of my mother,
or that my Soule was infused
into my body: and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
without intermission
33. yeeres and a halfe, till
such time as my Soule was
separated from my body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Crosse. So as, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Martyr even in the
Wombe of my Mother.
Wherfore I was not so much
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6451:20"/>
as one moment, without
the most bitter martyrdome
of my Spirit: Because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
I suffered in the Night
when I was taken, or the
Day following when I was
slaine, in mocking, reviling,
spitting, nayling, and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Crosse, &amp;c.
This throughly and wholly
my most holy Soule long
before suffered. But thou art
especially to consider, that
those dolorous piercing
darts of the Virgin, my
blessed mother, became the
excessivest Object of my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
who having a tender
and respective eye to all my
dolours, in perfect Charity,
as became the condition of
her motherly excellency, so
much grieved for my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6451:20"/>
as was sitting for such
a woman to grieve. And all
the sorrowes of my Mother,
continually wounded my
mind. So as, my Mothers
Crosse ministred unto mee a
new Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Another Object of my
continuall sorrow, was all
those martyrdomes which
were at any time done, or to
bee done upon any of mine
Elect for me. So as, in very
truth I say unto thee, that all
those paines, griefes, tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
persecutions, and
miseries, which any man was
to suffer, or should suffer as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
in body, as in soule,
from <hi>Adam,</hi> even to the very
last man, that shall bee borne
to the end of the World: all
these I suffered alwayes in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6451:21"/>
my Soule must fully, and
through my compassion
they did more hurt me, and
more sharply grieve me, than
any mans corporall paine,
which hee actually suffereth,
ever personally did. And
there are two causes which
give sufficient testimony of
the truth hereof. One is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I, in the glasse or mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of my Divinity did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
all things created and
to bee created, things past,
present, and to come, which
were to me present. And I,
from the very first instant of
the infusion of my Soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Body, began alwayes
to observe, till such time as I
gave up my Ghost upon the
Crosse, all the paines which
I was to endure, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6451:21"/>
all my Elect from the
beginning of the world, had
at any time suffered, and such
as being not yet borne, were
to suffer, even to the end of
the world: all this I suffered
in the inferiour faculties of
my Soule. And in each of
these was I more inwardly
and grievously tormented in
my Spirit, than any one
could be in his owne proper
body, at such time as hee is
to suffer tortures or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Another cause which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
so great paine in my
Spirit, was abundant love.
For love begetteth griefe and
heavinesse in the spirit: So
as, by how much thy love
towards me was more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
or greater, by so much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6451:22"/>
more is thy soule tormented
with my Death and Passion.
And because I have alwaies
and above comparison loved
thee, and every man, more
than hee can love himselfe,
therefore have I suffered
greater paine than all that
which any one hath ever suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
upon earth, or was to
suffer, or shall suffer to the
end of the world. Thou
knowest, that when <hi>Paul</hi> had
consented to the death and
stoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and did
persecute Christians, I said
unto him, <hi>Saul, Why persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
thou me?</hi> And yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
not me in my owne
proper person, but in the
persons of my beloved
friends; because what good
or evill soever befalleth my
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6451:22"/>
friends, befalle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h me. And
this proceedeth from the
great love which I beare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men. Thus therefore
maist thou consider, how
and by what meanes my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
exceeded in paine the
passions of all that ever suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or shall suffer, because I
suffered both in my Body
and Soule, and that immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
and by nature delicate,
and for so long time, to wit,
for thirty foure yeeres did I
suffer martyrdom in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
both for my selfe and all
my Elect. <hi>Laurence</hi> in one
night was broyled on a grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron;
<hi>Bartholomew</hi> in one day
was slaine; <hi>Katherine</hi> in one
houre was broken on a
Wheele, &amp;c. All these tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
never hurt any one of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6451:23"/>
them so much in their owne
bodies, as they tormented me
in my Soule, for thirty foure
yeeres. Whence <hi>Isay, Truly
he hath suffered for our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and borne our sorrowes.</hi>
And therefore, I could never
laugh, but often weepe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
as one of forty
yeeres, when I was scarce
thirty. Which came to passe,
by reason of the continuall
Justice, which I incessantly
bore for my Passion that was
to come, and the suffering of
my Elect, which I alwaies
clearly beheld, and painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffered by strength of
imagination. Whereupon I
oftimes said unto my Father,
<hi>Many are my grones: and my
heart is sorrowfull.</hi> To thee
likewise doe I say, that thou
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6451:23"/>
maist bee moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and affection towards
mee, that <hi>my life is waxen old
with heavinesse, and my yeeres
with mourning.</hi>

                  <p>Surely, O my good Jesu,
as I have heard and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
no conceit can suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
apprehend the depth
of those anguishes and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
of thy most holy
Soule, nor griefes and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thy Body. But a very
deepe question doth trouble
my mind, to wit, how heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
paine, or anguish could
befall thy blessed soule, seeing
it was alwaies in great joy
through Contemplation of
thy Divinitie, which was so
amiable to behold, that if the
damned in Hell could but
behold the amiable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6451:24"/>
of God, as the blessed
Spirits doe in the Kingdome
of Heaven; they could bee
tormented by no griefe, nor
heavinesse, either by the fire
of hell, or sight of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in hell.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, that my pure
and blessed soule was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
albeit my Body was
mortall. For my Soule, from
the very instant of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and ever after, even
when I was upon the Crosse,
was as<note n="*" place="margin">O Sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Secret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of us no curious discussion, but serious devotion!</note> glorious, and in as
great joy and delight, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of her <hi>superiour faculties,</hi>
as she is at this day in heaven,
sitting at the right hand of
God my Father. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of her <hi>inferiour faculties,</hi>
she was in a continuall and
incessant heavinesse, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6451:24"/>
for the causes aforesaid.
Which could not bee by
course or order of Nature,
that in one and the selfe-same
soule together, and at once,
there should be so great joy,
and so great heavinesse, for
this was miraculous and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall.
Because, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of nature,
joy and delight doe expell
sorrow and griefe, so as they
cannot suffer together in
one and the selfe-same soule.
And to the end, thou maist
more clearely understand
these things, I would have
thee to know, that the Source
and Fountaine of all my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
was that high and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable
<hi>divine dispensation,</hi>
whereby it was forbid mee,
that the influence of my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6451:25"/>
and fruition thereof,
which were in the <hi>superiour
faculties</hi> of my Soule, should
redound to the <hi>inferiour,</hi> for
otherwise shee had felt no
sorrow. But because this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
was by the <hi>divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation</hi>
prohibited mee,
therefore did I at once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enjoy all joy, according
to the <hi>Superiour faculties,</hi> and
perfectly suffer and become
most vehemently afflicted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Inferiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</hi>
And thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
hath the power of my
Father, joyned anguish with
greatest sweetnesse, and
highest power with lowest
weaknesse. Because that
this influence prohibited me,
was altogether repugnant to
the course of Nature. For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6451:25"/>
naturall it is, and according
to the course of Nature, that
the <hi>Superiour powers</hi> or <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
redound to the <hi>inferiour,</hi>
and the <hi>Inferiour</hi> have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in the <hi>Superiour.</hi> And
by how much this <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
was more wonderfull, by
so much was my sorrow
more sharpe and dolefull.
Thou art to know also, that
I kept my naturall strength
during my Passion, even to
the point of death. Whereby
it followeth, that my Passion
was more dolorous.</p>

rise againe by Obedience,
being humbled with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

                  <p>O good Jesu, vouchsafe
to bestow on my hearing a
fuller joy, by recounting to
mee thy most unworthy Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the rest of those bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and fruits, arising from
the dayly remembrance of thy
most holy Passion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
                  <p>The memory of my death,
by a dayly ruminating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
ought to burne upon the
altar of thy mind, for many
reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, because thou canst
doe nothing more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto mee, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
thine heart in my most
holy Passion, with love,
compassion, reverence, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6451:31"/>
imitation. Whereof thou
canst not doubt, being assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
thereof by many autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of holy Scripture.
Wherefore I doe advise thee
to stamp my painfull love,
and loving paine in thy
soule, and to be thankfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, saying:<note n="*" place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Signet with his Posie.</note> 
                     <hi>Set me, as a
signet, upon thine heart:</hi> As if
he should say, Love mee, as
I love thee. Remember
not onely how great things
I have done for thee, but
how sharpe and unworthy
things I have suffered for
thee, and see if thou doest
not give mee an ill requitall,
if thou doest not love mee.
For tell mee, who loves thee
as I doe? Who desireth to be
loved of thee, as I doe? <hi>Set
me,</hi> therefore, <hi>as a signet upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6451:31"/>
thine heart,</hi> that thou maist
love me with all thy strength:
upon thine <hi>arme,</hi> that thou
maist performe those things
which please mee with all
thine affection: upon thine
<hi>heart,</hi> that whatsoever is
deare unto thee, thou maist
set aside for me, and alwaies
preferre me, and alwaies more
and more love me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou oughtst
continually to remember my
Passion, because by it thou
art led by the hand to the
love of God. For by my
Passion, I have shewne to
thee the quantity of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
And love deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
love againe. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what I say; I would
not reedeme man with praier,
for so oft times man freeth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6451:32"/>
man from captivity. Nor
with the price of gold and
silver: for so sheep and Oxen
are bought: but with the
price of my bloud, that by the
price of the thing bought,
my love might bee weighed.
Do not therfore dis-esteeme
thy worth: consider oft
times thy price. If I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
man with gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
it might have beene
thought, that the soule of
man had beene comparable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to temporall riches. That
which is redeemed, is more
precious than that by which
it is redeemed: Therefore
the soule of man is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than my bloud.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or stirring of
devotion; Whence it was
that <hi>Sampson</hi> found an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neycombe</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:6451:32"/>
in the mouth of a
<hi>dead Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n.</hi> I am the <hi>Lion</hi> of
the Tribe of <hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> in whose
death the honeycombe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
is found, wherewith
the spirit of man is refreshed.
O that thou wouldst seriously
consider, how upon the
Crosse my mouth appeared
like one halfe-alive, open,
and my tongue bloudy;
surely, if thou hadst an heart
of iron, it would have melted
with compassion and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The fourth fruit arising
from the memory of my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is, that in it is found a
guard of defence against all
Enemies. Whereupon my
Apostle <hi>Peter; Christ suffered
for you, arme your selves likewise
with the same mind.</hi> And <hi>I say;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6451:33"/>
Enter into the rocke.</hi> As a
Souldier, who unable to
withstand his enemy in the
field, flyeth to his Tents.
Briefly, the<note n="*" place="margin">Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs Sacred Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit against Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Enemy shall
prevaile nothing against him,
whom the daily exercise of
my Passion doth delight.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is, because with
no exercise is man so much
enriched as with my merits,
applied to him, and made
his, by the hand of faith; for
the foundation of all grace,
and the root of merit, (as it
hath sole relation to me, and
derived to man by Faith in
me) consisteth in the sorrow
of heart and body, for my
Crosse. For this cause mine
Elect Apostle said; <hi>I have
esteemed my selfe to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but</hi> JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6451:33"/>
                     <hi>and him crucified.</hi> And that
devout sonne of my blessed
mother, <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie.</note> 
                     <hi>It is my
highest philosophy</hi> (said hee) <hi>to
know</hi> CRIST JESUS, <hi>and
him Crucified.</hi> But thou
oughtst to grieve, because
there are many enemies of my
Crosse. For the lovers of
pleasures are my persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours;
they are guilty of my
death, not as authors or
fautors, but as contemners
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> my death: These are they,
who make the merit of my
Passion in them of no effect;
who make themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of mine heavenly
blessing, &amp; unspeakable glory:
who living in their delights,
laugh at the mysterie of my
Passion; who tread mee the
Sonne of God under their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6451:34"/>
feet, and lay reproach upon
the Spirit of Grace. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life is an injury unto
God, contempt of my Crosse,
and redoundeth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely
of all the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                  <p>The sixt is, the allaying of
the labours and dolours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
man in his way of
repentance, and life of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For a devout faithfull
Souldier hath no feeling of
his owne wounds, when hee
seeth the wounds of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Captaine. And to this
end have I contemned all
earthly goods, that I might
shew how they were to bee
contemned: and sustained all
adverse things, that I might
teach how they were to bee
sustained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:6451:34"/>The seventh is, the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
of carnall desires:
for with the sight of my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
whatsoever is carnal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
decreaseth.</p>
                  <p>The eighth is, the stirring
of compunction and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for sinues. For who is
he that grieveth not highly,
when he recals to mind how
his sinnes were so odious to
God the Father, that for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them away, he would
have his beloved Sonne cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and put to death?</p>
                  <p>The ninth is, the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of good hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence:
For in my Crosse
the Sinner hath his Sanctuary,
as a murderer flying for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to the Church-yard.
Nothing is so bitter even
unto death, which may not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6451:35"/>
be cured by my death: I have
changed the sentence of thy
eternall punishment, into the
crucifying of my Body, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a dolorous languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For I, in that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which <hi>Pilat</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against me, taking upon
me, the person of all Sinners,
to purge their sins wherein
they had long laboured, was
adjudged to death for all
Sinners.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sinner.</speaker>
                  <p>I conceive and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
by this which thou
(my good Jesu) hast said,
that albeit this sentence
was very unjust, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
execrable in respect of
thee, because man had no
power over God, the wicked
over the just: yet in respect
of us, it was manifold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6451:35"/>
modious and profitable: and
the reason hereof is amiable
and venerable; because hee
wholly reversed that sentence
pronounced upon the first
man, for sinne. For the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a dolefull exclusion
was denounced against him.
Whence it is written, <hi>The
Lord cast out man from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
of pleasure, and set an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to keepe the way of the tree of
life.</hi> But happy and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
was thy sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> called back a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
man, for by this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
the <hi>Sonne</hi> for the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
was injuriously cast out
of his inheritance, by the
husbandmen of the Vineyard,
the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Therefore
thy Apostle saith, <hi>That</hi> Jesus
<hi>might sanctifie us, hee suffered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6451:36"/>
without the gate.</hi> And well it
was that he suffered without,
that he might bring us back
againe to within: <hi>for we have
entrance by his bloud.</hi> But I
beseech thee (most loving
Jesu) from the very inward
affection of mine heart, by
those paines, with which, as
with most sharp arrowes, thy
most sweet heart was pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and those of the Virgin
thy blessed Mother, at the
hearing of that sentence of
thycondemnation; that I may
deserve through thy merits,
to be delivered in the houre
of my death, and the last day
of judgement, from thatsharp
and terrible word of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of eternall damnation,
which thou wilt thunder
out against the reprobates:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6451:36"/>
                     <hi>Depart from me yee cursed into
everlasting fire, prepared for the
Devill and his angels.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
                  <p>Happy is he, from whose
memory the <hi>last judgement</hi>
never departeth, that by the
feare thereof, hee may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his life from naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and pleasure of the flesh.
For surely, that judgement
is highly to be feared, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all things are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
without witnesses, where
the Hoast of all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Saints shall stand
round about,<note place="margin">The terror of the last <hi>judgement.</hi>
                     </note> and every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shall tremble with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
feare, before my Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
seat. What will they
say then, who in this short
time have lived negligently
and carelesly? Meane time I
expect you patiently, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6451:37"/>
you all to my kingdome
lovingly. Time will come,
when I shall require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of you, for this your
negligence, and shall say unto
you, <q>For you am I made
crooked, for you (I say) am
I made crooked upon the
earth, for you am I scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for you with spittings
defiled, for you is my face
buffeted, for you am I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
condemned, for you
am I crucified, for you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wood am I hanged, with
gall am I fed, and with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar
quenched, that I
might make you all Saints
eternally crowned. I have
called you all my Brethren,
I have offered you to my
Father, I have sent you my
holy Spirit, I have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6451:37"/>
sed to you Paradise. What
should I have done more,
and I have not done it, that ye
might be saved? Tell me ye
Sinners: What have yee
suffered for me your gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who when I was just,
suffered so great things
for your sakes?</q> These truly
shall bee demands proper for

affection to all, to expresse
the love of his heart, by the

from thence to derive those
Sacraments which gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6451:41"/>
my <hi>Soule,</hi> deputed to the

those that lay this disgrace
on me, remembring him or
them more especially in her
prayer, who inferre these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
on me; and if none as
yet be done mee, shee desires
that hereafter they may bee

very highest pitch of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to see my sorrow with
new sorrow multiplied, that
my sorrow might bee more
sensibly conceived. This
seemes to bee her glorie to
bring injuries, contumelies,
and whatsoever is worst up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

time, it is her desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

There is shee joyed, there is

thou nearer than

Judgement, and
Eternity. Bethinke then with
thy selfe every day, how
thou maist stand in the severe
discussion of death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and how thou maist
eternally live. Thou art to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6451:48"/>
take an exact account of all
thy thoughts, words and
deeds, because an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is to be given of all thy
thoughts, words and deeds.
Thinke every evening, that
death is that night approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching:
Thinke every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that death is that day
accoasting. Deferre not thy
conversion, nor the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of any good action till
to morrow, because to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is uncertaine, but death
is ever certainly waiting.
There is nothing that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

If thou contemne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
calling of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
thou shalt never come to
true conversion. Doe not
defer thy conversion, nor the
practice of any religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to thy old age; but offer
unto God the flower of thy
youth: Uncertaine is old
age to the young, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
destruction attendeth
him that dieth impenitently
young. There is no Age
more fit for the service of
God, than youth, flourishing
in abilities both of body and
mind. For no mans sake
oughtst thou to take in hand
an evill action; for not that
man w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thou so respectedst,
but God in whose brest all
the treasures of wisdome
are stored, shall in the end
judge thy life: Doe not then
preferre any mans favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the honour of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.
In the way of the
Lord wee either increase or
decrease: Take examination
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:6451:49"/>
then of thy life every day,
whether in the practice of
piety thou increasest or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasest.
To <hi>stand</hi> in the
way of the Lord is to <hi>goe back.</hi>
Let it not then delight thee
to <hi>stand</hi> in the course of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but endevour alwaies to
<hi>walke</hi> in the way of the Lord.
In thy conversation bee
cheerefull to all, distastefull
to none, familiar to few:
Live to Godward devoutly,
to thy selfe chastly, to thy
Neighbour justly. Use thy
friend as a pledge of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thine enemy for a triall
of thy patience, all men to a
well-disposed benevolence,
and wherein thou maist
more effectually worke to
beneficence. While thou
livest, dye dayly to thy selfe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6451:49"/>
and to thy vices; So in thy
death maist thou live to God.
Let meekenesse appeare in
thy affection, mildnesse in
thy countenance, humility
in thy habit, modesty in thy
habitation, patience in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.
Let facility be in
thine accesse, decency in thy

affability in thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
benignity in thy

of those 3. things past,
Evil committed, Good omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

life, the difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
saved, the fewnesse of
those that are to be saved.
Think alwayes of these three
things to come, Death, than
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> nothing is more horrible;
Judgement, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more terrible; the
paine of Hell, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more intolerable. Let
thine Evening Prayers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the sinnes of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
day; let the last day of
the weeke reforme the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the dayes gone before.
Thinke in the Evening, how
many soules are that same day
thrown head-long into Hell;
and give thankes unto God,
for that hee hath given thee
time to repent in. There
be three things above thee,
which ought never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6451:50"/>
from thy memory: That
Eye which seeth all things,
that Eare which heareth all
things, and those bookes
wherein all things are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Wholly hath God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
himselfe to thee;
communicate thy selfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
wholly to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
That is the best life,
which is wholly employed
to the behoofe and benefit of
others. Render to thy su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
obedience and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to thy equall counsell
and assistance, to thy inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
succour &amp; supportance.
Let thy body be subjected to
thy mind, and thy mind to
God. Bewaile thy evils past,
disesteeme thy goods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
covet with all the desire
of thine heart those goods
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:6451:51"/>
to come. Remember thy sin,
that thou maist grieve: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy death, that thou
maist cease from sinne: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Gods justice, that
thou maist feare: Remember
Gods mercy, lest thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
Withdraw thy selfe
as much as thou canst, from
the World, and devote thy
selfe wholly to the service of
God: Thinke alwayes, how
chastity is endangerd by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,
humility by prosperity,
and piety by employments
transitory. Desire to please
none but Christ: feare to
displease none but Christ.
Beseech God alwayes, that as
he bids what he would, so he
would doe what hee bids:
that hee would protect what
is done, and direct in what
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:6451:51"/>
is to bee done: Endevour
thy selfe to bee what thou
wouldst have thy self thought
to be; for God judgeth not
according to the outward
semblance, but according to
the inward substance. In thy
discourse beware of much
speech, because account shall
be required of every vaine
word. Whatsoever thy
works bee, they passe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but as certaine seeds of
eternity, are they bestowed: if
thou sow according to the
flesh, from the flesh shalt thou
reape corruption: if thou
sow after the Spirit, from
the Spirit shalt thou reap
the reward of eternall retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.
After death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall the honours of this
World follow thee, nor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6451:52"/>
heaps of riches favour thee,
nor pleasures enjoy thee, nor
the vanities of this World
possesse thee, but after the
fatall and full period of this
life all thy works shall follow
thee. As then thou desirest to
appeare in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
appeare such in the
sight of God at this present.
Thinke not with thy selfe
what thou hast, but rather
what thou wantst: Pride
not thy selfe for that which
is given thee, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
humbled for that
which is deni'd thee. Learne
to live now while thou maist
live. In this time is eternall
life either got or lost. After
death there remains no time
for working, for then begins
the time of rewarding: In
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6451:52"/>
the life to come is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
any worke, but pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the worke. Holy
Meditation may beget in
thee knowledge, knowledge
compunction, compunction
devotion, devotion may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
prayer. Great good for
peace of the heart, is the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the mouth: By how
much more as thou art divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the World, so
much more acceptable art
thou unto God. Whatsoever
thou desirest to have, aske it
of God; whatsoever thou
already hast, attribute it to
God: He is not worthy to
receive more, who is not
thankfull for what he hath
received: Then stops the
course or current of Gods
grace to man, when man
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6451:53"/>
makes no recourse by thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to God: Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
befals thee, turne it to
good; so often as prosperity
comes upon thee, thinke
how occasion of blessing and
praising God is ministred
unto thee; againe so often
as adversity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ayles thee,
thinke how these are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
for the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and conversion of thee.
Shew the force of thy power
in helping, the force of thy
wisdome in instructing, the
force of thy wealth in relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Neither let Adversity
bruise thee, nor Prosperity
raise thee: Let Christ be thy
scope of thy life, whom thou
art to follow here in the
way, that thou maist come
to him there in thy countrey.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:6451:53"/>
Amongst all other things, let
profound humility, &amp; ardent
Charity be thy greatest care.
Let charity raise thine heart
unto God, that thou maist
cleave unto him: Let humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
depresse thine heart, les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thou becom proud &amp; so leave
him. Esteem God a Father for
his clemency, a Lord for his
discipline; a Father for his
sweet power, a Lord for his
severe power; Love him as a
Father devoutly, feare him as
a Lord necessarily: Love him
because he will have mercy:
Feare him, because he will not
suffer sin. Feare the Lord, and
trust in him; acknowledge thy
misery, and declare his mercy.

               </p>
               <p>We are then to <hi>thrist</hi> after
wisdome, to <hi>thirst</hi> after
righteousnesse. Nor shall
we be satisfied with this, nor
filled with that, till this our
fraile life shall be ended, and
we come to that which God
hath promised. For God
hath promised to make us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with the Angels. Now
the Angels <hi>thirst</hi> not as wee
doe, nor <hi>hunger</hi> as wee doe,
but partake of the food of
truth, the food of light of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6451:56"/>
immortall wisdome. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are they blessed: And
in so great blessednesse (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that heavenly City of
Hierusalem, from which we
are here as Aliens) they take
care of us poore pilgrims,
they commiserate us, and by
Gods appointment they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
us, that at last we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to our common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
&amp; there at last with them
be satisfied with that divine
fountaine of truth &amp; eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Wherefore let our <hi>Soule</hi>
now <hi>thirst,</hi> &amp; let our <hi>flesh</hi> also
<hi>thirst</hi> eagerly. Yea <hi>My flesh</hi>
(saith he) <hi>longeth after thee:</hi>
because to our flesh, is resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
promised by thee. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as blessednesse is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to our soule: so also is
resurrection promised to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6451:56"/>
our flesh. Such is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the flesh
which is promised unto us.
Heare, learne, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what may be the hope
of Christians. For what end
are we Christians? Not to
this end are wee Christians,
that we should seeke earthly
happinesse, which even
Theeves and malefactors oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
enjoy. No, wee are
Christians for another kind
of happinesse, which shall be
then by us received, when
this our transitory life shall
be ended. For this then is
the Ressurection of flesh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to us. And such is the
resurrection of flesh to us
promised, that this same flesh
which wee now carry about
us, may rise in the end, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6451:57"/>
retaine her incorruptible
glory without end. Neither
let this seeme incredible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, because you see the
dead falling to corruption,
and returning to dust and
ashes. Suppose that any
dead corpse should be burnt
to ashes, or that dogs should
teare it, doe you therefore
thinke that it shall not rise
againe? All these parts
which you see peecemeale di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and into small graines
of dust resolved, remaine all
whole with GOD; for into
them doe the Elements of
the world passe, from whence
they first came, when wee
were made: These wee doe
not see, yet wil God, when
he knowes his owne time,
produce them; who before
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:6451:57"/>
we were made, when his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
will was, produeed us
from them. Such Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the flesh is promised
to us, that, albeit this flesh
which we now carry, be the
same which shall rise again,
yet must it not have that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
which it now hath.
For now through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our frailty, if we
eat not, wee faint and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
if we drinke not, wee
faint and thirst sor water; if
we wake long, we faint and
fall a sleep; if we sleep long,
we faint and so awake; if we
eat and drinke long, albeit
we eat and drinke for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
yet doth this long
refection become a defection;
if wee stand long, wee are
weary, and therefore wee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6451:58"/>
fit; and if we fit long, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
wearied, and therefore
we rise. Then consider, how
there is no constant state in
our flesh: because our infancy
flyeth away into childhood,
and then if thou seeke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
there is no infancy,
because it is now child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which was even now
infancy. Againe, that child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
passeth into youth, and
then if thou seek childhood,
thou canst not find it. This
youth becomes a man; and
then if thou seeke that
youth, hee is not to bee
found. This man becomes
old: thou seekst a strong
man, and hee is not to
be found. And this old man
dyes: thou seekest an old
man, and hee is not to bee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:6451:58"/>
found. Our age then stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not, every where there
is wearinesse, every where te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnesse,
every where cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
Considering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what hope of resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
God promiseth unto
us; in these our manifold
defects, we <hi>thirst</hi> after that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
and so our <hi>flesh
longeth much after God.</hi> In this
<hi>Idumaea,</hi> in this wildernesse,
by how much she laboureth,
by so much more eagerly she
<hi>thirsteth;</hi> by how much she is
wearied, by so much shee
<hi>thirsteth</hi> after that infatigable
incorruption, for which she
was created. Albeit, my
Brethren, the flesh of every
good and faithfull Christian
in this World, <hi>thirsteth</hi> after
God. Because if his flesh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6451:59"/>
need bread, if it need water,
if it need wine, if it need
money, or what reliefe soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it need, he ought to beg
for these at the hands of
God, not from Devils and
Idols, or what other Powers
of this World, I know not.
There are who when they
suffer hunger in this World,
leave God, and call on <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>

if you can, understand
what is this <hi>it selfe.</hi> For even

What is then <hi>it selfe</hi> but that
which is? And what is this
which is? That which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
is. For whatsoever is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

altering from one to

it is abides not: Yet not so
as <hi>locally</hi> it is not, but <hi>summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi>
it is not. And what is
this which is, but hee, who

<hi>Thus shalt thou say unto the

I AM THAT I AM;</hi>
He who <hi>IS,</hi> hath sent mee
to you! But thou canst not
conceive it, it is farre from
thee to understand it, far from
thee to apprehend it. Retaine
therefore that which he was
made for thee, since to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him it is farre from
thee. Retaine the flesh of

and left halfe-dead by
Theeves wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, thou maist
be to an Inne conducted, and
cured. Let us then runne to
the house of the Lord, and
come to the City, where our
feet may stand in the gates;
that City which is <hi>builded as
a City, that is compact together
in it selfe. It selfe</hi> is this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 101.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art the same,
and thy yeares shall not faile.</hi>
Behold <hi>it selfe, Whose yeares
shall not faile!</hi> Brethren, doe
not our yeares daily faile and
fade in the yeare? For those
yeares which are come are
not now, and those which
are to come are not yet. Now
are these failed which are
come, and those shall faile
which are to come. Houres
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:6451:62"/>
past bee already gone, and
houres to passe are not yet
come, &amp; when they are come
they likewise shall passe, and
faile. What be those yeeres
which do not faile, but those
which stand? If yeares then
doe there stand, those yeares
which stand is one yeare; and
that one yeare which stands, is
one day: because that one
day hath neither rising nor
setting, neither begun from
yesterday, nor excluded from
to morrow, but standeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
the same day. And
whatsoever thou wilt, thou
maist call this day; if thou
wilt, they are yeares; if thou
wilt, it is a day: thinke what
thou wilt, yet it standeth.
For this City partakes of
stability, being <hi>compact toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6451:63"/>
in it selfe.</hi> Worthily then,
because it becomes partaker
of this stability, doth he say
who runneth thither; <hi>Our
feet were standing in thy Courts,
O Ierusalem.</hi> For all things
doe there stand, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
passeth: Wilt thou
then stand there, and not
passe? Runne thither. None
hath <hi>It selfe</hi> of himselfe. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Brethren: Hee hath a
<hi>body,</hi> but this is not <hi>it selfe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it stands not in it selfe.
It is changed by ages, it is
changed by removes of places
and times, it is changed by
corporall diseases and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
therefore it stands not
in itselfe. <hi>Heavenly bodies</hi> do
not stand in themselves, for
they have their certaine
changes, though secret: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:6451:63"/>
are these changed
from place to place, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from East to West, and
againe they goe about to the
East. These then doe not
stand, these are not <hi>It selfe.</hi>
Neither doth <hi>Mans Soule</hi>
stand itselfe. For with how
many alterations and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
is she varied, with what

from her selfe estranged, with
what desires infected and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested?

words:</head>

                  <q>Who hath set peace in thy

thy borders.</hi> How
much have yee all
rejoyced? Love
this, my Brethren. Wee
are much delighted, when
this love of <hi>Peace</hi> cryeth
from your hearts. How
much hath it delighted us?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6451:65"/>
Having as yet said nothing,
expounded nothing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounced this verse, <hi>yee
have even cryed out.</hi> And
what is it that hath cryed
from you? the love of <hi>peace:</hi>
what doth it present unto
your eyes? Whence doe
yee cry, if yee do not love?
Whence doe yee love, it yee
doe not see? <hi>Peace</hi> is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
Where is that Eye, by
which it is seene, that it may
be lov'd? Neither would it
be cryed upon, unlesse it
were lov'd. These are those
representments of invisible
things, which God exhibits
unto us. With what beautie
hath the conceit of <hi>Peace</hi> sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on your hearts? What
then shall I now speake of
<hi>Peace,</hi> or of the praise of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6451:65"/>
                  <hi>peace?</hi> Your affection pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth
all my words: I shall
not performe it, I am not
able to undergo it, I am too
weake to doe it. Let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
all our praises of <hi>peace</hi>
to that Countrey of <hi>peace.</hi>
There shall wee more fully
praise it, where wee shall
more fully possesse it. If wee
thus love <hi>peace</hi> begun in us,
how much shall we praise it
when perfected in us? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
this I say, my beloved
Children, Children of the
Kingdome, Citizens of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
because in <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
is the Vision of <hi>peace,</hi> and
all those who enjoy and love
<hi>peace</hi> are made blessed in it.
This, which ye so much love
and affect to heare named,
pursue it, desire it, love it in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6451:66"/>
your House, love it in your
Businesse, love it in your
Wives, love it in your
Children, love it in your
Servants, love it in your
Friends, love it in your
Enemies. This is that <hi>peace</hi>
which Heretiques have not.
Now what doth <hi>peace</hi> here
amidst the uncertainties of
this Region, in this Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of our mortality;
where, as yet, no one is
transparent to another, none

is good, not knowing

we so rashly judged. What

in every devout heart the

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6451:68"/>
of his Tract upon the 36. <hi>Psal.</hi>
Upon these words: <hi>Meeke

               <p>Upon which, with a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate

thus: This <hi>Earth,</hi> whereof
we have so often spoken, is
holy <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The <hi>Meeke</hi>
shall be delivered from this
their pilgrimage, and shall
live for ever with God, and
of God. Therefore shall
they <hi>possesse the Earth</hi> for an
inheritance. And what shall
their riches be? They shall
be <hi>delighted in the multitude of
peace.</hi> For the wicked, hee
may be delighted in the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
of Gold, in the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of Silver, in the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>

Wealth, of delicious Wines,
sumptuous and luxurious
Feasts. But admit, hee
should be alwayes stored, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in these suted, were
not his case to be lamented?
But what shall be thy riches,
what shall bee thy dainties?
<hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>peace:</hi> Thy
Gold shall bee <hi>peace,</hi> thy Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Whatsoever thou desirest
shall be to thee <hi>peace.</hi> That
which is here Gold, cannot
be unto thee Silver: That
which is Wine, cannot bee
unto thee Bread: That
which is unto thee Light,
cannot be drinke: whereas
thy God shall bee to thee

him, and never hunger:
Drinke him, and never

him, and never faile: Hee

wholly and entirely. Thou
shalt suffer there no extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for another: have him,
with whom thou shalt
possesse all: enjoy all, and
hee enjoy thee all, who is
all in all: because thou,

                  <q>His praise is above the

Heaven and in
Earth?</hi> Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he praiseth?
No, But because all things
praise him, all things cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6451:70"/>
to him: the beauty of all
things is in some sort the
voyce of those which praise
the Lord. The Heaven
cryeth to the Lord; Thou
hast made me, not I my selfe.
The Earth cryeth, Thou hast
fashioned me, not I my selfe.
How then doe these cry?
When thou consid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rest these
and findest this in these, out
of thy consideration they cry,
out of thy voyce they cry,
<hi>His praise is in Heaven and in
Earth:</hi> Consider the <hi>Heaven,</hi>
it is beautifull: consider the
<hi>Earth,</hi> it is beautifull: both
of them are together very
beautifull. It is he that made
them, he that guides them: it
is his command that governs
them: It is hee that alters
times, supplies moments.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6451:70"/>
Even Hee of himselfe sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
them. All things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe praise him, whether
they be in station, or motion,
whether they be from <hi>Earth</hi>
below, or from <hi>Heaven</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
whether they be in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
or renewing. When
thou seest these, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
in these, and art lifted up
in Contemplation to Him
that made these, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
how these invisible
things of his are understood
by these which are made, then
is <hi>His praise in Heaven and in
Earth,</hi> that is, thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
him for things earthly,
thou praisest him for things
heavenly. And because Hee
made all things, and that
there is nothing better than
Him; whatsoever He made
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6451:71"/>
is below Him, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
seemes pleasing in these,
is lesse pleasing than Hee is.
Let nothing then so much
please thee in these which he
hath made, as He himselfe, by
whom they were made. But
if so thou love this which
He hath made, thou art much
more to love Him, by whom
they were made. If these be
so beautifull which He hath
made, much more beautifull
is Hee by whom they were
made. <hi>His praise is in Heaven
and in Earth, and he shall exalt
the horne of his people.</hi> Now (in
this Vale of teares, and field
of tares) is the <hi>Horne of his
people</hi> humbled in threshings,
tribulations, temptations,
beating of brests. When shall
the <hi>Horne of his people be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:6451:71"/>
When the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
shall come, and our Sun
shall arise, not this which is
seene with our eyes, and <hi>ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
on the good and evill,</hi> but
even that Sunne whereof it is
said,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>unto you that feare the

                  <note place="margin">Malac. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>shall the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
arise, &amp; health shall be
under his wings;</hi> and whereof
the proud and wicked shall
say,<note place="margin">Wisd. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The light of righteousnesse
hath not shined unto us, and the
Sunne of understanding rose not
upon us.</hi> Hee shall bee our
Summer. Now, fruits in
Winter time appeare not in
the root. Thou observest how
dry Trees are in winter. He
that knows not the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these things, prunes
the dry Vine before the fruit
come, and, perchance, next
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6451:72"/>
Spring it becomes so dry, as
it brings forth neither
flower nor fruit, when it
should come. Both these are
alike in winter, this liveth,
that is dead: But the life
of this, and the death of that,
are both in secret. The Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
approacheth; life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in this, death is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in that. Beauty of
leaves precedeth, plenty of
fruit succeedeth: the Vine is
attired with that beauty in
her leafe, which she retains
in her root. Therefore, my
Brethren, we are now while
we are here, in our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
like other men. Like as
they are borne, eat, drinke,
live, and are cloathed, and so
passe over their life; even so
the Saints. Sometimes doe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6451:72"/>
these things deceive men,
whence it is they say, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
since this man became
a Christian, did his head ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ake? Or now being a
Christian, enjoyes hee more
than I doe? O dry Vine!
Thou observest the Vine
planted neere thee how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
it is in winter, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
how dry it is by heat of
summer. The Lord our
beauty will come, who lay
hid in the root; and then will
<hi>He exalt the horne of his people,</hi>
after this our captivity wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we mortally live. Whence
it is that the Apostle saith,
<hi>Iudge nothing before the time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I Cor. 4.</note>
                  <hi>untill the Lord come, who will
lighten things that are hid in
darknesse, and then shall everie
man have praise of God.</hi> But
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6451:73"/>
thou wilt say, where is any
root? where is any fruit? If
thou beleevest, thou knowest
where thy root is. For there
it is, where thy Faith is,
where thy <hi>Hope and Charity</hi>
is.<note place="margin">Colos. 3.</note> Heare the Apostle, <hi>for yee
are dead:</hi> They appeared as
it were dead in winter. Heare
how they live, <hi>And your life is
hid</hi> (saith he) <hi>with Christ in
God.</hi> Behold, where thou
hast thy root! When then
shalt thou bee adorned with
beauty? When shalt thou be
multiplied in fruit? Heare
what followeth, <hi>When Christ
which is our life shall appeare,
then shall yee also appeare with
him in glory.</hi>

               <head>THE
Soules Jubilee,
Gathered from Saint
Augustine, in his Tract
Upon the 85. Psalme,
Upon these words:</head>

                  <q>
                     <p>Rejoyce the Soule of thy
servant: for unto thee, ô
Lord, doe I lift up my
Soule.</p>
                     <p>For thou, Lord, art good
and mercifull, &amp; of great
kindnesse unto all them
that call upon thee.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ejoyce the Soule
of thy Servant.
Rejoyce her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
unto thee do
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:6451:74"/>
I raise her. She was in earth,
and in earth shee felt bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
Now, lest she should
pine away through bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and so lose all thy graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sweetnesse, I have raised
her up unto thee, <hi>Rejoyce</hi>
her with thee. For thou
onely art joyfulnesse: the
World is full of bitternesse.
Surely, very rightly doth he
exhort his members, that
they have their <hi>hearts on high.</hi>
Let them then heare it &amp; doe
it: let them lift that up unto
heaven, which is in an evill
state while it is upon Earth.
For there the heart doth not
corrupt, if it be lifted up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. If you have corne
in low places, lest it should
corrupt, you remove it
higher: doe you then seeke
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6451:74"/>
to prepare a place for
your corne, and will you
suffer your heart to corrupt
on Earth? you remove your
corne to an higher room, lift
up your heart unto heaven.
But how may I doe this, will
you say? What Cords, what
Pulleis, what Ladders are
needfull? These <hi>staires,</hi> are
thy <hi>affections:</hi> thy <hi>way,</hi> is thy
<hi>will.</hi> By loving thou ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,
by neglecting thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendest.
Standing on Earth
thou art in Heaven, if thou
love God. For the heart is
not lifted, as the body is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The body, that it may
be raised, changeth her place,
but the heart, that it may be
roused, changeth her will,
<hi>For unto thee, O Lord, doe I lift
up my soule: for thou, Lord, art
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6451:75"/>
good and mercifull,</hi> therefore
<hi>rejoyce her.</hi> As one wearied
and tediously affected with
the bitternesse of earthly
things, shee desires to bee
sweetned, and hath sought
the fountaine of sweetnesse,
but could not find it on
earth. For what way soever
she turned herselfe, she found
scandals, tribulations, feares,
tentations: In what man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
safe security? Of whom
certaine joy? And if not of
himselfe, how much lesse
from another? For either
men are evill, and of necessity
wee must suffer them, yet
hoping withall that they may
be changed: or they are good,
and so wee ought to love
them, yet fearing withall
lest they become evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6451:75"/>
they may be changed.
There, the wickednesse of
those begetteth bitternesse
of soule: here, care and
feare equally surprize us, lest
hee fall away from us, who
walked sometime uprightly
among us. What way soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then the heart shall turne
her, she findes bitternesse in
earthly things: shee has not
wherewithall to sweeten her,
unlesse shee lift her selfe up
unto God her Maker. <hi>For
thou, Lord, art good and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
What is this <hi>mercifull?</hi>
Thou supportest mee till
thou perfectest me. For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
my Brethren, I will speak
as a man unto men and of
men. Let every one bring
hither his heart, and behold
himselfe without flattering
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:6451:76"/>
and without glozing. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is foolisher, than flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
&amp; seducing ones self.
Let every one then consider
and see what and how many
things are acted in mans
heart; and how, for most
part, our very praiers are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by various thoughts,
so as our hearts will scarcely
stand firme before God. It
desires so to enjoy it selfe
that it may stand, and in some
sort it flyes from it selfe, yet
for all this it findes no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
by which it may confine
her thoughts, or barres by
which it may restraine her
distractions, and wandring
motions, and stand joyfully
before her God. Rare it is,
that a prayer should occurre
devoutly fixt, amongst so
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6451:76"/>
many prayers. Now every
one would say, that, what
befalleth him, befalleth not
another, unlesse we found in
the Sacred Scripture of God,
that <hi>David</hi> in one place pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and said:<note place="margin">2 Reg. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, I have
found my heart, that I may pray
unto thee.</hi> Hee said, hee had
<hi>found his heart,</hi> as if it used
sometimes to fly from him,
and he to pursue it as a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and could not lay hold
on it, and to cry unto the
Lord, <hi>My heart hath forsaken
me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> Therefore, Brethren,
considering what hee here
saith, <hi>Thou art good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull,</hi>
I conceive that for this
cause he cals him a <hi>mercifull
God,</hi> for that hee suffereth
these things in us, and yet
expecteth prayer from us,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6451:77"/>
that hee might perfect his
good work in us. And when
we have given it him, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
our oblation of prayer
unto him, hee receiveth it
freely, and heareth it friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
neither remembers hee
those prayers of ours, which
we so unseasonably presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but receiveth this one
which we scarcely found, yet
found wee humbly offered.
For tell me, Brethren, what
man is he, with whom if his
friend shall begin to talke,
and he will not answer him,
but observes him to decline
from him, and to direct his
discourse unto another, as if
he were wholly aliened from
him, who, I say, could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
this? Or suppose thou
should'st intercede a Judge,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:6451:77"/>
and addresse thy selfe to him
in such a place as hee may
heare thee, and suddenly,
when thou should'st speake
unto him, thou leavest him,
or entertainest some trifling
discourse with thy friend,
how could hee endure this?
Yet doth God suffer so
many hearts of such as pray,
and thinke of many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
thoughts while they
pray, I forbeare to speake of
thoughts hurtfull, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to speake of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
and offensive unto
God: for to thinke even of
superfluous thoughts, is an
injury unto him, with whom
thou speakest. Thy Prayer
is a speech unto God. When
thou readest. GOD speakes
unto thee: When thou praiest,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6451:78"/>
thou speakest with God.</p>
               <p>But what? Are wee to
despaire of man-kind, and
now conclude, that every
man is damned, when any
wandring thought shall
creepe in upon him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
his prayer? If wee
should conclude thus, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I doe not see what
hope might remaine in us.
But forasmuch as wee have
hope in God, for <hi>great is his
mercy,</hi> let us say unto him;
<hi>Rejoyce the soule of thy servant:
For unto thee, O Lord, doe I
lift up my soule.</hi> And how have
I lifted it up? As much as I
could, as much as thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
me strength, as soone as
I was able to lay hold on my
fugitive soule. So long as
thou stoodst before me (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6451:78"/>
him to speake in the
person of God) thou enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainedst
such vaine &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
thoughts, as thou
scarcely pouredst forth one
fixt or stable prayer unto
me. What more canst thou
answer unto this, but, <hi>that

What is it then that the
Scripture saith in so many
places,<note place="margin">Prov. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>They shall call upon me,
but I will not answer.</hi> (Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he is mercifull to all
such as call upon him) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be for that some cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon him, doe not
call upon him, of whom
it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>They have
not called upon God?</hi> They
call, but not upon God.
Thou callest for what thou
lovest: Thou callest for
what thou wishest in thee;
thou callest for what thou
would'st have come to thee.
Wherefore, if for this end
thou call upon God, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
may come to thee, that
an inheritance may descend
to thee, that temporall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
may befall thee, thou
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6451:79"/>
callest upon him for those
things which thou desirest
that they may come unto
thee: But thou makest God
here a furtherer of thy lusts,
not a favourer of thy desires.
Is God good, if he give thee
what thou would'st have?
What if thou would'st have
what is ill? were hee not
more mercifull unto thee in
not giving thee what thou
would'st have? Yet, for all
this, if hee doe not give it
thee, God is as nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee: For thou sayest,
How long have I sought,
how oft have I sought, and
yet am not heard? But
what hast thou sought? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
the death of thy
Enemy: what if he also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
thine? He who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:6451:80"/>
thee, he likewise created
him: Thou art a man, hee
likewise is a man: But God
is the Judge, hee hearkneth
both, but hee heareth not
both. Thou art sad, for that
thou art not heard in thy
prayer against him: be glad,
that hee is not heard in his
prayer against thee. But
thou wilt say, I did not seeke
this, I sought not the death
of mine enemy; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
the life of my child:
What evill sought I in this?
Thou soughtst no evill, as
thou thinkest; but tell mee,
what if hee were taken from
thee, lest Sin should change
his understanding? But thou
wilt say, hee was sinfull, and
therefore I desir'd that hee
might live, that hee
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6451:80"/>
might reforme his life.
Thou desiredst that he might
live better: but what if God
saw that he by living longer,
would become worse? How
knowest thou then whether
might more redound to his
profit, to dye or live? Seeing
then thou knowest not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into thy heart, leave
this to the secret counsell of
God. But what shall I then
doe, wilt thou say? How
may I pray? How maist
thou pray? As thy Lord
hath taught thee, as thine
Heavenly Master hath taught
thee. Call upon God, as
God;. Love God, as God.
Nothing is better than hee,
desire him, covet him. See
how this princely Prophet
calleth upon the Lord in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

thou canst find nothing more

nothing more diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For what more diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
than what is sempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall?
Doe not feare that hee
at any time will fall from
thee, who hath made thee,
that thou shouldst not fall

from him. If then thou callest
upon God as God, be secure,
thou art heard; thy portion
hath relation to that verse,
<hi>He is very mercifull to all such
as call upon him.</hi> Doe not
then say, He hath not given
me this. Returne unto thy
heart, and discharge thy
conscience, examine it, doe
not spare it. If thou hast
at any time called upon God
for temporall benefits, assure
thy selfe that therefore hee
did not give them thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not profit
thee. In this, Brethren, let
your hearts be edified, your
Christian hearts, your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hearts; lest yee fall into
murmuring against God, by
being discontented, when
frustrated of your desires:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6451:82"/>
and in vaine it is to kick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the prick. Make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to the Scriptures.
The Devill is heard,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> and the
Apostle is not heard. How
seemes this unto you? How
are the Devils heard? They
besought him that they
might goe into the <hi>heard of
Swine,</hi> and it was granted
them. How is the Devill
heard? He besought him,
that he might tempt <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 1.</note> and
it was suffered him. How
is the Apostle not heard?
<hi>Lest I should be exalted out of

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>through the abundance
of revelations, there was given
unto me a pricke in the flesh, the
Messenger of Satan to buffet me.
For this thing I besought the
Lord thrice, that it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me. And he said unto
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6451:82"/>
me, my grace is sufficient for thee:
for my power is made perfect
through weaknesse.</hi> He heard
him, whom he had disposed
to damnation: and heard not
him whom hee prepared to
salvation. The sick patient
asketh many things of his
Physician: yet the Physician
gives them not, hee heares
him not after his will, but
for his health. Make God
then thy Physician: aske of
him health, and hee will bee
thy health: not only as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
health, but as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is all health. Love not
then any health beside him,
but as thou hast it in the
Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Say unto my Soule I
am thy Salvation.</hi> What is it
unto thee what hee give
thee, so he give himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6451:83"/>
to thee? Now wouldst thou
that hee give himselfe unto
thee? What if that thou
wouldst have hee will not
give thee, that hee may give
himselfe unto thee? Hee
removes impediments from
thee, that hee may enter in
unto thee. Brethren, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and consider what God
gives here unto Sinners, and
hence gather what hee
keepes in store for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
To Sinners that blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
him, hee gives daily
the benefits of Heaven and
Earth, hee gives fountains,
fruits, health, children,
wealth, abundance. All
these goods things none gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
but God. Hee that
gives such things to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
what thinkst thou stores
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6451:83"/>
hee up for his faithfull?
Doest thou thinke this of
him, that hee who gives such
things to the evill, reserves
nothing in store for the
good? yes truly, hee reserves
not onely earth but heaven.
Nay perchance, I speake of
something too low when I
speake of heaven: hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
himselfe who made
Heaven. Beautifull is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but more beautifull is
the Maker of Heaven. But
(saist thou) I see Heaven,
but I see not him. Thou hast
eyes to see Heaven: But
thou hast not as yet an heart
to see the Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
To that end came
hee from Heaven to Earth,
that hee might cleanse thine
heart, whereby he might
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6451:84"/>
bee seene who made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth. But freely
with patience expect salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Hee knowes best
with what medicines to cure
thee: Hee knowes best how
to cut thee, how to seere
thee. Thou art become
sick through sinne, hee
comes not onely to cheere,
but to cut and seere. Doest
thou not see what paine
men suffer under the hands
of their Physicians, who
promise unto them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
hope of life? Thou
shalt bee cured, saies the
Physician, thou shalt bee
cured if I cut thee. And
this is but the promise of
man, and promised to
man. Neither is hee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
who speakes it, nor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:6451:84"/>
hee who heares it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee speakes it unto
man, who made not man,
nor perfectly knoweth what
may become of man: yet
gives man credit to these
words of man, who knowes
not what becomes of man:
hee submits his members
unto him, hee suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee bound, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unbound he is cut and
seer'd: and perchance hee
recovers health for a few
dayes, yet after this short re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of health, hee knows
not when hee must dye; and
perchance hee dyes while he
is in cure, or perhaps hee
cannot bee cured. But to
whom hath God at any time
promised, and deceived?</p>

how the House it selfe may

For though, perchance,

hee was before hee

in the <hi>haven,</hi> he commits his

his <hi>Competitors</hi> bee those <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
which plash him; who
never leave him, till they
cause his <hi>Top</hi> and <hi>Top-galant</hi>
to yeeld with dishonour;
which, his unbounded spirit
unable to brooke, becomes
his secret Pioner.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pleasure</hi> seazeth
his Fort; how long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are those slow-running
houres, which divide him
from idolatrizing his light-affected
Mistresse? What
numerous fancies his delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

him; presenting to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced
Conceit, more

Hee reteines a constant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
of her favour, feature,
posture; but how light shee
weighs in the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>honour,</hi>
hee never dreames. Hee flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

a scattred or ravish'd <hi>favour</hi>
transports him! Meane time,
shee works on his fortune,
while shee guls his guilded

Thus splitted in his

they would intercede (if

discovered him to be the only

Oh that hee would recollect
himselfe! and consider from
whence hee came, what
hee is, and whereto hee must
goe.</p>
               <p>First, let him reflect upon
the state of his earthly being;
that weake contexture wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee is moulded; Next,
what weake and infirme sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
hee stands on; and
how soone those shaking

will not afford him; nor all

               <p>O Man! Seeing then,

Physician of our soules,
here doe I come to the foot
of thy Crosse, she wing my
wounds and sores unto
thee: heale mee, O my God,
and prescribe mee what I
should doe. I acknowledge,
and confesse, O Lord, that I
am vehemently addicted to
sensuall affections, and too
great a Lover of my selfe,
which selfe-love I perceive
hindereth much my spiritual
profit and proficience. So
as, being oft-times ensnared
either with my pleasures and
delights, or deterred with
the labour of fasting, I lose
the benefit of pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
exercises: with the
losse whereof my salvation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6451:98"/>
likewise is endangered. This
sensuality of mine is to mee
very tedious, very grievous:
for truly it desires at set
houres to feast<note n="*" place="margin">Delicacy the Devils darling.</note> daintily and
delicatly, it desires after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and suppers, to solace
it selfe in discourses and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
likewise, to take the
ayre, walke in gardens and
arbours, alwayes affecting
one recreation or other: but
teach thou mee, O Lord, by
thy example what I ought to
doe. O with what confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with what shame doe I
conceive my selfe to bee
cloathed, so often as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
after what sort thou
entertainedst that most deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and most tender body
of thine? In the midst of
those anguishes and dolours
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6451:98"/>
of thy most bitter death, thou
ministredst to it no other
repast nor receit, than that
which was<note n="*" place="margin">Christs confection.</note> confectioned of
gall, and vinegar, by those
cruell and hatefull Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries.
And at that time,
whose tongue, I pray thee,
durst complaine of thy
<note n="*" place="margin">Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> meat, that it was eyther
cold or raw, and ill dressed,
or too quickly, or slowly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
upon sight of that
Table spread, O Lord, for
thee, in that thy so great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity?
In stead of delights
and discourses, which I
seeke in my Suppers, and
banquets, thou hadst the
voyces of them, who with
moving, and mowing, and
wagging their heads, derided
and blasphemed thee, saying,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:6451:99"/>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Christs Musique.</note> 
                     <hi>Hey, thou that destroyest the
Temple, and buildest it in three
dayes.</hi> This was the musick,
this the harmony of thy
banquet. Likewise, when
thou stuckst nailed hand and
foot upon the Crosse, this
was thy<note n="*" place="margin">Christs Perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> walking into the
Garden. For albeit, thou
hadst another garden, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thou retiredst after supper,
yet was it not to walke in,
but to pray in; not to refresh
thee, but to shed thy bloud:
not to delight thee, but to
grieve, sorrow, and bee in
the agony of death. What
shall I say more of the rest of
those refreshments of thy
blessed flesh? My flesh requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a soft bed, a pretious
weed, spacious and specious
houses, but tell thou mee, O
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:6451:99"/>
my holy Love, what an one
might be thy chamber? What
thy house? What thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Thy garment is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and thy purple the
<note n="*" place="margin">Christs habit.</note> habit of derision. Thy
<note n="*" place="margin">Christs house.</note> house is to bee conversant
in publike assemblies, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the distemperatures of
Sunne, and ayre; and if I
seeke for any house of thine
besides this, it is a stable for
beasts. <hi>Foxes</hi> have their
holes, and the <hi>Sparrowes</hi> of
heaven their nests: But thou
the Creator and Maker of
all things, hast not whereon
to<note n="*" place="margin">Christs repose.</note> lay thine head. O yee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities
and superfluities,
how comes it to passe, that
there is any place left for you
among Christians? Either
let us cease to be Christians,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:6451:100"/>
or let us cast from us all these
delights and superfluities:
seeing our Lord and<note n="*" place="margin">Christs conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Master
hath not only cast from him
those things which were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
but even those
things also which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>Now it remaineth, Lord,
that I see what a Chamber
thou hast. <hi>Tell mee,</hi> O sweet
Lord, <hi>where it is that thou lyest,
where thou sleepest at noone?</hi> I
lay mee downe here at thy
feet: teach mee, what I ought
to doe. For this my sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
will not well relish a
Sermon of thy Crosse. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a bed soft and sweet, and
if I awake at Prayer time, yet
doe I suffer my selfe easily to
bee overcome by sloth: I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
likewise a morning
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6451:100"/>
slumber, that I may get rest
for my head. But tell mee,
O Lord, what rest thou hadst
upon that<note n="*" place="margin">Christs bed.</note> bed of thy
Crosse. When as leaning
on the one side, thou wert
wearied, how couldst thou
rest thee on the other side,
that thou mightst bee eased?</p>
                  <p>May not thine heart here
burst? May not all thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality
here dye? O solace
to the poore! O, shame to
the rich! O strength to the
penitent! O condemnation
to the soft and delicate!
Neither is JESUS CHRISTS

                  <p>O Lord, give mee grace,

but if not, I beseech thee,

that even this very moment

My seeing, hearing, tasting,

grace unto her, not to cease
from kissing thy feet, washing
them with her teares, and

according to the greatnesse
of mine iniquities, thy great

Cut out of mee towards my

Grant that I may <hi>sow the seed

If thou love any thing in this

thou lovest thine owne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Cease therefore to love

if thou love me onely in this

never enjoy what thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,

Truly, thou lovest nothing

the condition or quality of

is no kind of death that can

bee at rest. Wherefore, let it

feare, whether the death bee

takes thee away. For if one

kind of death were more
unhappy than another, all

unhappy, the most part
whereof in times past, in the

speaking to thee, I likewise
speake to them, who are as

advise you all in this, that
yee love innocence, and hate
iniquity. If thou hast at any

repent, that thou hast sinned,
so long as thou livest. Yet
so repent, if thou wishest to

that thou returne not

which here in this world, no

yee walke as Pilgrimes.
Now your Pilgrimage is

Death therefore is the
very <hi>last line,</hi> running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this <hi>exile</hi> wherein yee

yee goe; so as, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gate, by which yee may
passe from this valley of your
Pilgrimage, and enter your
Countrey, your heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritage,
but by death. Death
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6451:135"/>
then most certainly doth
wait for you, like as a most
certaine end is limited to
your life. But this difference
there is betwixt the good
and evill, that here in your
Pilgrimage yee all travaile
mixtly, all, I say, albeit not
all in a right way; yee long
after your blessed Countrey:
all yee, so long as yee are
in your journey, although
yee wander, may returne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the true way. But when
yee shall come to the end of
your journey, in the gate it
selfe, that is, at the point of
death, yee are discerned, that
Some of you may passe from
exile unto life, others to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
and eternall death. It is
not then lightly to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
nor negligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:6451:135"/>
how every one is to
bee prepared before death
come. For there yee leave all
things after you, in which
yee trusted. Bee they riches,
honours, friends, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vaine thing whatsoever,
they shall availe you nothing
at the houre of death, but
leaving these behind you, ye
shall goe naked unto the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall
of God, to receive
according to your works.
What blindnesse, nay what
madnes is it then, to rejoyce
here in your journey, to

               <p>Such things therefore are

In such sort is every one to

were his very last, wherein he
should dye and goe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This is the most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
profitable, &amp; soveraigne
counsell, O Daughter, that
thou maist live after this
manner, and that death may
be to thee no terrour. Now
then, if not continually,
yet frequently, should that
houre bee presented before
thee, as if it were before
thine eyes, wherein thy soule
going out of thy body shall
be judged for all thy workes,
words, and thoughts. This
therefore oughtst thou even
at this present to injoyn thy
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6451:137"/>
selfe, that thou maist live so
even now, to the end thou
maist be found so prepared,
is thou wouldst thy selfe
to bee prepared, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
death shall undoubtedly
come. It is the property of
a most sottish and senselesse
heart, to deferre amendment
of life to that time, when
time expireth, when thou
canst live no longer, when
now thou art not to amend
thy life, but to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God as thou art already
amended. Surely, not sinnes
only, but even all things doe
leave thee going out of this
life. Thou art not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
said to leave thy sins,
when thou canst now sin no
more: But if whilest thou
hast ability to sin, thou cease
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6451:137"/>
from sin; true repentance is
never to be called late: but
this which is deferred to the
end of thy life, it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that it is seldome true.
For if through feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
only, being even now
to die, thou sorrowest, and
art ready for the avoiding of
punishment to performe any
taske, be it never so extreme,
to obtaine pardon: Thou
sorrowest not out of <hi>charity,</hi>
in that thou hast offended
God, but out of <hi>selfe-love,</hi> for
that thou wishest to thy selfe
good and not evill. For thou
sorrowest, because thou hast
brought to thy selfe eternall
damnation by thy sinnes:
Wheras, if thou rightly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest,
for this only wouldst
thou sorrow, in that thou, so
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:6451:138"/>
disobedient unto me, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
to me, so reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to me, hast not exhibited
due honour and reverence
unto me: whom thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
with al affection to have
honored, whatsoever should
befall thee. Whereas now,
forasmuch as thou only sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest
for thy selfe, if dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
were avoided, or no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on sinne inflicted,
thou wouldst never lament,
though thou hadst offended
me a thousand yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">No true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without Charitie.</note>
True <hi>Repentance,</hi> which

that thy Brother, after

That inconstancie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stability

is common to innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
servants of God.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:6451:161"/>
There is no cause then
that hee should be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
so much amated.
For if hee suffer this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
against his
will, and strive wirh his
best endevour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
attentive, his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

ofttimes more usefull
and fruitfull, than if it

it being purged
and purified from these
distractions. Exhort
him alwayes, that hee be
of good courage. If
with a patient and resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
heart, hee suffer for
the love of God his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and want of
health, whereof almost
hee daily laboureth, hee
need not doubt, but so
soone as he shall lay off
this grievous, onerous,
and bitter load of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
flesh, hee shall
enjoy eternall joy and
health. Goe to then,
my Beloved, let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

thee, vigilantly, and so
endevour to live circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly,
as becommeth
true Christians, who
beare both the style and
state of Christianitie.
Let us passe over all the

Then shall wee

infinitely exceeding and

wee shall behold in the

admire, O Lord, (albeit I

any thing but in thee, the
most vast and unbounded

Thou art the boundlesse Sea

But being everie

thee present? But surely
thou inhabitest a light inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible.
But where is that

light inaccessible? Or how
shall I come to that light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible?
Or who will
guide mee, and bring
mee to it, that I may see
thee in it? Then, with what
signes, with what face shall
I seeke thee? I have not
seene thee, O Lord my God,
I have not knowne thy face.
What shall hee doe, O most
high Lord, what shall this
thy forraine banisht one
doe? What shall thy servant
doe, doubtfull of thy love,
and far casten off from thy
face? Hee longeth to see
thee, and thy face is far from
him. Hee desireth to come
unto thee, and thine habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

knoweth not thy place. Hee
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:6451:177"/>
affecteth to seeke thee, and
knoweth not thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
O Lord, thou art my
God, and thou art my Lord,
and I never saw thee. Thou
hast made mee, and re-made
mee: and all those good
things which I have, hast
thou bestowed on mee, and
I have not yet knowne thee.
Finally, to see thee was I
made, yet have not I done
that for which I was made.
O miserable condition of
man, to lose that for which
hee was made! O hard and
harsh chance is this! Out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
what ha's hee lost, and
what ha's hee found? What
is gone, and what abideth?
Hee hath lost happinesse, for
which hee was made, and
hee hath found unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:6451:177"/>
for which hee was not
made. That is gone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which nothing is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
and that abideth which
of it selfe is nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie.
Man did eat the
bread of Angels, which now
hee tastes not: now hee eats
the bread of sorrowes,
which then hee knew not.
O the publique lamentation

Miserable exchange! from
how great good, to how
great evill? Great losse, great

But out alas for me unhappy

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:6451:178"/>
Whither did I goe,
whereto am I come? to what

and behold trouble. I went
towards God, and behold I
became an offender against
my selfe. I sought for rest in
my secret paths, and I found
tribulation and sorrow in
my inward parts. I would
have laughed through the
joy of my minde, and I was
enforced to rore through the

O Lord look upon us, heare

I beseech thee, O Lord, let

I beseech thee, O

Sweeten it with thy conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
I beseech thee, O

if before I eat I sigh, grant
that after my sighs I may eat.
O Lord, I am become croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

may looke upward: mine
iniquities are gone over
mine head, they overwhelme
me, and as an heavie burden

Let mee seeke thee by desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
desire thee by seeking,
finde thee by loving, love
thee by finding. I confesse,
O Lord, and I give thankes:
because thou hast created in
mee this thine Image, that
being mindfull of thee, I
might think of thee, and love
thee. But so abolished is this
image with the blemishes of
vice, and so darkned with the
smoake of sinne, as it cannot
doe that for which it was
made, unlesse thou renue, and
reforme it. I presume not, O
Lord, to pierce thine height,
for I can by no meanes nor
measure compare mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to it, yet I desire
in some sort to understand
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6451:180"/>
thy truth, which mine heart

For this, likewise, I
beleeve, that unlesse I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,

Therefore, O Lord, thou

with what bitter terror shee
is afflicted, with what stings
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:6451:181"/>
of a biting conscience shee is
distracted. Shee remembers
the things forbidden her,
which shee hath committed;
Shee considers the things
commanded her, which shee
hath negligently contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
she bemoanes those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
times of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
offer'd her, and which
shee so fruitlesly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
shee bewailes that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
article of strict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
inevitably appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
her. She h'as had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
time of sojourning
here; shee is now compelled
to goe hence. Shee would
regaine that which shee h'as
lost, but she is not heard. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
her, shee beholds the
whole course of her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
life, all which shee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:6451:182"/>
as one short pace.
She casts her eyes upon her
selfe, and collects the space
of an infinite perpetuity. She
laments therefore, in that she
h'as lost, what in so short a
space she might have got, the
joy of all ages. She bemoanes
her selfe, in that for so short
a pleasure of fleshly delight,
she h'as lost the unspeakable
sweetnesse of perpetuall so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
Shee blusheth, in that
for this substance which is
subject to wormes, shee h'as
neglected that which was to
have beene ranked amongst
Quires of Angels. Now she
lifteth up the beames of her
minde, and no sooner behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the glory of immortall
riches, than shee becomes
confounded, for that she h'as
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6451:182"/>
lost them for the poverty of
this life. Againe, when shee
casteth her eyes under her in
a despicable reflex upon the
valley of this world, and
eying it to be nothing but
darknesse, but above her
wonders at the beautie of
that eternall light, she clearly
sees, that it was night, and
darknesse which shee loved.
O that shee might but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
some small remainder
of time for repentance, what
a sharp course of conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
would she take upon her?
what and how great things
would shee promise? with
what vows of devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would
shee enwreath her? In the
meane time, while her divine
eyes grow darke, while her
heart beats, while her hoarse
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6451:183"/>
throat gaspes, her teeth grow
by little and little black, and
draw, as it were, unto them
a certaine rust, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
becomes pale, and all
her members stiffe. While
these, then, and such like as
forerunning offices of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching
death attend her,
all her works and words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves before her;
nay, not her very thoughts
are absent, and all these bring
in bitter testimony against
their author. All these are
heaped together before the
eyes of her viewing them, so
as, even those things which
she shunneth to behold, she is
inforced, though against her
will, to take notice of. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, there is here an
horrid troupe of Devils, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:6451:183"/>
there a glorious traine of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
By that which appears
betwixt them, may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceived, which of them
h'as most property in her.
For if tokens of piety bee
discovered in her, shee is
cheared with the delights of
an angelick invitation, and
allured with the sweetnesse
of an harmonious melodie,
to go forth. But if the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her merits, and the
impurity of her foule and
filthy life adjudge her to the
left hand, presently with an
intolerable terrour shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
surprized, with the
violence of a sudden force
she is disturbed, dejected, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded,
and from the prison
of miserable flesh violently
haled, that to eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:6451:184"/>
with bitternesse shee
may be tugged. Now, after
her departure from the body,
who can utter what armed
troopes or Squadrons of
wicked Spirits lye in ambush
for her; what treacherous
traines furnished with cruell
tortures besiege the way
that receives her? And lest
the soule should escape the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
legions of furies, as it were,
in military rankes or batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
inclose her. This and

made a slave of every sense.

and outward, yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed

Without all sensible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,

I increased daily, yet
knew I not the meanes of my
growth. He only who made
and fashioned me, knew mee;
long before I came out of the

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:6451:189"/>
musicall aires that usher'd
mee to this vale of woes.
My very <hi>first voyce</hi> implyed
a <hi>prophecie:</hi> my <hi>teares</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of my following
<hi>miserie.</hi> I came into the
world <hi>naked;</hi> whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures come <hi>cloathed</hi>
and <hi>armed.</hi> With what joy
was I received, while those
that saw mee, cried, <q>
                     <hi>How
like is hee to his Father?</hi>
                  </q> And
they said well, if they poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>Adam,</hi> for his bloud
made me his sonne, and like
himselfe a sinner.</p>
               <p>What a foolish part it was
(had I well considered it) to
see wise men rejoycing at
the sight of one who was
entring the <hi>Tyring-house</hi> of
mourning! The <hi>Thracians,</hi>
though Pagans, shewed
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:6451:190"/>
themselves in this more
Christians. These lamented
their Babes <hi>birth,</hi> but rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at their <hi>death.</hi> What
great delight could any
take in mee, when I came so
bare into the world, as I
brought not with mee one
poore ragge to shroud my
shame: and all the <hi>regreets</hi> I
returned them, <hi>teares</hi> and
<hi>shrikes?</hi> These deserved no
great entertainment of joy.
To see such a feeble thing, as
could afford it selfe no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
An <hi>Infant Pilgrim,</hi>
who could not find a tongue
to beg him harbour! One,
who wanted all things, yet
could not tell it's owne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ants. This might rather
move <hi>compassion</hi> than <hi>joy.</hi>
And such a poore one was I.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6451:190"/>
Nothing did I see that could
please mee. Still were my
late-unsealed eyes flowing,
my seeble voyce shriking;
nought but notes of miserie
everie where resounding.
And deserved these such
pleasing entertainment? By
my <hi>birth,</hi> I got nothing to
<hi>my selfe,</hi> but <hi>teares;</hi> to my
<hi>friends,</hi> nothing but <hi>cares</hi> and
<hi>feares.</hi> To feed mee was their
care; lest I should be better
fed than taught was their
feare. Sleepe, Food, and
Shrikes, all which begot my
<hi>parents</hi> trouble, were the best
things I rendred them; and
the whole expence of those
houres, which I bestowed
on them. Silly infancie!
when that pleaseth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
best, and batteneth the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:6451:191"/>
Infant most, which profiteth
the world least, <hi>Sleepe.</hi> Small
cause had my <hi>Parents</hi> to have
joyed in my <hi>birth,</hi> had they
considered how my entrie
led mee into a maze of
miserie, a vale of vanitie.
How that small portion of
flesh, which I brought along
with mee, would in time
prove my profest enemie.
My first teares told the
world that I had something
in mee, which annoyed mee.
My originall guilt struck
teares into mine eyes, feares
into my heart. Naked came
I, as one stript of his coat.
And this nakednesse came by
the losse of my garment of
innocence. My Grandfire
never found himselfe naked,
till hee had transgressed.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6451:191"/>
Then, and never till then,
flew hee to the bushes. But
what avail'd it him to flye
from his sight, whose eyes
were in everie place? Small
doubt but I would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the same course, could I
either have considered my
guilt, or found feet to hasten
mine escape. But I found an
<hi>ignorance</hi> in the one; and a
<hi>weaknesse</hi> in the other. Thus
was I <hi>borne</hi> in sinne, before I
could beare up my selfe.
Yet for all this did my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
account of mee as a
rich prize. Dandled must I
bee till I sleepe; wrapt in
warme cloaths; carefully
nursed; tenderly used: and
if my too deare Parents got
but one poore smile from
their Babe, they held their
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:6451:192"/>
care and cost highly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced.
Thus begun I my
life in teares, and continued
it with feares, hopes, and
griefes. Which made mee
many times with heartie
sighs in the privie chamber
of mine heart, to conclude:
Better was the day of ones
death, than the day of his
birth. And that the best
thing that could bee unto
man, was not to be borne at
all: and the next, to dye
soone. For what brought
I into the world with mee,
but pulleyes which haled
mee along to miserie? And
what bestowed the world on
mee, when shee had received
mee, but <hi>clouts</hi> and <hi>bands.</hi>
The one to proclaime my
<hi>povertie,</hi> the other my <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie.</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:6451:192"/>
So as, all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
I had from
this goodly Store-house of
worldly happinesse, was
<hi>want,</hi> and <hi>restraint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus scarce able to creep,
(yet distinguished by <hi>reason</hi>
from all other creeping
things) I at last got crawled
from the state of <hi>infancie</hi> to
<hi>childhood.</hi> Where, as I increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in yeares (though insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and therein more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable)
I increased still in the
measure of my wants and
woes.</p>

               <p>NOw was I weaned
from my Nurses milk,
but not from my Grandhams
sin. I begun with <hi>Christs
Crosse,</hi> but soone was I tired
with <hi>learning</hi> it; which
shewed how quickly I would
be afterwards wearied with
<hi>bearing</hi> it. I held the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any creature more
happie than that of a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.
So as it was my desire
(so soone did the heat of
goodnesse, the hopes of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlinesse
expire) to <hi>learne</hi>
in <hi>jest,</hi> but <hi>play</hi> in <hi>earnest.</hi> I
found in my selfe a conceit
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:6451:193"/>
apt enough for any sports;
in these I could lesson o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
But in the <hi>Schoole</hi> of
<hi>Vertue,</hi> I was ever slowest in
reading, or taking out any
such lesson to my selfe. How
long seemed that day, when
<hi>learning</hi> was enjoyned me for
a taske? How speedie that
houre, wherin <hi>libertie</hi> was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me to play? Thus like a
<hi>Beare</hi> to the <hi>stake,</hi> was I haled
to my <hi>booke,</hi> wherein I found
afterwards the happiest state.
Wandring, albeit not much
harmfull fancies, begun now
to seaze on mee. I was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
contented, by being
seated in that place where I
was: nor with that sport I
last affected. When I was
in my fathers house, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
was to bee in the field;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:6451:194"/>
when I was in the field, I
longed to bee at home. My
<hi>childish</hi> ambition (indeed)
was not high. My delights,
as they required no great
cost; so were they purchased
with lesse care. Easie and
narrow were my desires;
they aspired no higher than
to points, pins, or cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones.
Trifles had so taken
up my imagination, as it
could reach no further. Yet
in these <hi>weake vanities,</hi> my
desire was to be a <hi>conquerour.</hi>
Now when I found my selfe
growne from my <hi>coat,</hi> my
<hi>Parents</hi> fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d no such thing
in my <hi>conditions.</hi> Those were
<hi>childish</hi> still, and held both
their first <hi>shape</hi> and <hi>size.</hi>
None ever breathed, that
was longer time a <hi>child:</hi> or
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:6451:194"/>
that longed lesse after the
state and style of <hi>Man.</hi> My
thoughts were so fitted to
that age, as if that age were
ever to bee master of my
thoughts. I measured everie
one by mine owne Last, and
mused how any one could
bee serious. I knew not
what they meant by a deare
Summer, or an unseasonable
Harvest. These were the least
and lightest of my cares:
while I found plentie, I
dreamed little of others scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.
Mine highest outrage
was the breach of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.
Yet such <hi>inbred seeds</hi>
were sowne in mee by his
<hi>grace</hi> that made mee, as I
thought this was not well
done of mee. But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I did in my selfe <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect;</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:6451:195"/>
others were as apt
quickly to <hi>corrupt.</hi> If other
children approved it, I gave
way unto it. I shap't my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
by their liking: my
election by their loving.
Thus went I on a <hi>proficient</hi>
in nothing so much as folly.
I wished for time after time
to please my <hi>childish</hi> fancie:
but never weighed the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of time, nor how all
things slav'd to time were
vanitie. Few and weake
were my desires; nor did
they much differ from those
of an inferiour creatures,
being altogether for the
present. How easily might
any one have deceived mee
with <hi>shadowes</hi> for <hi>substance;
Esau</hi> in preferring a <hi>messe of
pottage</hi> before his <hi>inheritance,</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:6451:195"/>
was never more foolish, than
I was in the estimate of my
vanities. What a brave
youth held I my selfe with
mine Eldern Gun, Hobbie-horse,
and Rattle? A poore
pride, and yet rich enough
for that time. What was
onely before mee, seemed
deare unto mee. Yesterday
was too long for mee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member:
and to morrow too
long for mee to expect. I
held the present day, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
date of my pleasure. No
day was to mee ominous,
but if any were, none so
much, as after a long <hi>Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up,</hi> to returne to <hi>Schoole.</hi>
I found in my selfe a naturall
feare; but this proceeded
rather from sight of the rod,
than any propensitie to what
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:6451:196"/>
was good. This <hi>feare</hi> taught
mee first how to <hi>flatter;</hi> and
this I began first to practise
on my <hi>Master.</hi> What faire
promises would I make
him, in hope of one houres
reprive from him! All things
should bee amended; meane
time, nothing lesse intended.
Thus went I on in my <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi>
wayes; wise enough to
be a Wag; too light, to bee
truly wise. So as, I might be
well compared to that <hi>Top,</hi> I
so much used; which alwayes
ran round, &amp; never went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
unlesse it were whipt.
A true Truant, but a weake
Proficient. Libertie I still
desired, yet made no use of
it. Books I loved onely for
their Cover; Flowers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented
Letters I preferred
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:6451:196"/>
before the matter. Thus was
my <hi>childhood</hi> bestowed;
though some glowing hopes
rak't up in the embers appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
which did not a little
glad their longing hearts
which gave me nurture: but
how these hopes ripened,
you may hereafter gather.</p>

were my delights mounted

ever proceeded from want

was in request, I held it a
complete fashion. For Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,

I held nothing so

purchase a Parasites praise
by my riot. It is not in mee;
no, it is far from mee and my
memorie, to recall to mind
what miriads of houres that
time mis-spended. Scarcely
one poore minute can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke

And yet must I be enforced

freely to lye open my selfe,
and speake what is true. For
of all those Consorts, whose

that it is impossible for
mee to remember, how many

when they scarce knew how
to sin, I taught them; when
they were willing to sin, I
perswaded them; when they
withstood sin, I constrained
them; when they enclined
to sin, I consented to them.
Yea, to how many I lay
snares in the way where they
walked, for how many I
made pit-fals in the way
when they sought it: And
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:6451:200"/>
to the end I might not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

And he came unto me,

sin no more. But I found the

the continuance thereof too

and by it promised to my
selfe more libertie. I held it
Security enough to sinne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.
As one retired from
the sight both of God and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:6451:202"/>
man, to promise more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
to sinne, I stickt not to
say, <hi>Who seeth mee?</hi> But woe
is mee! what was worst of
all, and what without griefe
of heart I shall never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
Though I saw many eyes
upon mee, and that my <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
might have done good to
many; for that in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others, I was ranked
both for <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
before many others;
those whom I might by my
uprightnesse have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
by my loosenesse of
life I depraved. Which
made me call to minde with
much heavinesse of heart,
what I had sometimes read:
<hi>Of so many deaths is every one
worthy, as he hath given evill
examples to those that live with
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:6451:202"/>
him, or left evill examples to
those that shall succeed him.</hi> O
my God (thus would I many
times commune with mine
owne heart) how many
deaths have I deserved, who
held it not enough to undoe
my selfe, by taking upon me
a liberty of sinning; but to
undoe others too, by chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them out a way by my
unhappie example for the
like freedom of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressing!
This, I confesse, could not
chuse but make me to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

most hatefull; my selfe to my
selfe most distasteful. And yet
for all this, swum I still in
the same streame. Truth it is,
that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my youth up, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as
yet no early soft downe had
cloathed my chin, I had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a full perusall of my owne
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:6451:203"/>
estate. I found in me, what of
necessity might bee either
corrected by me; or nought
could I looke for lesse than
misery. Some <hi>bosome sins</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in me after I came
to <hi>mans</hi> estate w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ill became
the condition of <hi>man,</hi> and I
sought for cure of them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these, one I culled
forth more deare to me than
the rest, and which neither
day nor night would afford
mee any rest. And I found
meanes to remove it, or to
weane mee from it; and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
them, but got no helpe
by them, because I mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
them. for I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
after such time as I
had beene advised, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
to use, to allay, if not
take away, the poyson of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:6451:203"/>
that <hi>darling sin</hi> wherewith I
was infected; I tooke great
care for a while, to observe
whatsoever was injoyned
mee: and to neglect no
meanes to procure my safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
First, I shut my <hi>windowes;</hi>
I admitted no <hi>treaties;</hi> I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from <hi>dainties.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
I suffer'd not my
thoughts to converse with
<hi>lightnesse.</hi> Thirdly, I presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my suit to that <hi>High
Court of Requests,</hi> for more
assistance. Fourthly, I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
my flesh to <hi>holy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and obedience. Fifthly,
I <hi>meditated</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> and how
this dainty pampered flesh
would in that time turne to
deformitie and rottennesse.
Sixtly, I imparted my griefes
to my <hi>Superiours,</hi> to receive
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:6451:204"/>
the benefit of their godly
counsell and holy prayers.
But flesh and bloud became
soone weary of this Taske.
Which I no sooner negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
than I made relapse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that malady, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the time of my spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
exercise, was well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaged.
Thus in my entry
to the state of <hi>man,</hi> after such
time as I was gone downe to
the Grave, and that the Pit
had nearely received mee;
had not my good God taken
pity of mee, and showne
the light of his Countenance
upon me: even then, I say,
was I no sooner set againe
on my feet, then I returned
to my accustomed filth. And
though <hi>Manhood</hi> had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up my <hi>

And yet is there none so old,

so much by others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and read man over and
over in every volume? Sure,
either now or never there is
some appearance of <hi>grace,</hi>
when there is so neare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to my Grave. To be
<hi>old</hi> in <hi>yeares,</hi> and <hi>young</hi> in
<hi>houres,</hi> is an unchristian piece
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:6451:205"/>
of Arithmetick. Neither can
there be any sight more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely,
than to see an old
man, gray in haires, and
grave in yeares, to have no
other argument to prove his
years, but his haires. I am
now <hi>gathering</hi> my <hi>vessels</hi> in
the <hi>haven:</hi> Neither doe I find
ought without me, that may
so much cheare mee, as to
hold me one minute longer
from my Countrey. I have
passed the Maine, and am
come a Shore. And yet I must
put forth a little further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can reach my wished

the <hi>Suburbs;</hi> my <hi>weake

things wanting in mee, that
tell me, I am not so well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:6451:206"/>
as I should be. I finde,
indeed, in me no great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to sinne, but what of all
that? Did my <hi>will</hi> to sin die,
while I had <hi>ability</hi> to sin? If
it did not; all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor shall advantage
me ought at my ending. For
hee who ceaseth from sinne
when hee can sinne no more,
cannot be said to leave sinne,
but sin to leave him. There
is not one <hi>servant</hi> in all my
<hi>Meniey</hi> that is able to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
service for mee; not one
living power or faculty that
can discharge that peculiar
office they owe mee. It is
high time for mee then to
shut up shop, and to leave my
Trade; my too long trading
in sinning, wherein I have
spent so many houres (never
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:6451:206"/>
to be recalled) of precious
time. I am now esteemed of,
but as some old moath-eaten
<hi>Calendar</hi> without date. If I
talk like to one of my yeares;
unseasoned youth jeeres such
gravity; if I speake ought
below my selfe, straight am
I taxed of levity. If I doe
ought youthfully, it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
mee; and if I doe like
my selfe, gravely, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastes
me, because it dislikes
them whose company de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
mee. I have <hi>greene
thoughts</hi> shrowded under <hi>gray
locks.</hi> So as, it seemes I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in nothing from what I
was at first, but only in haire,
and unable limbs. For I have
a <hi>will</hi> to doe what I did, if I
had <hi>abilitie</hi> to doe what I
would. Never was decrepit
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:6451:207"/>
thing more strong in <hi>will,</hi>
more weake in <hi>power.</hi> I am
now made use of, like as of
some aged sullied <hi>Record;</hi>
only brought forth to looke
upon, and then laid aside.
Would I but know what a
small portion of worldly
meanes might suffice mee;
seeing Nature hath now
drawne out my threed of life
to the full length; I could
not but confesse that my
small remainder of dayes
now left mee, had a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie
to serve mee: yet,
while I have one foot in the
Grave, my desires are more
<hi>deepe</hi> than the Grave; more
<hi>thirstie</hi> than the Earth, to
which I am every moment
drawing nearer, though in
my earthly affections daily
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:6451:207"/>
stronger. There is nothing
in all my house of lesser use
than my selfe; neither is my
body halfe so weake as my
minde. My life is but at best,
a dying sleepe. Nor bee my
cares ever at better rest, than
when I am asleepe. The most
that can be now said of me, is
this; <hi>He was a man in his time.</hi>
But that time is done; for
now I turne <hi>Child</hi> again; and
cannot for a world help my
selfe, so neare am I to the
brinke: yet see what light
thoughts sparkle out of this
<hi>dead Turffe!</hi> My eyes dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
my teeth blacken; my
heart heateth; my hoarse
throat ruttleth; my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
hath lost her colour;
all my powers and motions
their vigour: yet can those
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:6451:208"/>
darke eyes look and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
anothers Farme; those
teeth grate and grinde
themselves for revenge; that
poore beating throbbing
heart wish for a longer life;
that seere and sallow counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
desire to looke young;
those decayed powers wish
to be strong. My friends put
me in mind of my <hi>Will:</hi> and
my sicke soule answers them
with a sigh: Friends, advise
him to forget his <hi>Will:</hi> for it
was that onely which undid
mee and him. But my <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
house</hi> must not bee yet
<hi>disposed</hi> of; I love it too well
to leave it. Yet a little; and
yet a little. Spare mee but a
very little; I finde not my
selfe altogether so <hi>weake,</hi> as
my <hi>weaknesse</hi> should yet stand
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:6451:208"/>
in need of a <hi>Will.</hi> Thus doe
I love to deceive my selfe;
while that <hi>strong man</hi> stands
at the doore, readie to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
mee. I daily see how
those who are every way
stronger, are enjoyned to
pay their debt to Nature.
But this I apply not to my
selfe; I looke still for some
dayes to bee <hi>added</hi> to my life.
None so weake, but hee is
fit for some worke. Though
I can neither digge, nor
delve, nor fashion my selfe
to any hand-labour; I can
devise how to make my
<hi>Barnes</hi> larger: But what is
all this to setting of my
house in Order? Alas! How
long have I wearied my selfe
with these wayward cares?
How long have I beene in
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:6451:209"/>
preparing, and am still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared?
What a stirre I
made for a <hi>state,</hi> and still
neglected my <hi>inward state?</hi>
yea, what got I for all my
<hi>cares,</hi> but an unhappie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>feares?</hi>
And what were my <hi>hopes,</hi>
but from those things, from
whence I could not expect
for either <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>helpe?</hi>
And thus I keep my Couch;
no lesse fearfull to lose what
I alreadie have; than I was
sometimes carefull to get,
what I now have. Woe is
mee! shall I therefore neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Heaven, because Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
h'as dealt so bountifully
with me? Shall that which I
now scarcely enjoy (for I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it without joy) deprive
mee of my chiefest joy? Here
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:6451:209"/>
I feele all the <hi>infirmities</hi> of
<hi>Nature;</hi> there I shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a <hi>Lasting youth,</hi> and with
it abundance of pleasure.
Yet these worke weakly on
mee. I would faine build
my <hi>Tabernacle</hi> here. And yet
I finde no great comfort
here. For what may I bee
said to <hi>enjoy,</hi> that I <hi>possesse?</hi>
Attendants indeed, of <hi>Old
age</hi> I have many, and such as
cleave neare mee. But for
ought else without mee, I
cannot challenge them <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly;</hi>
because a very short
time shall <hi>impropriate</hi> these to
my <hi>posteritie.</hi> Those things
then that grieve mee, I have;
nor will they leave mee till
I goe to my Grave: But
those things that should
cheare mee, I have not: for
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:6451:210"/>
they must shortly leave mee,
or I them; when <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
shall bee my <hi>Mother,</hi> and
<hi>Wormes</hi> my <hi>Brethren</hi> and
<hi>Sisters.</hi> Thus hath my life
beene as a <hi>Tale</hi> that is <hi>told:
Sphinxes</hi> riddle is now made
good in me: my <hi>second child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
records mine aged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie.
My <hi>age</hi> h'as made
<hi>time</hi> change my <hi>Tence;</hi> I
WAS, and that is all can be

But if they knew my aime,
they would quickly rectifie
their censure, and approve of
mine order. For I doe not
here treat of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> as a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fore <hi>Age,</hi> to delight in:
for rare were that delight
(unlesse it receive life from
above) that could suit well
with it. No; my meaning
is to take a <hi>Survey</hi> (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
teares) of all those <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:6451:211"/>
which my vaine <hi>youth</hi>
affected; with those which
my riper age frequented:
with these which my decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
time (these few and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
dayes of mine) have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.
And in the review of
these, I finde those <hi>Pleasures</hi>
of my <hi>youth,</hi> full of vanitie;
yet not enthralling mee to
so much miserie, as those of
my <hi>riper growth;</hi> nor those so
dangerous, as these of mine
age. Everie <hi>time</hi> brought
with it a new <hi>tide.</hi> In the first
prime of my <hi>youth;</hi> I made
choyce of such delights as
sorted best with my fancie;
wherein I shewed such agili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as few in the exercise of
them surpassed mee. But in
these I found much vanity:
for they either wearied mee,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:6451:211"/>
or they were weary of mee.
The <hi>beasts</hi> of the <hi>field</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
my <hi>prey;</hi> while I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a <hi>prey</hi> to those <hi>beasts</hi>
within. In these an <hi>easie Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi>
tooke mee; contending
with those who were given
to like sports, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie.
This, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
was neither greatly
harmfull nor usefull. Those
poore <hi>Creatures</hi> which I had
in chace abroad, could have
done mee little harme; had
not my <hi>passions</hi> wrought mee
disquiet at home. Which,
though they assailed and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
mee, yet did they not
wholly surprize mee. And
yet did I many things, which
beget in mee now a glowing
shame. My <hi>youth</hi> was not so
well seasoned, as to use <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:6451:212"/>
as it should be used. I
was too hot in the quest and
pursuit of it, to shew any
discretion in the exercise of
it. And too strongly was I
fixed on those poore <hi>Objects,</hi>
wherewith my unstayed <hi>eyes</hi>
were fed, to make use of
what mine eyes beheld, for
mine inward good. But long
did I not bestow my selfe on
these: for when I came to
more yeares, I abandoned
those <hi>pleasures</hi> I pursued at
first; I betooke mee to those
that seemed more <hi>manly;</hi> but
I found by bitter experience,
that they onely <hi>seemed</hi> so:
for these are they who now
sting mee like <hi>Adders,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
my troubled soule with
a thousand terrours. For in
those times I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:6451:212"/>
with what securitie I
used to sit in my Summer-Arbour.
How my thoughts
were only laid to satisfie my
loose desires. <hi>Let us take our
fill of pleasure;</hi> thus I talked
with my wandring senses.
And quickly opened they
their <hi>windowes</hi> to let sin in;
but no <hi>passage</hi> found I by
them to let sin out. They
cried with the Horse-leach,
<hi>more, more.</hi> I found them as
<hi>insatiable</hi> as Hell, or the <hi>Grave.</hi>
Yea, when strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
failed, and the powers
of sin became weakened, my
wanton <hi>Will</hi> supply'd, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insoever
my abilitie wanted.
Thus in my strength, was I
led away captive; nor could
I redeeme my liberty for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
yeares. This caused mee
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:6451:213"/>
many times in the chamber
of my heart to peruse the
story of <hi>Sampson:</hi> who, when
hee was strongest, shewed
himselfe weakest, in disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his strength to a <hi>Dalilah.</hi>
And this, mee thought, came
neare mee; I could never
read it, but I was stinged
with it. For at that time
was I in my full strength;
and conceivingst state. I had
improved my helps by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and behaviour of my
selfe, by reading <hi>bookes</hi> and
<hi>men.</hi> In the one I read what
should bee done; in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I beheld whatsoever
was either praise-worthy, or
otherwise done. None could
disguise himselfe from the
world more; or seemingly
impeach his honour lesse.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:6451:213"/>
But what was the issue of all
this? A <hi>double sinne</hi> could
receive no lesse than a <hi>double
scourge.</hi> Halt with <hi>man,</hi> I
might; with <hi>God,</hi> I could
not. The longer hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the more hee inferred.
In that sin, wherein any one
is most delighted; shall he be
punished. Sweet meat must
have sowre sauce. I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
(but too short time
did those thoughts lodge
with mee) that these <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
were but for a <hi>moment,</hi>
but no lesse space than <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
ended the <hi>torment.</hi> I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
too, how that <hi>Eternitie</hi>
depended on this <hi>Moment.</hi>
Yet, for all this did I enlarge
mine heart unto <hi>pleasures.</hi>
The day seemed long, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I did not enjoy them: the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:6451:214"/>
night long, wherein I
thought not of them. I
knew what sinne it was to
<hi>sollicit</hi> a <hi>Maid</hi> unto light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
or to be <hi>drunken</hi> with
<hi>wine,</hi> wherein was <hi>excesse:</hi>
or to suffer mine <hi>heart</hi> to
be <hi>oppressed</hi> with <hi>surfetting</hi>
and <hi>drunkennesse:</hi> yet, for all
this, run I on still in mine
<hi>evill wayes;</hi> and so continued
till my <hi>evill dayes</hi> came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mee; which fitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for <hi>pleasures</hi> too, but
of another degree, and in an
higher straine of vanitie.</p>
               <p>Alas, poore decrepit age!
what <hi>pleasure</hi> can the whole
world find for such a Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
Thine eyes are too

thee merrie, laugh at thee;
because thy mirth so ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
thee. Old men wag
their heads at thee, seeing
thee doe what so ill-beseems
thee. Thou hast had already
enough of the <hi>pleasures</hi> of
sin: let the younger brood
now enjoy what thou hast
tasted. And yet this must not
be. That man were too too
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:6451:215"/>
old, for whom the world
could not find one <hi>pleasure</hi> to
fit his <hi>age.</hi> This to my griefe,
I found in my selfe. Old
sores are ever hardest to bee
cured; and vices in old
age most desperate. Heare
then my distemper; and to
cure it, afford mee your <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
and <hi>teares</hi> to my Saviour.
The lesse I need, the more
needfull am I in my desires.
I have more than a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to maintaine mee du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this short remainder of
my pilgrimage, lent mee.
And yet this will not serve
my turne: my mouth is halfe
filled with gravell; and yet
are not my desires filled with
what they enjoy. And thogh
my verie <hi>nailes</hi> might serve
for a <hi>spade</hi> to dig my grave;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:6451:215"/>
they had rather be moulded
and be rusted with telling of
coyne. Though I can
scarcely see it when I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it: this sufficeth mee,
without hope of enjoying
to hoord it. My whole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie
is brought into one
volume: &amp; that penn'd with
no great art. My cash-keeper
lookes to it, and I to him,
lest hee corrupt it. This vast
volume bears this title, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor</hi>
and <hi>Debitor.</hi> But for
my <hi>Debts,</hi> I owe few; save
onely to <hi>Him,</hi> to whom I
owe my selfe. Meane time, I
am so far from discharging
it, as I scarcely vouchsafe to
acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>O lessen in mee these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
cares; that it may be
henceforth my whole care,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:6451:216"/>
to apply to this old sore a
speedy cure. Let mee not
onely speake it, but thinke
it: <hi>Vanitie of vanities, and all
is but vanitie, save onely to
please God, and to serve him.</hi>

               <p>MY <hi>breeding</hi> was such,
as it never acquainted
mee with any Hand-labour.
Neither was my <hi>constitution</hi>
so strong as to endure it:
nor my <hi>disposition</hi> so low as
to brooke it. Free-bred
were my Studies: so as, <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing</hi>-like,
with shell on head,
I begun to write, before my
<hi>yeares</hi> could well make mee
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:6451:216"/>
an <hi>Author.</hi> But hence my
teares! The <hi>Subjects</hi> I made
choyce of, were of <hi>Love;</hi> to
close with my <hi>fancie,</hi> which
was verie <hi>light.</hi> I was proud
in bearing the title of a <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
which, I must confesse,
together with the instancie
of such as either truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
mee, or deluded
mee, made mee ambitious
after the name of an <hi>Author.</hi>
And what were those light
<hi>Poems</hi> I then penned; but
such as are now pensive
Odes to my dolorous soule,
grieving to peruse what my
youth so dearely loved? O
how familiar was I with
<hi>Parnassus, Helicon, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crene,</hi>
and all the <hi>Muses!</hi>
Meane time, I seldome or
never thought of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:6451:217"/>
                  <hi>Olympus,</hi> which
crowns all vertuous <hi>Labours</hi>
with true happinesse. It was
the saying of an holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Aug. Med. 4.</note>
                  <q>Those studies which
I once loved, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

I sometimes praised, now
disparage mee.</q> Far more
cause have I to say, how,
Those <hi>Labours</hi> which I once
fancied, now afflict mee:
those which sometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
mee, now perplex
mee. I am many times in
company, where I heare
some of my youthfull verses
repeated: and though I doe
neither owne them, nor
praise them: yet must I in
another place answer for
them, if hee, on whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
shall not in these teares
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:6451:217"/>
which I shed, drowne the
memory of them. For alas!
how many chaste eares have
I offended; how many light
eares have I corrupted with
those <hi>unhappie workes</hi> which
I have published? What wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
measures have I writ for

and next her <hi>Venus</hi> and

of these doe
grieve me! When that <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>

became a <hi>Forge</hi> of lightnesse

For what sweet

then is a divine influence;
and the choice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:6451:219"/>
makes the difference.
This I speake not in defence
of my selfe, but in defence of
it which I have so much abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For many sweet Poems
have I read, which could not
chuse but beget in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
<hi>Reader</hi> many good
thoughts: and whose <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi>
whether they were
couched in <hi>prose</hi> or <hi>verse,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serrved
of all cleare judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their applause; and
these live to posterity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they enlivened vertue:
&amp; set up such a Light upon
the Altar of devotion, as shal
never go out. But these I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
not. Let my <hi>teares</hi>
therefore be many; because
the <hi>fruits</hi> which others rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by my <hi>Labours,</hi> were but
few. Neither was I onely
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:6451:219"/>
vers'd in these. For being
put on by my <hi>Superiours,</hi> at
whose dispose I was, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
my pen to <hi>Labours</hi>
Historicall, Morall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
Neither was I in these
lesse blame-worthy: for even
Those, wherein I should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have aym'd at Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
had ever in them some
sprinklings of vaine-glory:
Nay, what was more; (for
enough I cannot speake to
my owne shame;) Those
<hi>Cardinall vertues</hi> whereof I
treated; and which to the
imitation of others I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
found ever the
worst example in my selfe.
Which could not chuse but
redound to my great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
to see mee the least
observer of that, which I
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:6451:220"/>
commended to another.
Likewise, those <hi>Theologicall
vertues,</hi> which in those my
<hi>Diviner Workes,</hi> I so highly
honoured; with those <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Beatitudes,</hi> the practice
whereof I so much pressed;
where found they my imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in them, to confirme
my admiration of them?
Now tell mee, was this all
that might bee required of
mee? Was it sufficient for
mee to commend to others,
what I meant not to amend
in my selfe? Was this the
duty of an Author? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee our lives to bee
showne in our pens, or our
pens in our lives? Truth is,
for one <hi>Active</hi> man, we have

which, none ever professed

more, and expressed lesse,
than my selfe. I could some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
say, and confirme it
with a vow; That I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

relate with pen, what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

none could finde this in me,
that did reade me; or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing

So as, withdrawing my selfe
a little aside from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>People</hi> I converse

and all our Fathers before
us, <hi>Pilgrims.</hi> Every day h'as
his date; yesterday was nor as
to day, nor to day as to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Two things there are,
which makes mee ever to
wonder, the more I thinke of
them. The one is, to heare a
<hi>Stranger</hi> (as we are all) to
breathe out so many long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wishes, languishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
<q>O that I were at
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:6451:222"/>
home! O that I were in
mine owne Countrey!</q>
And what home is this hee
meanes? Is it his owne home?
his owne native Countrey?
No; It is his <hi>earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi>
Perchance he liveth (if a
<hi>Pilgrimage</hi> may be properly
called a <hi>Living</hi>) farre in the
<hi>North,</hi> and upon occasion he
is call'd up to the <hi>South;</hi> O
how tedious are his houres
till he returne! yet was hee
as neare his <hi>Countrey,</hi> before
as now. The Latter is, to see
a poore <hi>way-faring</hi> man (as
we are all) when he is in his
journey, and wearied with
Travaile, overload himselfe,
as if hee purposely meant to
fore-slow his speed to his
Countrey: Or set himselfe
on <hi>building</hi> in the way, as if he
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:6451:222"/>
had quite forgot the <hi>place</hi>
whereto he was to goe. This
I am sure, is my estate. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
I have found even in those
who would have highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in enjoying that <hi>light</hi>
which I am call'd to; and no
doubt, would have made far
better use of it, than I doe;
excellent <hi>resolves</hi> touching
their contempt of earth: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their <hi>understandings</hi>
were so <hi>darkned,</hi> as their
mis-guided thoughts could
mount no higher. These
could conclude; <q>Whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we be, we are in our
Countrey, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with us, so it be well
with us.</q> But well it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee with us, so long as
<hi>Passions</hi> of the <hi>minde</hi> disquiet
us within, and <hi>Infirmities</hi>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:6451:223"/>
enfeeble us without. I heare
some call this <hi>Life</hi> a <hi>Prison;</hi>
but yet these who call it so,
live not like <hi>Prisoners.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
and Delicacies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not <hi>Fotters.</hi> Nay, if we
truely held it a <hi>prison;</hi> wee
would desire our <hi>libertie:</hi> but
we either know not, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
not our misery.
Others can call it a <hi>Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
others a <hi>Punishment;</hi>
others a <hi>Death.</hi> But if a
<hi>Banishment,</hi> why wish wee
not to be restored? if a <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
why seeke wee not
to bee released? And if a
<hi>Death,</hi> why sleepe wee in it,
and desire not to be raised?
No; no; these are but words
in the aire. Like such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>Abstinence,</hi> in their
<hi>Surfets;</hi> or discourse of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:6451:223"/>
in their <hi>Cups.</hi> Not

nor one of these

is my case: Though I finde

the eyes of the <hi>Almighty</hi>

in a <hi>miserable state,</hi> and knew
it not? How long have I
beene a <hi>Stranger</hi> to my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

I have read it, Deare Lord, in

by experience in that publike

how this <hi>Life</hi> is truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a <hi>Course,</hi> to a <hi>Roast;</hi>

To the <hi>Flight</hi> of a <hi>Bird;</hi>

Yet for all this have I loaded
my selfe with <hi>thicke clay;</hi> as if
I were too <hi>fleet</hi> in my course
to heaven, and needed trash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But would you know
in what <hi>places,</hi> I have beene

<hi>persons,</hi> most conversed? I
shall render you a just Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
meane time, what
Account I shall make for my

knowes.</p>
               <p>After such time, as my
Parents had brought mee up
at Schoole; to get mee an
inheritance in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
no earthly <hi>providence</hi>
could endow me; I was sent
to the <hi>Vniversitie;</hi> where
(still with an humble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:6451:225"/>
of others
favours and seasonable ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours)
I became such a <hi>Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
as <hi>Time</hi> call'd mee, and
<hi>Examination</hi> approv'd mee
for a <hi>Graduate.</hi> And in these
Studies I continued, till by
universall <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>vote,</hi> I
was put upon a <hi>Task,</hi> whose
<hi>Style</hi> I have, and shall ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the <hi>Sonne of Earth;
Terrae Filius.</hi> From the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of which exercise,
whether it were the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
favour which the
<hi>Vniversitie</hi> pleased to grace
mee withall, or that shee
found some tokens in mee of
such future proficience as
might answer the hopes of
so tender a Mother, I know
not: but, sure I am, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no small encouragement
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:6451:225"/>
both in my studies and free
tender of ample preferment.
And too apt was I, to apply
this the worse way. For this
extraordinary grace begot
in mee a selfe-conceit of my
own worth: ever thinking,
that if this had not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from some more deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
parts in mee: that rich
<hi>Seminary</hi> of all Learning
would not have showne so
gracefull a Countenance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mee. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
I laboured by that
<hi>Grace</hi> which was given mee,
to suppresse this <hi>Opinion</hi> in
mee; and humbly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my wants and
weaknesse in all; my abilitie
in nothing. But <hi>applause</hi> is a
dangerous <hi>Eare-ring:</hi> which
I found by giving too easie
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:6451:226"/>
eare to my owne praise; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>,
as it deluded my judgement,
so it expos'd me to censure.
True, too true I found it,
that in the sight of our
owne Parts, wee need no
borrowed lights. This it
was, and onely this that
induced mee to put my
selfe forward in Publique
Exercises with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence:
wherein (such
happinesse it is to bee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest

wherein I tasted such

my selfe to a profession,
which I must confesse sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not well with my dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for the fresh fragrant
flowers of Divine Poesie and
Morall Philosophy could
not like well to be removed,
nor transported to those
thorny places and plashes of
the Law. But no remedy;
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:6451:227"/>
with an unwilling farewell
I tooke my leave of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi>
to addresse my Studies to
that <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which at first
seemed so far different from
my element; as if I had been
now to be moulded to some
new Dialect; for though I
was knowne to most
tongues, I became a meere
Novice in this. Here I long
remained, but lightly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
being there seated, where
I studied more for <hi>acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
than <hi>knowledge.</hi> Nor
was I the onely one (though
a principall one) who run
deeply in areeres with time;
and gulled the eyes of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with a Law-gowne.
For I found many in my
case, who could not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
their Parents many
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:6451:227"/>
yeares charge with one
Book-case.</p>
               <p>Yet amidst these dis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
studies, whereto I
was rather enforced than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined:
I bestowed much
precious time (better spent
then in Tavernes and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thells)
in reviving in mee
the long-languishing spirit
of Poetrie, with other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Assayes; which so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighted mee, as they
kept mee from affecting that
loose kind of libertie, which
through fulnesse of meanes,
and licentiousnesse of the
age, I saw so much followed
and eagerly pursued by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
This moved mee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to fit my buskin'd
Muse for the Stage; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasionall Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:6451:228"/>
or Poems; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free-borne, and not
mercenarie, received grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
acceptance of all such
as understood my ranke and
qualitie. For so happily
had I crept into <hi>Opinion</hi> (but
weake is that <hi>Happinesse</hi> that
is grounded on <hi>Opinion</hi>) by
closing so well with the
temper and humour of the
time, as nothing was either
presented by mee (at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
of the noblest and
most generous wits and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of that time) to the
<hi>Stage;</hi> or committed by mee
to the <hi>Presse;</hi> which past not
with good approvement in
the estimate of the world.
Neither did I use these <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Solaces</hi> of my pen, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than as a <hi>play</hi> onely to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:6451:228"/>
the <hi>imagination:</hi> rather to
allay and season more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
studies; than accoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
them any fixt imployment.
Nor did I onely bestow my
time on these; for I addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my selfe to <hi>Subjects</hi> of
<hi>stronger digestion;</hi> being such
as required more maturitie
of judgement, though lesse
pregnancie of invention:
relishing more of the <hi>Lampe,</hi>
than those Lighter measures
which I had formerly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
wherein I grew as
strong in the opinion and
reputation of others as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
This I must confesse,
begot in mee a glowing
heat and conceit of my selfe:
but this I held an easie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the more dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
because arising from the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:6451:229"/>
infirmitie of nature. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
I can very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
(and what other
<hi>Followers</hi> can bee to such a
<hi>Remembrancer</hi> but penitent
teares and incessant feares)
that I held it in those dayes
an incomparable grace to be
styled one of the <hi>Wits.</hi>
Where, if at any time invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a publique feast, or
some other <hi>meeting</hi> of the
<hi>Muses,</hi> wee hated nothing
more than losing time;
reserving ever some Select
houres of that Solemnity,
to make proofe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
in a present provision
of Epigrams, Anagrams,
with other expressive (and
many times offensive) fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Wits</hi> so ill employed,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:6451:229"/>
were like <hi>weapons</hi> put into
mad mens hands. They hurt
much, benefitted little: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stating
more than they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
for they liked onely
such mens palats, as were
Male-contents, and Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
affected. By this time I
had got an <hi>eye</hi> in the world;
and a <hi>finger</hi> in the street.
<hi>There goes an Author! One of
the Wits!</hi> Which could not
chuse, but make mee looke
bigge, as if I had beene ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
in a new mold. O how
in privacie, when nothing
but the close Evening, and
darke walls accompany mee,
doth the remembrance of
these lightest vanities per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
mee! How gladly
would I shun the memory of
them! How willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:6451:230"/>
that sweetnesse which
many conceive to bee in
them! But let mee goe on;
for I am yet but entring
that high bet-path of my
younger follies. Having
thus, for divers yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
continued at <hi>Inns of
Court;</hi> where that opinion
the world had of my Works,
gained mee more <hi>friends;</hi>
than the opinion men had
of my <hi>Law,</hi> got mee <hi>fees.</hi>
For such as affected <hi>Scenes</hi>
more than <hi>Suits</hi> were my
<hi>Clients.</hi> I thought with my
selfe to take a turne or two
in <hi>Pauls;</hi> and to peruse a
whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Gazetta</hi> in one <hi>walke.</hi>
This I conceived might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
mee; first, by indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and ingratiating my
selfe with that <hi>Societie:</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:6451:230"/>
which, I must confesse, were
richly endowed with two
excellent parts, <hi>Invention,</hi>
and <hi>Memorie.</hi> Secondly, by
screwing some <hi>Subject</hi> from
their <hi>Relations,</hi> which might
set my pen a work upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
               <p>But I found not there
what I expected, which
made mee leave that <hi>walke,</hi>
and turne <hi>Peripateticke;</hi> a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<hi>Exchange-man;</hi> where in
short time I got acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the best; being such
<hi>gentle Merchants,</hi> as their
<hi>wealth</hi> could not so darken
their <hi>worth,</hi> but they would
willingly enter lists in a
combat of <hi>wit.</hi> These, I
grant, tooke great felicitie
in my company: nor did it
repent mee of bestowing
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:6451:231"/>
some houres with these:
whose discourse of <hi>forraine
Newes</hi> strengthened by such
able <hi>Intelligence,</hi> did infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
please. And these, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as the least losse
to themselves (I may safely
vow) would not stick upon
occasion to <hi>accommodate</hi> me:
which winged my desires
for the <hi>Court;</hi> the better to
<hi>accomplish</hi> mee. Where I
found gracefull acceptance
with choycest acquaintance.
But <hi>Cynthia</hi> could not bee
still in her full orbe. I begun
to withdraw my thoughts
from the pursuit of these,
and recount with my selfe
what I had seene: store of
wealth in the one, and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
state in the other.
Yet for all this I found my
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:6451:231"/>
selfe but a <hi>Planet</hi> in both.
Fixt I could not bee, till
some constant <hi>Calling</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mee. I resolved then,
seeing I found nothing
either in <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Citie,</hi>
but cares: Cares in the
one, of getting to hoord and
gather; cares in the other,
of getting to spend and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
in the one, more <hi>rinde</hi>
than <hi>pith;</hi> in the other,
more <hi>pith</hi> than <hi>rinde.</hi> This
partaking more of <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that of <hi>Substance:</hi> yet
a naturall straine of <hi>Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in both: but their <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
different. The one
making a <hi>cringe</hi> for <hi>fashion;</hi>
the other for <hi>gaine.</hi> While
the former makes his <hi>vowes</hi>
too familiar with his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests,</hi>
to be beleeved; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:6451:232"/>
sees too deepe a glosse
of his <hi>commodities,</hi> with <hi>shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oaths</hi>
to be lik't. The one,
with a low dook of your
<hi>Servants Servant,</hi> proclaimes
him the <hi>Servant</hi> of time, and
no ones servant. This I
wholly dislik't, for I found
the title of <hi>Servant</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
applyed by that Divine
Vessell of Election, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Sanctuarie of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that pure Mirrour
of Supreme Contemplation.
His <hi>title</hi> was, as it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of others of his Fellow-Labourers:
<hi>Paul a servant of
Iesus Christ; Iames a servant
of Iesus Christ; Iude a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Iesus Christ.</hi> With
this <hi>Complement</hi> These began
their Epistles: A Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christians are to imitate.</p>
               <p>The other, with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
weights and measures
(reserving ever my best
thoughts for the best) made
mee suspect him, that hee
sold his <hi>commodities</hi> by <hi>retaile,</hi>
and his <hi>conscience</hi> by <hi>whole
sale.</hi> Upon review of these,
(I say) I resolv'd to leave
those <hi>Cinnamon Trees</hi> of
the <hi>Court</hi> with their sweet
rindes; and those <hi>Palmato's</hi>
of the <hi>Citie</hi> with their broad
shades: and to turne honest
<hi>Countrey-man:</hi> where my
Parents providence had set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a competent estate upon
mee. Here I lookt to finde
nothing but plaine dealing;
where I found in very deed,
nothing lesse. For upon a
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:6451:233"/>
more serious perusall of
that life, with the benefits
that rose from it, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those who were
borne and bred in it; I
found a cunning Colt wrapt
up in a russet coat. Men as
apt to <hi>catch,</hi> as if they had
beene hatcht in the <hi>Harpies</hi>
nest. Such as would not
stick to hazard their part
and portion in the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
for a Symoniacall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
And still I went on to
dive into the qualitie of
those Ilanders. Where I
found some <hi>pining</hi> through
want, others <hi>repining</hi> at their
neighbours wealth, few or
none co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their estate:
yet none so poore in estate,
as hee would not, though
hee spared it from his belly,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:6451:233"/>
have a fee in store to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a suit. Long I had not
remained in this fashion, till
it pleased the Prince to put
mee in Commission for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of <hi>Iustice:</hi> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and a choyce one too,
yet such an one, as by the
abuse of <hi>man,</hi> not of <hi>time,</hi>
may be compared to the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledony</hi>
stone, which retaineth
her vertue no longer than it
is rubbed with gold. For
my carriage therein, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to such as knew mee:
many imperfections and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
(Heaven knowes) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed
mee, which by
an humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mine owne wants,
&amp; an earnest desire of supply
by Gods grace, became so
rectified in mee; as what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:6451:234"/>
seemed crooked, was by
that <hi>golden Rule</hi> of his <hi>divine
Will</hi> in mee streightned.</p>
               <p>Thus have I passed my

where the longer I lived, the

it now grieves mee, to have
grieved so much at the sight

if thou hadst possessed the

without grieving for them:

I know well, it is thy <hi>Flesh,</hi>
which thus disquiets thee.
It is shee who suggesteth
these things to thee. Wrastle

then with her, and give her
the foile; it is better that
shee faile, than thou fall. Tell
her; oh tell her: For this
will charme her. Those
worldly <hi>Friends,</hi> on whom
shee so much relyes; can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deliver themselves nor

professe much; and vow to

leave her for a <hi>prey</hi> to her

His poore corps is with

may remember us sometimes
while wee live on earth, but
they soone forget us when
wee are laid in earth. Aske
her then; will shee be stayd
by these <hi>friends,</hi> of which
<hi>Time</hi> makes <hi>shadowes,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>
profest <hi>foes? Secondly,</hi> if
<hi>Friends</hi> have not in them such

any assurance: hopes

any sure footing or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance?
No; tell her, these
are of all temporary blessings
most <hi>various</hi> and <hi>dangerous.</hi>
Various, in respect of the
<hi>Object</hi> from whence shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
them, being <hi>man:</hi> and
consequently, apt enough
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:6451:240"/>
upon the least occasion, to
change his <hi>minde.</hi> And <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi>
in respect of those

them to many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
both living and dying.
Aske her then; will shee bee

those more <hi>active pleasures</hi>
have wholly left her: shee
sees her <hi>Buildings,</hi> and to
leave them, and to whom
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:6451:241"/>
shee knowes not, it deepely
grieves her. Those pleasant
walkes, which with the
helpes both of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
shee so carefully contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
those shadie delightfull
Arbours, wherein shee so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredly
and contentedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
Those silent Groves,
christall Springs, dainty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectories,
wherein shee so
delightfully sported, bathed
&amp; banquetted: must she lose
all these; and for a cover of
mouldred earth, wherein all
her beautie lyes buried? It
must bee so; there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie;
the cold earth must
receive her perished beautie.
Nor should the losse of all
these grieve her; seeing these
were so confined to time, as
they could promise no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:6451:241"/>
to her. Yea; they
deserved rather to bee loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
than loved; seeing the
Sight of them too often
estranged her thoughts from
Him that made them. Aske
her then, where bee all
those who sometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
these <hi>pleasures</hi> to the
full! Where those <hi>Objects,</hi>
wherein they delighted?
Looke! Reade! Their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi>
are as <hi>Letters</hi> written
in dust. Their glorious <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
have lost the <hi>Names</hi> of
their founders. They sleepe
in their earth: but that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
sleepeth not, which
they mnst render for their
<hi>vanities</hi> on earth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, seeing her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
<hi>pleasures</hi> have wholly left
her; but the bitter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:6451:242"/>
of the abuse of them
stayes with her: the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the one being spent:
but the bitternesse of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left: what content may
shee finde in her <hi>Possessions;</hi>
the Worldlings <hi>Minions?</hi>
'Las, nothing! these are
tane from her, and bestowed
on another. Shee is now to
goes to her long <hi>home;</hi> and
another is to <hi>possesse</hi> her
dwellings. Though here,
shee held <hi>passing</hi> of <hi>time</hi> a
<hi>meere pastime;</hi> and a large <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi>
the Sole Solace of a
Worldling; now she findes
enough of Earth in a very

now whether her <hi>Granars</hi> be
enlarged; her <hi>Revenues</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased;
her <hi>Treasures</hi> slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
These be none of hers;

The very <hi>Wind</hi> h'as as great

Nor did they deserve so
much loving, when they
were in their very height
of enjoying. Being such as
were got with <hi>Care,</hi> kept
with <hi>Feare,</hi> and lost with
<hi>Griefe:</hi> proper things to dote
on! The fulnesse of them
could not stay, one poore <hi>Fit</hi>
of an <hi>Ague:</hi> nor get a <hi>reprive</hi>
at <hi>Deaths</hi> hand for a minute.
Besides, that long unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Adieu</hi> of the unhappie
<hi>possessour</hi> at his heavie <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
O Death, how bitter is
the remembrance of thee to a
man that liveth at rest in his
possessions!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then, no outward

man, as to withdraw
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:6451:243"/>
his thoughts from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
of man: Or so trouble
him in his passage or transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Earth, as to divert
his affections from heaven
in his remove from Earth.
Seeing, all things are not
onely <hi>vanity,</hi> but <hi>affliction:</hi>
where such as are highliest

and deluded by them:
Seeing, the beauty, riches,

of earth, are no sooner <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi>

O my <hi>Soule,</hi> and why art

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:6451:243"/>
in a silent secrecy, framing
this reply! These worldly
respects are not the things
that make <hi>Death</hi> appeare so
terrible unto mee. Noe; I
can freely bid farewell to
the world; there is nothing
in it, that makes mee ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd

at all in it, but sinne, or
occasions of sinne: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I ever possesse
ought, which did not <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi>
mee more in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,</hi>
than it <hi>delighted</hi> mee
in the <hi>enjoying.</hi> Tell me
then (poore fearfull soule)
what is it that so much
troubles thee in this thy
<hi>passage?</hi> What is it that
makes thee so shake and
shudder in this thy <hi>dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
O my sinnes! my
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:6451:244"/>
sinnes! it is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my sinnes, which
makes mee unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from this place where
I committed them: or to fix
mine eyes on that place,
which is so pure as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide them. I cannot
thinke of that <hi>place</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have not sinned; nor
of that <hi>houre</hi> wherein I have
not highly transgressed.
And can one minutes repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
discharge such long
arrerages? O my perplexed
soule, remember to thy
comfort that divine Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<hi>At what time soever a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

is hee feared. Hee shall

<hi>Faith</hi> is not in it.
Whence that the <hi>bodie</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
Because a <hi>Soule</hi> is not

of thy <hi>Soule</hi> is <hi>Faith.</hi> No

And though <hi>late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>

yet <hi>true repentance</hi> never

commend thy selfe to

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6451:246"/>
