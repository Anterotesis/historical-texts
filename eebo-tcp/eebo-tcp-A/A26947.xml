            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Canons that batter the Unity, Catholiciſm and Purity of the Church of Chriſt, are mounted on the frame which I have here demoliſhed. The ſwords, and pens, and
<pb facs="tcp:55445:3"/>
tongues that you are now engaged againſt, and which you muſt expect from henceforth to aſſault you, are whetted and managed by the ſenſeleſs, tyrannous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>principles,</hi> which I have here Detected. As un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable as they appear to the unprejudiced, they are ſuch as have animated the ſtudies and diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of thouſands to captivate the Princes and Nations of the Earth to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke. As vain as they appear to us that ſee them naked, they are ſuch as have divided and diſtracted the Churches of Chriſt, and troubled and dethroned Princes, and laid them at the feet of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope; They have abſolved ſubjects from their Oaths and other obligations to fidelity: They have involved many a Nation in blood: O the ſtreams of the blood of Saints that have been ſhed by theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Principles, in <hi>Savoy, France, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, Poland, Germany, Ireland, England,</hi> and many other Lands! As eaſie a war as here I manage, it is againſt thoſe adverſe Principles that have armed Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and Millions againſt the innocent, or againſt their lawful Soveraigns, whom God had bound them to obey: They have faſtned knives in the breaſts of the greateſt Kings, as the lamentable caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> the third and fourth of <hi>France</hi> doth teſtifie: They have in a few days time in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the adjoyning parts of <hi>France,</hi> perfidiouſly butchered Nobles and other perſons of eminency, and people of all ſorts, to the number of neer thirty thouſand (as <hi>Thuanus</hi> reckoneth them, if not forty thouſand, as <hi>Davilah.)</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which I here confound, have invaded <hi>England</hi> by a <hi>Spaniſh Armado,</hi> (whether by the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and upon the account of Religion, I have after ſhewed out of their own Writers:) they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared knives and poyſon for our Princes, which God
<pb facs="tcp:55445:3"/>
did fruſtrate: they have laid Gunpowder to blowup King and Parliament, and helliſhly execute the fury of the deluded zealots in a moment, and then to have charged the Puritans with the fact: They have in a time of Peace, by a ſudden inſurrection, murdered ſo many thouſands in <hi>Ireland</hi> in a few days or weeks, as poſterity will ſcare believe. They are dreadful Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, and not meer ſpeculations that we diſpute againſt. I beſeech you therefore that you receive not this as you would do a Scholaſtick or Philoſophical Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about ſuch things as ſeem not to concern you; but as you would intereſs your ſelf in a Diſputation upon the Queſtion, Whether you ſhould be depoſed or murdered as an Heretick? And whether we ſhould be Tormented and burnt as Hereticks? And whether the lives of all the Princes and People upon earth whom the Pope judgeth Hereticks, ſhould be at his mercy? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo do in this cauſe. I ſpeak not this to provoke you to deal bloodily with them, as they do with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord! I abhor the thoughts of imitating their cruelty! It is only the Neceſſary Defence of your Life, and Dignity, and the Lives of all the Proteſtants that are under your Protection and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the ſouls of men, that I deſire. On what terms we ſtand with thoſe men whoſe Religion teacheth them to kill us if they can; and to venture their lives for it, is eaſie to underſtand. When we have no ſecurity from them for our lives, but their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to deſtroy us, we muſt diſable them or die. I utter no melancholy dreams nor ſlanders: I have here ſhewed it in the too plain and cepious Decrees of the approved General Council at <hi>Lateran,</hi> that the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Princes, and abſolving their Subjects from their fidelity and giving their Dominions to others, not only
<pb facs="tcp:55445:4"/>
for ſuppoſed Hereſie, but for not exterminating ſuch as deny Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an Article of their Faith; and no man can diſown it, without diſowning Popery in the Eſſentials. If once they will renounce the Decrees of General Councils approved by the Pope, we ſhall be ſoon agreed.

I need not therefore tell you that <hi>Bozius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtienſis,</hi> and many more of them make the Pope to be the Lord of all the World: Or that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the ſtronger ſide do carry it, as <hi>[The common judgement of all Catholick Divines,</hi> (ſee what a rabble he heaps up <hi>De Pontif.

He gives us his proof of this. And whether the Pope do take your Government to be for the good of ſouls, I need not tell you. It is the ſtupendious judgement of God on Chriſtian Princes for their ſins, that they have been ſo far blinded as to endure ſuch an uſurper ſo long, and have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this blotted out his name from among the ſons of men. <hi>[Non licet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is not lawful</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ib. c.</hi> 7.) <hi>for Chriſtians to Tolerate an Infidel, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical King, if he endeavour to draw his Subjects to his Hereſie or unbelief: but to judge whether a King do draw to Hereſie or not, belongeth to the Pope, to whom the care
<pb facs="tcp:55445:4"/>
of Religion is committed: therefore it belongs to the Pope to judge a King to be depoſed, or not depoſed.]</hi> You ſee here it is not <hi>Lawful</hi> for ſuch Chriſtians as the Papiſts to <hi>Tolerate you:</hi> which may help your judgement in the point of their Toleration. <hi>Si Chriſtiani</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ib.) olim non depoſuerunt Neronem—Valentem Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; ſimiles, id fuit quia deerant vires temporales Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianis.]</hi> You have your Government and we our Lives, becauſe the Papiſts are not ſtrong enough.

                  </p>
                  <p>But their crueltie to mens <hi>ſouls,</hi> and the Church of Chriſt, doth yet much more declare their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs. It is a point of their Religion to believe, that no man can be ſaved but the Subjects of their Pope, as I have after proved, and is to be ſeen in many of their writings, (as <hi>Knot,</hi> and a late Pamphlet called <hi>Queſtions for Reſolution of Unlearned Proteſtants,</hi> &amp;c.) and Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> hath recited the words of <hi>Lindanus, Valentia</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez.</hi> (Apol. lib. 2. c. 1.) <hi>[defining is to be of Neceſsity to Salvation to be ſubject to the</hi> Roman <hi>Biſhop.]</hi> And would not a man think that for ſuch horrid doctrines, as damn the far greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the world, they ſhould produce at leaſt ſome probable Arguments? But what they have to ſay, I
<pb facs="tcp:55445:5"/>
have here faithfully <hi>detected.</hi> If we will diſpute with them, or turn to them, the Scripture muſt be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge then as their Church expoundeth it: The Judgement of the Ancient, yea or preſent Church, they utterly renounce; for the far greateſt part is known to be againſt the Headſhip of their Pope; and therefore they muſt ſtand by for Hereticks. Tradition it ſelf they dare not ſtand to, except themſelves be Judges of it; for the greateſt part of Chriſtians profeſs that Tradition is againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Vice-chriſt. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſenſe and experience of Chriſtians they gainſay; concluding all beſides themſelves to be void of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or ſaving grace, which many a thouſand holy ſouls do find within them, that never believed in the Pope. Yea when we are content to lay our lives on it, that we will ſhew them the deceit of Popery, as certainly and plainly as Bread is known to be Bread when we ſee it, feel and taſte it, and as Wine is known to be Wine when we ſee and drink it; yet do they refuſe even the judgement of ſenſe, of all mens ſenſes, even their own and others. So that we muſt renounce our honeſty, our Knowledge of our ſelves, our ſenſes, our reaſon, the common experience and ſenſes of all men, the Judgement and Tradition of the far greateſt part of the preſent Church or elſe by the judgement of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts we muſt all be damned.</p>
                  <p>Whether ſuch opinions as theſe ſhould by us be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted, or by you be ſuffered to be taught your Subjects, is eaſie to diſcern. If they had <hi>ſtrength,</hi> they would little trouble us with Diſputing. Nothing more common in their Writers ſcarce, then that the Sword or Fire is fitter for Hereticks then Diſputes. This is hut their after-game. Though their Church muſt rule Princes, as the ſoul, ruleth the body, yet it muſt be by
<pb facs="tcp:55445:5"/>
Secular Power; excommunication doth but give fire: it is Lead and Iron that muſt do the execution. And when they are themſelves diſabled, it is their way to ſtrike us by the hands and ſwords of one another. He that ſaw <hi>England, Scatland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> a while ago in blood; and now ſees the lamentable caſe of ſo many Proteſtant Princes and Nations deſtroying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thinks that Papiſts have no hand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, counſelling, inſtigating, or executing, is much a ſtranger to their Principles and Practices.</p>
                  <p>Obſerving therefore that of all the Sects that we are troubled with, there is none but the Papiſt that diſputeth with us with flames and Gun-Powder, with Armies and Navies at their backs, having ſo many Princes, and ſo great revenews for their proviſion, I have judged it my duty to God and his Church, 1. To Detect the vanity of their cauſe, that their ſhame may appear to all that are impartial; and to do my part of that neceſſary work for which <hi>Vell. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terculus</hi> ſo much honoured <hi>Cicero (Hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 34.) <hi>Ne quorum arma viceramus, corum ingenio vinceremur]</hi> And 2. To preſent with greateſt earneſtneſs theſe following <hi>Requeſts</hi> to your Highneſs on the behalf of the cauſe and people of the Lord (wherein the Papiſts alſo ſhall ſee, that it is not their <hi>ſuffering,</hi> but only our <hi>Neceſſary Defence</hi> that we deſire.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We earneſtly requeſt that you will Reſolvedly adhere to the cauſe of Truth and Holineſs, and afford the Reformed Churches abroad the utmoſt of your help for their Concord and Defence, and never be tempted to own an Intereſt that croſſeth the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Chriſt. How many thouſands are ſtudiouſly contriving the extirpation of the Proteſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Earth? How many Princes are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb facs="tcp:55445:6"/>
againſt them? The more will be required of you for their aid. The ſerious endeavours of your Renowned Father for the Proteſtants of <hi>Savoy,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the world by Mr. <hi>Morland</hi> in his Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath won him more eſteem in the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that fear the Lord, then all his victories in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered. We pray that you may inherit a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care of the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We humbly requeſt that you will faithfully adhere to thoſe that fear the Lord in your Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In your <hi>eyes let a vile perſon be contemned; but honour them that fear the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 15. 4. <hi>Know not the wicked; but let your eyes be upon the faithfull of the Land, Pſal.</hi> 101. 4, 6. Compaſſionate the weak and curable, Puniſh the uncurable; reſtrain the froward; but Love and cheriſh the ſervants of the Lord. They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the honour and the ſtrength of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; It was a wiſe and happy King that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that his <hi>Good ſhould extend to the Saints on earth, and the excellent in whom was his delight, Pſal.</hi> 16. 2, 3. This ſtrengthening the vitals is one of the chief means to keep out Popery and all other dangerous diſeaſes. We ſee few underſtanding Godly people receive the Roman infection, but the prophane, licentious, ignorant or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant that are prepared for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We earneſtly requeſt your utmoſt care, that we may be ruled by Godly, Faithfull Magiſtrates under you: and that your Wiſdom and Vigilancy may fruſtrate the ſubtilty of Masked Papiſts or Infidels that would creep into places of Council, Command, or Juſtice, or any publick office. If ever ſuch as theſe ſhould have a hand in your affairs, or be our Rulers, we know what we muſt expect. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our jealouſies of ſuch men are, becauſe we
<pb facs="tcp:55445:6"/>
know that the deſign is agreeable to their principles and intereſts: and we know it is their uſual courſe: and we find that ſuch men ſwarm among us: we hear their words, we read their writings, we ſee their practices for Popery and Infidelity. The jealouſies of many wiſe men in <hi>England</hi> are very great concerning the preſent deſigns of this Generation of men; and not without cauſe. We fear the <hi>Masked Papiſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> more then the <hi>bare-faced,</hi> or then any enemy. The men that we are <hi>jealous</hi> of, and over whom we deſire you to be <hi>Vigilant,</hi> are theſe <hi>Hiders</hi> that purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcure and cover their Religion. He that wilfully concealeth his Faith, alloweth me to ſuſpect it to be naught: The chief of them are, 1. The <hi>Seekers</hi> that have not yet found a Church, a Miniſtry, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or Scripture, nor ſome of them a Chriſt to believe in. 2. The Paracelſians, Behmeniſts, and other Enthuſiaſts, that purpoſely hide themſelves in ſelf-deviſed, uncouth, cloudy terms, and pretend to viſible familiarity with ſpirits. 3. The <hi>Vani,</hi> whom God by wonders confounded in <hi>New England,</hi> but have here prevailed far in the dark. 4. The ſecret guides of the Quakers. 5. Thoſe that make it their buſineſs to argue againſt the Religion of all others, but aſſert little of their own, endeavouring to bring all men to uncertainties, and looſe them from the faith. 6. Thoſe that are ſtill vilifying or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the faithfull Godly Miniſtry. 7. Thoſe that do ſecretly or openly plead the cauſe of Infidels: (which are alas, too many: whether <hi>ex animo,</hi> or for promoting Popery, time will diſcloſe:) that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the Scriptures, and deny the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the body, or that there are any Devils, or is any Hell. 8. The <hi>Libertines,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55445:7"/>
that would have liberty for all that they can call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though againſt the certain Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and that tell us the Magiſtrate hath nothing to do with mens Religion (of which anon.) 9. The Democratical Polititions, that are buſie about the change of Government, and would bring all into confuſion under pretence of the Peoples Liberty or Power, and would have the Major Part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be the Soveraign of the reſt; that is, the worſt, that are ſtill the moſt; and the ignorant, that cannot Rule themſelves; and the vicious, that are enemies and hinderers of piety; and the worldlings, that mind nothing but what is under their feet, and have no time to think of Heaven, they have ſo much to do on earth; and as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>had rather there were one Star leſs in Heaven, then One Cow loſs in their Paſtures:</hi> theſe muſt be our Soveraigns. 10. Thoſe that under pretence of defending Prelacy, and of uniting us with <hi>Rome,</hi> do adhere to the courſe of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Sancta Clara,</hi> and Unchurch all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, degrade all the Miniſters that are not of their way, while they maintain the verity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the validity of her Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and would have the Pope to be the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium Unitatis</hi> to all the Church, and the Weſtern Parts to obey him as their Patriatch, yea and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Ruler of the whole, ſo he do it by the Laws of General Councils, and deprive not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Biſhops of their Priviledges. Theſe ten ſorts of men we are Jealous of; and if ever you advance them into places of Command or Power, it will increaſe our jealouſies. God knows, I have no perſonal grudge to any of them. But the Goſpel and the ſouls of men, and the hopes of our poſterity, are not ſo contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb facs="tcp:55445:7"/>
as to be given away as a bribe to purchaſe theſe mens good will, or to ſtop their mouths leſt they ſhould reproach us. As it is the common, but a poor redreſs, that after the Maſſacres of thouſands, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Proteſtants have ſtill had from the Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> to diſclaim the fact, or caſt it upon ſome raſh diſcontented men (which will not make dead men alive again.) So will it be a poor relief to us, when theſe men are our Maſters, and have deprived us of all that was dear to us in the world, that we eſcaped their ill language while the work was doing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We alſo humbly beſeech you, that you will go on with the <hi>purging,</hi> and <hi>encouraging</hi> of the Miniſtry: Caſting out the Ignorant and Ungodly; and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing thoſe that are Able, and Faithfull. They deny their eaſe, and dignity and the riches of the world (which other employments would afford) to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Satan and the worlds corruptions, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ſouls! And therefore the more oppoſe them and revile them, and unthankfully requite them, the more are you obliged for the ſake of Chriſt, and mens ſalvation, to aſſiſt them. All their enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſurpaſs the Devil in impudency, accuſe them of Covetouſneſs, Idleneſs and Ambition, as if theſe were the things that they ſeek after in the world. If our practice ſeconding our profeſſion, be not enough to confute theſe calumnies of malignant men, let this be added to confute them, that we make it our earneſt requeſt to your Highneſs, that all ſuch Ambitious, Idle, Covetous, or otherwiſe ſcandalous Miniſters may be caſt out. You have Commiſſioners in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for this work: Require them to do it faithfully: If we deſired this much againſt our Reproachers, they would ſay we perſecuted them: We deſire you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:55445:8"/>
but to turn this perſecution againſt our ſelves. We alſo deſire you, that you will not advance us to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Honours, or Dignities, or Power; nor make us Lord Biſhops, nor to abound with the riches of this world: Theſe things agree not with our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: We only deſire food, and rayment, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to furniſh us for our work, and expreſs ſome charity to the needy that daily expect it from us; and we crave of you that we may be no richer. We alſo deſire you, never to put the ſword into our hands, nor enable us to execute any of our private paſſions upon any, nor yet to touch mens Bodies or Eſtates; but only to manage the word and Keyes of the Kingdom of Chriſt upon mens Conſciences, and Guide his Church accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our office, and let it prevail as God ſhall bleſs it. This is all the advancement we deſire. We have doubly renounced all the world, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and as <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt; we have given up our ſelves to a difficult fleſh-diſpleaſing work: we crave no more of you but ſo far to countenance us as Chriſt commandeth you, and the good of our peoples ſouls requires. And God will be judge between us and our malitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachers, whether theſe requeſts are Covetous, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, or Unreaſonable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We alſo humbly crave your aid, for the procuring and maintaining an Union and Concord among all the Paſtors and Churches in your Dominion. All that fear God are Agreed in the main: and they have a ſpecial Love to one another; and theſe are good preparatives to their fuller reconcilement. I know that there is no ſuch diſtance in their principles, but that they may in bleſſed Concord carry on the work of God: Our poor people need this, that are offended at our ſmalleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: All our ſtrength united is too little to bear
<pb facs="tcp:55445:8"/>
down the oppoſitions of Hell and Earth that we muſt daily encounter in our work. Your help may do much to procure our Concord, of which I ſhall preſume to ſay more to you in another addreſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly we beſeech you that <hi>Toleration</hi> may be <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> by <hi>Execution</hi> as well as by <hi>Law;</hi> And therefore that as the <hi>Approved Miniſters</hi> muſt have an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of <hi>Approbation,</hi> and muſt be reſponſible before the Commiſſioners of <hi>ejection,</hi> for any thing that forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; ſo the <hi>Tolerated</hi> may be <hi>tryed</hi> according to your Laws of <hi>Toleration,</hi> and may have an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> for their <hi>Toleration,</hi> before they have Liberty publikely to propagate their Opinions to others: and that they may be as reſponſible before the Commiſſioners for ejection as we. And that publikely nor privately Papiſts, nor Infidels, nor any that deny the eſſentials of the faith may not be ſuffered to ſeduce the people. If any think that this is deſired by us, becauſe we fear the power of truth, or would deprive them of any juſt freedom of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, I provoke them ſolidly to anſwer what is here ſaid in the following Diſpute; and we diſſwade not your Highneſs if you were in any doubt (which we do not imagine) of the truth of the Chriſtian or Reformed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to invite us to an equal Diſputation, and try whether we ſhall not open the ſhame of Infidelity and Popery (the two great evils that threaten this land) at any time. But if you are reſolved of the wickedneſs of both theſe wayes, we have reaſon to expect that you ſuffer not the poyſon to be adminiſtred to your people. Give not leave to every ſeducer to do his worſt to damn mens ſouls; When you will not tolerate every Traytor to draw your Armies or people into Rebellion; nor to every wicked man to ſolicite others to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, murder, theft or deceit. And verily if men have
<pb facs="tcp:55445:9"/>
leave to preach againſt the Scripture, Churches, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Ordinances, yea and againſt the life to come under the name of Seekers, Quakers or ſuch other Sects, we had far rather that they had leave to pull off their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, and do it openly in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For <hi>as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> they will diſown abundance of the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which <hi>as Seekers, &amp;c.</hi> they propagate on deſign: And as plain dealing in Religion is better then jugling, ſo we had rather that open quiet Papiſts were tolerated, then theſe jugling deceivers. They that pretend to know the Jeſuites and Fryars, do profeſs that they are more common in Princes Councils and Families, and in the houſes, if not the cloſets of Noble men, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and perſons of publick truſt or ſervice, then we that live and mean ſimply do imagine. And who would have thought that had not know it, that they had ſo inſinuated into the ſeveral ſects among us, and that they were ſo induſtrious in their work, as the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> Scottiſh Jew was, to be circumciſed or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Jew, and then rebaptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve?</p>
                  <p>Judge I beſeech you by theſe three Reaſons, how far their <hi>ſeduction</hi> is to be tolerated. 1. That they <hi>preach Treaſon</hi> againſt Princes and States, I have ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably, is part, and a principal part of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their doctrine <hi>corrupteth almoſt all Morality:</hi> What need we fuller clearer proof, then the <hi>Janſenian</hi> hath given us in his Myſterie <hi>of Jeſuitiſm?</hi> and much more may be added. <hi>Morton</hi> hath long ago produced enough to tell us what to expect from ſuch men: <hi>Apolog. Part.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13. As from <hi>Tollet</hi> himſelf <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>de inſtruct. ſacerd. c.</hi> 9. <hi>[Quantum ad intentionem dilectionis, non tenemur ſub praecepto Deum plus omnibus diligere] Stapleton l.</hi> 6.

And <hi>p.</hi> 322. he reciteth the words of <hi>Tollet, ibid. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. teaching <hi>Equivocation</hi> upon oath before a Magiſtrate, and ſo maintaining perjury. And <hi>p</hi> 327. he citeth the ſame Author maintaining that Murder, and Blaſphemy in a paſſion and not deliberate, is no mortal ſin, unleſs in one that is uſed to Blaſpheme. And <hi>p.</hi> 329. how <hi>Bellarm. Coſterus, Valentia</hi> maintain that Fornication in a Prieſt is better, or a ſmaller ſin then to marry. The like he ſhews of their doctrine of Theft, Falſe witneſs, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 332, 333, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This from him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But above all their other miſchiefs, the <hi>Propagating of Infidelity</hi> by them is the greateſt: Which they do in two wayes. 1. Under the <hi>Vizard</hi> of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Seekers</hi> they plead againſt Scripture and Chriſtianity, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to looſen men from all Religion, and perſwade them that they muſt needs be Infidels or Papiſts: <hi>Veron</hi> and his followers have given them full Directions to manage this deſign. And while (with debauched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences) they thus perſwade men to be Infidels in jeſt, they have made abundance ſuch in good ſadneſs: ſo that upon my knowledge there are many ſuch ſwarm among us, that ſometime ſeemed pious perſons, that plead againſt Chriſtianity it ſelf. 2. And no wonder, when <hi>ſome of the leading Papiſts</hi> do ſeem to be <hi>Chriſtians in jeſt,</hi> and <hi>Infidels in good ſadneſs themſelves.</hi> I ſhall inſtance now but in their Champion, <hi>Tho. White,</hi> who in his <hi>Euclid. Metaphyſ. Stoech.</hi> K. <hi>pr.</hi> 16. maintaineth that <hi>in a manner,</hi> or <hi>almoſt all incorporated ſouls ſhall be ſaved by the world as the Inſtrument, or elſe the world were

ſubſtantially evil, and the ſouls that fail of Bleſſedneſs, non ſint ſufficientes ad partem conſiderabilem totius multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis conſtituendam.</hi> He that believeth this, cannot believe Chriſt, nor well perſwade men to believe in Chriſt. This happy news to the Pagans and Mahometans, might ſomewhat affright the Chriſtians being the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, leſt they ſhould be that <hi>inconſiderable number,</hi> but that he that talks of the damnation of ſo few, its like by his Arguments believeth it of none. The ſame he aſſerts in his <hi>Treatiſe of the middle ſtate of ſouls,</hi> Rat. 5. p. 41. And <hi>Rat.</hi> 10. he diſputeth againſt <hi>Vindictive Juſtice as a thing not becoming God:</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 88. denyeth that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>injure God,</hi> forſooth <hi>becauſe he ſuffereth it willingly.</hi> Pag. 95 <hi>(Tranſlat.)</hi> he ſaith that <hi>ſouls are exempt from all ſuch pains as may be cauſed by any outward agent:</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 111. That God Governeth not the world as a <hi>Monarch, but as an Engineer;</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 134. he ſaith <hi>[the puniſhment of ſin whether external or internal, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the increaſe and exaggeration of ſins in thoſe who are perverſe, and the decreaſe and diminution of them in thoſe who amend]</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 90. that <hi>[the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods honour occaſioned by</hi> Peter, <hi>was not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and repaired by any other]</hi> and ſo not by Chriſt. And <hi>pag.</hi> 146. <hi>[that Gods aim is alwayes the utmoſt good of every creature]</hi> And he oft enough tels us that God attaineth all his will. And is this man a Papiſt? or are Papiſts in good ſadneſs, that tell the world that none but the ſubjects of the Pope can be ſaved? and yet now the number that periſh will be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; and God aimeth at the utmoſt Good of every creature. Sure he thinks that all the Toads muſt be made men: and all men made Angels; and every ſtar muſt be made a Sun! I ſhall paſs by the Books that are written againſt the <hi>Creation,</hi> and againſt
<pb facs="tcp:55445:10"/>
                     <hi>Scripture,</hi> and againſt <hi>Hell, &amp;c.</hi> which ſwarm among us; only adviſing your Highneſs to take heed that you venture not upon any worldly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to ſtand guilty before the living God of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or tolerating ſuch Books to be publiſhed, and ſuch doctrines as theſe to be preached to your People, to the everlaſting undoing of their precious ſouls.</p>
                  <p>If you ask <hi>who it is that preſumeth thus to be your Monitor?</hi> It is one that ſerveth ſo great a Maſter that he thinks it no unwarrantable preſumption, in ſuch a caſe to be faithfully plain with the greateſt Prince. It is one that ſtands ſo neer Eternity, where <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall wear the Crown, that unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man-pleaſing would be to him a double crime: it is one that rejoyceth in the preſent happineſs of <hi>England,</hi> and earneſtly wiſheth that it were but as well with the reſt of the world; and that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the providences of God by which we have been brought to what we are; but dare not own all the actions of men that have been the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he hath thought meet to manifeſt in this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and leave upon record. And he is one that concurring in the Common Hopes of greater Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings yet to theſe Nations under your Government, and obſerving your Acceptance of the frequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes that from all parts of the Land are made unto you, was encouraged to do what you dayly allow your Preachers to do, and to concur with the reſt, in the tenders (and ſome performance) of his ſervice; and particularly the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Wilts</hi> who have <hi>Petitioned</hi> you for the <hi>Summ</hi> of what I have here expreſt; and whoſe Petitions I deſire may be

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou come hither with a practical eſteem of Truth, deſiring to know it that thou maiſt obey it, &amp; with an humble mind doſt ſtudy and pray to the Father of Lights, and art impartially willing to receive the Truth in the Love of it that thou maiſt be ſaved, and with diligence and meekneſs to read and weigh the Evidences that I bring thee, thou art then the perſon to whom I recommend theſe Papers with confident expectation of ſucceſs. The Controverſies here handled are thoſe that have made, and ſtill are making, the greateſt comhuſtions in the Chriſtian world. And yet to almoſt all men of learning on both ſides they ſeem exceeding eaſie. I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet with a Learned Proteſtant but taketh Popery for ſuch tranſparent fallacies, that he is little or no whit trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any doubtings in the buſineſs: And I ſeldom meet with a Learned Papiſt but is as confident on the other ſide, as if beſides them, all the Chriſtian world were blind and mad. Intereſt and prejudice muſt needs do much then on one ſide at leaſt. And which ſide hath the greateſt worldly intereſt to by as their underſtanding, is ſoon diſcerned by one that knows the Papalpower, their Cardinals, Prelates, and the Riches, Honours and priviledges of their Clergy, and that knows our ſtate. And if thou wilt hear the Reaſons of the confidence of both ſides, I will tell it thee here as brieſly and plainly as I can.</p>
                  <p>We are confident of our own Religion, becauſe we believe the Goſpel: and we have no other Rule and Ieſt of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55445:12"/>
And we are confident that Popery is a deceit, becauſe we both believe the Goſpel and the judgement of the ancient and preſent Churches, and becauſe we believe our ſenſe it ſelf: As ſure as we know Bread from Fleſh, and Wine from Blood, by ſeeing, taſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſure know we that Popery is falſe. And if a Controverſie is not at an End when it is brought to the judgement of all the ſenſes of all the ſound men in the world (it being about the object of ſenſe) then we are paſt hope of ending controverſies: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we will not waſte our time with every fellow that will diſpute with us that Snow is black, or the Fire cold, no more will we trouble our ſelves with theſe men that tell us that Bread is not bread, and Wine is not wine.</p>
                  <p>And if you would know the Reaſons of the confidence of the Papiſts, I know no more of them but what their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and ſpeeches do expreſs, and thoſe I have hereafter given you. Two things they are ſtill harping on: the firſt is, <hi>that in our way we have no aſſurance that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is true, or that Scripture is the word of God.</hi> Save me the labour of repetitions, and read but what I have witten in the Preface to the ſecond Part of the <hi>Saints Reſt (Edit. 2. &amp;c.)</hi> where I give you the Reſolution of our faith, and in my <hi>Safe Religion, Diſp. 3.</hi> and then believe them if thou canſt.</p>
                  <p>Their ſecond is, that thred-bare Queſtion <hi>[Where was your Church before</hi> Luther? <hi>Where hath it been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively in each age?]</hi> And here meer Sophiſtry carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it through the Papal world, to the deluding of the ſimple that will be catcht with chaffe, and are not able to ſee <hi>things</hi> for <hi>Names.</hi> I have dealt with ſome of them that harped on this ſtring, and never met with any thing from them that ſhould ſeem conſiderable to a diſcerning man, ſave only the two unanſwerable arguments of <hi>Confidence</hi> (that I ſay not <hi>Impudence)</hi> and <hi>Loquacity.</hi> Though I have more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55445:12"/>
fully ſhamed this Queſtion in this Book, I will here alſo give you at the entrance, a ſhort view of the caſe.</p>
                  <p>The men that ask us, where our Church and Religion was, either know not (through ignorance) or will not let others know (through wickedneſs) what our Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is. <hi>[Shew us</hi> (ſay they) <hi>a Church in all ages that held the thirty nine Articles, or that held all that the Proteſtants hold, or elſe they were not Proteſtants?]</hi> Forſooth, we muſt receive from them a Definition of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, and then we muſt prove the ſucceſsion of ſuch. Know therefore before you diſpute about the ſucceſsion, what is the thing whoſe ſucceſsion is queſtioned. <hi>[A Proteſtant is a Chriſtian that holdeth to the holy Scriptures as the ſufficient Rule of faith and holy living, and proteſteth againſt Popery.]</hi> The Proteſtant Churches are Societies profeſsing the Proteſtants Religion. <hi>[The Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion]</hi> is an improper ſpeech, but <hi>[the Proteſtants Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion]</hi> is a phraſe that we ſhall own. For <hi>[Proteſtancy]</hi> is not our Religion it ſelf, but the Rejection of Popiſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Religions or defiling Additions. If my Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of other mens Additions be themſelves Additions, then is it in the power of any Heretick in the world to force me to Add to my Religion at his Pleaſure. A thouſand new Articles &amp; Forms of Worſhip he may deviſe, and then muſt I add to my Religion by rejecting them all: even as I add to my Apple by wiping the dirt of it, or to my Cloaths, by bruſhing them. The Proteſtants Religion is only the Chriſtian Religion the naked Chriſtian Religion alone: The Papiſts the Chriſtian Religion corrupted with abundance of additions. The Proteſtants ever diſavowed any Confeſsions of men as pretended to be the Rule or Law of their Religion. <hi>The Proteſtants Religion is the Holy Scriptures alone]</hi> The Papiſts Religion is all that is decreed by the Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Our Religion containtd in the Scoipture hath its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55445:13"/>
and Integrals. All the Eſſentials and as much of the Integrals as (in the uſe of means) we are able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we believe particularly and explicitely: the reſt we believe generally and implicitely to be all true. So that as the Papiſts will not give us leave to take the writings of <hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Do they know our Religion better then we do? This is our Religion, and this we ſtand to.</p>
                  <p>Well! Conſider now whether any thing be eaſier then for a Proteſtant to ſhew you a viſible Church that hath ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively been of his Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Chriſtian Religion hath been in all ages ſince Chriſt in viſible Societies: The Religion of Proteſtants is the Chriſtian Religion: therefore the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants hath been in all ages ſince Chriſt in viſible Societies.</p>

That Religion which is contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as its Rule or ſufficient Revelation, hath been profeſſed in all ages in viſible Churches. But the Religion of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is contained in the Holy Scriptures as its Rule or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Revelation: therefore the Religion of Proteſtants hath been profeſſed in all ages in viſible Churches.</p>
                  <p>We name the Societies from the places of their reſidence: Our Church (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tels the Donatiſts) begun at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and thence was diſperſed into <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe;</hi> it hath continued in <hi>Syria, Aethiopia, Aegypt, India, Greece, &amp;c.</hi> If I could name but one Nation that had been of my Religion, I ſhould ſuſpect it were not the true Religion.

                     <hi>O but,</hi> ſay the Juglers, <hi>This is a General anſwer, to ſay you are Chriſtians: there are more ſorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then One.</hi> I Reply; It is the General or Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick that we are ſpeaking of; and therefore if it were not ſuch a General anſwer, it were not pertinent to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: There are no more ſorts of Chriſtians but <hi>One;</hi> that is, there is no Eſſential difference among them; but there is a gradual, integral and modal difference. But may not Chriſtians of ſeveral Degrees of Knowledge be in the ſame Catholick Church? Our queſtion is not, [Where any Sect, or any particular Church hath had its ſucceſsion:] but [where that Catholick Church hath been, of which we are members.] And ſurely Chriſt hath but <hi>One Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Is it the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or their <hi>Religion,</hi> that you would have us prove a ſucceſsion of? Theſe deceivers cheat abundance of poor ſouls by this one device, even ſuppoſing that the word <hi>[Proteſtant]</hi> doth denominate our Church from its Eſſential parts, and ſo call for a Catalogue of Proteſtants. But I would ask them, whether we or they do better know our Religion? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what a Proteſtant is? If they know it at all, it is from our writings or expreſsions; For ſure they will not pretend without ſigns to know our hearts, and that better then our ſelves. You muſt take it from us, if you will know what our Religion is, as we muſt take it from you, if we will know yours. And therefore delude not ſilly ſouls by perſwading them that you know what our Religion is better then we. If you will believe our Books that tell you, believe our ſayings alſo, and believe me that here tell you my own Religion. [A Proteſtant is a Chriſtian that

Men that never heard of the name of Papiſt or Proteſtants, may be of the ſame Religion with us. If many Nations of the world never received Popery, and we reject it; if they never knew it, and we know it and diſown it, are we not both of one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even in the Integrals? One man never heard of the Leproſie: another catcheth it and is cured of it; and a third flyeth from it and preventeth it; And I think all theſe are truly men; yea and <hi>(in tantum) ſound</hi> men. When you call to us for a proof of our ſucceſsion, either you mean it, of the Eſſentials of our Religion and Church, or of the Negation of your Corruptions: Either you mean it of the points that we are Agreed in, or of thoſe we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in: <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is it that we are Agreed in; and that is our Religion, and nothing but that: Proteſtancy as ſuch, is but our wiping off the dirt, or curing the ſcab that you have brought upon our Religion, Is he not a man as well as you that will not tumble with you in the dirt, or come into your Peſthouſe? If we know not our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then we cannot tell it you; and then you cannot know it: And if we <hi>do</hi> know it, believe us, when we profeſs our own Belief: We ſtill profeſs before men and Angels, that we own no Religion but the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor any Church but the Chriſtian Church, nor dream of any Catholick Church but one, containing all the true Chriſtians in the world, united in Jeſus Chriſt the Head. We proteſt before men and Angels that it is the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that are the Law and Rule and Teſt of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; And why are we not to be Believed in this our own Profeſsion, as well as you are in yours, when you make the Decrees of Popes and Councils to be your Law and Rule and Teſts?</p>

We perform therefore more then you demand. You ask us <hi>Where was our Church before</hi> Luther? And we anſwer, Where our Religion was.

                  <p>But ſay they, <hi>tell us of a Church that profeſſes your 39 Articles.</hi> Silly deceivers!

All this I will now manifeſt to thee.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Out-ſide</hi> of their aſſertion is that Every point that we are bound to belive by a Divine faith, is funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or eſſential to Chriſtian faith, or of neceſsity to ſalvation. And if ſo, then no man breathing can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For no man knoweth all that he is bound to know. And no man believeth that which he underſtandeth not: It is impoſsible to believe that ſuch a Propoſition is a truth diſtinctly and actually, when I underſtand not what the Propoſition is. And that we all know but in part, even what we are obliged to know, no man will deny, but he that is mad by pride or faction: All that God hath revealed in his word, is the matter of our faith: There is to man can ſay, I have no culpable ignorance of any one Truth of God that I ſhould believe. Had we been more perfect in our diligent ſtudies, and prayers, and uſe of all means; and had we never ſinfully grieved the ſpirit that ſhould illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate us, (to ſay nothing of our Original ſinfull dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) there is not one of us but might have known more then we do. If ſin of the will and life be conſiſtent with true faith, then ſome ſin in the underſtanding is conſiſtent with faith. But the former is true: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55445:16"/>
according to the out-ſide of their doctrine, no man that hath any ſinfull ignorance (and conſequently unbelief) in his underſtanding can be ſaved; that is, no man in the world. If he that thinks he knowth any thing, knoweth nothing as he ought to know, <hi>1 Cor. 8. 2.</hi> what ſhall be ſaid of theſe men, that think they and all the Church do know all things that they ought to know, and that their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have no ſin? And muſt we needs be of that faith that damneth all men, and of that Church where none are ſaved?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> As the Out-ſide of their Aſſertions is made for a bug-bear to frighten fools, ſo that the In-ſide (as expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many of them) is that Heathens and Infidels may be of their Church or ſaved, and that nothing of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith at all is neceſſary to ſalvation, is plain: For they 'tell us that they mean, that all points are of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, where they are ſufficiently propoſed, and mens ignorance is not invincible; but where there is no ſufficient propoſal, but mens ignorance is invincible, or ſuch as comes not from a wilfull neglect of means, there no ignorance of the articles of faith is damnable, and ſo no article ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary: ſo that the queſtion indeed is not Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men believe or not? but Whether they are Unbelievers or Heathens or ignorant perſons, by a willfull neglect of ſufficiently propoſed Truth, or not? So that all that part of the Heathen or Infidell world (O how great) that have no ſuch propoſals of the Goſpel, may not only be ſaved, but be better and ſafer then moſt Chriſtians (if not all) who certainly are ſinfully ignorant of ſome truth which they ought to know.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it will not ſtand with faith to deny belief to God in any thing, ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: for he that believeth him in one thing, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him in all.]</hi>

And if this be all, the Proteſtants are ready to averre upon their moſt ſolemn Oaths, that they believe every thing without exception which they know to be a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: and no wonder; for ſo doth every man that believes that there is a God and that he is no lyar. If this will ſerve your turn, you have no more to ſay againſt us; your mouths are ſtopt. But may it not ſtand with faith to be ignorant, and that through ſinfull neglect, of ſome revealed truth of God, or of the meaning of his word? If you are ſo proud as to think that all the juſtified are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and have no ſin, yet at laſt conſider whether a man that liveth in Heatheniſm til fourſcore years of age, and then turns Chriſtian, is not afterward ignorant through his former ſinfull negligene?

                  <p>But if indeed it be not the want of Neceſſary Articles of Faith that they accuſe us of, but the want of willingneſs or diligence to know the truth, let them prove their accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and let thoſe perſons that they prove guilty bear the blame. Do they think we would not as willingly know the truth as they? and that we do not pray as earneſtly for Divine illumination? Do we not read their Books?

                  <p>But yet they have not done with us.

You take the <hi>39</hi> Articles for our Religion, and yet may Hereticks that are far from our minds, pretend to them. It's the liker to be the Rule becauſe all Hereticks pretend it, and would borrow credit from it to their Hereſies. The Law of the Land is the Rule of our Juſtice; and yet Lawyers and their Clients that are contrary to each other, do plead it for their contrary Cauſes. The Creed it ſelf is pretended by Arrians for their Hereſie. What muſt we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55445:18"/>
have no Rule or Teſt or diſcovery of our Religion which a Heretick can pretend for his impiety. What words of God or man are not capable of being miſinterpreted? If we ſhould give you every day a confeſsion of Faith, ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks might pretend to hold the ſame: No wonder then if they do ſo by the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> And can any Learned Papiſts be ſo ignorant, as not to know that the Arrians pretended the Authority of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils? and ſo do many other Hereticks; and that the Authority of Pope and Councils are frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for contrary opinions among them, and may be pretended by many an Heretick? And will they therefore grant that the Decrees of Popes and Councils are no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſcovery of their Faith? If Hereticks pretending to <hi>your Teſt</hi> of Faith, diſprove not that to be <hi>your Faith,</hi> then Hereticks pretending to <hi>our Rule</hi> and Teſt of Faith (which is the Holy Scripture) is no proof that it is <hi>not</hi> our Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>I do therefore conclude, that the Proof of a Succeſsion of ſuch Churches as have received the Holy Scriptures, is a valid proof of a ſucceſsion of Churches of our Religion, ſeeing we have no Religion (doctrinally) but the Holy Scriptures. And this as far as modeſty will permit, I challenge all the Jeſuites on Earth to confute with any ſolid Reaſons: yet adding that we do <hi>ex ſuperabundanti</hi> prove a ſucceſsion alſo of Churches that never owned Popery, even the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world. But let theſe men themſelves but prove to us a ſucceſsion of their Church, even ſuch as they require of us; Let them prove that from the Apoſtles days the Catholick Church (or any one Congregation of twenty men) did hold all that now their Councils and Popes have Decreed, and are eſteemed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their Faith, and I am contented to be their bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave for ever, or to bear a fagot, or be uſed by them as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55445:18"/>
cruelly as their malice can invent, or flames or their ſtrappado's execute. Let my Head be at their Mercy if they can but prove that Succeſsion of Popery, as they require us to do of Proteſtancy, or as I have produced of our Churches and Religion. In the <hi>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> and <hi>16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> Detection I have more largely ſpoken to them of this point, to which I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>In the very principal point of <hi>their Papal Soveraignty,</hi> they have nothing but this groſs deceit to cheat the world with: The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors divers ages after Chriſt, did give the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> a Primacy in their Empire, and hence theſe men would perſwade us, that even from Chriſt they have had a Soveraignty over all the Chriſtian world. Wink but at theſe ſmall miſtakes, and they have won the Cauſe: <hi>1.</hi> Suppoſe but Chriſts Inſtitution to ſtand in ſtead of the Emperors. <hi>2.</hi> Suppoſe divers hundred years after Chriſt, to have been in the Apoſtles days. <hi>3.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Primacy to be Soveraignty or Univerſal Government. <hi>4.</hi> But eſpecially grant them, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was all the Chriſtian world; and then they have made good that part of their Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>That there were many Nations without the reach of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that had received the Chriſtian Faith, is paſt doubt. <hi>Socrates lib. 1. c. 15. ſaith that</hi> Thomas <hi>choſe</hi> Parthia, Bartholomew <hi>choſe</hi> India, Matthew Ethiopia, <hi>to plant the Goſpel in; but the middle</hi> India <hi>was not converted till</hi> Conſtantines <hi>days, by</hi> Frumentius <hi>and</hi> Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius; <hi>and</hi> Iberia <hi>by a Maid.]</hi> So <hi>Euſeb. l. 3. c. 3. tells us of</hi> Thomas <hi>his Preaching to the</hi> Parthians, <hi>and</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew <hi>to the</hi> Scythians. <hi>]</hi> Et in vit. Conſt. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>8. that there were many Churches in</hi> Perſia, &amp; cap. <hi>91. how</hi> Conſtantine <hi>wrote for them to the King.] Godignus</hi> and others of them maintain that the <hi>Abaſſines</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpel from the beginning. Beſides <hi>Scotland</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55445:19"/>
and many other Countries that were not under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. And none of theſe were Governed by the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three Arguments againſt the Papal Cauſe, I ſhall here premiſe to more that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> If all that part of the Chriſtian world that was out of the reach of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, did never ſubmit to the Soveraignty of the Pope, then hath he not been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively (or at any time) the actual Head of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church: But the Antecedent is moſt certain: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo is the Conſequent.</p>
                  <p>How an old woman, the Emperors Mother of <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> did baffle their Jeſuites, by asking them <hi>[</hi> How it came to paſs, if obedience to the Pope be neceſſary to ſalvation, that they never had heard from him till now? <hi>]</hi> I have told you after from themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If Primacy were Soveraignty, and Emperors and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were Gods, yet the <hi>Indians, Abaſſines, Perſians,</hi> and many more in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Sweeds,</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and moſt of <hi>Germany</hi> in the Weſt and North, ſhould be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Pope.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> If the Rule and Teſt of the Faith of Papiſts never had a Real Being, or no ſucceſsion from the Apoſtles, then their Faith and Church hath either no Real Being, or no ſuch Succeſsion: But the Antecedent is true: as I prove.</p>
                  <p>It is either General Councils, or Popes, or the Church Eſſential (as they uſe to call it, that is, the Whole Body) that is the Rule of their Faith. If it be General Councils, <hi>1.</hi> They had no being from the Apoſtles till the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> therefore the Rule of the Papiſts Faith was then unborn. <hi>2.</hi> Yea they never had a being in the world: There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing like a General Council ſince the days of the Apoſtles to this day. The firſt at <hi>Nice</hi> had none, (ſave one <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who its like was ſome perſecuted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55445:19"/>
Biſhop that was fled, or if one or two more its not material), but the Biſhops of the Empire, and out of the Weſtern parts ſo few as was next to none: The following Councils, as <hi>Conſtantinop. 1. &amp;c.</hi> were only out of one piece of the Empire: The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> I diſdain to reckon among the modeſter pretenders to an Univerſality.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> And if it be not General Councils, but the Pope that is the Rule of their Faith; then, <hi>1.</hi> Their Faith hath been interrupted, yea and turned to Hereſie and to Infidelity when the Pope hath ſo turned. <hi>2.</hi> And why then do they tell our people, that they take not the Pope for the Rule of their Faith?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> If it be the Major part of the Univerſal Church, <hi>1.</hi> It's known that two to one are againſt them, or at leaſt the Greater part: therefore by that Rule their Faith in the Papal Soveraignty is falſe. <hi>2.</hi> And yet it would be hard, if a man muſt be of no Belief, till he have brought the world to the pole for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum. 3.</hi> If all the ſtir that the Papiſts make in the world for the Papal Government be but to rob Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates of their Power, then are they but a ſeditious Sect: But the Antecedent is apparent: For there are but two ſorts of Government in the Church: The one is by the Word applyed unto the Conſcience, which worketh only on the willing; either by General exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as in Preaching; or by perſonal application, as in Sacraments, Excommunication and Abſolution: And this is the work of the preſent Paſtors, and cannot be performed by the Pope: Nor would he be content with this, to govern Volunteers. The other is by Commands, that ſhall be ſeconded with force: And this is proper to the Magiſtrate. But if they will be deluded to give up their Crowns and Scepters to the Pope, let them ſtand as the objects of the compaſsion of Spectators.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE thoughts of the divided ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have brought one of the greateſt and conſtanteſt ſadneſs to my Soul, that ever it was acquainted with; eſpecially to remember, that while we are quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and plotting, and writing, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt each other, ſo many parts of the world (about five of ſix) remain in the Infidelity of <hi>Heatheniſm, Judaiſm</hi> or <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> where millions of poor ſouls do need our help; and if all our ſtrength were joyned together for their Illumination and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it would be too little. Oh horrible ſhame to the face
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55445:26"/>
of Chriſtendom, that the Nations are quietly ſerving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and the Turk is in poſſeſſion of ſo many Countries, that once were the Inheritance of Chriſt, and that his Iron yoak is ſtill upon the necks of the perſecuted <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that he ſtands up at our doors in ſo formidable a poſture, ſtill ready to devour the reſt of the Chriſtian world; and yet that inſtead of combining to reſiſt him, and vindicate the cauſe and people of the Lord, we are greedily ſucking the blood of one another, and tearing in pieces the body of Chriſt with furious hands, and deſtroying our ſelves to ſave the enemy a labour, and ſpending that wit, that treaſure, that labour and that blood, to daſh our ſelves in pieces on one another, which might be nobly, and honeſtly, and happily ſpent in the cauſe of God.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thoughts provoked me to many an hours conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, How the wounds of the Church might be yet healed; And have made it long a principal part of my daily Prayers, that the Reconciling Light might ſhine from Heaven, that might in ſome good meaſure take up our differences; and that God would at laſt give healing Principles and diſpoſitions unto men, eſpecially to Princes and the Paſtors of the Church. But the more I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died how it might be done, the more difficult, if not impoſſible it appear'd, and all becauſe of the <hi>Romane</hi> Tyranny, the Vice-Chriſt or pretended Head of the Church, being with them become an eſſential part of it, and the Subjection to him eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to our Chriſtianity it ſelf. So that (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) <hi>No man, though he would, can be a Subject of Chriſt, that is not ſubject to the Pope;</hi> and this with abundance of into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable corruptions they have fixed by the fancy of their own Infallibility, and built upon this foundation a worldly Kingdom, and the temporal Riches and Dignity of a numerous Clergy, twiſting ſome Princes alſo into the Intereſt; ſo that they cannot poſſibly yield to us in the very principal points of difference, unleſs they will deny the very Eſſence of their New Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Church, and pluck up the foundations which they have ſo induſtriouſly laid, and leave men to a ſuſpicion that they are fallible hereafter, if they ſhall confeſs themſelves miſtaken in any thing now; and unleſs they will be ſo admirably ſelf-denying, as to let go the temporal advantages which ſo many thouſands of them are intereſted in: And whether ſo much light may be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55445:26"/>
hoped for in ſo dark a generation, or ſo much love to God, and ſelf-denyal in millions of men ſo void of ſelf-denyal, is eaſie to conjecture: And we cannot in theſe <hi>greateſt</hi> matters come over to them, unleſs we will flatly betray our Souls, and depart from the Unity of the Catholick Church, and from the Center of that Unity, to unite with another called the <hi>Romane Catholick Church,</hi> in another Center. And if we ſhould thus caſt away the Truth and Favour of God, and ſin againſt our Knowledge and Conſcience, and ſo prove men of <hi>no Faith or Religion,</hi> under pretence of deſiring a <hi>Unity</hi> in Faith and Religion, yet all would not do the thing intended, but we ſhould certainly miſs of theſe very ends which we ſeek, when we had ſold the Truth and our Souls to obtain them. For there is nothing more certain, then that the Chriſtian World will never unite in the <hi>Romane</hi> Vice-Chriſt, nor agree with them in their Corruptions, againſt plain Scripture, Tradition, Conſent of the ancient Church, againſt the Reaſon and common ſenſe of Mankind, This is not by any wiſe man to be expected. Never did the univerſal Church, or one half of it center to this day in the <hi>Romane</hi> Soveraignty: And why ſhould they hope for that which never yet was done? When they had their Primacy of Place (to be the Biſhop of the firſt Seat, and firſt of the Patriarcks) it made the Pope no more a Soveraign and a Vice-Chriſt, then the King of <hi>France</hi> is Soveraign to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> or <hi>Bavaria;</hi> or then the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Juſtice on the Bench is the Soveraign of the reſt: and yet even this much he never had but from the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire: What claim did he ever lay in his firſt Uſurpations, to any Church without thoſe bounds? It was the Empire that raiſed him, and the Empire limited his own Uſurpations. Saith their own <hi>Reinerius,</hi> (or whoever elſe) <hi>Cont. Waldenſ. Catal. in Biblioth. Patr.

                     <p>BEfore I mention the Grounds or Cauſe that you muſt maintain, I muſt premiſe this Advice to the Common People.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Wrong not the Truth and your ſelves by an unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. Enter not raſhly upon Diſputes with thoſe that are Learned and of nimble tongues, if you be ignorant, or of weak capacities your ſelves. Though I ſhall here ſhew you that Scripture, Church, Tradition, Reaſon and Senſe are on your ſide, yet experience tels us how the words of Juglers have made millions of men deny belief to their eyes, their taſte and other ſenſes. An ignorant man is ſoon ſilenced by a ſubtile wit; and many think that when they cannot anſwer, they muſt yield, though they deny both Senſe and Reaſon by it. If any of them ſecretly entice you, deſire them to debate the caſe with ſome able, learned, experienced Miniſter in your hearing. It is the office of your Paſtors to defend you from the wolves: If you once deſpiſe them or ſtraggle from them and the Flocks, and truſt to your own Reaſon that is unfurniſhed and unprepared for ſuch work, you may take that you get by it, if you be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. You need the help of Paſtors for your ſouls, as well as of Phyſicians for your Bodies, and Lawyers for your Eſtates: or elſe God would never have ſet them over you in his Church. Let them but come on equal terms, and you ſhall ſee what Truth can do. In this way we will not avoid a Conference with any of them. But alas! with ignorant unlearned people, what may not ſuch Deceivers do? that can perſwade ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand ſouls to give no Credit to their own eyes, or taſte, or feeling, but to believe a Prieſt, that Bread is not Bread, and Wine is not Wine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet I would have the weakeſt to endeavour to <hi>underſtand</hi> the <hi>reaſons</hi> of their Profeſſion, and to be <hi>able</hi> to repell Deceivers: And to that end, I ſhall here give you firſt ſome Directions concerning the cauſe which you muſt defend.</p>
                     <p>And concerning this, Obſerve theſe things following 1. Underſtand what the <hi>Religion</hi> is that you muſt hold and maintain: It is the antient Chriſtian Religion. Do not put every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55445:28"/>
Truth among the Eſſentials of your Religion: Our Religion doth not ſtand or fall with every Controverſie that is raiſed about it. That which was the true Religion in the Apoſtles days is ours now: that which all were baptized into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of, and the Churches openly held forth as their Belief. Reformation brings us not a new Religion: but cleanſeth the old from the droſs of Popery, which by innovation they had brought in. A man that cannot confute a Papiſt, may yet be a Chriſtian, and ſo hold faſt the true Religion. It followeth not that our Religion is queſtionable or unſafe, if ſome point in Controverſie between them and us be queſtionable or hard. The Papiſts would fain bring you to believe that our Religion muſt lie upon ſome of theſe Controverſies: but its no ſuch matter Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>That then it is not about Religion that we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them.</hi> I anſwer; yes: it is about the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of their Religion, but it is but for the preſerving the <hi>Integrity</hi> of <hi>ours</hi> againſt the Conſequences and additions of theirs. They have made them a <hi>New</hi> Religion (which we call Popery) and joined this to the <hi>Old</hi> Religion (which we call Chriſtianity.) Now we ſtick to the old Religion alone; and therefore there is more eſſential to <hi>their</hi> Religion, then is to ours; ſo that our <hi>own</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even the <hi>ancient Chriſtianity,</hi> is out of Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. The Papiſts do confeſs that the Creed, the Lords Prayer, the ten Commandments are true, yea that all the Scripture is the word of God, and certainly true: ſo that our Religion is granted us as paſt diſpute: And therefore it is only the Papiſts Religion that is in queſtion between us, and not ours. If you will make thoſe lower Truths to be of the Eſſence of your Religion which are not, you will give the Papiſts the advantage which they deſire.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Papiſts call for a Rule, or Teſt of your Religion, and ask you where they may find it, aſſign them to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and not to any Confeſsions of Churches, further then as they agree with that. We know of no Divine Rules and Laws of Faith and Life, but the holy Scripture (and the hearts of Believers have an imperfect Tranſcript of them.) The Confeſsions of Churches are but part of the Holy Scripture, or Collections out of them, containing the points of greateſt weight: And if in phraſe or order (much more in matter) there
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55445:28"/>
be any thing humane, we make it not our Rule, nor are we bound to make it good, no more then the Writings of godly men. A point is not therefore with us an Article of Faith, becauſe our Churches or a Synod put it into a Confeſsion, but becauſe it is in the Word of God. For a Councils determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations do with us differ but gradually from the Judgement of a ſingle man, in this reſpect. And therefore we give them the Scripture only as the full Doctrine of our Faith, and the perfect Law of God; And thoſe points in it, which Life or Death is laid upon, and God hath told us, we cannot be ſaved without, we take as the Eſſentials of our Religion, and the reſt as the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grals only.</p>
                     <p>If they ask, <hi>Why then we do draw up Confeſſions of Faith?</hi> I anſwer, 1. To teach and help the people by gathering to their hands the moſt neceſſary points, and giving them ſometimes an explication of them. 2. To let our Accuſers ſee that we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand not the Scriptures. 3. To let Paſtors and other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects know what ſence of Scripture the Magiſtrate will own within his Dominions. 4. And to let the Paſtors and the world know what ſence in the principal Points we are agreed in. But ſtill we take not our Confeſſions for our Divine Rule; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any errour in a Confeſſion, there is none in the Rule of our Religion, and conſequently none in the Religion which we all agree in; but only in ſuch a perſons or Churches expoſition of the Rule, which yet among Chriſtians is not in any eſſential Point.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Underſtand well what is the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that when the Papiſts ask you what Church you are of, or call to you to prove its antiquity or truth, you may give them a ſound and Catholick anſwer. The Catholick Church is the whole number of true Chriſtians upon earth (for we meddle not now with that part which is in Heaven.) It is not tyed to Proteſtants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor to the Greeks only, much leſs to the Romaniſts only, or to any other party whatſoever; but it comprehendeth all the members of Chriſt; and as viſible, it containeth all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Chriſtian Religion by a credible profeſſion. If the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion may be known, then a man may know that he is a Chriſtian, and conſequently a member of the Catholick Church. But if the Chriſtian Religion cannot be known, then no man can
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55445:29"/>
know which is the Church, or which is a Chriſtian. All Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans united to Chriſt the Head, are this Catholick Church. If you tye the Church to your own party, and make a wrong deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, you will enſnare your ſelves, and ſpoil your belief, and your defence of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Run not into extreams: mix not any unſound principles with your Religion. For if you do, the Papiſts will cull out thoſe, and by diſgracing them, will ſeem to diſgrace your Religion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Uſe not any unſound Arguments to defend the Truth. For if you do, the truth will ſuffer, and ſeem to be overthrown by the weakneſs of your Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Joyn not with thoſe men that caſt out any Ordinance of God, becauſe the Papiſts have abuſed it. Reformation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Inſtitutions is not by the Abolition of them, but by the Reſtauration of them. There are few things in uſe among the Papiſts themſelves as parts of worſhip, but may lead us up to a good original, or tell us of ſome other real Duty which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into theſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Joyn not with thoſe ignorant, unpeaceable, ſelf-conceited, womaniſh, rabious Divines, or private men, that pour out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy reproaches at godly men among our ſelves, as if they were Hereticks, or ſuch as the Churches ſhould diſ-own. For theſe are they that pleaſe the Papiſts, and harden them in their Error, and offend the weak. They think they may call us Hereticks or Blaſphemers by authority, when we call one another ſo. Such Railers teach them what to ſay, and play their game more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually then they could do their own. When they are alluring the ſimple people, how ſoon will they prevail, if they can but prove their charge againſt us from the pens of Proteſtants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
                     <p>Having told you on what grounds you muſt make good your cauſe againſt them, I ſhall next give you three or four eaſie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (ſome of them formerly given you) by which even the weakeſt may prove that Popery is but deceit.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 1. <hi>IF there be any godly honeſt men on earth beſides Papiſts, then Popery is falſe and not of God. But there be godly honeſt men on earth beſides Papiſts: therefore Popery is falſe, and not of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is proved thus. It is an Article of the Popiſh faith, that there are no godly honeſt men on earth, beſides Papiſts: therefore if there be any ſuch, Popery is falſe, (By godly honeſt men, I mean ſuch as have true love to God, and ſo are in a ſtate of ſalvation.) The Antecedent I prove thus. 1. Their very definition of the Church doth make the Pope the Head, and confine the memberſhip only to his ſubjects, making the Roman Catholick Church (as they call it) the whole. 2. But yet leſt any ignorant Papiſts ſay, <hi>I may be a Roman Catholick without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that all others are ungodly, and ſhall be damned,</hi> I will give it you in the Determination of a Pope and general Councll. <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, <hi>Abrog. Pragm. ſanct. Bull.</hi> in the 17<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at the <hi>Laterane,</hi> ſaith <hi>[And ſeeing it is of neceſſity to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all the faithful of Chriſt be ſubject to the Pope of Rome, as we are taught by the teſtimony of divine Scripture, and of the holy Fathers, and it is declared in the Conſtitution of Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> 7. &amp;c.] And Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond was converted from being <hi>Aenaeas Sylvius</hi> by this Doctrine of a Cardinal, approved by him at large, <hi>Bull. Retract.</hi> in the Vol. 4. of <hi>Binnius,</hi> p. 514. <hi>[I came to the Fountain of Truth, which the holy Doctors, both Greek and Latine ſhew; who with one voyce ſay, that he cannot be ſaved that holdeth not the unity of the holy Church of Rome; and that all thoſe vertues are maimed to him that refuſeth to obey the Pope of Rome; though he lye in ſack cloth and aſhes, and faſt and pray both day and night, and ſeem in the other things to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law of God.]</hi> So that if a Pope and General Council be falſe, then Popery is falſe. For <hi>their</hi> infallibility is the ground of their faith, and they take it on their unerring authority. But if the Pope and a General Council be to be believed, then no man but a ſubject of the Pope can be ſaved: no, though he faſt and pray in ſack-cloth and aſhes day and night, and ſeem to fulfill the reſt of the Law of God. Its certain therefore that if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55445:30"/>
any one of you that call your ſelves Romane Catholicks do not believe that all the world ſhall be damned ſave your ſelves, you are indeed no Romance Catholicks, but are Hereticks your ſelves in their account; for you deny a principal Article of their faith; and deny the Infallibility of the Pope with a General Council, which is your very Foundation.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we find that even in the great charitable work of reducing the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> the Jeſuite <hi>Gonzalus Rodericus</hi> in his ſpeech to the Emperours mother laid ſo great a ſtreſs on this point, that when ſhe profeſſed her ſubjection to Chriſt, he told her, that <hi>[None are ſubject to Chriſt that are not ſubject to his Vicar,] [Negavi Chriſto ſubjici qui ejus vicario non ſubjicitur.] Godignus de reb. Abaſsin. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18. in <hi>Roderic. liter.</hi> p. 323.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith <hi>(de Eccl. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.) that <hi>[no man though he would can be ſubject to Chriſt that is not ſubject to the Pope]</hi> that is, he cannot be a Chriſtian. And therefore <hi>Card. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> (then Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon.)</hi> tels the Proteſtants that they were not to be called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And <hi>Knot</hi> againſt <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> with abundance more of them, aſſerting that Proteſtants cannot be ſaved, do eaſily learn to practice this Leſſon of the Pope and Council. I come now to prove that your Pope, and Councill, and Faith are falſe, and that others beſides you may be in a ſtate of Charity and Salvation. (For you confeſs your ſelves, that he that is in a ſtate of Charity, is in a ſtate of Salvation.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>If a man may know his own heart, then there are others beſides Papiſts that are in Charity, and are godly men:</hi> (and ſo in a ſtate of Salvation) But a <hi>man may know his own heart:</hi> therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Conſequence of the Major is plain by inward experience to every godly, honeſt man that knoweth himſelf. If I can know my own heart, I muſt needs ſay I love God, and am not void of ſincere Godlineſs and Honeſty. And that I may know my own heart I can tell alſo by experience: For to know my own Knowledge and Will is an ordinary certain thing, if not by intuition it ſelf. And if a man cannot know whether he believe and love God or not, then no man can give thanks for it, nor make Profeſſion of it: nay men cannot converſe together, if they cannot know their own minds. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55445:30"/>
we may have a moral Conjectural certainty that we have true Love, and are juſtified. And then I have a moral conjectural certainty at leaſt, that Popery is falſe; becauſe I have at leaſt ſuch a certainty that I am not ungodly or unjuſtified. So that look what meaſure of knowledge or perſwaſion any Proteſtant hath that he is truly honeſt and juſtified, that meaſure of knowledge muſt he needs have (if he underſtand himſelf) that Popery is a deceit.</p>
                     <p>So that from hence you may gather theſe four concluſions; 1. <hi>That all that have any knowledge or perſwaſion that they are not ungodly unjuſtified perſons themſelves, and void of the true Love of God, are quite out of danger from turning Papiſts,</hi> if they underſtand but what Popery is; and if they do not, they cannot turn to it, but in part.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That never any honeſt godly man did turn Papiſt in the world;</hi> and this the Papiſts themſelves will juſtifie: For they ſay (by a Pope and general Council) that no man can be ſaved but a Papiſt: and they generally hold, that all that have Charity and are juſtified, ſhall be ſaved if they ſo die. So that if Popery be true, then no man had Charity or true Godlineſs before he was a Papiſt: and therefore never did one godly man or woman turn Papiſt. And therefore let them take the honour of their wicked ſeduced Ones. What glory is it to them that none ever turned to them but ungodly people?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And it followeth that the <hi>Papiſts do not ſo much as deſire or invite any godly man to turn to them.</hi> If you underſtand their meaning, they call you not to turn to them, if you are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſons.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And hence it follows that every one that turneth Papiſt, doth thereby confeſs that he was a wicked man before, and that he had not the leaſt true love to God; that he was not juſtified, but a graceleſs wretch.</p>
                     <p>In a word, all you that do but know or hope that you have any ſaving Grace, have an Argument here againſt Popery, which all the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in the world cannot confute. For you know your own hearts better then they: And they have no way to turn you to them, but by perſwading you that you are not what you are, and that you know not what you know. So that plainly this is your Argument, <hi>[I know, or I have good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55445:31"/>
that I am not utterly void of Charity or ſaving Grace; therefore I know, or have the ſame perſwaſions that Popery is falſe, which determineth that none have Charity or ſaving Grace but Papiſts.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I proceed to a further proof of the Minor; A man may have a very ſtrong <hi>Conjecture</hi> that <hi>many others</hi> that are no Papiſts have ſaving Grace; though he had no perſwaſion that he hath ſuch Grace himſelf. And conſequently he muſt have as ſtrong a conjecture that Popery is falſe. What abundance of holy heavenly perſons have we known of all ranks among us! Such as have lived in dayly breathings after God, ſpending no ſmall part of their lives upon their knees; and in the ſerious and reverent attendance upon God in holy worſhip, meditating day and night upon his Law; hating all known ſin, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in holineſs, and longing for perfection; and living in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Temperance and Chaſtity, abhorring the very appearance of evill, and making conſcience of an idle word or thought, devoting their lives and labors, and all they have to God, giving all their Eſtates (ſome of them) to pious and charitable uſes, except what is neceſſary for their dayly bread, even mean cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and food; taming their bodies, and bringing them into ſubjection, and denying themſelves, and mortifying the fleſh, and contemning all the Honors or Riches of the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſuffer death it ſelf, (as many of their Brethren have done from the Papiſts) rather then ſin wilfully againſt God and their conſciences: in a word, living to God, and longing to be with him, and manifeſting theſe longings to the very death; grieving more at any time, if they have but loſt the ſenſe and perſwaſions of the love of God, then if they had loſt all the world; and would give a thouſand worlds, if they had them, for more of the Love of God in their ſouls, and fuller aſſurance of his Love and Communion with him. As far as words, and groans, and tears, and the very drift of a mans life, and the expending of all that he hath, can help us to know another mans heart, ſo far do we know all this by others, that have lived among us. And may we not conjecture, and be ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that theſe, or ſome of theſe, or ſome one of theſe, was a holy juſtified perſon?</p>
                     <p>And now Reader, if ever thou be tempted to be a Papiſt, I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55445:31"/>
will tell thee what a task thou haſt: Look on one ſide on the Lives of holy men among us, ſuch as was Mr. <hi>Dodd, Mr. Paul Bayn,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilderſham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sibbs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> with many hundreds more; Beſides bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Bradford, Glover, Sanders, Hooper,</hi> and the reſt that laid down their lives in the flames in teſtimony againſt Popery; beſides all the thouſands that in other Nations have dyed by the Papiſts hands, becauſe they durſt not ſin againſt God; and beſides all the Learned holy Divines of other Nations, and the millions of Godly Proteſtants there; as alſo look upon all the godly that are now living, men or women, that live in moſt earneſt ſeeking after God and ſerving him; look on thoſe about you, enquire of others; read the writings of holy Divines: and then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>you cannot turn Papiſt till you have concluded that all theſe are damned, and are utterly void of ſaving Grace and the Love of God;</hi> If there be but one Proteſtant that you know, or any one of all that have been, that you take to be in a ſaving ſtate, you cannot poſſibly turn Papiſt, if you know what you do. For it is eſſential to Popery to contradict all this.</p>
                     <p>Nay, this is not all: but think of all the Greek Church that lyeth under the tyranny of the Turk, and of all the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Abaſines,</hi> and other Chriſtians in the world, that are more in number far then the Papiſts; and you muſt conclude, that <hi>not one of all theſe are ſaved before you can be a Papiſt.</hi> And is this an eaſie task to one that hath the heart of a man in his breſt? If you are no true Chriſtians your ſelves, dare you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that not one of theſe are true Chriſtians? If you confeſs that you love not God your ſelves, dare you ſay that among the far greater part of the Chriſtians of the world, there is not one man or woman that loves God? This you muſt ſay if you will be a Papiſt.</p>
                     <p>And then on the other hand, Look on the words of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſee what thanks he will give you for ſuch a cenſure, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged: for with what judgement ye judge, ye ſhall be judged: and with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you meet, it ſhall be meaſured to you again. And why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt thou the mote in thy brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye?—Thou hypocrite! firſt caſt out the beam

out of thine own eye, and then ſhalt thou ſee cleerly to caſt out the mote out of thy brothers eye.]</hi> Jam. 4. 12. <hi>There is one Law-giver that is able to ſave and to deſtroy: who art thou that Judgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?]</hi> Rom. 14. 1, 2, 3, 4, 10. <hi>[Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful diſputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth herbs: Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth; for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he ſtandeth or falleth; yea he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.

For it is written, as I live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God; ſo then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more.]</hi> Matth. 18. 6. <hi>[But whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that be were drowned in the depth of the Sea.]</hi> Mat. 25. 40, 45, 34, 41. <hi>[Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom—For I was hungry and ye gave me meat—Verily I ſay unto you, in as much at you have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.]</hi> And ver. 41. <hi>[De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire—Verily I ſay unto you, in as much as you did it not to one of</hi> the leaſt <hi>of theſe, you did it not to me.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will recite no more: Judge now by ſuch paſſage as theſe, how Chriſt ſets by <hi>one of the leaſt</hi> of his ſervants: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how he will take it of you, to judge the far greateſt part of his Church to be graceleſs and none of his Church, but ſuch as ſhall be damned. And if you dare not venture on ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inhumane a cenſure, againſt the experience of ſo much holineſs as appeareth in them before your eyes, then you cannot be Papiſts: And if you dare venture on it, I leave you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether under pretence of being the only Chriſtians, you have not done violence to the common reaſon and nature of man. So much for the ſecond proof of the <hi>Minor.</hi>

3. But I have yet another proof, <hi>that many that are no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are good Chriſtians, and conſequently, that Popery is a deceit,</hi> and that is <hi>the Teſtimony of many of their own Writers.</hi> I will not call for their teſtimony concerning our ſelves (for we know our ſelves better then they do) but concerning other Churches whom they condemn as Hereticks, or that are no ſubjects of the Pope of Rome. And I will at this time content my ſelf with one of many that might be cited; and that is a Monk, <hi>Burchardus</hi> that lived in the Holy Land, and having wrote a Deſcription of it, and thoſe that inhabit it, ſaith of them as followeth, <hi>p.</hi> 325, 326. <hi>[And for thoſe that we judge to be damned Hereticks, as the</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Jacobites, Maronites, Georgians, <hi>and the like, I found them to be for the moſt part good and ſimple men, and living ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely toward God and men; they are of great abſtinence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And of the Romane Catholicks he ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 323. <hi>[There are in the Land of Promiſe men of every Nation under Heaven, and every Nation lives after their own Rites: and, to ſpeak the very truth, to our own great confuſion, there are none found in it, that are worſe, and more corrupt in manners then Chriſtians]</hi> (he means Papiſts.)</p>
                     <p>And page 324. he tels us, that the Syrians, Greeks, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Georgians, Neſtorians, Nubians, Jubeans, Chaldaeans, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronites, Ethiopians, Egyptians, <hi>and many other Nations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, there inhabit; and that ſome are ſchiſmaticks not ſubject to the Pope; and others called Hereticks, as the</hi> Neſtorians, Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, <hi>&amp;c. but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are many in theſe ſects that are very ſimple (or ſincere) knowing nothing of hereſies: devoted to Chriſt: macerating the fleſh with faſtings, and cloathed with the moſt ſimple garments, ſo that they far excel the very Religious of the Church of Rome.]</hi> ſo you hear an Adverſaries teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>Well then, when a Papiſt can prove to me, that I love not God, contrary to my own experience of my ſelf: and when he can make me believe that no one of all the holy Heavenly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of my acquaintance, Miniſters, or people, are in a ſtate of charity or Juſtification: and that no one Chriſtian on earth ſhall be ſaved but a Papiſt, then I will turn Papiſt: And till then they do not deſire me to turn. But I muſt ſolemnly profeſs that this belief is ſo difficult to me, and abhorred by my reaſon, and my whole heart, and ſo contrary to my own knowledge, and to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55445:33"/>
abundant evidence, and to all Chriſtian charity, that I think I ſhall as ſoon be perſwaded to believe that I am not a man, and that I have not the uſe of ſence or reaſon, or that Snow is black, and the Crow white, as to believe this Eſſential point of Popery. I ſhould a hundred times eaſier be brought to doubt whether I have the love of God my ſelf, then to conclude all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the world ſave the Papiſts, to be the heirs of damnation.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 2. <hi>THat Doctrine is not true nor of God which teacheth men to renounce all Chriſtian Love and Works of Chriſtian Love, towards moſt of the Chriſtians upon earth: But ſo doth the Doctrine of Popery; therefore it is not of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If their Error were meerly ſpeculative, it were the leſs; but here we ſee the fruits of it, and whither it tends. The major Propoſition is plainly proved from <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. <hi>[By this ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another.]</hi> Col. 1. 4. <hi>It muſt be a [Love to all the Saints.]</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 9. <hi>But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye your ſelves are taught of God to love one another.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſpecial Love is the Commandment of Chriſt, the new Commandment; without this, no man can be a Lover of God, nor be loved of him as a Member of Chriſt, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 11, 12, 14, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 7, 8, 11, 12, 20, 21. 2 <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 12, 17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. He that loveth not a Chriſtian as a Chriſtian, with a ſpecial love you may ſee in theſe Texts is none of the Sons of God. And that the Papiſts teach men to deny this ſpecial Chriſtian Love to moſt Chriſtians in the world, I prove. They that teach men to take moſt true Chriſtians in the world for no true Chriſtians, but for Hereticks or ungodly perſons that ſhall be damned, do teach them to deny the ſpecial love and works of love to moſt true Chriſtians: But thus do the Papiſts; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How can a man love him as a Chriſtian or a godly man, whom he muſt take to be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or an ungodly man? Its true they may yet love them as Creatures, and ſo they muſt the Devils; and they may love them as men, and ſo they muſt the Turks and Heathens: But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55445:33"/>
no man can love him as a member of Chriſt, whom he believes to be no member of Chriſt, but of the Devil. And all Papiſts are <hi>bound</hi> to this uncharitableneſs by their Religion, even by the Pope and general Council. And ſo as Chriſt bindeth his ſervants to Love one another with a ſpecial Love; ſo the Pope and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil bind the Papiſts not to love the moſt true Chriſtians with a ſpecial Chriſtian love: they cannot do it without being Hereticks themſelves, or overthrowing the foundation of Popery.</p>
                     <p>And here you have a taſte of the Popiſh Charity, when they boaſt above all things of their Charity. I muſt profeſs, it is their horrible inhumane uncharitableneſs that ſeems to me their moſt enormous crime. And alſo you may ſee here the extent of their Good works, which they ſo much Glory in. He that is bound not to love me as a Chriſtian, is bound to do nothing for me as a Chriſtian. So that they will not give a cup of cold water to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, unleſs he be alſo a Diſciple of the Pope: nor can they love or relieve Chriſt in his ſervants, when they are bound to take them as none of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: and ſo the ſpecial Love and Charity of a Papiſt extendeth to none but thoſe of their own Sect: and ſuch a Charity the Quakers, and Anabaptiſts, and Familiſts have as eminently as they. Let them take heed leſt they hear, In as much as <hi>you did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, you did it not to me.</hi>

Magiſtrates (It ſeems they think they owe no more obedience to their Magiſtrates then they promiſe.) But as I refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to what King <hi>James</hi> and his defenders have ſaid on this point (beſides many more) ſo I ſhall now give you but the words of one of their own approved General Council 12. the fourth at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. as <hi>Binnius</hi> and others of their own record it. In the firſt Chapter they ſet down their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, two Articles of which are, 1. <hi>That no man can be ſaved out of their Univerſal Church. And</hi> 2. <hi>That the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the Altar are tranſubſtantiate into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, the appearances remaining. And in the</hi> third Chapter they ſay, <hi>[We excommunicate and anathematize every hereſie extolling it ſelf againſt this holy orthodox Catholike faith, which we have before exponed, condemning all hereticks by what names ſoever they be called—And being condemned, let them be left to the preſent ſecular Powers, or their Bailifs to be puniſhed, the Clergy being firſt degraded of their Orders; and let the goods of ſuch condemned ones be confiſcate, if they be Lay-men, but if they be Clergy men, let them be given to the Churches whence they had their ſtipends. And thoſe that are found notable only by ſuſpition, if they do not by congruous purgation demonſtrate their innocency, according to the conſiderations of the ſuſpition and the quality of the perſon, let them be ſmitten with the ſword of</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, <hi>and avoided by all men, till they have given ſufficient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and if they remain a year excommunicate, let them then be condemned as hereticks. And let the ſecu'ar powers, in what Office ſoever, be admoniſhed and perſwaded, and if it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary compelled by Eccleſiaſtical cenſure, that as they would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and accounted Believers, ſo for the defence of the faith, they take an Oath publikely, that they will ſtudy in good earneſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their power, to exterminate all that are by the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted hereticks, from the Countries ſubject to their Jurisdiction. So that when any one ſhall be taken into Spiritual or Temporal power, he ſhall by his Oath make good this Chapter. But if the temporal Lord, being required and admoniſhed of the Church, ſhall neglect to purge his Countrey of heretical defilement, let him by the Metropolitan and other Comprovincial Biſhops be tyed by the bond of Excommunication. And if he refuſe to ſatisfie within a year, let it be ſignified to the Pope, that he may from thenceforth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55445:34"/>
his Vaſſals abſolved from his fidelity, and may expoſe his Countrey to be ſeiſed on by Catholikes, who rooting out the hereticks, may poſſeſs it without contradiction, and may keep it in the purity of faith; ſaving the right of the principal Lord, ſo be it that he himſelf do make no hinderance hereabout, and oppoſe any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the ſame Law is to be obſerved with them that are not principal Lords. And the Catholikes that taking the ſign of the Croſs ſhall ſet themſelves to the rooting out of the hereticks, ſhall enjoy the ſame indulgences and holy priviledges, which were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe that go to the releif of the holy land. Moreover we De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the believers, receivers, defenders, and favourers of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſhall be excommunicate; firmly decreeing, that after any ſuch is noted by excommunication, if he refuſe to ſatisfie within a year, he ſhall from thence forth be</hi> ipſo jure <hi>infamous, and may not be admitted to publike Offices or Councils, or to the choice of ſuch, nor to bear witneſs. And he ſhall be inteſtate and not have power to make a will, nor may come to a Succeſſion of inheritance. And no man ſhall be forced to anſwer him in any cauſe: but he ſhall be forced to anſwer others. And if he be a Judge, his ſentence ſhall be invalid, and no cauſes ſhall be brought to his hearing. If he be an Advocate, his Plea ſhall not be admitted. If a Notary (or Regiſter) the Inſtruments made by him ſhall be utterly void, and damned with the damned Author. And ſo in other the like caſes, we command that it be obſerved.]</hi> Thus they go on further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Biſhops by themſelves, or their Arch-deacons, or other fit perſons, once or twice a year to ſearch every Pariſh where any Heretick is found to dwell, and put all the Neighbourhood to their Oaths, whether they know of any Hereticks there, or any private meetings, or any that in life and manners do differ from the common converſation of the faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Biſhops that neglect theſe things are to be caſt out, and others put into their places that will do them.</p>
                     <p>And Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 7. expreſly ſtirs up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to caſt off their Princes, ſaying <hi>[And for the conſpiracy of Hereticks and the King, we believe it is not unknown to you that are near them, how it may be impugned by the Catholike Biſhops and Dukes, and many others in the German parts: for the faithful of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>are come to ſuch a number, that unleſs the King ſhall come to ſatisfaction, they may openly profeſs to chooſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55445:35"/>
another King, and obſerving Juſtice, we have promiſed to favour them, and will keep our promiſe firm,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>The ſum of all is, that all that the Pope calls Hereticks, muſt be condemned and deſtroyed, and all Kings, Princes or Lords, that will not execute his ſentence and root them out, muſt be diſpoſeſſed of their Dominions, and the ſubjects abſolved from their fidelity (whatever Oaths they had taken) and all others that do but favour or receive them be utterly undone.</p>
                     <p>I fetch not theſe things out of the writings of the Proteſtants, nor from any private Doctors of their own, but from the very words of a General Council confirmed by the Pope, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably approved by them. And abundance the like might be produced. And many ages ſaw this doctrine put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Emperors of <hi>Germany</hi> were depoſed by the Pope, and the Subjects abſolved from their Allegiance, as the many volumes written in thoſe times, and publiſhed together by <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſtus</hi> teſtifie. And the King of <hi>France,</hi> or any other that tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any of the ſuppoſed Hereticks, may ſee what a cenſure they are expoſed to, if meer neceſſity were not their ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps ſome will ſay, that <hi>this Decree was not</hi> de fide, <hi>but a temporary precept. Anſw.</hi> When a precept requireth duty, it may be a point of Faith to believe it. Precepts are the Objects of Faith, at leaſt as they are aſſertions, that the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is our duty. It is an Article of faith, that God is to be loved and obeyed, and our Superiors to be honoured, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be loved, and Charity to be exerciſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Incarnation of Chriſt, his death, reſurrection, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, glorification, interceſſion, his future Judgement, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all matters of fact, and yet matters of faith too. If practicals be not Articles of faith, then we have no Articles of faith at all: for all our Theology and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is practical. Do Papiſts murder poor Chriſtians by the thouſands, and yet not <hi>fide divina</hi> believe that it is their duty ſo to do? Either it is a duty, or a ſin, or indifferent. If <hi>a ſin,</hi> woe to their Pope and Council (and if this be no ſin with them, I know not why the world ſhould be troubled by them with the name of ſin.) If it be <hi>indifferent,</hi> what then ſhall be called ſin? If they can ſwallow ſuch Camels, as the blood of many thouſand Chriſtians, what need they ſtrain at Gnats, and ſtick at private
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55445:35"/>
Murders, or Fornication, or Lying, or Slandering, any more then the Jeſuit. Caſuiſts do, that are cited by the <hi>Janſenian</hi> in his Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm? But if theſe Murders and depoſing Kings be indeed a duty, how can they know it to be ſo, but by Believing? And indeed if a General Council and the Pope are to be believed, who give it us with a <hi>Decernimus &amp; firmiter ſtatui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> then it is doubtleſs a point of faith: and if they are not to be believed, then Popery is all but a meer deceit.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>But may we not be Roman Catholikes though we joyn not with them in this point? Have not many ſuch renounced it? and ſo may we. Anſw.</hi> If you renounce the Decrees of a Pope and General Council, you renounce your Religion in the very foundation of it, and cannot be Papiſts, if you know what you do; but are in the Roman account as errant Hereticks as thoſe that they have tortured and burnt to aſhes: though here in <hi>England</hi> where they cannot handle you as they would do, they dare not tell you ſo. And if you may renounce the Decrees of a Pope and General Council, when they ſay, <hi>[It is a duty, or lawful to extirminate all as Hereticks, that believe not Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and to ſeize upon the Lands of Princes that will not do it, and to deliver them to others that will, and abſolve their Vaſſals from their fidelity]</hi> I ſay, if you may renounce them in this, why may not we have as free leave to renounce them in other things, as groundleſs?</p>

                     <p>Argum. 4. <hi>THE true Catholike Church is Holy: the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath for many generations been unholy: therefore the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was not in any of thoſe Generations the true Catholike Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major Propoſition is an Article of the Creed profeſſed by themſelves, as much as by us, <hi>[I Believe the Holy Catholike Church.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unholineſs of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I prove undenyably, thus: <hi>If an Eſſential part of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>even its Head, hath been unholy through many Generations, then the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath been unholy for many Generations: but an Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55445:36"/>
part, even the Head, hath been unholy: therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence of the Major is paſt denyal. <hi>Bonum eſt ex cauſis integris.</hi> Though it will not follow that the Church is Holy, becauſe one Eſſential part is Holy, yet it clearly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Church is unholy, becauſe an Eſſential part is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy. As it followeth not that the Body is ſound, becauſe the Head is ſound; yet it followeth, that the man (or the body) is unſound or ſick, becauſe the Head is unſound or ſick. As it is not a Church without all its Eſſential parts, ſo it is not an <hi>Holy Church</hi> without the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of all its <hi>Eſſential</hi> parts.</p>
                     <p>And that they make the Pope the Head of the Catholike Church, and an Eſſential part, I am loth to prove; I would I could but entice them to deny it: for it is the principal contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between them and the true Catholikes.</p>
                     <p>And that abundance of their Popes have been unholy, I have formerly proved, and they dare not I hope deny it; when their own Hiſtorians deſcribe their Impieties, and their own Writers, even thoſe that are bittereſt againſt us, do freely confeſs it: yea General Councils have judged them and caſt them out. The number of theſe Monſters is ſo great, that it would make a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume greater then I intend, but to name them and recite their crimes. I will give a brief inſtance of one of them.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>John</hi> the twenty third was accuſed and depoſed by the General Council at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> upon about ſeventy Articles which in <hi>Binnius</hi> take up about thirteen columes <hi>in folio:</hi> and therefore I ſuppoſe you would give me no thanks to trouble you with the recital of them all. The firſt Article was, that he was from his youth, a man of a bad diſpoſition, immodeſt, impudent, a lyar, a rebell and diſobedient to his parents, and given to moſt vices, and then was, and yet is commonly taken for ſuch a one by all that knew him. The ſecond Article was, how by Simoniacal and unjuſt means he grew rich. The third Article, that by Simony he was promoted to be a Cardinal. The fourth Article, that being Legat at <hi>Bononia</hi> he governed Tyrannically, impiouſly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, being wholly aliene from all Chriſtian piety, and juſtice, divine and humane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fifth Article, that thus he got to be Pope, and yet continued as bad, and as a Pagan deſpiſed the worſhip of God, and if he performed any, it was more leſt he ſhould be totally blamed of hereſie and caſt out of the Papacy,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55445:36"/>
then for any devotion, and he hudled it up like an Hunter or a Souldier. The ſixt Article was, that he was the oppreſſor of the poor, the perſecutor of righteouſneſs, the pillar of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and the Simoniacal, a ſerver of the fleſh, the dregs of vices, a ſtranger to vertue, flying from publike conſiſtories, wholly given to ſleep and earnal deſires, wholly contrary to the life and manners of Chriſt, the mirror of infamy, and the profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of all miſchiefs; ſo far ſcandalizing the Church of Chriſt, that among Chriſtian Believers that knew his life and manners, he is commonly called, <hi>The Devil incarnate.</hi> The ſeventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was, that being a veſſel of all ſins, repelling the worthy, he Simonically ſold Benefices, Biſhopricks and Church dignities openly to the unworthy that would give moſt for them.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I ſhould but weary thee to add threeſcore more of theſe Articles. Theſe were all proved to be Notorious by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and many more. Yet I will crave thy patience while I add but two or three of the laſt. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that he came to be Pope by cauſing Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Phyſitian Dr. <hi>Daniel de ſophia</hi> to be poyſoned. Another was, that he committed inceſt with his brothers Wife, and with the holy Nuns, and Whoredom with Virgins, and adultery with mens Wives, and other crimes of incontinency, for which the wrath of God cometh on the children of diſobedience. Another, that he was a wicked man, notoriouſly guilty of Murder, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and other grievous crimes, a diſſipater of the Church goods, a notorious Simoniſt, and pertinacious Heretick. The next Article was, that often and often before divers Prelates and other honeſt men, by the Devils perſwaſion, he obſtinately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, dogmatized, and maintained, that there is no life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, nor any other after this; Moreover, he ſaid and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately believed that the ſoul of man doth die and is extinct with the body like the bruit beaſts, and that the dead ſhall not riſe again at the laſt day, contrary to the Article of the Reſurrection. The laſt and ſome other Articles are about his perfidiouſneſs.] And hereupon the Council depoſed him.</p>
                     <p>And now Reader I leave thee to judge, whether the <hi>Romane</hi> Church had a holy Head, when it had a <hi>Heathen</hi> and a <hi>Devil incarnate?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the general Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> depoſed Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55445:37"/>
as being <hi>[A rebel againſt the holy Canons, a notorious diſturber and ſcandalizer of the peace and unity of the Church, a Simoniſt and a perjured wretch, incorrigible, a ſchiſmatick, and an obſtinate Heretick.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>John</hi> 13. <hi>alias</hi> 12. was in Councill convicted of <hi>raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maids, Wives, Widows at the Apoſtolick doors, and committing many murders: he drunk a health to the Devil, and at Dice cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Venus <hi>for help, and at laſt was ſlain in the act of Adultery.</hi> Saith <hi>Plutina [he was from his youth a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with all diſhoneſty and filthineſs; and if he had any time to ſpare from his luſts, he ſpent it in hunting, and not in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.]</hi> And after he calls him <hi>[a moſt wicked man, or rather a Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter]</hi> and ſaith that <hi>[the life of this moſt wicked man being judged in a Council of</hi> Italian <hi>Biſhops, for fear of them he fled and lived like a wild beaſt in the woods,]</hi> till at laſt he got the better again by the help of his friends at <hi>Rome;</hi> till an angry man that found him naught with his wife, got the better of him, and ſent him to anſwer it in another world. And their own writers note that this was the firſt Pope that changed his name, whom his followers imitated. And do you think the Head of the Roman Church was then Holy?</p>
                     <p>If it were a diſputable matter, I would prove out of abundance of their own writers, that many others of them have been moſt wicked wretches, common adulterers, and fornicators, yea Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, poyſoning their predeceſſors to get the Popedom <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But its needleſs, becauſe they deny it not. <hi>Baronius</hi> their flattering Champion ſaith <hi>(Annal ad an.</hi> 912.) <hi>What then was the face of the holy Roman Church? How exceeding filthy, when the moſt potent, and yet the moſt ſordid whores did rule at</hi> Rome? <hi>by whoſe Pleaſure Sees were changed, Biſhops were given, and which is a thing horrid to be heard, and not to be ſpoken, their Lovers (or mates) were thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Peters <hi>Chair, being falſe Popes, who are not to be written in the Catalogue of the Roman Popes, but only for the marking out of ſuch times. And what kind of Cardinals, Prieſts, and Deacons think you we muſt imagine that theſe monſters did chooſe, when nothing is ſo rooted in nature as for every one to beget his like?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Genebrard</hi> that ſpleeniſh Papiſt <hi>(li.</hi> 4. <hi>Sec.</hi> 10.) ſaith <hi>[In this one thing that age was unhappy, that for neer one hundred and fifty years about fifty Popes did wholly fall away from the virtue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55445:37"/>
of their anceſtors, being rather irregular and Apoſtatical, then Apoſtolical]</hi> So that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not then either a Holy or Apoſtolical Head.</p>
                     <p>And Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth himſelf writeth <hi>(De Sacram. Confir. Art.</hi> 4.) that <hi>there have many Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>been He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> And two or three ſeveral General Councils did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> for an Heretick.</p>
                     <p>And if I ſhould tell you but what their own writers ſay of the wickedneſs of the Roman Clergy, in many ages; and of the wickedneſs of the Roman people, of the large ſumms of money that the Pope hath yearly for the licenſed or tolerated Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in <hi>Rome,</hi> you would think that the body of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Roman Church were neer kin to the Head, and therefore not the Holy Miſtris of all Churches.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps ſome will ſay, that the <hi>Pope was holy becauſe his Office was Holy, though his perſon vicious. Anſ.</hi> 1. If this be the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Catholick Church, mentioned in the Creed, then the Inſtitution of offices is it that makes it Holy, and while the office continueth, the Holineſs cannot be loſt. 2. Then let them prove their Holineſs by Saints no more. 3. Let them not then delude the people, but ſpeak out, and tell them that they mean ſuch Holineſs as is conſiſtent with Heatheniſm, or Infidelity, Murders, Sodomie, and may be in an incarnate Devil! Is this the Holineſs of the Catholick Church?</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But you may have unholy perſons among you alſo, that yet ſay you are of the true Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But they are no <hi>Eſſential</hi> part of the Catholick Church which we believe; and therefore it may be a Holy Church, though they be unholy. But the Pope is an <hi>Eſſential</hi> part of the Roman Church which they believe in; and therefore it can not be Holy, if he be unholy.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>By this means you leave no room for the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>or any Papiſt in the Catholick Church which is truly Holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not as Papiſts: ſo they can be no members of it. But if with any of them Chriſtianity be predominant, and prevail againſt the infection of Popery, ſo that it practically extinguiſh not Chriſtianity, then as Chriſtians they may be members of the Church, and be ſaved too, but not as Papiſts.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is confeſſed. The Minor I prove thus, 1. <hi>Where there are two Heads or Soveraign Powers ſpecifically diſtinct, there are two Societies, or Churches. But thoſe called Papiſts, or the Roman Catholick Church, have two Heads or Soveraign Powers ſpecifically diſtinct. Therefore they are two Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is granted by all Politicians, who do without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction ſpecifie Common-wealths and other Political Societies from the Soveraign Powers: and ſo the Monarchical, Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Democratical are ſeveral <hi>Species.</hi> The <hi>Belgian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and the <hi>French,</hi> be not ſpecifically the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Minor hath two ſtanding proofs ſo viſible that he muſt be blind indeed that cannot ſee them. Firſt there are the many Volumes that are written by both ſides for their ſeveral forms: <hi>Bellarmine, Gretſor</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Italian</hi> faction proving that the Pope is the chief Power, and above a General Council, and the ſeat of Infallibility, and not to be judged by any, being himſelf the Judge of the whole world. And the other party proving that a General Council is above the Pope, and that he is to be judged by them, and may be depoſed by them. If any ſay, that they are but few and no true Catholicks of this Opinion, I anſwer, then a General Council are but few and no true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which yet is ſaid by them to repreſent the whole Catholick Church: For the General Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and of <hi>Baſil</hi> have peremptorily aſſerted it, and repeat it over and over; yea the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> ſay, <hi>Seſ. ultim.</hi> that <hi>[Not one of the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full did ever doubt but that the Pope was ſubject to the Judgement of a General Council, in things that concern faith.

(What then is become of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the reſt of their champions?)</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you'l ſay, <hi>they are but few on the other ſide.</hi> I anſwer: yes: Not only moſt Popes, and the <hi>Italian</hi> Clergy, and the predominant party of Papiſts, but another General Council, even that at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> under <hi>Julius</hi> 2. and <hi>Leo</hi> 10. expreſly determine on the contrary, that the <hi>Pope is above a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council.</hi> So that here is not only an undenyable proof that General Councils are fallible by their contradicting each other, and that there is a Neceſſity of rejecting ſome of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Foundation of Popery is rotten; but alſo here is one Repreſentative Catholick Church againſt another Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Catholick Church, and one Council for one <hi>Species</hi> of Soveraignty, and another for another <hi>Species</hi> of Soveraignty. So that undoubtedly it is not the ſame Church, that had two heads of ſeveral ſorts.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Where the Soveraignty is mixt and not in either alone, if any one ſhall ſet up the one as the only Soveraign, and ſubject the other to them, they change the form of the Commonwealth, but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55445:39"/>
do not ſet up two Commonwealths; but if half take one for the Soveraign, and the other half take the other for the Soveraign, they plainly divide the Commonwealth into two: if they do it only in mind, and the ſecret thoughts of their hearts, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known to others, and ſo cannot be the ground of a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but if they do it by a publike conſent and practice, they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently make two Commonwealths. What elſe brought us into a war which ended not till one party was ſubdued? It is not poſſible that one Political body ſhould have two Soveraigns ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically diſtinct. Indeed it may have five hundred natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Soveraignty (as in a Senate;) but they are but one Political perſon, or one <hi>ſumma poteſtas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I prove the Minor by another Argument. <hi>Where there are two three or four Heads or Soveraigns at once numerically diſtinct, there are two or three or four Churches. But the</hi> Roman <hi>Church pretending to be Catholike, hath had two or three or four Heads at once numerically diſtinct; therefore it was two or three or four Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is a known truth to all that are verſt in any degree in the doctrine of Politicks. It is not only two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but two <hi>individual</hi> Soveraigns that are inconſiſtent with the numerical Unity of a Political body. Two, or ten, or two hundred may joyn in one Soveraignty, as one Political perſon (as I ſaid) but if there be two Soveraigns, there are certainly two Societies: for if both be Supream, neither is Subordinate. The Minor is not to be denyed: for the Papiſts lay their very foundation on a ſuppoſed diviſion: for ſooth <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were both at once their Biſhops. And there is not many of them that adventure to tell us, that <hi>Peter</hi> only was the Supream, and that <hi>Paul</hi> was under him: but they make them as equals, or coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and ſome of them ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> was the Biſhop of the uncircumciſion, and <hi>Peter</hi> of the Circumciſion (and then <hi>Peters</hi> Church is confined to the Jews) And they do not tell us, that one Headſhip was divided between them: For then that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample would direct them ſtill to have two Popes, or two Biſhops to a Church: ſo that <hi>Peter</hi> being a Head, and <hi>Paul</hi> a Head, they had ſure diſtinct bodies.</p>
                     <p>But whether they ſtand to this or not, they cannot deny their many following diviſions. The twenty third ſchiſme (as <hi>Wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus</hi>

And of eight Succeſſors, ſaith <hi>Wernerus, [I can ſay nothing obſervable of them; becauſe I find nothing of them but ſcandalous, becauſe of the unheard of contention in the holy Apoſtolike ſea one againſt another, and together mutually againſt each other.]</hi>

                     <p>Reader, wouldſt thou be troubled with any more of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? I tell thee nothing but from their own Hiſtorians, and that which multitudes of them agree in: I go not to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant for a word. But one Pope in thoſe contentious times, I find lived in ſome peace, and that was <hi>Silveſter</hi> the ſecond, of whom ſaith <hi>Wernerus</hi> (as others commonly) <hi>[This</hi> Silveſter <hi>was made Pope by the help of the Devil to whom he did homage: that all might go as he would have it:—but he quickly met with the uſual End, as one that had placed his Hope in deceitful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well! I ſhall now appeal to reaſon it ſelf, whether this were one Church, that for fourty (or ſay others fifty) years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſeveral Heads, ſome of the people following one, and ſome another, and the moſt Learned and moſt Conſcientious not able to know the right Pope, nor know him not to this day. If <hi>England</hi> were fourty years thus divided between two Kings, it were certainly two Kingdoms. But the true Catholike Church of Chriſt is but one.</p>

                     <p>Argum. 6. <hi>THE true Catholike Church hath never ceaſed or diſcontinued, ſince the founding of it to this day. The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath ceaſed or diſcontinued: therefore the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not the true Catholike Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I prove the Minor (for the Major they will grant.) <hi>If the Head which is an Eſſential part, hath diſcontinued, then the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath diſcontinued. But the Head hath diſcontinued: therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Minor only needs proof: and that I prove 1. <hi>There have been many years interregnum or vacancy, when there was no Pope at all.</hi> And where then was the Church when it had no Head?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There have been long ſucceſſions of ſuch as you confeſs your ſelves, were not Apoſtolical, but Apoſtatical. 3. Your own Popes and Councils command us to take ſuch for no Popes. For example, Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> in his Decretals (ſee <hi>Caranza pag.</hi> 393.) ſaith <hi>[He that by money or the favour of men, or popular or military tumults is intruded into the Apoſtolical ſeat without the Concordant and Canonical election of the Cardinall and the following religious Clergy, let him not be taken for a Pope, nor Apoſtolical, but for Apoſtatical.]</hi> And even of Prieſts, he commandeth, <hi>[Let no man hear Maſs of a Prieſt whom he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. But our greater Argument is from the authority of God, and the very nature of the office. <hi>An infidel, or notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man, is not capable of being a Paſtor of the Church</hi> (in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu compoſito, <hi>while he is ſuch) But the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>have been Infidels, and notoriouſly ungodly men: therefore they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being Paſtors of the Church</hi> (and conſequently that Church was Headleſs, and ſo no Church.) The Major I prove. 1. Where there is not the neceſſary matter and diſpoſition of the matter, there can be no reception of the form: But Infidels and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly ungodly men, are not matter ſufficiently diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the form of Paſtoral Power: therefore they cannot receive it.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is proved 1. As every true Church is a Chriſtian
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55445:41"/>
Church (it being only a Congregation of Chriſtians that we ſo call, in our preſent caſe) ſo every Paſtor is a Chriſtian Paſtor: but an Infidel or notoriouſly ungodly man is not a Chriſtian Paſtor: therefore not a true Paſtor. 2. Otherwiſe a Mahometan, Jew, or Heathen may be a true Pope; which I think they will deny themſelves. 3. If any Diſpoſition or Qualification at all be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the being of the Paſtoral Office (beſides manhood) then is it neceſſary, that he own God the Father, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer (that is, be not notoriouſly an Infidel, or ungodly.) But ſome qualification is neceſſary: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None can be named more neceſſary then this.</p>
                     <p>And that Popes have been ſuch as I here mention, is proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Not to mention <hi>Marcellinus</hi> that ſacrificed to an Idol, or <hi>Liberius</hi> that ſubſcribed to the Arrian profeſſion; (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is an hundred times more hope of their Salvation by Repentance, then of an hundred of their Succeſſors) <hi>John</hi> the twenty ſecond held that the ſoul dies with the body, of which the Pariſians and others condemned him. <hi>John</hi> the twenty third, as I ſhewed before, denyed the life to come, and ſo was an Infidel.

                     <p>Argum. 7. TO the foregoing Arguments, I add the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of one formerly mentioned, for the uſe of all that have the uſe of their wits and ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If a man may be ſure, that he knows bread to be bread, and wine to be wine, when he ſeeth, feeleth, and taſteth them, then he may be ſure that Popery is a deceit.</hi> (This Conſequence they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not queſtion) <hi>But a man may be ſure that he knoweth bread to be bread, and wine to be wine, when he ſeeth, feeleth, and taſteth them: therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Note that I ſpeak of ſuch a knowledge as belongs to men of ſound wits and ſenſes, and a convenient object and <hi>medium.</hi> It is the ſenſes of the whole world that I appeal to, and not of one or two: it is bread and wine that are near us, in the hand or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55445:41"/>
mouth that I ſpeak of, and not at a miles diſtance: in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and not in the dark. So that take the bread and wine into your hand, and judge of it, and let this decide our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. If you can tell whether that be bread or no bread, you may tell whether the Papiſts or we are in the right. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that be not learned and ſubtile enough to judge by Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and writings of Learned men, may yet judge by their ſight and feeling. Either you know bread and wine when you ſee it, taſte it, feel it, or you do not. If you do, then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is at an end: for the ſenſes of all ſound men in the world, will be againſt the Papiſts that ſay the bread after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is no bread, and the wine is no wine. But if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know bread when you ſee, feel, and eat it, then ſee what follows. 1. Then we are ſure that the Pope and all his Council are not at all to be truſted: for if ſence be not to be truſted, then the Pope and his Council know not when they read the Scripture, and Canons, and Fathers, and hear Traditions, but that they are deceived. 2. Then we are uncertain of any Judgement that Pope or Council can give: for when they ſpoke or wrote it, we are uncertain whether our eyes and ears, or reaſon judging by them, are not deceived in the hearing or reading of their words. 3. How ridiculouſly then do they call for a Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies? and what a fooliſh quarrel is it that they make, who ſhall be the Interpreter of Scriptures, or Judge of Controverſies? For what can a Judge do but ſpeak or write his mind? and when he hath done, you know not what it is that you hear or read, becauſe your ſenſes may deceive you. Its a far harder matter to underſtand a ſentence or book of the Pope or Council when you read or hear it, then to know bread when you ſee, and feel, and eat it. Many thouſands know bread, that know not the Popes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nor a word of a book. 4. And by this rule, it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether Scripture be true, or Chriſtianity the true Religion. For we cannot know it but by our ſences: and if they are ſo uncertain, all our Religion muſt needs be uncertain. 5. Yea we cannot tell what Revelation to deſire that ſhould end our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and make us certain. For if God ſhould ſend an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or other Meſſenger from heaven to decide the Controverſies between us and the Papiſts, what could he do more but ſpeak it to us as from God? and we ſhould ſtill be uncertain of what we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55445:42"/>
ſee or hear: ſo that we are left uncurably in our ignorance and Controverſies, if Popery be true.</p>
                     <p>And here you may ſee upon what terms we diſpute with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and what hope there is of ſatisfying them. We diſpute with men that will not believe their own ſenſes, or the ſenſes of the world. The damned man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. thought if one might have been ſent to his brethren from the dead, they would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And if <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay to them, If they will not hear <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one riſe from the dead; we may ſay of Papiſts, ſure, if they will not believe their own eyes, and ears, and taſte, and know not bread when they ſee, and feel, and eat it, how ſhould they be perſwaded, though one were ſent to them from heaven to reſolve them? Can we think by all our <hi>Arguments</hi> to make any matter plainer to a man then that <hi>Bread is Bread,</hi> when he ſeeth and eateth it? If this be uncertain to them, what can you prove to them, or what way can you deviſe to deal with them? For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>ſenſe</hi> be uncertain, we have no certainty of any thing in the world.</p>
                     <p>But to this <hi>H. T.</hi> (they ſay <hi>H. Turbervile)</hi> in his Manual of Controverſies ſaith thus. [Anſw. <hi>Subſtance is not the proper and immediate object of ſenſe, but colour, quantity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor can ſenſe judge at all of ſubſtance though it be under ſenſible accidents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be the ſubject of thoſe accidents, and have a ſenſible and corporal manner of being, which the Body of Chriſt neither is, nor hath in that Sacrament. It hath a ſpiritual manner of being, and is not the ſubject of the accidents of bread; they are without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by Miracle; therefore no wonder, if ſenſe be deceived in this matter. Here Senſe and Reaſon muſt vail bonnet to faith, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Authority of God revealing, and the Church propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they are no competent Judges what God can do by his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.]</hi> Thus <hi>H.

                        <hi>Repl.</hi> And is this all that theſe Rabbies have to ſatisfie the world that it is not Bread and Wine which is ſeen, and felt, and taſted! Let us firſt take notice of the by-paſſages of his anſwer, and then reply to the ſubſtance. 1. Is not this like the reſt of their contradictory imaginations? That Chriſt hath not a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral manner of Being in the Sacrament: and yet it is not Bread, but his Body that is there: yea before <hi>pag.</hi> 207. he ſaith,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55445:42"/>
[We maintain not his Corporal, but real and ſpiritual preſence in the Sacrament. So that either they affirm that his <hi>Body is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and yet deny his <hi>Bodily preſence;</hi> or elſe they affirm his <hi>Bodily</hi> preſence, but not his <hi>Corporal</hi> preſence.

Yes, in terms its ſaid <hi>[We maintain not his Corporal preſence]</hi> 2. And can a Body be preſent, and not in a Bodily manner? And why is <hi>[Spiritually]</hi> put as contradiſtinct? Sure when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid our Bodies ſhall be raiſed <hi>ſpiritual bodies,</hi> he thought that they were nevertheleſs <hi>bodies</hi> for being <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> and therefore it is nevertheleſs a <hi>Bodily</hi> manner of preſence, for being a <hi>ſpiritual manner.</hi> But if by the Corporal preſence or manner (denyed) be meant nothing but the qualities and quantity by which it is fit to be the Object of our ſenſes, why had we not this plainly without jugling? To ſay <hi>Chriſt is preſent in Body but not ſenſibly,</hi> is plainer Engliſh, then to ſay <hi>that he is preſent in Body but not Bodily preſent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note alſo that he calls them <hi>[The accidents of bread]</hi> and yet ſaith <hi>[they are without a ſubject]</hi> And ſo doth <hi>the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Roman Catholike Belief,</hi> and their ordinary writers ſay that the Body of Chriſt is under the <hi>forms of Bread and Wine,</hi> and yet ſay that <hi>Bread and Wine are none of the ſubject of thoſe forms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>I Come now to the next and principal part of my task, which is to open to you their Deceits, and give you Directions for the diſcovery and confutation of them, that by the help of theſe you may ſee the Truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 1. Remember this ground which they have given you, that <hi>If you prove them guilty but of any one Error in points of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief determined by their Church, you thereby diſprove the whole body of Popery, as ſuch.</hi> For you pull up the foundation which they build on, and the Authority into which they reſolve their faith. They will grant you, that if they are deceived by the Church in one thing, they have no Certainty of any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Churches credit. So that if you read <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe againſt Praying in an unknown tongue, or the many precepts for our reading and meditating in the Law of God, or the like, and can but perceive that the Popiſh Latine ſervice, or their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding men to read the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are contrary hereto, or if you find out but any one of their Errors, you cannot be a Papiſt, if you underſtand their Profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But it is not ſo with us: for though we know that the Scripture and all that is in it is of infallible Truth, and that every true Chriſtian (while ſuch) is infallible in the Eſſentials of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; (for elſe he were no Chriſtian) yet we profeſs that we know but in part, and that our own Writings and Confeſſions may poſſibly in ſome things be beſides the ſenſe of Scripture, and there being much more propounded in Scripture to our faith, then what is of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, we may poſſibly after our ſtudying and praying miſtake in ſome things that are not of the Eſſence but the Integrity of Chriſtianity, and are neceſſary to the <hi>Melius eſſe,</hi> the ſtrength or comfort, though not to the being of a Chriſtian. So that every Error in <hi>their</hi> faith deſtroyes their grounds, and ſo their new Religion; but ſo doth not every Error of ours.</p>
                     <p>Or to ſpeak more diſtinctly; let us diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Fides quae &amp; qua;</hi> their <hi>Objective faith,</hi> and our <hi>Subjective faith.</hi> 1. Their <hi>Objective Faith</hi> hath Errors in it, but ours hath none by their own confeſſion: For theirs is all the Decrees of their Popes
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55445:44"/>
and Councils: and ours is only the Holy Scripture, which they confeſs to be infallible. Our own writings do but ſhew how we underſtand the Scriptures, and ſo whether our <hi>ſubjective faith</hi> be right or not. 2. We confeſs that it is not only poſſible but probable, that we are miſtaken in ſome lower points, about the meaning of the Scriptures, and yet our foundation is ſtill ſure. But they have in a ſort confounded their <hi>Subiective</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective faith:</hi> and one believes it on that account becauſe others do believe it; and ſo one age or part do but ſeek for the <hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>Actual faith</hi> of the other. Yea 3. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that every point which is of faith, that is, thats determined by the Church to be ſo, is of ſuch neceſſity to ſalvation that no man can be ſaved that denyeth it, or that doth not believe it (if ſufficiently propoſed.) But we are aſſured, that though all that is in Scripture be moſt true, yet through miſunderſtanding, ſome points there propoſed to our faith, may poſſibly be denyed and diſputed againſt by a true believer; and yet his ſalvation not be overthrown by it. The Papiſts cry out againſt us for diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Fundamentals (or eſſentials) of Religion and the Integrals: but we know it to be neceſſary.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 2. WHEN you have brought the matter thus far, and ſee that if they have one errour in faith, their whole cauſe is loſt, then conſider, <hi>Whether it be Poſſible for that Doctrine which is ſo contrary to Scripture, and to it ſelf, to be free from all Error.</hi> 1. How contrary it is to Scripture, 1. To forbid the reading of Scripture in a known tongue: 2. And their Publick Praying in an unknown language: 3. And their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Lords Supper to the People by the halves, denying them the Wine, and giving them the bread only: 4 And their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming men to be perfect without ſin in this life: 5. And their calling ſome ſins <hi>venial which deſerve a pardon,</hi> and yet are truly no ſins: 6. And their abſolute forbidding their Prieſts to marry, 7. And ſaying that there is no Bread and Wine left after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, with abundance the like: the very reading of the texts may ſatisfie you.

                     <p n="2">2. And that they are contrary to themſelves, appeareth: 1. In that (as I ſaid before) not only ſeveral perſons, but ſeveral Countries go ſeveral wayes; the French are of one way, and the Italians of another, even in the Fundamentals of their Faith, which all the reſt is reſolved into. 2. Their Popes have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily been contrary to one another in their Decrees; which made <hi>Platina</hi> ſay <hi>[Following Popes do ſtill either infringe or wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the Decrees of the former Popes]</hi> And <hi>Eraſmns</hi> ſaith that <hi>[Pope</hi> John 22. <hi>and Pope</hi> Nicolas <hi>are contrary one to another in their whole Decrees, and that in things that ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to matter of faith]</hi> Had we no inſtances but of <hi>Sergius</hi> and <hi>Formoſus</hi> and their following partakers, it were enough. And <hi>Celeſtines</hi> caſe puts <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to ſilly ſhifts. 3. That their Councils contradict each other, I have formerly manifeſted. They confeſs that the Arrians have had many Councils as General as moſt ever the Orthodox had: and if it be only the want of the Popes approbation that nullifieth their authority, then let them tell us no more of <hi>Councils</hi> and of <hi>[all the Church]</hi> but ſay plainly that is but <hi>one man</hi> that they mean.</p>
                     <p>But even their <hi>approved Councils</hi> have been <hi>contrary;</hi> As the ſixth Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> approved by Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> is now confeſſed to have many errors. The Council of <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſarea</hi> confirmed by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 4. and by the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council (as ſaith the Council of <hi>Florence Seſ.</hi> 7.) condemned ſecond marriages, contrary to Scripture and the preſent Church. The Council at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth determines that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55445:45"/>
the Pope is above a General Council; and the Councils of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> determine that the General Council is above the Pope, and that this is <hi>de fide,</hi> and its hereſie to deny it.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 3. <hi>IF you enter into Diſpute with any Papiſt, enquire firſt what he will take for ſufficient Proof, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles you are agreed on by which the reſt muſt be decided.</hi> For men that agree in <hi>nothing</hi> at all, are not capable of a diſpute. For the Principles in which they are agreed, are thoſe that the reſt muſt be reduced to. And when you have made this enquiry, you ſhall find that the Popiſh way of Diſputing is to forbid you to Diſpute, unleſs you will firſt yield the cauſe to them as beyond diſpute: and that they are not agreed with the reſt of the world in any common principles to which the differences may be reduced for tryal, and ſo that there is no ſort of Proof that they will admit of as ſufficient: For if there be any ground of Proof at all, it muſt be 1. From the ſenſes. 2. Or from Reaſon. 3. Or from Scripture. 4. Or from the Church; but they will ſtand to none of all theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Begin at the bottom of all, and know of them whether they will take that for a Valid Proof, which is fetcht from ſenſe, even from the ſoundeſt ſenſes of all men in the world, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a convenient object and <hi>Medium?</hi> If they will not take this for Proof, how can you diſpute with them? Or what Proof can be admitted, if this be not admitted? We have this advantage in dealing even with thoſe Heathen that have blotted out much of the Law of nature it ſelf, that yet they will yield to an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>But if they would yield to the Validity of this proof, then they give away their cauſe, ſeeing <hi>ſenſe</hi> telleth us that it is <hi>bread</hi> which we ſee, and feel, and eat after the Conſecration. They know this; and therefore they muſt diſown and deny this ſort of proof.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But will they then admit of Proofs from <hi>Reaſon?</hi> No, that cannot be, if proof from ſenſe be not admitted. For <hi>Reaſon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth its object by means or occaſion of the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> and muſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55445:46"/>
needs be deceived if <hi>it</hi> be deceived: And <hi>Reaſon</hi> hath not a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that it holds faſter, then <hi>that ſenſe is to be credited;</hi> that this is white or black which my own eyes and the eyes of all other men do ſee to be ſo: and ſo that this is bread which we all ſee, and feel, and taſte to be ſo. And therefore the Papiſts tell us that <hi>Reaſon muſt ſtoop to faith,</hi> that is, they will not ſtand to <hi>Reaſon</hi> when it contradicteth the doctrine of their ſect. It ſeems they are in ſome parts of their Religion <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> But I would know, whether they have <hi>any Reaſon to be unreaſonable.</hi> If they <hi>have,</hi> then why might not <hi>our Reaſon</hi> be valid as well as <hi>their Reaſon</hi> which they bring <hi>againſt Reaſon?</hi> by which they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelves. For if <hi>Reaſon</hi> be vain, why <hi>Reaſon</hi> they to prove its Vanity or invalidity? But if they have <hi>no Reaſon againſt Reaſon,</hi> let them confeſs it, and offer us none, and then their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes will do no harm. We eaſily yield, that we have <hi>Reaſon to believe Gods Revelations,</hi> about thoſe things which we had <hi>no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe</hi> if they were not <hi>Revealed:</hi> And that many of thoſe <hi>Revelations</hi> are <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> ſo far as that <hi>Reaſon</hi> cannot diſcern the truth of the thing <hi>without them;</hi> yea it would rather judge the things <hi>improbable:</hi> But yet <hi>Revelations</hi> are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>inform Reaſon,</hi> and not <hi>deſtroy it;</hi> nor do they <hi>ſo contradict Senſe or Reaſon,</hi> as to make that <hi>credible</hi> which <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> have <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> to judge <hi>falſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that here we muſt break with a Papiſt, even where we might join in diſpute with a heathen. And how will Papiſts deal with Heathens if they will deny the proofs from <hi>ſenſe and reaſon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. But will they ſtand to the Validity of <hi>Proofs</hi> from Scripture? No; For 1. They take it to be but part of Gods word, ſo that we may nor argue <hi>Negatively, [It is not in the holy Scripture: therefore it is not an Article of faith or a Law of God]</hi> For they will preſently appeal to <hi>Tradition.</hi> 2. And even ſo much as is in Scripture, though they confeſs it to be true, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it not to be by us intelligible, and will not admit of any proof from it, but with this limitation, that you take it in that ſenſe as the Church takes it. For they are ſworn by the <hi>Trent</hi> Oath <hi>[to take it in that ſence as the Holy Mother Church doth hold, and hath held it in, and never to take or interpret it but according to the unanimous ſenſe of the Fathers.]</hi> So that they muſt know what ſenſe all the Fathers are unanimous in before they can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55445:46"/>
a proof from Scripture. And before that can be done, above a Cart-load of books muſt be read over or ſearched: and when thats done, they will find that moſt texts were never medled with by moſt of thoſe Fathers in their writings; and in thoſe that they did meddle with, they diſagreed in multitudes, and where they <hi>diſagree</hi> they are not <hi>unanimous;</hi> and there the Papiſts are ſworn to believe no ſenſe at all. And if they would have come down to a Major vote, it is no ſhort or eaſie matter to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the votes. And if they know the Fathers unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet muſt they have the ſenſe of the preſent Church too: And is it not all one to make your adverſary the <hi>Judge of your cauſe,</hi> as the <hi>Judge of your Evidences and all your proofs?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Well, but at leaſt may we not hope that they will ſtand to the Judgement of the <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> And if ſo, we will not take it for our adverſary? No: they will not do ſo neither. For 1. When they deny proof from <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> they muſt needs deny all thats brought from the Church: For the Church cannot judge it ſelf but on ſuppoſition of the infallibility of ſenſe. 2. And when you argue from the judgement and practice of the greater part of the Church, they preſently diſclaim them all as Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, and will have no man be a Valid wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs but themſelves. The Greeks, the Aethiopians, the Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, the Proteſtants, all are Hereticks or Schiſmaticks ſave they; and therefore may not be witneſſes in the caſe. So that you ſee upon what terms we ſtand with the Papiſts, that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no proofs upon the Infallibility of <hi>Senſe or Reaſon,</hi> or the <hi>ſufficiency of Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>teſtimony of the Catholick Church,</hi> but only from <hi>themſelves.</hi>

                     <p>To help you to ſee the ſenſe of this deceit, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it; 1. You may eaſily obſerve that this is the plain drift of all, to perſwade you to make them your judges, and yield the cauſe inſtead of diſputing it. For it is no other judge but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they will admit. Yield firſt that the Pope or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is the judge of all controverſies, and then its folly to diſpute againſt them: ſo that if you will yield them the cauſe firſt, they will then diſpute with you after.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But what is to be ſaid to the pretence of the Neceſſity of a Judge? I anſwer, 1. Its againſt all reaſon and experience to think that all enquiries or diſputes are vain, unleſs there be a Judge to decide the caſe. A Judge is a Ruling decider; not to ſatisfie mens minds, ſo much as to preſerve Order, and Peace, and Juſtice in the Society. But there are thouſands of caſes to be privately diſcuſſed, that we never need to bring to a Judge. Every Husbandman, and Tradeſman, and Navigator, and other Artificer doth meet with doubts and difficulties in his way which he laboureth to Diſcern, and ſatisfieth himſelf with a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Diſcretion without a Ruling Judge. We eat, and drink, and clothe our ſelves, and follow our daily labours without a Judge, though we meet with controverſies in almoſt all, what meat or drink is beſt for quality or quantity, and a hundred like doubts. Men do marry, and build, and buy, and ſell, and take Phyſick, and diſpatch their greateſt worldly buſineſs without a Judge. Judges are only for ſuch controverted caſes as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be decided without them, to the <hi>attaining of the Ends of Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Is it not againſt the daily practice of the Papiſts to think or ſay that all diſputes and controverſies muſt have a Judge? Who is the Judge between the Nominals, Reals and Formaliſts, the Dominicans, Franciſcans and Jeſuites, in all thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies which have Cartloads of Books written on them? Their Pope or Councils dare not Judge between them. Do they not daily diſpute in their Schools among themſelves without a Judge? and ſtill write books againſt one another without a Judge?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Underſtand well the uſe and differences of Judgement. The <hi>ſentence</hi> is but a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>the execution:</hi> and Judges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55445:47"/>
determine the <hi>mind and will of man:</hi> but preſerve <hi>outward Order,</hi> if men <hi>will not</hi> ſee the truth themſelves. Me thinks the Jeſuits that are ſo eager for free will, ſhould eaſily grant that the Pope by his definition cannot determine the <hi>Will</hi> of man. And they ſee that <hi>Hereticks remain Hereticks,</hi> when the Pope hath ſaid all that he can: And if he can cure them all by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations, he is much too blame that he doth not. And if a mans <hi>mind</hi> be to be ſettled, an <hi>Infallible Teacher</hi> is fitter then a Judge. <hi>Judgement</hi> then being <hi>for Execution,</hi> when you ask, <hi>Who ſhall be the Judge?</hi> I anſwer that <hi>Judgement</hi> is either <hi>total, abſolute and final:</hi> or it is only <hi>to a certain particular end, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> from which there is an Appeal. In the former caſe, there is no Judge but Chriſt, and the Father by him. No abſolute deciſion can be made till the great Judgement come; and then all will be fully and finally decided. And for the <hi>limited preſent Judgements of men,</hi> they are of <hi>ſeveral ſorts,</hi> according to their <hi>ſeveral Ends.</hi> When the queſtion is, <hi>Who ſhall be corporally puniſhed as an Heretick? the Magiſtrate is Judge;</hi> For <hi>coercive puniſhment</hi> being his work, the <hi>Judgement</hi> muſt be <hi>his</hi> alſo. But when the queſtion is, <hi>Who ſhall be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated as an Heretick,</hi> as Gods Law hath told us who <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and ſo is the <hi>Rule</hi> of deciſion about individuals: ſo to try individual perſons, and caſes according to this Law, belongs to the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church:</hi> but not to the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>other Churches a thouſand miles off,</hi> that never received ſuch an authority, and are not capable of the work: but to the <hi>Governours of the Church in which the party hath Communion,</hi> and into which he ſhall at any time intrude and ſeek communion. And <hi>all men</hi> have a <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcerning</hi> that are concerned in the <hi>Execution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if a diſputing Papiſt will ſay that his buſineſs is not to Diſpute with you, but to <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> or <hi>hang,</hi> or <hi>burn you</hi> for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> then I confeſs, its all the reaſon in the world that you ſhould firſt agree of the <hi>Judge.</hi> But why the Pope ſhould be the Judge, I know not, unleſs it be in his own charge.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 5. VVHen you have proceeded on theſe grounds, the Papiſts will tell you, that <hi>in their way there is an End of Controverſies, but in yours there is none: For if you will not ſtand to ones Judgement as infallible, you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as long as you live before you come to an End.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To direct you in diſcuſſing this part of the <hi>Deceit</hi> alſo: 1. We confeſs that on earth there will be no End of all controverſies among the beſt: nor of the great controverſies which ſalvation lyeth on, between the believers and the unbelievers: that is, there will be ſtill Infidelity and Hereſie in the world, and errour in the godly themſelves. 1. Hath it not been ſo in every age till now? And why ſhould we expect that it ſhould now be otherwiſe? 2. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> tell us that here <hi>we know but in part, and propheſie in part?</hi> and when is it that that which is <hi>imperfect will be done away,</hi> but when <hi>that which is perfect is come?</hi> While we know but in part, we ſhall differ in part.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hath your way put an End to controverſies any more then ours? Are you not yet at controverſie with <hi>Infidels, Whether Chriſt be the Redeemer:</hi> and with <hi>Hereticks whether he be true eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God?</hi> Are you not yet as full of controverſies among your ſelves, as any Chriſtians on the face of the earth? I do not believe but in the many Volumes of your Schoolmen, Caſuiſts, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, I can ſhew more controverſies yet depending, then you can find amongſt any ſort of Chriſtians in the world; yea then you can find among all other Chriſtians in the world ſet together.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And is there any thing in <hi>your way</hi> that better tendeth to the deciding of controverſies then <hi>in ours?</hi> Nothing at all; but contrarily, you have made more Controverſies then you have ended. For, 1. We have a <hi>Certain infallible Rule</hi> to decide our controverſies by, even ſuch as you confeſs your ſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; Even the Holy Scriptures: but you have an uncertain Rule, even the Decrees of your Popes and Councils, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Volumes of the Fathers, which are at odds among themſelves; your very <hi>Rule</hi> is ſelf-contradicting, and your Judges are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ears (as hath been ſhewed.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Our Faith</hi> conſiſteth in thoſe points which are granted by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55445:48"/>
your ſelves, and ſo are beyond Controverſie between us and you. But <hi>yours</hi> lyeth alſo in a mixture of mens corruptions, which will ever be controverted and condemned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Our Faith</hi> conſiſteth in the few ancient Articles by which the Church was alwayes known (as to its eſſentials.) But <hi>you</hi> confound the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> with the <hi>integrals:</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> of your neceſſary Articles is ſo great, as muſt needs be matter of more controverſie then ours.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We know our Religion, and where to find it: For it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the firſt, and receiveth no additions or diminutions. One generation cometh, and another goeth, but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. But <hi>you</hi> never know when you have all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you know not when your Pope will have done defining: that is an article of faith <hi>to you</hi> one year that was none the year before nor ever before.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>We</hi> need no Judge to decide any controverſies among us in the points of Abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation: both becauſe the Scripture is ſo plain in thoſe points, as to ſerve for deciſion without a Judge; and becauſe we abhor to make a controverſie of any of them; and where there is no <hi>controverſie,</hi> there needs <hi>no Judge.</hi> We are all agreed, through the plainneſs of the Scripture, that there is but one, Eternal, moſt Wiſe, and Good, and Omnipotent God; and that there is one Mediator between God and man, who is himſelf both God and man, that was crucified, dead, buried, went to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, roſe again, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, intercedeth for us, and is King and Head of the Church: and will raiſe the dead, and judge the world, ſome to Heaven, and ſome to Hell: Theſe and all the reſt of the Eſſentials of our faith, and many more points that are not eſſentials, are ſo plain in Scripture that we are paſt making them matter of Controverſie. If any man deny an Eſſential point of faith, he is none of us, no more then of you. But you are it ſeems ſo deep in infidelity, that you muſt have a judge to decide your Controverſies in the neceſſary Articles of Faith. For whatever is <hi>de fide,</hi> you make to be of ſuch equal neceſſity, that you deride our diſtinguiſhing the Fundamentals from the reſt, (as may be ſeen in <hi>Knots</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity unmaskt againſt <hi>Chillingworth)</hi> Seriouſly tell us, Do you think Chriſtians need a Judge, or muſt put it to a Judge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, <hi>whether Chriſt be the Meſſias or not? whether he died and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55445:49"/>
roſe again or not? Whether he will judge the world or not?</hi> or any ſuch points. If he be a Judge, he muſt have power to oblige you to ſtand to his Determination on which ſide ſoever he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And what if <hi>John</hi> 22. determine that the ſoul is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, or <hi>John</hi> 23. that there is no reſurrection or life to come, but a man dieth like a beaſt: would you ſtand to this deciſion?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If you ſay that your Judge hath power to oblige you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on one ſide, that is, when he judgeth right (and ſo make no Judge of him, but a Teacher) we have ſuch Judges as well as you, even Teachers to ſhew us the Evidence of truth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. If you ſay that you have a <hi>Judge to determine of hereſies in order to the Puniſhing of them by the ſword:</hi> So have we as well as you, and better then you. For your Pope is a Prieſt that hath nothing to do with the ſword, (at leaſt out of his own Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities): but our Princes and other Rulers are lawful Magiſtrates, that are appointed to be a terror to evill doers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 6.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If you ſay that you <hi>have a Judge to determine of hereſie in Order to Excommunication,</hi> ſo have we in every Church: even the Paſtors of the Churches, who are bound to unite and aſſiſt each other in ſuch works. <hi>What is to be accounted Hereſie,</hi> the Law of God ſufficiently determineth: <hi>And what particular perſons are to be Judged hereticks and excommunicated according to that Law,</hi> the particular Paſtors that are on the place can better decide then a Pope that is a thouſand, or five thouſand miles off, and cannot hear the witneſſes. And do you not your ſelves decide almoſt all ſuch caſes through the world (that is of your ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) by the preſent Paſtors or Biſhops, and not by the Pope? And why may not we do ſo then as well as you?</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But if you lay all upon your Popes or Councils Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, I deſire you but to read my third Diſputation in a Book againſt Popery, called the <hi>Safe Religion;</hi> and then believe that Infallibility if you can. I ſhould think my ſelf a miſerable man, if I were not my ſelf more Infallible then many of your Popes have been. Every Chriſtian (while ſuch) is infallible in his belief of the Chriſtian faith; And the Scripture is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ground of our belief.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Is it not a plain Judgement of God upon you, that while you make the Scripture ſo dark and not intelligible,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55445:49"/>
and cry up the Neceſſity of a living Judge, you ſhould not only ſwarm with differences among your ſelves, but ſhould be utterly diſagreed, and at a loſs to know <hi>who is this Judge of Controverſies,</hi> one ſaying <hi>it is the Pope,</hi> and another that <hi>its the Council;</hi> and what the better are you for ſaying, <hi>There muſt be a Judge,</hi> as long as you cannot tell <hi>Who it muſt be?</hi> Its not only uncertain among you <hi>Whether Pope or Councill be the Infallible Judge,</hi> but alſo <hi>which is a true Pope,</hi> and <hi>which is a lawfull Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council?</hi> For fourty years at leaſt together, the Church could not know the true Pope, but the more learned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable men were divided: Nor is it known to this day. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſtrongeſt hath carried it, and ſucceſs been his beſt title. Nay General Councils themſelves knew not the right Pope. The Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> knew not the right Pope. They of <hi>Baſil</hi> thought <hi>Felix</hi> the fifth the true Pope, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> no Pope: But friends and ſtrength confuted a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, and proved depoſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope. And for Councils themſelves, who knows which to take for currant and of Authority? What Catalogues have you of <hi>reprobated Councils,</hi> and of <hi>doubtfull Councils,</hi> and <hi>partly approved, partly reprobate,</hi> and who knows which and <hi>how far;</hi> but only <hi>that is approved, that pleaſeth the Pope, and that reprobate that diſpleaſed him,</hi> and yet perhaps approved by a former Pope: So that you are all in a confuſion and uncertain about your true Popes and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils.</p>
                     <p>And if you knew them, yet what a loſs are you at to know their Decrees and Canons? What a Fardel of falſe Decretall Epiſtles have you thruſt upon the world, as <hi>Blondell, Dalleus, Reignolds</hi> and others have fully proved. Forſooth decretals that uſe a tranſlation of the Scripture that was formed a long time after the death of the ſuppoſed Authors of thoſe Epiſtles: And Decretals which make mention of perſons and things that were many ſcore or hundred years after the death of the ſaid Authors. Theſe are your new Scriptures, and by theſe our faith muſt be regulated, and our controverſies decided.</p>
                     <p>And your Canons are abundance of them as uncertain: ſome of your own will have but twenty Canons of the firſt General Council at <hi>Nice:</hi> ſome will have the new found rabble of additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Much more uncertainty or certain forgery there is in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55445:50"/>
Canons called the Apoſtles: and the like we may ſay of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more.</p>
                     <p>And now I appeal to all the impartial Reaſon in the world, whether your voluminous, apocriphal, uncertain faith that needs a living Judge, and cannot find one, or agree upon him, and that leaves your controverſies ſtill undecided, be a liker way to peace and unity, then our ſhort and plain Articles and infallible Scripture faith, that hath leſs matter of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and better means to prevent it, even faithful Teachers and Judges in every Church and Commonwealth, which ſhall ſo far determine as may preſerve the peace of thoſe ſocieties, leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the final full Deciſion of all to the Eternal Judge that is even at the door.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Yea and is not Gods hand of Judgement yet more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable againſt you, that when your Popes and Councils have paſt their judgement, the ſeveral Sects are unable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them? witneſs the late ſentence againſt the Janſeniſts, of which the perſons that ſeem to be condemned, ſay, that there is no ſuch thing or words in all <hi>Janſenius</hi> writings, as the Pope ſaith are in him, and condemneth as his: and the Controverſie is as far from a deciſion, as if the Pope had held his peace. Yea your great Diſputer here in <hi>England, Thomas White</hi> the Noveliſt, is the ſame for all the Popes determination.</p>
                     <p>Take another inſtance in the forementioned Caſe, <hi>Whether the Pope or Council be ſupream:</hi> The Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> determined it one way as <hi>de fide,</hi> and yet that made no end of the Controverſie. The Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it the other way; and yet it is a Controverſie after two contrary deciſions: and ſome ſay one way, and ſome the othe: and ſome ſay, <hi>It is yet undecided</hi> (for fear of angring the French by caſting them off as Hereticks.) Another inſtance. The Council at <hi>Baſil Seſſ.</hi> 36. <hi>(pag.</hi> 80. in <hi>Binnius)</hi> hath fully determined the Controverſie between the Franciſcans and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans about the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> immaculate conception: and yet it is undetermined ſtill; and <hi>Thomas White</hi> preſumes to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that <hi>[Certainly there is no Tradition for it, nor any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that ever the Negative will be defined.</hi> Apolog. <hi>for</hi> Tradit. pag. 64, 65, 66. yea he carryeth it as boldly out, as if never Council had made or medled with it. I will therefore recite the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55445:50"/>
words of the Council, which are theſe <hi>[A hard queſtion hath been in divers parts, and before this holy Synod, about the Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the glorious Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and the beginning of her Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſome ſaying that the Virgin and her ſoul was for ſome time or inſtant of time actually under Original ſin: others on the contrary, ſaying, that from the beginning of her Creation, God loving her, gave her grace by which preſerving and freeing that bleſſed perſon from the Original ſpot—we, having diligently looke into the authorities and reaſons, which for many years paſt have in publike relation on both ſides been alledged before this holy Synod, and having ſeen many other things about it, and weighed them by mature conſideration, do Define and Declare, that the doctrine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the glorious Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of God, by the ſingular preventing and operating grace of God, was never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under Original ſin, but was ever free from all Original and actual ſin, and was holy and immaculate, is to be approved, held and embraced of all Catholikes as godly and Conſonant to Church-worſhip, Catholike faith, right reaſon, and ſacred Scripture: and that henceforth it ſhall be lawful for no man to preach and teach the contrary]</hi> Is not this plain Defining?</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But this was not an approved Council. Anſw.</hi> 1. It was owned by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> himſelf. And here once for all I prove that the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was approved by the Pope: for Pope <hi>Felix</hi> the fift (one of the beſt Popes that ever <hi>Rome</hi> had this thouſand years) approved it in this point: not only by accepting their election, but in expreſs terms <hi>[profeſſing firmly to hold the faith of the Councils of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>and</hi> Baſil, <hi>and to keep it inviolate to a tittle, and confirm it with his ſoul and blood: promiſing faithfully to labour to defend the Catholick faith, and for the execution and obſervation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Councils of</hi> Conſtance <hi>and</hi> Baſil, <hi>ſwearing to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the celebration of Generall Councils, and confirmation of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, according to the Decrees of the Holy Council of</hi> Baſil] See <hi>Binnius Seſ.</hi> 40. <hi>page</hi> 87. If they ſay that <hi>Felix</hi> was not a true Pope: I anſwer, then <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth choſen by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill at <hi>Conſtance</hi> was no true Pope; and then where is your ſucceſſion? Theſe things are plain and cannot be denyed, though unconſcionable ſhifters, that argue according to their Wills, may find words to be guile the ſimple.</p>

AND by this that hath been ſaid, you may ſee what to think of <hi>their glorying in their Unity, and accuſing our Diviſions.</hi> One of the principal arguments that they prevail by, is by telling the people into how many ſects we are divided, and that the Catholick Church is but one: but we are many: and here they will tell you of all the names they can reckon up, Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptiſts, Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Arminians, Socinians, Quakers, and what not. And they will tell you that all this Diviſion comes by departing from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church; every man being left to be of what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion his fancy leadeth him to, for want of an univerſal Judge of controverſies. And they will ask you what reaſon you have among all theſe Sects to believe one of them rather then another? So that they would perſwade you that there is no way for Unity but by turning to be Papiſts, that we may be united in the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To all this deceit (for it is no better) we give them our full anſwer in theſe Propoſitions. 1. It is not every kind of unity that is deſirable: but Unity with truth, and honeſty, and ſafety. Its eaſier to agree in evil then in good: for evil findeth more friendſhip with corrupted nature, and hath more ſervants in the world. The wicked are more agreed, and far more in number, of one mind, then the Godly are. The Mahometans are far more agreed; and that in a far greater number, then the Papiſts are.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55445:51"/>
The Devils have ſome agreement in their way: They are all agreed to hate Chriſt and his members, and to ſeek night and day whom they may devour. It is eaſier to agree in a Papiſts work then in ours: To ceater carnally in a ſinfull (and oft a moſt wicked) man; to agree in certain forms and ceremonies, which fleſh and blood is glad to delude themſelves with, inſtead of the Life of faith and Love; its eaſie to agree in ſuch a carnal religion. To ſpare the labour and time of ſtudy and ſearching after truth, and to caſt their ſouls upon the faith of others, even the Pope or a Council, this is an eaſie thing for lazy ungodly men to agree in: But to make the Truth our Own, and get the Law of Chriſt written in our own hearts, and to live upon it, and walk in the light, and embrace all thoſe truths that are moſt againſt our fleſhly inclination and intereſt, this is not ſo eaſie for corrupted nature to agree upon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath told us that it is <hi>a little flock to whom he gives the Kingdom,</hi> Luke 12. 32. and that <hi>the gate is ſtrait, and the way narrow that leads to life, and few there be that find it; and the gate is wide and the way broad that leads to deſtruction, and many there be that enter at it.</hi> And therefore it is no great wonder if error and ſin have the greater number.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And yet for all this I dare boldly ſay that there is a far more excellent Unity and Concord among the true Reformed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, then among the Papiſts, and that they do but cheat poor ſouls with the falfe pretence of unity. And this I ſhall make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you as followeth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As I have ſaid before, they are utterly divided and diſagreed about that very power in which they ſhould unite, and which they pretend muſt agree them in all other things. One half of them are for the Soveraignty of a Pope, and the other of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council: and that as a point of faith. So that there is no poſſibility of Union with them, that are divided in the very point in which they invite us to Unite with them. If the eye be dark how ſhall the body ſee? If they cannot agree about that power that they ſay muſt agree them in all things elſe, what hope of an agreement with them?</p>
                     <p>But for our parts we are all agreed that Chriſt only is the head of the Church, and in him we all unite.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. With us, they are uſually but here and there a ſtragling per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55445:52"/>
or ſome few half-witted ſelf-conceited Novices that fall off and diſagree from us in any thing that deſtroyeth ſalvation: But with the Papiſts, Princes are againſt Princes, and Nations againſt Nations, and which is much more, General Councils againſt General Councils, even in the Foundation of their faith. So that let the General Councils be never ſo full and learned, and juſtly called, yet if they be againſt the Popes Soveraignty over them, the other party call them but <hi>Conciliabula,</hi> falſe Councils and Conventicles. Of how great moment this difference is, let the learned <hi>Cajetane</hi> be a witneſs, who in his Oration in the Council at the <hi>Laterane,</hi> under <hi>Leo</hi> 10. inveighing againſt the Councils at <hi>Piſa, Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> makes one to be <hi>Babel,</hi> and the other <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. As I proved before, the Papiſts are divided into two ſeveral pretended Catholick Churches by making themſelves two Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns: but ſo are not we: For we have but one Head Jeſus Chriſt. That they are two Churches (beſides what is ſaid) hear the words of <hi>Cajetane</hi> in the foreſaid Oration <hi>(in Bin. p.</hi> 552.) <hi>[This Novelty of</hi> Piſa, <hi>ſprung up at</hi> Conſtance, <hi>and vaniſhed.

Nor doth it embrace the Principality of that One, who is in the Church triumphant, and preſerveth the Church militant; and which the Synod of</hi> Piſa <hi>ought to embrace if it came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not, as it doth, to rely on the Government of a multitude. The Church of the</hi> Piſans <hi>therefore doth far differ from this Church of Chriſt. For one is the Church of believers: the other of Cavillers: One of the houſhold of God; the other of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone us: One (is the Church) of Chriſtian men: the other of ſuch as fear not to tear the coat of Chriſt, and divide the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical members of Chriſt from his myſtical body.]</hi> This was ſpoken in Council with applauſe. And can there yet be greater diviſions then theſe?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They have been utterly divided about the very power of chooſing their Pope, in whom they muſt unite. In one age the <hi>People</hi> choſe him: In another the <hi>Clergy</hi> choſe him; ſometime <hi>both together:</hi> For a long time the <hi>Emperours</hi> choſe him: At laſt only the <hi>Cardinals</hi> choſe him. And ſometime a <hi>General Council</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55445:52"/>
hath choſen him. <hi>Our Catholick Church</hi> hath no ſuch uncertain Head, but one thats the ſame yeſterday to day and for ever.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They have often had two or three Popes at once, and one part of the Church hath followed one, and another the other: yea (as is ſaid for forty years together, none knew the true Pope) ſaith <hi>Cajetane ubi ſup. [Of the Schiſm of that time there were three ſo accounted Popes, that none of them might be eſteemed the Succeſſor of</hi> Peter <hi>either certain, or without ambiguity.]</hi> For many ages one part hath been running after one, and the other after the other, or ſtriving about them. But we are all agreed in our Head without Controverſie.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They have killed multitudes of perſons in their diviſions about the choice of their Pope (as in <hi>Damaſus</hi> choice) And they have had many bloody wars to the dividing of the Church about their Popes and between Pope and Pope. This was their Unity. It would make a Chriſtian aſhamed and grieved to read of the lamentable wars and diviſions of Chriſtendom, either between or about their Popes.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Their Popes and Chriſtian Emperor, Kings and Princes, have been in yet longer and more grievous wars.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They have ſet Princes againſt Princes, and Nations againſt Nations in wars about the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of the Popes for many ages together: and it is too ſeldom otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They have ſet Kings and their own ſubjects together in wars, as <hi>England</hi> and almoſt all Chriſtendom hath known by ſad experience.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. They have Excommunicated Princes, and encouraged their ſubjects to expell them, and to murder them: hence were the inhumane murders of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, Kings of <hi>France;</hi> and the Powder Plot, and may Treaſons in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> This is their Unity.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. They center and unite the Church in an impotent, inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Head, that is not able to do the Office of a Head, to the hundredth part of the Church, and therefore cannot poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve unity. But our Head is all-ſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. They ſet up not only a Controverted head, which all the Churches never agreed to, nor ever will do, but alſo a falſe uſurping Head, which the Churches dare not and ought not to unite in. Whereas Jeſus Chriſt is beyond contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55445:53"/>
the juſt and lawfull Head of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Your Agreement and Unity is with none but your own ſect: and is this ſo great a matter to boaſt off? you divide your ſelves from moſt of the Catholick Church, and caſt them off as Hereticks, or Schiſmaticks; and then boaſt of a Unity among your ſelves. And ſo may the Quakers, the Anabaptiſts, the Socinians, as well as you: Or if you magnifie your Unity from the greatneſs of your number that agree, the Greek Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is numerous: and yet in this we far exceed you. For the true Catholick is in Union with all the Members of Chriſt on earth. We lay our Unity on the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and ſo are united with all true Chriſtians in the world: even with many of them that reproach us: when you laying your Unity on I know not how many doubtfull points, yea, on you know not what your ſelves, can extend it no further then to your ſect. Which is the more notable and glorious Unity? to be United to the truly Catholick body, containing all true Chriſtians in the world, or to be at Unity with a ſect, which is the leſſer and more corrupted part of the Church?</p>
                     <p n="14">14. With what face can Papiſts glory in their Unity, that are the greateſt Dividers of the Church on earth? Who is it that condemneth the greateſt part of the Church, and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth that condemnation with fire and ſword, or ſo much vehemence, as the Papiſts do? when they have moſt audaciouſly divided themſelves from all others, and arrogated the title of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks to themſelves, they call this abominable Schiſm by the name of Unity. If you ſay that the Reformers have divided themſelves from all others too: I anſwer, not as from Hereticks, or no members of the ſame body with us, as you do: but only as from unſound miſtaken Brethren: And therefore properly we are not divided from them, but only from their miſtakes. We think it not lawfull to join with the deareſt Brethren in ſinning, or in that worſhip (by perſonal local communion) where we cannot keep our innocency: But yet we hold the unity of the Spirit with them in the bond of Peace: and are one with them in all the ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, and holy worſhip. Even where diſtance of place, or circumſtantiall differences keep us from Communion in the ſame Aſſemblies: yet our ſeveral Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have communion in faith, and Love, and the ſubſtance of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55445:53"/>
worſhip as to the kind, ſo that our diviſion from other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is nothing to the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But yet when any differ from us in any point Eſſential to our Religion (that is, to Chriſtianity,) they are none of us, nor owned by us; and therefore you cannot ſay that we are at difference among our ſelves, becauſe ſome Apoſtates have faln off from us. You will not allow us to ſay you have many ſects, becauſe ſome of you have turned Socinians, or becauſe thouſands of yours have turned to the Reformers, in the dayes of <hi>Luther, Calvin, &amp;c.</hi> And why then ſhould thoſe ſects be numbred with us that are not of us, but went out from us? If men turn Infidels, Seekers, Quakers, Socinians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are not of us no more then of you. If you ſay that we bred them: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no more than you breed them, when they turn to the ſame ſects from you: Nor no more then you bred the Lutherans, far better men. They went out from you, and yet you bred them not: But on the other ſide, you cheriſh thoſe as part of your Church, which differ from you in your <hi>fundamentals;</hi> ſo that the Pope dare not unchurch or diſown them (as the French, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> but ſo do not we.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Our Unity is in <hi>Poſitives,</hi> and theirs is in <hi>Negatives:</hi> Ours is a Unity in faith; and theirs is <hi>in not believing the contrary:</hi> And ſo dead men, may have a fuller Unity in the grave then the Papiſts have.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Our Union is Divine, having a Divine Head and Center, and Divine Doctrine and Law in which we agree. But the Papiſts is humane, having a carnal Head and Center, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Decrees and Canons for its matter and Rule.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. They have not ſo ſure a means of retaining men in their unity as we have: Let experience be Judge of this: For where one hath forſaken our Unity and Communion, I ſuppoſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, if not thouſands, have forſaken theirs, as <hi>France, Belgia, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Tranſilvania, England, Scotland, Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> can witneſs: and if themſelves might be believed, the Greek Church, and all, or almoſt all the Chriſtians elſe in the world have gone from their unity. And yet will they glory in the effectualneſs of their means of unity? Why then did they not retain all theſe Nations in their unity?</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Moreover, indeed they have very little Religious unity at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55445:54"/>
all among them; for its force and terror that keeps men in their Church: And who can tell under ſuch violence how many ſtick to them in Conſcience and willingly? He that will forſake their Religion in <hi>Spain,</hi> muſt be tormented and burnt at a ſtake, and in other Countreys where they have full power, he muſt be at leaſt undone. So that 1. Theirs is a unity of bodies more then of minds: 2. And their union is not procured by the Pope as Pope; but by the temporal ſword, which the Pope hath uſurped over ſome countreys, and which deluded Princes uſe by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in other Countreys. What a jugling deceit then is this, to perſwade poor ſouls, that the only way to unity is to Center in the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that this is the moſt effectual means of ending differences! when in the mean they make ſo little uſe of it, and place ſo little confidence in it themſelves, but uphold their unity by the <hi>Magiſtrates ſword?</hi> And if this be the way, we have <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> among us as well as they, that can as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally compell men to unity, as far as their Judgements tell them it is fit: And beſides this force, it is the riches and preferment of their Clergy, with their immunity from ſecular power, &amp; the like, that is the means of their unity. But it is the light of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture opened by a faithfull Miniſtry, and countenanced by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtracy without tyranny, that is our means of unity.</p>
                     <p>If the Papal Headſhip be ſo effectuall a means of unity as they pretend, and if they are ſo much of a mind as they ſay, let them give us leave but to preach one 12. moneths in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> if they dare: or let them give men leave without fire and ſword to chooſe their Religion.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. And yet beſides all this, and after all this tyranny, they have more difference among themſelves then we have, or then all the Chriſtians that I hear of in the world. And to hide the Infamy of their differences, they tolerate them, and extenuate them. For differences in Diſcipline, and order of Worſhip they allow abundance of ſects called <hi>Orders,</hi> that men and women may chooſe which they pleaſe. And the voluminous differences of their Schoolmen, Caſuiſts and Commentators, they ſay are not in matters of faith. But call them what you will, they are many of them greater differences then are with us. I pray read over the <hi>Janſenians</hi> Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm, and take notice of the differences between the Jeſuites and them in Caſe-
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55445:54"/>

And <hi>Caramovel</hi> in his Fundamental Theologie takes it for certain, and thence concludes, that <hi>[a Prieſt not only may kill a detractor on certain occaſions, but ſometimes ought to do it]</hi> And yet the peeviſh Janſeniſt believeth none of this.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt ſtop: you may read in the ſaid Janſenians Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm, a volumn of ſuch paſſages of the Jeſuites, allowing men to give and receive the Sacrament when they come that day from Adultery: and allowing a man to eat and drink as much as he can with his health: and diſcharging men from a Neceſſity of Loving God, unleſs it be once in their lives, or as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55445:56"/>
others ſay, upon Holy-daies, or as <hi>Hurtado de Mendoza,</hi> once a year, or as <hi>Conink,</hi> once in three or four years, or as <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez,</hi> once in five years, or as Anthon. Sirmond, <hi>not at all, ſo we do not hate him, and do obey his other commands,</hi> with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more.</p>
                     <p>Now Reader I would here leave it to thy conſideration, whether all theſe differences among the Papiſts are ſo ſmall as to be no matters of faith. And I intreat you to read over the forementioned Book, (the Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm) and then judge whether Papiſts or the Reformed Catholicks are more at unity among themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Well! but ſuppoſe the loving of God, the avoiding murder, bribery, and the like, be no matter of faith at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet I have not done with them ſo. I deſire to know <hi>whether the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be matter of faith or not?</hi> They dare not deny but it is. Well! and what is the Scripture, but the words <hi>ut ſigna,</hi> and the ſenſe or matter <hi>ut res ſignificata?</hi> And are the Papiſts agreed among themſelves about either of theſe? no: For the words, its well known how ſome of the beſt Learned of them have ſtood for the preheminence of the Hebrew and Greek Texts: and others, and the moſt, for the vulgar Latine. And that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine Tranſlation hath been altered and altered again by them. And after many others comes Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, and makes it ſo compleat, that the Church is required to uſe his Edition; yet after him comes Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth and mends it in many hundred, if not thouſand places, and impoſes this upon the Church; which of theſe Popes was Infallible? I am ſure they much differ in their Tranſlations.</p>
                     <p>And for the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſcripture, though men muſt ſwear to take Scripture in the Churches ſenſe, yet will not any Pope or Council to this day, tell us the ſenſe of them, either by giving us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Commentary, or by deciding the many thouſand differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are among their Commentators. Do not all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators forſwear themſelves, having ſworn (thoſe that lived ſince the Council of Trent) to expound Scripture in the ſence of the Church, and only according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers. And why doth not the Pope decide theſe controverſies? ſeing it is their happineſs to have ſuch a Judge of Controverſies to keep them all of a mind?</p>

                     <p>They cannot endure to hear us diſtinguiſh the <hi>fundamentals</hi> (that is, the <hi>Eſſentials)</hi> of our Religion from the reſt: and therefore they call out to us for a Catalogue of our fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and would perſwade us that whatſoever is matter of faith, is of Neceſſity to ſalvation to be believed, and thoſe are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereticks that deny them, and therefore we muſt not make any ſuch difference. See <hi>Knot</hi> againſt <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> Their deſign in this is to perſwade people that the world muſt be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their mind in matters of faith, or elſe they cannot be ſaved. And by this trick they would prove that the Proteſtants and many other Churches are all Hereticks, and therefore have no place in General Councils, and are no parts of the Catholick Church. But let us conſider how judiciouſly they proceed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We muſt deſire the Papiſts to tell us whether Chriſtianity be any thing or nothing? If any thing, it hath its Eſſence: and 2. Whether this Eſſence of Chriſtianity be Knowable or not? If not, then they cannot know a Chriſtian from another: and they cannot know the Church from other Societies. If it be knowable, then its Eſſence muſt needs be knowable. 3. And we would be informed by them, whether all true Chriſtians in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55445:57"/>
the world are of the ſame ſtature or degree of knowledge and explicite belief? If they be, then there's no difference between Fathers and Babes, Strong and Weak, Prieſt and People; and then the Jeſuites have no more Knowledge or Faith then the ſimpleſt woman of their Church: but if there be a difference, then 4. We would know whether the Eſſence of Chriſtianity be varyed according to theſe degrees. If ſo, then there are as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of Chriſtianity in the world, as there be degrees of Faith; which they have more wit, I ſuppoſe, then to affirm. If not, then the Eſſence of Chriſtianity is diſtinguiſhable from the Integrity or ſuperadded Degrees, which is the thing that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for. 5. We deſire alſo to know whether the Apoſtles did not go on to teach their people more, after they had made them Chriſtians, in a ſtate of ſalvation. And whether the Prieſts, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Jeſuits will give men up, and teach them nothing more when they have made them Chriſtians. I know they will ſay, There's more to be taught. And if ſo, then the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity are diſtinguiſhable from the Integrals or Degrees. 6. And we would know elſe how they will underſtand that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12, 14. and 6. 1, 2. <hi>[For when for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, and are become ſuch as have need of milk and not of ſtrong meat. For every one that uſeth milk is unskilful in the word of righteouſneſs, for he is a babe. But ſtrong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, who by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern good and evil: therefore leaving the Principles of the doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not laying again the foundation,</hi> &amp;c.] Tell us now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtle do not here diſtinguiſh between babes and ſtrong men; milk and ſtrong meat; the principles or foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perfection? 7. And we would know of them whether all that is Revealed by God be of abſolute Neceſſity to every mans ſalvation that do or may hear it? If ſo, then no man can be ſaved that knoweth not all that God hath revealed; and then no one in the world can be ſaved: for here we know but in part. And their own Commentators differ about the word of God, which ſheweth that they are imperfect in the Knowledge of its ſenſe. And their Pope knows it not, or elſe he is ſhamefully to blame, that will not tell it the world, and reconcile his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55445:57"/>
and Diſputers. But if all revealed be not of Abſolute Neceſſity, then we may have leave to diſtinguiſh between points abſolutely Neceſſary, and the reſt. 8. And we would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all ſhall be damned, that know not as much as the moſt Learned and Wiſe? if not, then ſtill we may have leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh. 9. Further we demand, whether any ignorance or error that is culpable, will ſtand with Charity and Salvation? If not, then who ſhall be ſaved? If yea; then we may ſtill diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the points of Abſolute Neceſſity from the reſt. 10. We demand alſo, whether the whole holy Scripture be the word of God? If ſo, then whether we ought not to believe it all as far as we can underſtand it? And if ſo, whether it be not all, <hi>de fide</hi> matter of Faith? If not, they muſt tell us, what part of Gods word is to be believed, and what not. If yea; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly men may err <hi>de fide</hi> in points of Faith, and yet have Charity, and be ſaved: as their diſagreeing Commentators, Caſuiſts and Schoolmen do. 11. We would know whether the matters that their Divines are diſagreed in, be Revealed by God, or things unrevealed? If not revealed, do they not deſerve to be kickt out of the world, for troubling the world ſo with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed things? If they be Revealed, are they not Revealed to be believed, and ſo are <hi>de fide?</hi> 12. And we would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not ſome things <hi>Eſſential to true Obedience,</hi> and ſome things not Eſſential? If not, then no ſinner hath ſincere Obedience, and can be ſaved: If yea; then why may not the ſame be ſaid of faith? 13. Alſo we would know, when they baptize the Adult, whether they require any profeſſion of the faith from them or not? If not, they may as well baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels or Heathens. If they do, then what is that profeſſion? Is it a profeſſion of every particular truth that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be believed? No ſure: for then none but Doctors muſt be baptized. Nor they neither. Or is it a profeſsion of ſome particular Truths only? If of ſome only, why of thoſe more then the reſt, if they be not the Eſſentials diſtinguiſhable from the reſt? And do they make men true Chriſtians by baptizing them, or not? If they do, then ſure the Baptiſmal faith muſt contain all that is Eſſential to Chriſtianity. 14. We deſire alſo to be informed by them, what is the uſe of the Churches Creed, and why they have uſed frequently to make confeſsion of their

faith? Was it not the whole faith Eſſential to Chriſtianity which they confeſt? If not, then it was not fit to be the badge of the Church; or of the Orthodox: if yea; then it ſeems thoſe Creeds had in them the eſſentials diſtinguiſhed from the reſt. 15. we would know whether every thing delivered or defined by any General Council, be of ſuch neceſſity to ſalvation, that all muſt explicitely believe them all that will be ſaved? If ſo, then whether any Papiſt can be ſaved, ſeeing they underſtand them not all? If not, then ſure a diſtinction muſt be made. 16. And we would know how they can countenance ignorance ſo much as they do, if all things revealed be of equal neceſſity to ſalvation. 17. And what mean they to diſtinguiſh of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite and Explicite faith? Is it enough to believe as the Church believes, and not know what in any particular? then it is not <hi>de fide,</hi> or neceſſary to ſalvation to believe the reſurrection of Chriſt, or of man, or the life to come. For a man may believe that the Church is in the right, and yet not know that it holdeth any of theſe. Is it enough to believe the formal object of faith (which with us is Gods veracity) without the material? Or is it enough to remain Infidels, and only believe that the Church are true Believers? If you hold to this, you make no act of faith, but one <hi>(the believing that the Church, that is, the Pope or Council are true believers)</hi> to be of Neceſſity to ſalvation. But if there be ſomething that is Neceſſary to be <hi>actually</hi> (that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely) <hi>believed,</hi> then muſt not that be diſtinguiſhed from the reſt and made known? 18. Whence is it that you denominate men <hi>fideles, believers</hi> with you? Is it from a Poſitive faith, or for <hi>not holding the contrary?</hi> If the <hi>latter,</hi> then Stones, and Beaſts, and Pagans, and their Infants may be believers. If the <hi>former,</hi> then that Poſitive faith from whence all believers are denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated muſt be known. 19. Is not that true faith and all that is eſſential to Chriſtianity, which doth conſiſt with ſaving grace or (to uſe your phraſe) with true Charity? If not, then either Infidels and no Chriſtians may have true Charity, or elſe true Charity may be in the unjuſtified; or both: If yea, (which doubtleſs you will yield) then ſure men of lower knowledge and faith then Doctors, may have true Charity; and therefore true faith. 20. Laſtly, I appeal to your own confeſſions. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> often diſtinguiſheth between the points that all muſt

Diſp.</hi> 43. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. faith of the Article of Chriſts deſcending into Hell <hi>[If by an Article of faith we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a truth which all the faithfull are bound explicitely to know and believe, ſo I do not think it neceſſary to reckon this among the Articles of faith, becauſe it is not altogether neceſſary for all men]</hi> Here you ſee that <hi>Suarez</hi> diſtinguiſheth between Articles of Neceſſity to all, and thoſe that are not: and that he excepts even the Deſcent into Hell from this number of Articles Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all I might cite many more of your writers; but the thing is well known.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps you'l ſay, <hi>that though all that is</hi> de fide, <hi>be not neceſſary to be believed explicitely by all, yet implicitely it muſt.</hi> I <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. that which you call <hi>Implicite believing</hi> is no <hi>believing that point, but another point:</hi> yea a point that doth not ſo much as infer that: for it followeth not <hi>[the Church is infallible, therefore Chriſt deſcended into Hell.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And we believe all that is <hi>de fide</hi> with an <hi>Implicite faith</hi> as well as you: But it is an <hi>Implicite Divine faith,</hi> and not <hi>humane:</hi> For we are ſure that <hi>All that God ſaith is true;</hi> and this <hi>Divine veracity</hi> is the formal object of our faith. And we believe that all that is in Scripture is true, and that all that was ever delivered by the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt is true.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But all that is</hi> de fide <hi>is ſo neceſſary, that it will not ſtand with ſalvation to believe the contrary, or deny or diſ-believe any point of faith. Anſw.</hi> 1. That cannot be true, For no man can prove that a point may not be denyed and diſputed againſt by a true Believer as long as he is ignorant that it is true, and from God: the ſame ignorance that keeps him from knowing it, may cauſe him to deny it, and gainſay it. 2. Do not your own differing Commentators, Schoolmen and Caſuiſts (on one ſide at leaſt) diſpute voluminouſly againſt ſome Truths of Divine revelation? If you change a mans mind from the ſmalleſt error by diſpute, do you take that to be a change of his ſtate from death to life? <hi>Aenaeas Sylvius</hi> thought a General Council was above the Pope: but when he came to be Pope <hi>Pins</hi> the ſecond, he thought the Pope above a General Council; was this a change from death to life? It ſeems by his Bull of Retractation, he
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55445:60"/>
thought ſo, but ſo did not ſeveral General Councils: was the Catholick Church Repreſentative at the Councill of <hi>Baſil,</hi> or <hi>Conſtance,</hi> or <hi>Piſa</hi> in a ſtate of death and damnation for believing the Pope to be ſubject to a General Council? or was the Council at <hi>Laterane</hi> (another Repreſentative Catholick Church) in a ſtate of death for holding the Contrary? Muſt either Pope <hi>John</hi> the twenty ſecond, or Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> be damned becauſe of the contrariety of their Decrees? If the Council of <hi>Toletane</hi> the firſt ordain <hi>that he that hath a Concubine inſtead of a wife, ſhall not be kept from the Sacrament,</hi> doth it prove them all in a ſtate of death? If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſs that the ſixth General Council at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have many errors, doth it follow that the Catholick Church repreſentative was in a damnable ſtate? If the ſecond Council at <hi>Nice</hi> maintain the <hi>corpercity of Angels,</hi> and the firſt Council at the <hi>Latarane</hi> maintain the <hi>contrary,</hi> doth it follow that one of them was in a ſtate of death? I think not: (though I am ſure it proves a General Council fallible, when approved by the Pope, and therefore Popery a deceit.) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſometime tells us of the change of his own mind.</p>
                     <p>And the Retractations of <hi>Auſtin</hi> (a better man) tell us of the change of his mind in many things: And yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that he was in a ſtate of death and unjuſtified before.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But all that is</hi> de fide <hi>is of Neceſſity to the Salvation of ſome, though not of all. Anſw.</hi> 1. If that be granted, yet you muſt grant us leave to diſtinguiſh between Points neceſſary to be believed by all, and points that are not thus neceſſary to all. 2. But in what caſe is it that you mean, that other points are of Neceſſity to ſome? 1. Is it to thoſe ſome that know them to be of Divine Revelation? we eaſily grant you that: But that is not becauſe the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves are ſimply neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but becauſe a <hi>Belief of Gods veracity,</hi> and the Truth of all that he Revealeth in general, is of neceſſity: and he that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth that God is True <hi>(verax)</hi> cannot chuſe but believe <hi>all to be True</hi> which he knows God revealeth. He that thinketh God to be a Lyar, in one word, doth not believe <hi>his veracity,</hi> and ſo hath no Divine faith at all. And therefore you need not fear leſt any one ſhould be guilty of not believing that which they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55445:60"/>
know is the word of God, but thoſe that take God to be a Lyar, and that is thoſe that take him not to be God, and ſo are Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts. But ſtill the thing of Abſolute neceſſity is but firſt to believe in General that God is true in all his word, ſecondly and to believe the truth of the eſſential points of Chriſtianity in particular (embracing the Good propounded in them.) Now its true that ſecondarily all known Truths are of neceſſity to be believed, becauſe elſe our General belief of Gods veracity is not ſincere. But yet we muſt ſay that antecedently even to that perſon, theſe ſuperadded truths were not of Neceſſity to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be believed, becauſe they were not of ſuch Neceſsity to be <hi>Known;</hi> and if they had not been known, you would ſay your ſelves there had not been ſuch Neceſsity of Believing them.</p>
                     <p>But if you go further, and ſay, that <hi>all that were obliged to know them, or that had opportunity, or the Revelation if the truth, and yet did not, and thereupon deny them culpably, are in a ſtate of death;</hi> I deny that, and ſhall prove it falſe. Its true, that a <hi>wilfull</hi> refuſing the <hi>Light,</hi> becauſe men <hi>love darkneſs rather then light,</hi> is a certain ſign of a graceleſs wretch. But <hi>every culpable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and unbelief is not Damning ignorance or unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Otherwiſe no man ſhould be ſaved: For no man is void of culpable ignorance, and conſequently of culpable unbelief. Had we never been wanting in the uſe of means, there's no man but might have known more then he doth. Is there any one of you that dare refuſe to ask God forgiveneſs of your ignorance, unbelief, or the negligence that is the culpable cauſe of them, or that dare ſay, you need no pardon of them? 2. If you plead for venial ſin, how can you deny a venial unbelief upon venial ignorance? But then I pray you learn more wit and piety, 1. then to ſay that your venial unbelief or ſin is no ſin, ſave as Analogically ſo called; or 2. then to ſay it deſerves a pardon, or deſerves not everlaſting puniſhment. But if you will call it <hi>venial,</hi> becauſe being conſiſtent with the true Love of God and habitual Holineſs, and ſaving faith, the Law of Grace doth pardon it, and not condemn men for it, thus we would agree with you that there is <hi>veniall ſin;</hi> but then you muſt yield us that there is venial unbelief.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And we eaſily prove all this from the Law of God. It
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55445:61"/>
is the nature of the preceptive part to conſtitute Duty only, and the violation of that is ſin: But it is the ſanction, the promiſe and threatning that Determines of the Reward and Penalty: Now it is only the old Law of works that makes the Threatening as large as the prohibition, condemning man for every ſin: but ſo doth not the Law of Grace. The precept ſtill commandeth Perfect obedience, and ſo makes it a duty; but the promiſe maketh not perfect obedience the condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience, though imperfect. The Law of Nature ſtill makes everlaſting Death due to every ſin: But it is ſuch a Due as hath a Remedy at hand provided and offered in the Goſpel; and is actually reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed to all true believers. So that as it is not every ſin that will damn us, though damnation be due to it (becauſe we have a preſent Remedy;) ſo it is not every culpable ignorance or unbelief that will damn us, though it deſerve damnation, becauſe the Goſpel doth not only not damn us for it, but pardons it, by acquitting us from the condemnation of the Law. All this may teach you, not only to mend your abominable doctrine about Mortal and veniall ſin, but alſo to diſcern the reaſon why a man may deny ſome points of faith that are not of the eſſence of Chriſtianity, and yet not be damned for it, becauſe the Law of Grace doth not condemn him for it, though he be culpable, becauſe the Law of Grace may command further then it peremptorily condemneth in caſe of diſobedience. It is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> that makes faith the <hi>Condition of Life,</hi> though it be the <hi>Precept</hi> that makes it a <hi>duty:</hi> Now it ſaveth not as a <hi>performed Duty</hi> directly, (becauſe the precept gives not the Reward) but as a <hi>performed Condition:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unbelief condemneth not effectually as a meer ſin directly, but as <hi>ſuch a ſin</hi> as is the violation or non-performance of that condition. But it is not a belief of every thing that is prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptively <hi>de fide,</hi> which is made the condition of life.</p>

ANother of their Juglings is, <hi>to extoll the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Catholick Church as that which muſt be the ground of faith, and the decider of all Controverſies:</hi> And to this end they plead againſt the ſufficiency of Scripture, and bend all the force of their arguings and deſigns, as if all their hope lay in this point, and as if it were a granted thing that the day is theirs, and we are loſt, if the Catholick Church be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be the Judge. Hence it is that they cry out againſt private faith and opinions, and call men to the faith of the Church, and perſwade the poor people, that the Church is for them, and we are but branches broken off.</p>
                     <p>Well, we are content to deal with them at their own weapon, and at that one in which they put their truſt. For our parts we know that the true Catholick Church (nor any member of it, <hi>in ſenſu Compoſito)</hi> cannot err in any of the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Chriſtianity (for then it would ceaſe to be the Church:) But we have too much reaſon to Judge that it is not free from error in leſſer things. But yet for all that in the main cauſe between the Papiſts and us, we refuſe not their judgement. Nay we turn this Canon againſt the Canoneers, and eaſily prove that the Papiſts cauſe is utterly loſt, if the Catholick Church be Judge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But is it the Ancient Church, or the preſent Church that muſt decide the cauſe?</hi> Well! It ſhall be which you will. For the moſt Ancient Church in the Apoſtles dayes, we are altogether of its belief, and ſtand to its deciſion in all things; and if you prove we miſtake them in any thing, we ſhall gladly receive inſtruction and be reclaimed. To them we appeal for our Eſſentials and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals.

                        <hi>Yea, but this will not ſerve their turn: It is the preſent Church that muſt judge or none: For</hi> ſay they, <hi>if the ancient Church had power, ſo hath the preſent: and if the ancient Church had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth, how ſhall we know it but by the preſent?</hi> I anſwer, 1. We may know it by the Records of thoſe times far

ſurer then by the reports of men without writing: Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or numerous myſterious points are ſorrily carryed in the memories, eſpecially of the moſt, even of the Teachers. And for the Records, one diligent skilfull man will know more then ten thouſand others. One <hi>Baronius, Albaſpinaeus, Petavius,</hi> among the Papiſts, and one <hi>Uſher, Blondell, Salmaſius, Gataker, &amp;c.</hi> among the Proteſtants, knew more of the mind of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, then a whole Country beſides, or perhaps then ſome Generall Councils.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Well! but if you appeal to the greater number, to them ſhall you go. You muſt be tried by the preſent Church; Why then you are condemned.

If you ſay, the Better part ſhall be judge: who ſhall be Judge which is the Better part? we are ready to prove the Reformed Churches the Better part: and if we do not, we will give you the day, and loſe our cauſe. But I ſuppoſe you will appeal to the Greater part. Content! Then the world knows you are loſt. The Greeks, Moſcovites, Armenians, Abaſſines, and all other Churches in <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> are far more then the Papiſts; and your own pens and mouths tell us that theſe are againſt you. Many of them curſe you as Hereticks or Schiſmaticks; the reſt of them know you not, or refuſe your government. They all agree againſt your Popes univerſall Headſhip or Soveraignty, and ſo againſt the very form of your new Catholick Church: So that the world knows the Judgement of the far greateſt part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on earth to be againſt you in the main, ſo that you ſee what you get by appealing to the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>But I know you will ſay, that all theſe are Schiſmaticks, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and none of the Catholick Church: But they ſay as much by you, ſome of them, and all of them abhor your charge; and how do you prove it? and who ſhall be Judge whether they, or you be the Catholick Church? You tell us of your ſucceſſion, and of twenty tales that are good, if you may be Judges your ſelves; but ſo do they ſay as much which is good if they be Judges. When we offer to diſpute our caſe with you, you ask us <hi>Who ſhall be Judge,</hi> and tell us <hi>the Catholick Church muſt be Judge:</hi> But who ſhall be Judge between you and them which is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55445:62"/>
Church? you will not let us be Judges in our own cauſe, and why then ſhould you? Are we Proteſtants the <hi>leſſer number</hi> as to you? ſo are you to all the reſt that are againſt you. And what reaſon have we to let the <hi>leſſer number</hi> Judge over the <hi>Greater?</hi> If ſtill you ſay, becauſe you are the <hi>Better,</hi> let that be firſt tryed; but no reaſon you ſhould there alſo be the Judges.</p>
                     <p>So that the caſe is plainly come to this, <hi>Either the Papiſts muſt ſtand to the Greater number,</hi> and then the controverſie is at end: or they muſt ſhamefully ſay, <hi>we will not diſpute with you, unleſs we may be the Judges our ſelves, though the fewer.</hi> Or elſe they muſt lay by their talk of a Judge, and diſpute it equally with us, by producing their evidence, which we are ever ready for.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 9. THE moſt common and prevalent Deceit of the Papiſts is, <hi>by ambiguous terms to deceive thoſe that cannot force them to diſtinguiſh, and to make you believe they mean one thing, when they mean another, and to mock you with cloudy words.</hi> I ſhall here warn you to look to them therefore eſpecially in three terms, on which much of their controverſies lies, that is, the words <hi>Church, Pope, and Council.</hi> For there's but few underſtand what they mean by any one of theſe words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When you come to diſpute of the Church with them, ſee that you agree firſt under your hands of the Definition of that Church of which you diſpute. And when you call them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it, you will find them in a wood, you will little think how many ſeverall things it is that they call <hi>[the Church:]</hi> For example, ſometime they mean <hi>the whole Body, Paſtors and People:</hi> but more commonly they mean <hi>only the Paſtors,</hi> which are the far ſmalleſt part. And ſometime they mean the <hi>Church Reall:</hi> and ſometimes only the Church <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> as they call it in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councill. But whether they mean the Paſtors or People, they exclude all ſaving the Pope of his ſubjects, and ſo by the <hi>[Church]</hi> mean but a <hi>part or ſect.</hi> Sometime in the Queſtion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55445:63"/>
about <hi>Tradition,</hi> ſome of the French take the <hi>[Church]</hi> for the <hi>community,</hi> (as fathers deliver the doctrine of Chriſt to their children, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And ſometime they take it in its <hi>Politicall</hi> ſence, for a holy ſociety, conſiſting of a <hi>viſible Head and members:</hi> But then they agree not of that Head, ſome ſetting the <hi>Pope higheſt,</hi> and ſome the <hi>Councill.</hi> But frequently they take the word <hi>[Church]</hi> for the ſuppoſed <hi>Head alone,</hi> as in moſt queſtions about Infallibility, Judging of Controverſies, expounding Scripture, keeping of Traditions, defining points of faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They ſay, <hi>The Church muſt do theſe:</hi> but commonly they mean the <hi>ſuppoſed Head:</hi> And one part mean a <hi>Generall Councill:</hi> and the Jeſuites and Italians, and predominant part do mean <hi>only the Pope:</hi> ſo that when they talk of the <hi>whole Catholick Church,</hi> and call you to its Judgement, and boaſt of its Infallibility (you would little think it) they mean all this while but <hi>one poor ſinfull man:</hi> and ſuch a man as ſometime hath been more unlearned then many of your ſchool boys of twelve or fourteen years of age; and ſometime hath been a Murderer, Adulterer, and (if General Councils, or the common vote may be believed) an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, an Infidel, an Incarnate Devil. This man is their Church, as <hi>Gretſer, Bellarmine,</hi> and the reſt of that ſtrain profeſs.</p>
                     <p>So that if you do but force them to define and explain what they mean by the Church, you will either cauſe them to open their nakedneſs, or find them all to pieces about the very ſubject of the Diſpute.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. So alſo when they uſe the name of <hi>[a Pope]</hi> in diſputation, make them explain themſelves, and tell you <hi>(in a Definition)</hi> what they mean by <hi>[a Pope.]</hi> For, though you would think this term were ſufficiently underſtood, yet you ſhall find them utterly at a loſs, and all to pieces about it. Let us conſider diſtinctly of the Efficient, Matter, and Form. 1 As to the efficient cauſe of their Pope, there muſt concur a <hi>Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which they can no where ſhew) and a <hi>call from man (&amp; Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> what man or men have power to make a Head to the Catholick Church.) But whether they will call it an <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> or only a <hi>Cauſa ſine qua nen, Election</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> muſt go to make a Pope. Now either they <hi>will</hi> put theſe into their <hi>Definition,</hi> or <hi>not.</hi> If <hi>not,</hi> know of them <hi>whether a man without Election and Ordination may be Pope:</hi> If ſo, what
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55445:63"/>
                        <hi>makes him one?</hi> If <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> then he that can conquer <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſit down in the chair is Pope: If <hi>not poſſeſſion,</hi> what then? and why may not any man ſay, I am Pope? well: but doubtleſs they will tell you that <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Ordination,</hi> or both, is Neceſſary. If ſo, then firſt for <hi>Election,</hi> is it Neceſſary to the being of a Pope, that <hi>ſome certain perſons Elect</hi> who have the Power, or will <hi>any Electors</hi> ſerve whoſoever? If <hi>any</hi> will ſerve, then every Monaſtery or every Pariſh may chooſe a Pope: If there muſt be certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Electors, ſee that thoſe be named in the Definition: or at leaſt declared. And then firſt know whether theſe <hi>Electors</hi> are <hi>impowered</hi> to that work by <hi>Divine Law, or by Humane:</hi> If by Divine, let them ſhew it if they can. In Scripture they can never find who muſt chooſe the Pope. And their <hi>Tradition</hi> (if that were a Divine law) hath no ſuch precept, as appeareth by the alterations and divers wayes. And if it be but by a <hi>Humane Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Canon, then it ſeems the <hi>Papacy</hi> is ſo too: for the Power received can have no higher a cauſe then the Power giving or authorizing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When you come to know who theſe Electors muſt be, you open their nakedneſs. For firſt if they ſay, It muſt be the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> ask them, where then was the Pope when there were no <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> in the world? And whether that were a Pope or not that was choſen by the whole <hi>Romane Clergie?</hi> or whether thoſe were Popes or not that were choſen by the <hi>People?</hi> Or thoſe that were choſen by the <hi>Emperours?</hi> or thoſe that were choſen by <hi>Councills?</hi> If they tell you that it muſt be the <hi>Romane Clergie;</hi> Know whether the Cardinals be the whole Romane Clergie, who are Biſhops of other Churches, or whether they are not meerly Titular, at leaſt many of them? And whether the People, the Council, or the Emperours were the Romane Clergy? If they would perſwade you, that either the people, or the Emperour, or Council did not elect the Pope, but only ſhew whom the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Clergy ſhould elect, interpoſing exorbitantly ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt force, with the Due Election, then all currant Hiſtory cryeth ſhame againſt them, and we will lay the Diſpute on that with them readily, though it were with <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf. Nothing almoſt is more evident in the Papal Hiſtory, then that there have been at leaſt theſe five ways of election among them. Let them put it upon this iſſue with us when they will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55445:64"/>
If they allow of any of theſe as valid, which ever it be (as they muſt, or give up their ſucceſſion) then 1. We would know by what Law of God the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> may chooſe a Head for the Catholick Church, any more then the Emperour of <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> or the King of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain?</hi> 2. And we would know when the Emperour hath choſen one, and the Clergy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if not ſome others a third) whether both were not true Popes, if both parties were authorized Electors? And if yet the People chooſe one, and the Romane Clergy another, and the Cardinals alone a third, and the Emperour a fourth, and the Councill a fifth, muſt all theſe ſtand, or which of them, and why? Or if they tell you that it muſt be the particular Roman Church; then 1. If the people of that Church chooſe one, and the Clergy by major vote another, and the Cardinals a third, which is the true Pope? 2. And then the ſucceſſion is gone however: For they were no Popes that Emperors or Councils choſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they ſhall tell you that it is not Election but Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that makes a Pope, yea or that Conſceration is of Neceſſity with Election; then 1. Demand of them <hi>whether it be any one whoſoever that may Conſecrate,</hi> or <hi>whether this high power be confined to certain hands?</hi> If <hi>any</hi> may ſerve, or <hi>any</hi> Biſhops, then he that can get three drunken Biſhops to conſecrate him may be Pope. And then there may be an hundred Popes at once. But if it be confined to certain hands, 2. Let it be put down in the Definition, or at leaſt declared who thoſe are that muſt ordain or conſecrate him. 3. And if they ſay, that <hi>It muſt be only the Italian Biſhops that muſt conſecrate,</hi> then 1. Know of them by what Law of God they have power to conſecrate a Head to the univerſal Church, when all nations are agreed that <hi>quod pertinet ad omnes, ab omnibus tractari debet.</hi> 2. And by what Law they can create or Generate a creature of a more noble ſpecies then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if a beaſt ſhould beget a man? Or whether this prove not, that as a <hi>Biſhop</hi> at firſt was but <hi>Presbyter primae ſedis,</hi> (like the fore man of a Jury) and thence ſprung an <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> who was <hi>Epiſocopus primae ſedis,</hi> and thence a <hi>Patriarck,</hi> who was <hi>Archiepiſcopus primae ſedis;</hi> ſo in proceſs of time, when Pride grew riper, the <hi>Pope</hi> grew to be <hi>Patriarcha primae ſedis;</hi> but not till long after, the <hi>Head or Governour of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church,</hi> nor <hi>Patriarcha Patriarcharum;</hi> no more then
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55445:64"/>
the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> were at firſt <hi>Epiſcopi Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if they can ſhew us no law of God empowring theſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conſecrators, any more then others, then where is the <hi>Papacy</hi> that dependeth on it? There is nothing in Scripture to empower the Italian Biſhops any more then the Gallicane, Germane, or Aſian, to Conſecrate a Head for the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe there were, yet we muſt be reſolved whether it be <hi>ſome</hi> or <hi>all</hi> the Italian Biſhops that muſt do it? If but ſome, which be they? and how is their power proved? If all or any, then 1. What ſhall we do when ſome of them conſecrate one Pope, and ſome another, and ſome a third, which hath fallen out: which of theſe is the Pope? If Conſecration give the Power, then all are Popes. 2. And ſtill the Papal ſucceſſion is overthrown while many Popes had no Conſecration by Italian Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>Thus you may ſee what a caſe the poor Jeſuits or Fryars will be in, if you put them but to inſert the neceſſary Electors and Conſecrators in their Definition of a Pope.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But thats not the worſt, you muſt require them <hi>to put his neceſſary Qualification in the Deſcription.</hi> For if no <hi>Diſpoſition of the Matter</hi> be neceſſary, but <hi>ex quolibet ligno fit mercurius Romanus,</hi> then a Jew or other Infidel may be Pope: which they will deny. And if any <hi>Diſpoſition of the ſubject</hi> be of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to the Reception of the form, then cauſe them to put it down. And then 1. It is either <hi>true Godlineſs:</hi> and then farewell Papacy. 2. Or it is <hi>common honeſty and ſobriety:</hi> and then ſtill farewell Papacy. 3. Or it is <hi>learning and knowledge:</hi> and then <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro,</hi> and others of their own will bear witneſs that ſome Popes underſtood not their Grammar, and one good man being (ſaith <hi>Wernerus) rudis literarum,</hi> was fain to get another Compope to ſay his offices, (though it happened that they could not agree, and ſo a third was choſen, and his choice diſliked, and a fourth choſen, till there was ſix choſen Popes alive at once.) 4. If <hi>age</hi> be neceſſary, then the Children Popes (one at leaſt) have interrupted the ſucceſſion. 5. Yea, if the Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gender be but Neceſſary, Pope <hi>Joan</hi> hath interrupted the ſucceſſion, unleſs between forty or fifty of their own Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans deceive us. 6. but all this is the ſmalleſt part, the Queſtion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55445:65"/>
is <hi>whether faith in Chriſt be of Neceſſity to a Pope?</hi> If ſo, then what will you ſay to <hi>John</hi> the twenty third, that denyed <hi>the life to come,</hi> and to thoſe that have been guilty of <hi>Hereſie?</hi> So that by that time they have put the neceſſary Qualification of a Pope into their Definition, you ſhall find them hard put to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But yet the worſt is behind. They be not agreed about the very <hi>form of the Papacy:</hi> For ſome ſay, <hi>He is the Head of all the Catholick Church</hi> But others with the General Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> ſay, that <hi>he is the Head only of the ſingular members,</hi> but a <hi>ſubject to the Catholick Church repreſented in a Council,</hi> which receiveth its power immediately from Chriſt, ſo that you may ſee what a caſe they will be in, if they be but forced to tell you what they mean by a <hi>Pope,</hi> and to Define him too.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And if they uſe the name of <hi>a General Council,</hi> call them to <hi>Define</hi> what they mean by a <hi>General Council:</hi> ſome of them will ſay, <hi>It muſt be a true Repreſentative of the whole Catholick, Church:</hi> ſo that <hi>Morally</hi> they are all Conſenting to what is there done. But then the doubt remaineth whether there be a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of any certain Number of Biſhops? If not; it ſeems the whole Church may agree that twenty, or ten, or two, or one ſhall repreſent them, and be a general Council. But if this muſt not hold, then <hi>Muſt All the Biſhops of the world be there, or only ſome,</hi> and <hi>how many?</hi> Binnius ſaith, Vol. 1. pag. 313. that <hi>[a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council is that where all the Biſhops of the whole world may and ought to be preſent, unleſs they be lawfully hindred, and in which none but the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>by himſelf or his Legates, is wont to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.]</hi> And vol. 3. pag. 229. <hi>It is when all the Church is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Repreſented, the Pope preſiding.]</hi> But what a loſs are we here at? 1. How prove they that only <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould be members of a Council, and not <hi>Presbyters?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if that were granted them (without proof and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to practiſe) yet we are at a far greater loſs to know what a Biſhop is that muſt here be a member? Is he only the <hi>Primus Presbyterorum</hi> in a presbyterie? Or is he the <hi>Ruler</hi> of a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> (they Ruling the people?) Or is he the <hi>ſole Ruler of Presbyters and people?</hi> And is he to be in <hi>every Pariſh where are divers presbyters?</hi> or only in <hi>every Claſſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55445:65"/>
                        <hi>every County,</hi> or <hi>Province?</hi> Or ſhall the old Rule ſtand, that every <hi>City muſt have one?</hi> If ſo, then are not all our Corporations true Cities? And ſo by any of theſe Rules, there have been few General Councils in the world. And what word of God is there why <hi>London, Worceſter, Canterbury</hi> ſhould have Biſhops; and <hi>Shrewsbury, Ipſwich, Plimouth</hi> and hundreds ſuch ſhould have none? ſo that if the very <hi>matter</hi> of your Councils be ſo humane and diſordered, what is the Council compoſed of ſuch? As moſt of them uſe the term <hi>Biſhop,</hi> you would put them as hard to it to <hi>Define a Biſhop</hi> almoſt, as to define a Pope.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe they help you over this rub, yet by their Definition they null many General Councils, becauſe the Pope preſided not there: even the firſt General Council it ſelf at <hi>Nice</hi> (whatſoever they boldly feign to the contrary.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And by this Rule, either we never had a General Council, or but few: For inſtance, At the firſt Seſſion of the Council of Trent (the laſt and moſt famous Council) there were but four Archbiſhops, and twenty two Biſhops, taking in the Titular Biſhops of <hi>Upſal, Armach,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And at divers other Seſſions after, but eight, or nine, or very few more. In the fourth Seſſion which Decreed to receive Tradition with equal pious affection and reverence as the holy Scriptures, and which gave us a falſe Catalogue of the Canonical Books, there were but the Popes Legates, two Cardinals, nine Archbiſhops (titular and all) and forty one, or forty two Biſhops (titular and all.) Now we would fain know whether this was the whole Church morally repreſented? and whether theſe twenty two, or forty one were all the Biſhops of the world, or the hundreth part of them? Yea whether all the Biſhops of the <hi>African, Aſian,</hi> and other Churches could and ought to have been there?</p>
                     <p>If they ſay that moſt of the Biſhops of the world are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Schiſmaticks, and had nothing to do to be there, we are ſure that this is but the impudent cenſure of a ſect, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churcheth moſt of Chriſts Church, for far leſs faults then it ſelf is guilty of: But how is this heavy cenſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nay to make ſhort of it, its plain by this Definition, that a <hi>General Council</hi> is but a <hi>name</hi> (at leaſt ſince the daies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55445:66"/>
when the Church lay in a narrow room) and that no ſuch thing is to be expected in the world. For 1. If all Biſhops, or half come thither, what ſhall their poor flocks do the while? 2. How many years muſt they be travailing from <hi>America, Ethiopia,</hi> and all the remote parts of the Chriſtian world? 3. So much ſhipping, and proviſion, and ſo many thouſand pound a man is neceſſary for the Convoy of many, that alas the poor Biſhops be not able to defray the hundreth part of the charge. 4. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them are ſo aged and weak, that they are unfit for the journey. 5. Their Princes are ſome of them Infidels, and ſome at wars, and will never give them leave to come. 6. They muſt paſs through many Kingdoms of the enemies, or that are in wars, that will never ſuffer them to paſs. 7. The tediouſneſs, and hazards of the journey, with change of air is like to be the death of moſt of them, and ſo its but a plot to put an end to the Church. 8. The length of General Councils is ſuch (ſome of them being ten years, and ſome (as that at Trent) eighteen years) that ſo many Biſhops to be ſo long abſent from home, is but to give up the Church to Infidelity or Impiety (unleſs the Biſhops be ſuch things as the Church can ſpare.) 9. When they come together, they cannot many of them underſtand one another, becauſe of the diverſity of their languages. 10. And the Number would be ſo great, that ten or twenty Council-houſes or rooms would not hold them: ſo that they could not Converſe in one Aſſembly: ſo that a true General Council now, is but a name to amuſe thoſe that think the world is no bigger then a man may ride over in a weeks journey.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And yet even this Definition of <hi>Binnius</hi> is ridiculous: For he makes it enough that all the Biſhops of the world <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to be there, whether they be there or not. But then what if lazineſs or danger deterr them or detain them? Is that a Council where Biſhops <hi>ought to be</hi> and <hi>are not?</hi> How many muſt <hi>de facto</hi> be preſent, <hi>any or none?</hi> Prove if you can that forty Biſhops are a General Council, becauſe the reſt <hi>ought</hi> to be there. And who ſhall be judge of each mans caſe, whether he <hi>could</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to have been there? will you judge men before they are heard, or their cauſe known? Your ſaying that they <hi>ought to have been there,</hi> is no proof.</p>
                     <p>And yet <hi>Binnius</hi> hath one exception <hi>[unleſs lawfully hindred]</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55445:66"/>
Good ſtill! If all the Biſhops in the world be <hi>lawfully hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> it ſeems it is a General Council when no body is there: You ſee now what you put the poor Papiſts too, if you put them to <hi>define</hi> a <hi>General Council,</hi> or tell you what they mean by that word.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I again adviſe you; let them not befool you with empty or ambiguous words. And when they are all to pieces among themſelves, let them not make you believe they are united by agreeing in <hi>One word,</hi> when they are ſeveral things that are meant by that one word.</p>

                     <p>Firſt therefore we would learn of them, whether the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence and order of the five Patriarchal Sees, began not about the firſt General Council to be lookt after, but was ſetled ſome while after: For till there were General Councils (ſuch as were ſo called) there was no great occaſion of determining which ſhould have the firſt, ſecond, or third ſeat.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Or when ever the time was, yet we enquire, whether theſe other Sees as of <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> or ſome of them were not <hi>Patriarchal</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Rome?</hi> and whether Councils that ſpeak of priority or poſteriority, do not in the ſame manner, and on the ſame grounds, and to the ſame ends give <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> their places, as they give to <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt place? Surely we find them ſpeaking of them as matters of the ſame Order and nature, ſaying, <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall have the firſt place or ſeat, <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Alexandria</hi> the third, <hi>Antioch</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the fifth. 4. And therefore we enquire <hi>whether all theſe have not the ſame kind of right to their prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, whether it be Divine or Humane.</hi> And that the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55445:67"/>
of this Patriarchall order, yea of <hi>Romes</hi> Patriarchall Primacy, (which was the preparative to its univerſal Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) was not a meer humane invention, given on occaſion of the Imperiall ſeat at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not any inſtitution of Chriſt to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his Succeſſors, I deſire you not to take from my word; but all that will not be fool'd out of all Hiſtoricall verity by Popiſh audacity, let them take it from the expreſs words of the fourth great approved General Council, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> which the poor Jacobites and other Churches of the Eaſt and South are ſo reproached for rejecting.

Nor do I ſtand ſo much on it, that they gave <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> equal priviledges. But it may confound all the Papal Juglers on earth to find an approved General Council affirming, 1. That <hi>Romes</hi> Priviledges (even its meer primacy) were given by the Fathers. 2. And that becauſe it was the Imperial City. 3. And therefore on the ſame reaſon they do the like by <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> 4. And that the General Council of <hi>Conſtant.</hi> had gone before them on theſe grounds: ſo that you have the vote of two of the firſt four great General Councils, that it was not ſo from the beginning, nor an Apoſtolical Tradition, but the act of the Fathers, becauſe of the Imperial City. If a General Council can err, Popery is a deceit. If it cannot err, then the very Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of order in the Pope was then but new, and humane, on a Carnal ground, done by man, that might do the like by others, and therefore undo this again.</p>

                     <p>What would you have more Sirs? Do you not ſee yet what the Popiſh Catholick Church is; and what they mean when they mouth it out to you, and ask you whether your private Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſafer or wiſer then that of the whole Church, or of all the Chriſtian world? You ſee they mean all this while but one man, whom <hi>Gretſer</hi> and others plainly confeſs they call the Church. So that indeed it is General Councils, and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world or Church that are the ignorant, fallible, and oft er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55445:68"/>
part; and it is one man, (that ſometime is reputed an incarnate Devil by a General Council too) that is the unerring Pillar of the Church, and wiſer then all they. Do you not ſee that they make a meer nothing or mockery of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, any further then they pleaſe the Pope? And can you expect that any thing ſhould pleaſe them that is againſt his Greatneſs, or, as <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond calls it, <hi>[his holding the place of the great God, the Maker of all things, and all Laws?]</hi> What a vile abuſe is it then of the Pope to trouble the world by the meetings and Conſultations of General Councils, when he can ſit at <hi>Rome</hi> and contradict them infallibly, and, Good man, is fain to ſave the Catholick Church from the Errors that General Councils (the Repreſentative Catholick Church) would elſe lead them into: and therefore could he not with leſs ado infallibly make us Laws, Canons, and Scriptures without them? For ſure that which the Pope can do <hi>againſt</hi> a General Council, he can do <hi>without</hi> them. If he can Infallibly contradict a General Council, and Infallibly Rule us <hi>contrary</hi> to their Judgement, he may no doubt Infallibly Rule us without them. And therefore of late times they have learnt ſo much wit, that you may look long enough before you ſee a General Council. And I think the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> were no better Prognoſticators then <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Lilly,</hi> nor no more effectuall Lawgivers then <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> when they Prognoſticated or Ordained Decennial Councils: And I will be judged by all the world.</p>
                     <p>And here alſo you may ſee what account the Papiſts make even of the firſt General Councils. Its all one with them to judge others Hereticks for contradicting eſpecially the four firſt General Councils (compared to the four Evangeliſts) as the Scripture it ſelf: and yet (who would have thought it) they profeſs themſelves to reject the Canons or Decrees of both theſe, the firſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> in part.</p>
                     <p>And, now I think on it, by this priviledge I cannot ſee but the Pope is priviledged from all poſſibility of being an Heretick perſonally. But theſe things are on the by, I return to the point in hand, which is to prove to you, that not only the Romiſh Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Monarchy and Vice-godhead, but even its Patriarchal Primacy was no Apoſtolical Tradition, but an Humane Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, founded on this Conſideration, that <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial Seat and City.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:55445:68"/>
5. And Humane it muſt needs be. 1. For we find that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils did not declare it as any part of the Law of God, but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain it as an act of their own. 2. We find them adding the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was a new ſeat, neither Patriarch nor Biſhop reſiding there in the Apoſtles dayes, or long after. 3. Yea we find them giving this new Patriarch the ſecond place, and once making him equal with old <hi>Rome,</hi> which they would never have preſumed to do, if they had thought that the Patriarchſhip of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> had been of Divine Inſtitution: for what horrible arrogancy would that have been, when the Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtles had made <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſecond, and <hi>Antioch</hi> third, and <hi>Rome</hi> firſt, for a Council to ſet <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> before two of them, and equal with the firſt?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And therefore we have reaſon to think that if Patriarchs be deſirable creatures, there may more and more new ones now be made, as lawfully as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And we do not think that a General Council or Pope can make a man of one Nation to be Patriarch of the Church in another Nation, that perhaps may be in wars with the Prince of the firſt Nation: but that each Prince with the Church under their Power, hath more to do in it then either Pope or Council. And if <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſet up Patriarchs at home, they do as lawfully as the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ſet up.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And therefore we muſt needs judge, that to diſobey the Pope, or withdraw from his ſubjection (if he had never forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Patriarchſhip by the claim of an Univerſal Headſhip) were no greater a ſin, then to diſobey or withdraw from the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> either the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Patriarchs and Arch-biſhops is of Gods ordaining and approving, or not: if not (as moſt of the Proteſtants hold) then it is no ſin to reject any of them. If it be of God, then to reject any of them (though in ſimple error) is a ſin of diſobedience through ignorance, but is far from proving a man to be no member of the Catholick Church: for ſure Patriarchs are far from being Eſſential parts of the Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>For, 9. We conclude, as in the Papiſts own Judgement, the Catholick Church may be without the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Antioch;</hi> ſo may it therefore without the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 11. THE great endeavour of the Papiſts is to <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Tradition:</hi> The Council of <hi>Trent Seſ.</hi> 4. hath equalled it with the Scriptures, as to the <hi>pious affection and reverence</hi> wherewith they receive it. On pretence of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they have added abundance of new Articles to the faith, and accuſe us as Hereticks for not receiving their Traditions: And this is a principall difference betwixt us, that we take the Scriptures to be ſufficient, to acquaint us with the will of God, as the Rule of faith and holy living: and they take it to be but part of the word of God, and that the other part is in unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Tradition, which they equal with this (as afore.) For the maintaining of Tradition it is that they write ſo much to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the holy Scripture, as you may find in <hi>Ruſhworths</hi> Dialogues, and <hi>Tho. Whites</hi> Defence of them, and many others; ſo like to the Arguments and Language of the Seekers and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, that we can ſcarcely know whom we hear when they ſpeak to us.</p>
                     <p>For the diſcovery of their deſperate fraud in this point, and the right confuting of them: 1. You muſt diſtinguiſh them out of their confuſion: 2. You muſt grant them all that is true and juſt, which we ſhall as ſtiffly defend as they: 3. You muſt reject their errors and confute them: And 4. You may turn their own principall weapon againſt them, to the certain deſtruction of their cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Of all theſe briefly in courſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the firſt two I have ſpoke at large in the Preface to the ſecond part of the <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> and in the determination in the firſt part of my Book againſt Infidelity. But briefly to touch ſome of the moſt neceſſary things here, 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures, or the Scripture doctrine, from the Tradition of other doctrines, pretended to be the reſt of the word of God. 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh between a certain proved Tradition, and that which is unproved and uncertain, if not groſly feigned. 3. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the Tradition of the whole Catholick Church, or the greater part, and the Tradition of the leſſer more corrupted ſelfiſh part (even the Roman part.) 4. We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55445:69"/>
between a Tradition of neceſſary doctrine or practice, and the Tradition of mutable Orders. 5. And we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Tradition by way of Teſtimony, or Hiſtory, or by way of Teaching Miniſtry, and Tradition by way of Deciſive Judgement, as to the Univerſal Church: ſuffer them not to jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all theſe together, if you would not be cheated in the dark.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then concerning Tradition, we grant all theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propoſitions, (ſo that it is not all Tradition that we deny.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We grant that the Holy Scriptures come down to us by the certain Tradition of our fathers and Teachers; and that what the ſeeing and hearing of the Apoſtles was to them that lived with them, that Tradition and belief of certain Tradition is to us, by reaſon of our diſtance from the time and place: So that though the Scripture bear its own evidence of a Divine author, in the Image and ſuperſcription of God upon it, yet we are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Tradition for the Books themſelves, and for much of our knowledge that theſe are the true writings of the Apoſtles and Prophets, and <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>not depraved, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We thankfully acknowledge that the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of the faith, (and more) hath been delivered even from the Apoſtles in other wayes or forms, beſides the Scriptures: as 1. In the <hi>Profeſſions</hi> of the Churches faith. 2. In the <hi>baptiſmal Covenant</hi> and <hi>ſigns,</hi> and <hi>whole adminiſtration.</hi> 3. In the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi> 4. In <hi>Catechiſms or Catechizings.</hi> 5. In the <hi>prayers and praiſes of the Church.</hi> 6. In the <hi>hearts of all true believers,</hi> where God hath written all the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſaith and Law: So that we will not do as the Papiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly do: when God delivereth us the Chriſtian Religion with <hi>two hands, Scripture</hi> (compleatly) and <hi>Verbal Tradition,</hi> (in the eſſentials) they quarrell with the one hand (Scripture) on pretence of defending the other: ſo will not we quarrell with <hi>Tradition</hi> (the other hand:) but thankfully confeſs a <hi>Tradition</hi> of the ſame Chriſtianity by unwritten means, which is delivered more fully in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and this Tradition is in ſome reſpect <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to Scripture, and in ſome reſpect co-ordinate, as the ſpirits left hand as it were, to hold us out the truth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We confeſs that the Apoſtles delivered the Goſpel by voice
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55445:70"/>
as well as by writing, and that before they wrote it to the Churches.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By this preaching we confeſs there were Chriſtians made, that had the doctrine of Chriſt in their hearts, and Churches ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that had his ordinances among them, before the Goſpel was written.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And we confeſs that the Converted were bound to teach what they had received to their children, ſervants and others.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And that there was a ſetled Miniſtry in many Churches ordained to preach the Goſpel as they had received it from the Apoſtles before it was written.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And that the ſaid ordinances of Baptiſm, Catechizing, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Euchariſt, Prayer, Praiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were inſtituted, and in uſe before the Goſpell was written for the Churches.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And that when the Goſpel was written, as Tradition bringeth it to us, ſo Miniſters are commiſſioned to deliver both the Books, and the doctrine of this Book, as the Teachers of the Church, and to preach it to thoſe without, for their converſion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And that Parents and Maſters are bound to teach this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to their children and ſervants: yea if a Miniſter or other perſon were caſt into the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>America</hi> without a Bible, he muſt teach the doctrine, though he remembred not the words.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. We grant that to the great benefit of the Church, the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all ages have in ſubſerviency to Scripture delivered down the Sacred Verities, and Hiſtorians the matters of fact.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And that the unanimous Conſent of all the Churches, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in their conſtant profeſſions, and practices, is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to us.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And ſo is the ſuffering of the Martyrs for the ſame truth.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. And the Declarations of ſuch conſent by Councils is alſo a confirming Tradition.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And the Confeſſions of Hereticks, Jews and other Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, are Providentiall and Hiſtorical Traditions, for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. And we profeſs that if we had any Certain proof of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the Apoſtles of any thing more then is written in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55445:70"/>
Scripture, we would receive it: All this we grant them for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But in theſe points following we oppoſe them. 1. We take the holy Scriptures as the Compleat univerſal Rule or Law of faith and Holy living, and we know of no Tradition that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth another word of God; Nay we know there is none ſuch becauſe the Scripture is true, which aſſerteth its own ſufficiency. <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>unwritten Tradition</hi> are but two wayes of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the world with the <hi>ſame</hi> Chriſtian doctrine; and not with divers parts of that Doctrine, ſo as that Tradition ſhould add to Scripture: yea contrarily it is but the ſubſtance of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt verities that are conveyed by unwritten Tradition: but that and much more is contained in the Scripture, where the Chriſtian doctrine is compleat.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The manner of delivery in a form of words, which no man may alter, and in ſo much fullneſs and perſpicuity, is much to be preferred before the meer verbal delivery of the <hi>ſame doctrine.</hi> For 1. The Memory of man is not ſo ſtrong as to retain as much as the Bible doth contain, and preſerve it ſafe from alterations or Corruptions; Or if one man were of ſo ſtrong a memory, no man can imagine that all or moſt ſhould be ſo: Or if one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had ſuch wonderfull memories, we cannot imagine that all their poſterity ſhould have the like. If there were no ſtatute Books, Records, or Law-books in <hi>England,</hi> our Laws would be but ſorrily kept, and obeyed and executed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If all the world had ſuch miraculous memories, yet men are apt to be negligent either in learning or keeeping of holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; All have not that zeal that ſhould excite them to ſuch wonderfull diligence without which ſuch a treaſure could not be preſerved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When matter and ſo much matter, is commited to bare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory without a form of unalterable words, new words may make an alteration before men are aware: The change of one word ſometimes doth make a whole diſcourſe ſeem to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There are ſo many carnal men in the world that love not the ſtrictneſs of that doctrine which they do profeſs, and ſo many hereticks that would pervert the Holy Doctrine, that it would purpoſely be altered by them if it could be done; and it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55445:71"/>
might much more eaſily be done, if it lay all upon mens memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For one party would ſet their memory againſt the others, and (as it was about <hi>Eaſter</hi> a publick matter of fect) tradition would be ſet againſt tradition: eſpecially when the far greater part of the Church turn Hereticks, as in the Arrians dayes, then Tradition would be moſt at their keeping and interpretation; and if we had not then had the unalterable Scriptures, what might they not have done?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A whole Body of Doctrine kept only in Memory, will be ſoon diſjoynted and diſlocate; and if the matter were kept ſafe, yet the <hi>method and manner</hi> would be loſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And there could not be ſuch ſatisfactory Evidence given to another of the Integrity or Certainty of it, as when it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in writing. We ſhould all be diffident that the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were corrupted, or that Lawyers might combine to do it at their pleaſure, if there were no Law Books or Records, but all lay in their memories. If they were never ſo faithfull, yet they could not give us ſuch evidence of it.</p>
                     <p>I do not think any man of common reaſon can heartily believe, that all the holy Truths of God, Hiſtorical, Doctrinal, Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Prophetical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could (without a courſe of miracles, or extraordinary means) have been kept through all ages, as well without writing, as with it.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And if writing be not neceſſary, why have we ſo many Fathers, Hiſtories, and Canons? And why do they fetch their Tradition from theſe, and ridiculouſly call them unwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities? Are they unwritten, when they turn us to ſo many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes for them? And if mans writing be neceſſary for their preſervation, me thinks men ſhould thankfully acknowledge that God hath taken the beſt way in giving it us in his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable phraſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If they do prove that ſome matters of fact are made known to us by Tradition that are not in the Scripture, or that any Church Orders or Circumſtances of worſhip then uſed are ſo made known to us, (which yet we wait for the proof of) it will not follow that any of theſe are therefore Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or univerſal Lawes for the unchangable obligation of the whole Church. If there be ſome things Hiſtorically related in the Scripture, that were obligatory but for a ſeaſon, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55445:71"/>
occaſionally, and ceaſed when the occaſion ceaſed (as the Love-feaſts, the Kiſs of Love, the waſhing of feet, the abſtaining from things ſtrangled and blood, the anointing the ſick, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyings one by one, mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. miraculous gifts and their exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> then it will not follow, if they could prove that the Apoſtles faſted in the Lent, or uſed the ſign of the Croſs in Baptiſme or holy Ordinances, or confirmed with a Croſs in Chryſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that therefore they intended theſe as univerſal Laws to the Church, though I ſuppoſe they will never prove that they uſed the things themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We will never take the Popes Deciſion or bare word for a Proof of Tradition: nor will we receive it from pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but from rational Evidence. It is not their ſaying, <hi>we are the authorized keepers of Tradition,</hi> that ſhall go with us for proof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And therefore it is not the Teſtimony of the Papiſts alone, (who are not only a leſſer part of the Church, but a part that hath eſpouſed a corrupt intereſt againſt the reſt) that we ſhall take for certain proof of a Tradition: but we will prefer the Teſtimonie of the whole Catholick Church before the Romiſh Church alone.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They that can produce the beſt Records of Antiquity, or rational proof of the Antiquity of the thing they plead for, though they be but a few Learned Antiquaries, may yet be of more regard in the matter of Tradition then millions of the vulgar, or unlearned men: ſo that with us, <hi>univerſal Tradition</hi> is preferred before the Tradition of the <hi>Romiſh ſect,</hi> and <hi>Rational proof</hi> of Antiquity is preferred before <hi>ignorant ſurmiſes.</hi> But where both theſe concur, both <hi>univerſal conſent, and records</hi> or other credible evidence of Antiquity, it is moſt valid.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Romiſh Traditions which they take for the other part of Gods word: 1. In all Reaſon they muſt produce their ſufficient proof that they came from the Apoſtles, before we can receive them as Apoſtolick Traditions. And when they have done that, they muſt prove that it was delivered by the Apoſtles as a perpetual univerſal doctrine or Law for the whole Church: and when they have well proved both theſe, we ſhall hearken further to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Either theſe Traditions have Evidence to prove them Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55445:72"/>
or no Evidence. If none, how can the Pope know them? If they have Evidence, why may not we know it as well as the Pope? at leaſt, by the helps that his charity doth vouchſafe the world.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If there be any Proof of theſe Traditions, it is either ſome Antient Records or Monuments; and then our Learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries may better know them then a multitude of the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Or it is the Practice of the Church: And then 1. How ſhall we know how long that practice hath continued, without recourſe to the writings of the ancients? The reports of the people is in many caſes very uncertain. 2. But if it may be known without the ſearch of Antient Records, then we may know it as well as they.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If the Pope and Clergy have been the keepers of it, have they in all ages kept it to themſelves or declared it to the Church? (I mean to all in common) If they have concealed it, 1. Then it ſeems it belonged not to others. 2. Or elſe they were unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unfit for the office. 3. And then how do ſucceeding Popes and Clergy know it? If they divulged it, then others know it as well as they. We have had abundance of Preachers from among the Papiſts, that were once Papiſts themſelves, as <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza, Peter Martyr, Bucer,</hi> &amp;c. and yet theſe knew not of your truly Apoſtolical Traditions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And it mars your credit with us, becauſe we are able to prove the beginning of ſome of your traditions, or a time when they had no being, ſince the death of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And alſo that we are able to prove the death and burial of many things that have gone long under the name of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And when we find ſo lame an account from your ſelves of the true Apoſtolical Traditions: You are ſo confounded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Eccleſiaſticall Decrees and Traditions, and your Apoſtolical Traditions, that we deſpair of learning from you to know one from the other: and of ſeeing under the hand of his Holineſs and a General Council a Catalogue of the true Apoſtolical Traditions. And ſure it ſeems to us ſcarce fair dealing that in one thouſand and five hundered years time, (if indeed there have been Popes ſo long) the Church could never have an enumeration and deſcription of theſe Traditions, with
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55445:72"/>
the proofs of them. Had you told us which are Apoſtolick Traditions but as fully and plainly, as the Scriptures which you accuſe of inſufficiency and obſcurity, do deliver us their part, you had diſcharged your pretended truſt.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And it is in our eyes an abominable impiety, for you to equal your Traditions with the holy Scripture, till you have enumerated and proved them. And it makes us the more to ſuſpect your Traditions, when we perceive that they or their Patrons have ſuch an enmity to the Holy Scriptures, that they cannot be rightly defended without caſting ſome reproach upon the Scriptures. But this we do not much wonder at: for it is no new thing with the applauders of Tradition. We find the eighth General Council at <hi>Conſtantinople, Can.</hi> 3. decreeing, that <hi>[the Image of Chriſt be adored with equal Honour with the Holy Scripture,]</hi> But whether that be an Apoſtolical Tradition, we doubt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And if General Councils themſelves, and that of your own, ſhould be for the ſufficiency of Scripture; what then is become of all your Traditions? Search your own <hi>Binnius, page</hi> 299. whether it paſt not as ſound doctrine at the Council of <hi>Baſil (in Raguſii Orat.) Sup.</hi> 6. <hi>[that faith and all things neceſſary to ſalvation, both matters of belief, and matters of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, are founded in the literal ſenſe</hi> (of Scripture,) <hi>and only from that may argumentation be taken for the proving of thoſe things that are matters of faith, or neceſſary to ſalvation; and not from thoſe paſſages that are ſpoken by allegory, or other ſpiritual ſence]</hi> Sup. 7. <hi>[The Holy Scripture in the literal ſenſe ſoundly and well underſtood, is the infallible and moſt ſufficient Rule of faith]</hi> Is not here enough againſt all other Traditional Articles of faith? A plain man would think ſo. Yea, but <hi>Binnius</hi> noteth that he meaneth that explicitely or implicitely it is ſo. Well! I confeſs the beſt of you are ſlippery enough: but let us grant this; (for indeed he ſo explaineth himſelf afterward: yet thats no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Tradition. He there maintaineth that Scripture is the <hi>Rule of faith</hi> (not part of the Rule) <hi>[For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when the intellect hapneth to err, as in hereticks, its neceſſary that there be ſome Rule, by the deviation or conformity to which the intellect may perceive that it doth or doth not err. Elſe it would be ſtill in doubt and fluctuate—it appeareth that no humane ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55445:73"/>
is the Rule of faith. It remaineth therefore that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this Rule of faith. This is the Rule,</hi> John 20. <hi>where be ſaith, theſe things are written that you might believe, that Jeſus is the ſon of God, and believing might have life in his name. And</hi> 2 Pet. 2. <hi>You have a more ſure word of prophecy to which ye do well that ye attend as to a light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And</hi> Rom. 15. <hi>Whatſoever things were written, were written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—And its plain that the foreſaid authorities are of holy Scripture; and ſpeak of the holy Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The ſecond part alſo is plain, becauſe if the holy Scripture were not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule of faith, it would follow that the Holy Ghoſt had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiently delivered it, who is the author of it: which is by no means to be thought of God whoſe works are all perfect. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if the Holy Scripture were wanting in any things that are neceſſary to ſalvation, then thoſe things that are wanting might lawfully and deſervedly be ſuperadded from ſome thing elſe</hi> (ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde) <hi>or if any thing were ſuperfluous, be diminiſhed. But this is forbidden,</hi> Rev. 22. <hi>From whence its plain that in Scripture there is nothing defective, and nothing ſuperfluous, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its author, the Holy Ghoſt, to whoſe Omnipotency it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that nothing deminutely; to his Wiſdom that nothing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly; and to his Goodneſs that in a congruous order, he provide for the Neceſſity of our ſalvation,</hi> Prov. 30. 5, 6. <hi>The word of God is a fiery buckler to them that hope in him: Add thou not to his words leſt be reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar.]</hi> How like you all this in a Popiſh General Council? and in an Oration againſt the Sacrament in both kinds.</p>
                     <p>Well! but perhaps the diſtinction unſaith all again? No ſuch matter; you ſhall hear it truly recited. He proceeds thus <hi>[But for the further declaration of this Rule as to that part, it muſt be known, that the ſufficiency of any doctrine is neceſſarily to be underſtood two wayes; one way Explicitely, another way Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely. And this is true in every Doctrine or ſcience, becauſe no doctrine was ever ſo ſufficiently delivered, that all the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contained in its principles, were delivered and expreſſed expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely and in the proper terms: and ſo it is in our purpoſe: becauſe there is nothing that any way or in any manner</hi> (N.B.) <hi>pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to faith and ſalvation, which is not moſt ſufficiently contained in the holy Scripture explicitely or implicitely. Hence ſaith</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55445:73"/>
Auſtin <hi>[every truth is contained in the Scriptures,</hi> latent <hi>or</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>as in other ſciences Speculative, or Moral and Civil, the Concluſions and determinations are contained in their principles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the deduction is by way of inference or determination—]</hi> This is the plain Proteſtant Doctrine. There is nothing any way neceſſary to faith or ſalvation, but what is contained in the Scriptures, either expreſly, or as the Concluſion in the premiſes. Good ſtill! we deſire no more. Let holy Reaſon then diſcern the Concluſion in the premiſes, and let us not be ſent for it to the Authority of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay ſent for ſome thing elſe, that is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion deducible from any Scripture principles: we grant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or Church practices are very uſeful for our better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome Scriptures. But what is this to another Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional word of God? Prove your Traditions but by <hi>inference</hi> from Scripture, and we will receive them.</p>
                     <p>Yet let us hear this Orator further clearing his mind <hi>[Adding to a Doctrine may be underſtood four wayes.</hi> 1. <hi>By way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or declaration.</hi> 2. <hi>By way of ſupply.</hi> 3. <hi>By way of amplia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 4. <hi>By way of deſtruction, or contrary. The firſt way is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in every ſcience and doctrine, and ſpecially in Holy Scripture; not for it ſelf, which is moſt ſufficient, and moſt cleare in it ſelf, but for us:</hi> (This we all yield) <hi>The ſecond way is neceſſary to ſciences diminutely and inſufficiently delivered by their authors, for their ſupplement: ſo</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>is ſupplemented by</hi> Albertus Magnus, <hi>&amp;c. The third way, ſpecially if it be not exceſſive, is tolerable to the well being, though it be not neceſſary. The fourth way—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertively is to be rejected as Poyſon—Thus are the authorities to be underſtood, that forbid to add to, or diminiſh from the Scripture,</hi> Deut. 12, 32.</p>
                     <p>Well! by this time you may ſee, that when ſuch doctrine as this for Scripture ſufficiency and perfection as the Rule of faith and life, admitting no addition as neceſſary but explication, nor any other as tolerable, but moderate ampliation (which indeed is the ſame,) I ſay, when this doctrine paſt ſo lately in a Popiſh General Council, you may ſee that the very Doctrine of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions equaled with Scripture, or being another word of God, neceſſary to faith and ſalvation, containing what is wanting in Scripture, is but lately ſprung up in the world. And ſure the Traditions themſelves be not old then, when the conceit of them came but lately into the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:55445:74"/>
4. Well: I have done the three firſt parts of this task: but the chief is yet behind, which is to ſhew 1 How little the Papiſts get by their Argument from Tradition. 2. And how <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uch they loſe by it: even all their cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Two things they very much plead Tradition for: the one is their private doctrines and practices, in which they diſagree from other Chriſtians: and here they loſe their labour with the judicious. 1. Becauſe they give us no ſufficient proof that their Tradition is Apoſtolical. 2. Becauſe the diſſent of other Churches ſheweth that it is not univerſal: with other Reaſons before mentioned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other Cauſe which they plead Tradition for, is the Doctrine of Chriſtianity it ſelf. And this they do in deſign to lead men to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as if we muſt be no Chriſtians, unleſs we are Chriſtians upon the credit of the Pope, and his Subjects. And here I offer to their Conſideration theſe two things, to ſhew them the vanity of their arguing.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We do not ſtrive againſt you in producing any Tradition or Teſtimony of Antiquity for the Scripture, or for Scripture Doctrine: we make as much advantage of ſuch juſt Tradition as you. What do ſuch men as <hi>White, Vane, Creſſy,</hi> &amp;c. think of, when they argue ſo eagerly for the advantage of Tradition to prove the Scripture and Chriſtian faith? Is this any thing againſt us? Nothing at all. We accept our Religion from both the hands of Providence that bring it us; Scripture and Tradition: we abhor the contempt which theſe partial Diſputers caſt upon Scripture; but we are not therefore ſo partial our ſelves as to refuſe any collateral or ſubordinate help for our faith. The more Teſtimonies, the better. The beſt of us have need of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for our faith that we can get. When they have extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Certainty of Tradition to the higheſt, we gladly joyn with them, and accept of any certain Tradition of the mind of God. And I adviſe all that would prove themſelves wiſe defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the faith, to take heed of rejecting Arguments from Providences, or any neceſſary Teſtimony of man, eſpecially concerning matter of fact, or of rejecting true Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe the Papiſts over value it under the name of Tradition, left ſuch prove guilty of the like partiality and injuriouſneſs to the truth as the Papiſts are. And whereas the Papiſts imagine,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55445:74"/>
that this muſt lead us to their Church for Tradition, I anſwer that in my next obſervation, which is,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We go beyond the Papiſts in arguing for juſt Tradition of the Chriſtian faith, and we make far greater advantage of it then they can do. For 1. They argue but from Authoritative Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Pope, under the name of Church-Tradition (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the French party) whereas we argue from true Hiſtory and certain Antiquity, and prove what we ſay.</p>
                     <p>Where note 1. That their Tradition is indeed no Tradition: for if it muſt be taken upon the credit of a man as ſuppoſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible by ſupernatural (if not miraculous) endowment, this is not Tradition but Propheſie. And if they prove the man to be ſuch a man, its all one to the Church whether he ſay that <hi>[This was the Apoſtles doctrine,</hi> or, <hi>This I deliver my ſelf to you from God.]</hi> For if he were ſo qualified, he had the power and credit of a prophet or Apoſtle himſelf. And therefore they muſt prove the Pope to be a Prophet, before their kind of Tradition can get credit: and when they have done that, there is no need of it: this their honeſt Dr. <hi>Holden</hi> was ware of, upon which he hath ſo handſomely canvaſſed them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note alſo that ſuch as Dr. <hi>Holden, Creſſy, Vane, White</hi> and other of the French way that plead for Tradition, mean a quite other thing then the Jeſuited Italian Papiſt meanes; and while they plead for univerſal Tradition, they come nearer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, then to their Brethren, if they did not contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they have done, by making meer Romiſh Tradition to be <hi>univerſal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Note alſo, that when Papiſts ſpeak of Tradition confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they give us juſt reaſon to call them to Define their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tell us what they mean by it, before we diſpute with them upon an ambiguous word; ſeeing they are ſo divided among themſelves, that one party underſtands one thing by it, and another another thing; which we muſt not ſuffer theſe jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to jumble together and confound.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another advantage in which we go beyond the Papiſts for Tradition, is, that as we argue not from the meer pretended ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Infallibility or Authority of any, as they do, but from rational Evidence of true Antiquity; ſo we argue not from a <hi>ſect or party</hi> as they do, but from the <hi>Univerſal Church:</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55445:75"/>
As far as the whole Church of Chriſt is of larger extent and greater credit then the Popiſh party, ſo far is our <hi>Tradition</hi> more Credible then theirs. And that is eſpecially in three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Papiſts are fewer by far then the reſt of the Chriſtians in the world. And the teſtimony of many, yea of all, is more then of a part. 2. The Papiſts above other parties have eſpouſed an intereſt that leads them to pretend and corrupt Tradition, and bend all things to that intereſt of their own, that they may Lord it over all the world: But the whole Church can have no ſuch Intereſt and Partiality. 3. And the Papiſts are but one ſide; and he that will judge rightly, muſt hear the other ſides ſpeak too. But the Tradition that we make uſe of, is from all ſides concurring; yea Papiſts themſelves in many points.</p>
                     <p>Yea our Tradition reacheth further then the Univerſal Church: for we take in all rational Evidence: even of Jews, Heathens, and Hereticks, and Perſecutors, that bear witneſs to the matters of fact, and what was the doctrine and practice of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their times, and what Books they made the ground of their faith: ſo that as true Univerſal impartial naturally-or-rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally-infallible Hiſtory or Teſtimony, differeth from a private, pretended-prophetical aſſertion, or from the Teſtimony of one party only; ſo doth our Tradition excell both the ſorts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Tradition, both that of the Papal, and that of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill party. And now judge who may better boaſt of or extol Tradition, they or we; and to what purpoſe, <hi>Creſſy, White,</hi> and ſuch men do bring their diſcourſes of Tradition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But yet we have not ſo done with them, till Tradition have given them their mortal ſtroak. You appeal to Tradition, to Tradition you ſhall go. But what Tradition mean you? The Tradition of the Catholick Church? And where is this to be found and known? but in the profeſſion and practice of the Church, and in the Records of the Church. Well then! of both theſe let us enquire.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and great Queſtion between you and us, is, <hi>Whether the Pope be the Head and Soveraign Ruler of the whole Catholick. Church: and then whether the Catholick Church and the Roman are of equal extent?</hi> What ſaith <hi>Tradition</hi> to this?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let us enquire of the <hi>preſent</hi> Church: and there we have the profeſſion and practice of all the Greek Church; the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55445:75"/>
the Moſcovites, the Georgians, and all others of the Greek Religion diſperſed throughout the Turks Dominions, with the Jacobites, Armenians, Egyptians, Abaſſines, with all other Churches in <hi>Europe, &amp;c.</hi> that diſclaim the Headſhip of the Roman Pope; all theſe do with one mouth proclaim that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not, and ought not to be the Miſtriſs of the world, or of all other Churches, but that the Pope for laying ſuch a claim is an uſurper, if not the AntiChriſt. This is the Tradition of the Greeks; this is the Tradition of the Abaſsines: the far greateſt part of the Church on earth agree in this. Mark then what is become of the Roman Soveraignty, by the verdict of Tradition; even from the vote of the greateſt part of the Church. <hi>Rome</hi> hath no right to its pretended Soveraignty. <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is faln by the judgement of Tradition.</p>
                     <p>If you have the faces again to ſay that all theſe are Hereticks or Schiſmaticks, and therefore have no vote, we anſwer. If a minor party, and that ſo partial and corrupt, ſeeking Dominion over the reſt, may ſtep into the Tribunal, and paſs ſentence againſt the Catholick Church, or the greateſt part of it, blame not others, if on far better grounds they do ſo by that part. And for ſhame do not any more hereafter uſe any ſuch ſelf-condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, as to ask any Sect, <hi>[How dare you condemn the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? Do you think all the Church is forſaken but you,</hi> &amp;c?] And let us ask you, as you teach your followers to ask us, <hi>[If we muſt turn from the Univerſal Church to any Sect, why rather to yours then another? why not as well to the Anabaptiſts, or other party, as to the Papiſts?]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But your common ſaying is, that the <hi>Greeks, Proteſtants, and all the reſt were once of your Church, and departing from it, they can have no Tradition but yours, for their ſpring is with you.</hi> To which we anſwer. 1. The vanity of this your fiction ſhall by and by be anſwered by it ſelf. 2. You ſay ſo, and they ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: why ſhould we believe you that are a ſmaller, partial and corrupted part? 3. Well then let us go to former ages, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not the preſent Church whoſe voice you will regard (only by the way, I pray forget not, 1. That you do ill then to call us ſtill to the Judgement of the <hi>preſent Church,</hi> and dare not ſtand to it. 2. And that you do ill to perſwade men that the greater part of the Church cannot err, if you ſentence the

But how ſhall we know the way and mind of the ages <hi>paſt?</hi> If by the <hi>preſent age,</hi> then the greater part giveth us in their ſence againſt you. If by the Records of thoſe times, we are content to hear the Teſtimony of theſe. And firſt when we look into the Antients themſelves, we find them generally againſt you; and we find in that which is antiquity indeed, no footſteps of your uſurped Soveraignty, but a contrary frame of Government, and a conſent of antiquity againſt it. 2. When we look into later Hiſtory we find, how by the advantage of <hi>Romes</hi> temporal greatneſs and the Emperors reſidence there your greatneſs begun, and preparation was made to your uſurpation, and how the tranſlation of the Imperial Seat to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> made them your Competitors, yea to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the claim of an univerſal Headſhip; and we find how it being once made a queſtion, you got it by a murdering Emperor reſolved on your ſide for his own advantage. We find that it was long, even till <hi>Hildebrands</hi> dayes, before you could get any great poſſeſſion, for all this ſentence. It would but be tedious here to recite our Hiſtorical Evidence: we refer you to what is done already by <hi>Goldaſtus and Biſhop</hi> Uſher <hi>de ſtatu &amp; ſucceſs.

More then you can give a reaſonable anſwer to, I have produced in my Book called the <hi>ſafe Religion.</hi> In plain Engliſh, inſtead of <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition for your Soveraignty;</hi> we find that eight hundred years after the dayes of Chriſt, you had not neer ſo much of the Catholick Church in your ſubjection, as you have now: that at four hundred, or five hundred, if not till ſix hundred years after Chriſt you had no known part of the world that acknowledged your univerſal Soveraignty; but only the Latine Weſtern Church ſubmitted to the Pope as their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and the <hi>Patriarch primae ſedis,</hi> the firſt in order among the Patriarchs: and that before the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the Nicene Council, he was but a Biſhop of the richeſt and moſt numerous Church of Chriſtians: and we ſee no proof that of an hundred years after Chriſt he was any more then the chief Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter of a particular Church.</p>

If all this will not ſerve, we have <hi>National Evidences</hi> beyond all exception, that the Ethiopian Churches of <hi>Habaſſia,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Perſians,</hi> &amp;c. were never your ſubjects to this day.

For, if a free General Council ſhould be called, all the Churches in the world muſt be equally there repreſented: And if they were ſo, then down went the uſurped Head-ſhip of the Pope: For we are ſure already that moſt of the Churches in the world are againſt it: and therefore in Council they would have the Major vote. And thus by the conceſſion of the Roman Repreſentative Catholick Church the Pope is gone by Tradition. So that by that time they have well conſidered of the matter, me thinks they ſhould be leſs zealous for Tradition.</p>

ANother of the Roman frauds is this: <hi>They perſwade men that the Greeks, the Proteſtants, and all other Churches, were once under their Papal ſoveraignty, and have ſeparated themſelves without any juſt cauſe: and therefore we are all ſchiſmaticks; and thereforefore have no vote in general Councils,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
                     <p>A few words may ſerve to ſhew the vanity of this accuſation. 1. Abundance of the Churches were ſo ſtrange to you, that they had not any notable communion with you. 2. The Greek Churches withdrew from your Communion, but not from your ſubjection. If any of the Patriarcks or Emperours of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did for carnal ends at laſt ſubmit to you, it was not till lately, nor was it the act of the Churches, nor owned, nor of long continuance. So that it was your Communion and not your ſubjection that they withdrew from.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as for us of the Weſtern parts, we anſwer you, 1. We that are now living, our Fathers, or our Grand-fathers, were not of your Church: and therefore we never did withdraw.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:55445:77"/>
2. There were Churches in <hi>England</hi> before the Roman Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was here owned: And therefore if it was a ſin to <hi>change,</hi> the <hi>firſt change</hi> was the ſin, when they ſubjected themſelves to you; and not the later, in which they returned to their ancient ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And for the Germanes or Engliſh or whoever did relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh you, they have as good reaſon for it, as for the relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any other ſin.

ANother deceit that they manage with great confidence, is this; ſay they, <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be the true Church: then yours is not the true Church, and then you are Shiſmaticks in ſeparating from it: But the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Church; For you will confeſs it was once a true Church: when</hi> Paul <hi>wrote the Epiſtle to the Romans: and if it ceaſed to be a true Church, tell us when it ceaſed, if you can: If it ceaſed to be a true Church, it was either by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, or Schiſm or Apoſtacy: but by none of theſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>A man would think that children and women ſhould ſee the palpable fallacy of this Argument; and yet I hear of few that the learned Papiſts make more uſe of. But to lay open the ſhame of it in brief I anſwer 1. The deceit lieth in the ambiguity of the word <hi>[Church.]</hi> As to our preſent purpoſe, obſerve that it hath theſe ſeveral ſignifications. 1. It is taken oft in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for <hi>one particular Church, aſſociated for perſonal commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Gods Worſhip.</hi> And thus there were many Churches in a Countrey, as <hi>Judea, Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is taken by Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers often for an <hi>Aſſociation of many of theſe Churches for Communion by their Paſtors;</hi> ſuch as were Dioceſan, Provincial,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55445:78"/>
National Churches; whereof moſt were then ruled by Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, where a Biſhop, Archbiſhop, Metropolitan or Patriarck (as they called them) did preſide. 3. It is taken oft in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for <hi>the Body of Chriſt, the holy Catholick or Univerſal Church containing all true Believers as myſtical, or all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of true faith as viſible.</hi> 4. It is taken by the Papiſts oft for <hi>one particular Church which is the Miſtris or Ruler of all other Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now I come to apply theſe in anſwer to the argument. 1. If the Queſtion be of a <hi>true particular Church,</hi> we grant you that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true and noble Church, in the daies of <hi>Paul</hi> and long after; and thus <hi>Paul</hi> owneth it in his Epiſtle as a true Church. And to the queſtion when it ceaſed to be a true Church: I anſwer, 1. What matter is it to us whether it be reaſoned or not any more then whether <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Coloſs, Theſſalonica,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be true Churches or ceaſed? In charity we regard them all: but otherwiſe what is it to the faith or ſalvation of the world, whether <hi>Rome</hi> or any one of theſe be yet a true Church, or be ceaſed? I know not well whether there be any Church at <hi>Coloſs</hi> or <hi>Philippi,</hi> or ſome other places that had then true Churches: And doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that I am not a true believer? what would you ſay to ſuch a fellow that ſhould argue thus concerning other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as theſe men do of <hi>Rome?</hi> and ſay, e. g. <hi>[If</hi> Philippi, <hi>be a true Church, then</hi> England <hi>are no true Churches, If it be not, when did it ceaſe to be a true Church?]</hi> Would you not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, <hi>[What is it to me whether</hi> Philippi <hi>be a true Church or not? May not we and they be both true Churches? How prove you that? And whether it be ceaſed or not ceaſed, doth no what concern my faith or ſalvation, further then as my charity is to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards them]</hi> So ſay we of <hi>Rome:</hi> It was a true parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church in the Apoſtles dayes. And if it be ſtill a true Church what hinders but we may be ſo to? But whether it be ſo or not, is little to me. It concerneth not my faith or Salvation to know whether there be any ſuch place as <hi>Rome</hi> on earth, or whether it were conſumed long ago. If a man were ſo ſimple as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a report that <hi>Rome</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and never inhabited, or had a Pope ſince, he were but ſuch a Heretick as Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Boniface</hi> made of <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55445:78"/>
for holding there be Antipodes (though further from the South.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And if you take the word <hi>[Church]</hi> in the ſecond ſence, for a Dioceſan or Patriarchiall Church, or Aſſociation of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; ſuppoſing ſuch forms proved warrantable, the ſame anſwer ſerveeth as to the firſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But (to come to the true ſtate of our Controverſie) If by <hi>[a true Church]</hi> you mean either of the two laſt, that is, 1. The <hi>whole Univerſal Church:</hi> or 2. <hi>A Miſtris Church that muſt Rule all the reſt,</hi> it was never ſuch a true Church in <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore here we turn this argument of the Papiſts againſt themſelves. <hi>If the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>were neither the whole Catholick Church, nor the Miſtris of all other Churches when</hi> Paul <hi>wrote his Epiſtle to them, then it is not ſo now, nor ought to be ſo accounted. But the former is proved:</hi> 1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not the <hi>whole Catholick Church</hi> then, no man thats well in his wits can doubt, that reads what a Church there was at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> what a Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia, Smyrna, Thyatira, Laodicea, Corinth,</hi> and abundance more. Prove that all or any of theſe were parts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> if you can. 2. Where doth <hi>Paul</hi> once name them either the <hi>Catholick Church, or the Miſtris or Ruler of all Churches?</hi> or give the leaſt hint of any ſuch thing? or mention any Pope among them whom the whole world was to take to be their Soveraign Head? Is it not an incredible thing that <hi>Paul</hi> (and all the Apoſtles) would forget to make any mention of this priviledge, or teach them how to uſe it, or teach other Churches their duty in obeying the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if indeed they had been made the Miſtris Church? Men that can believe what they liſt, may ſay what they liſt. But for my part I will never think ſo hardly of <hi>Paul</hi> and all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as to accuſe them of ſo great oblivion or negligence. And therefore I conclude, <hi>Rome</hi> was neither the Univerſal Church, nor the Miſtris Church then (not many an age after) and therefore it is not ſo to be accounted now. So that you ſee how eaſily this ſilly Argument ſhews its ſhame.</p>
                     <p>But (though it concern not our main queſtion) I ſhall tell them further, that the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Roman Church muſt be diſtinguiſhed from its <hi>New Political Form.</hi> For the <hi>Matter,</hi>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55445:79"/>
ſo many of its members as are <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> are <hi>part of the Catholick Church</hi> of Chriſt, though not the <hi>whole:</hi> And for the <hi>form,</hi> 1. There is the <hi>form of its ſeverall parts,</hi> and the <hi>form of the whole.</hi> The form of any parts of the Roman Church that are <hi>Congregations or particular Churches of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> may make thoſe parts true Churches: that is, there may be many a true Pariſh Church that yet live under the Papall Yoak. But as to the <hi>Politicall form of their Roman Catholick Church, as it is a Body Headed by one claiming an Univerſall Monarchy,</hi> ſo the form is falſe and Antichriſtian, and therefore the Church as <hi>Papall,</hi> muſt be denominated from <hi>this form;</hi> and can be no better.</p>
                     <p>And this is our true anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>whether the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>be a true Church?</hi> There are I doubt not among them many a thouſand <hi>true members of the Catholick Church,</hi> and there may be <hi>true particular Churches</hi> among them, having true Paſtors and Chriſtian people joyned for Gods worſhip (though I doubt there is but few of them but do fearfully pollute it: and I am confident that ſalvation is much more rare and difficult with them, then it is with the Reformed Catholicks; yet that many among them are true Chriſtians and ſaved, I am fully perſwaded, eſpecially when I have read ſuch writings as <hi>Gerſons, Guil. Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſienſis, Ferus, Kempis,</hi> &amp;c.) And I think the better of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> himſelf for ſaying of <hi>Kempis de imitatione Chriſti [Ego certe ab adoleſcentia &amp; uſ<expan>
                              <am>

                     <p>But the <hi>Pope as a pretended Univerſal Monarch is a falſe Head,</hi> and conſequently <hi>their Papall Church, as ſuch, is a falſe Antichriſtian Church,</hi> and no true Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And (by the way) I conceive you are thus to underſtand a clauſe in a late oath of Abjuration drawn up by the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be offered to the Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>[the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not the true Church]</hi> that is, 1. <hi>Not the whole Catholick Church,</hi> but part of it, as they are Chriſtians. 2. Nor <hi>a true Church at all as Papal,</hi> and ſo formally as the <hi>Now Romiſh Church.</hi> But all this is little to our main Queſtion.</p>

ANother great Endeavour of the Papiſts is, <hi>to edneſs, unity, conſiſtency and ſetledneſs in Religion: but we are ſtill at uncertainty and to ſeek, incoherent, not tyed together by any certain bond, but ſtill upon diviſions, and upon change:</hi> And they inſtance thus <hi>[A while ago you were Epiſcopal, and then Presbyterian, and now you are nothing, but every one goes his own way: A while ago you worſhipped God in one manner, in Baptiſing, Marrying, Burying, Common Prayer, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and now you have all new.

                     <p>I repeat their words juſt as I have heard they make uſe of them with the people, and now I ſhall open the deceit of them in particular Anſwers to each part.</p>
                     <p>And 1. For the matter of unity, I have ſpoken of it before, and dare leave it to all the world that are judicions, whether the Papiſts or we are more unanimons, or more divided. Only to the Inſtances of diviſion, I ſhall ſpeak further now. 1. For the matter of Church Government, we are all agreed in the ſubſtance of it (except a very few ſtraglers;) As concerning the duty of Penitence, Confeſſion, Reſtitution, Contrition, and of the excommunicating the obſtinate, and Abſolving the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this we agree is the duty of the Presbyters; and we agree that theſe Presbyters may have a Preſident, only ſome think that the Preſident is <hi>ejuſdem ordinis,</hi> of the ſame order, differing but in degree, and hath no power <hi>jure divino,</hi> but what the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have, but only the <hi>exerciſe</hi> is reſtrained as to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55445:80"/>
by <hi>men;</hi> but others think that the Preſident is a Biſhop eminently of another order, having not only the exerciſe, but the power above the Presbyters. And is this difference ſo great a buſineſs? And do not theſe cheaters know, that if for this they would reproach us, they muſt do ſo by themſelves? Know they not that among their own Schoolmen there is the ſame difference, or in moſt points the ſame? And know they not that if differences in Ceremonies or Modes ſhould unchurch us, or diſgrace us, it would fall as foul on the whole Catholick Church, and that in the very primitive times? Did they never read of the difference between the Aſian and the Roman Churches, about the celebration of <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, and how <hi>Polycrates</hi> and the reſt did plead Tradition againſt the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and how <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did reprehend the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for his uncharitable cenſure of the Churches for ſo ſmall a difference? And how <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Anicetus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> could not agree, as building upon contrary Traditions: but yet maintained Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peace; as <hi>Euſebius</hi> out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Victor</hi> tels us, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Hiſt. Eccl. cap.</hi> 26. And the Engliſh and Iriſh Churches long after that adhered to the Aſian way; even after the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> had ended the controverſie on the Roman ſide. And who knows not how many more controverſies greater then theſe of ours have been among the Churches of Chriſt, without their unchurching or diſparagement to Religion.</p>
                     <p>And for the Doctrinal Controverſies mentioned, moſt of them lie more in words then in ſence, and all of them are far from the foundation, though they be about Chriſt, who is the Foundation. If one of your picture-drawers miſtake the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of Chriſt, or if one ſhould ſay he was not buried in a ſheet, theſe are errours about Chriſt that is the foundation, and yet far from the foundation. Thoſe of us that ſay <hi>Chriſt dyed for all,</hi> and thoſe that ſay <hi>he dyed not for all,</hi> do agree as your School-men do, that <hi>he dyed for all, as to the ſufficiency of his death and price:</hi> but <hi>he dyed not for all as to the actuall effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of pardon and ſalvation:</hi> Is not this your doctrine? and is not this ours? and are not you as much diſagreed about it as we? what elſe meant the late deciſion againſt the Janſeniſts? and what meaneth the preſent perſecution of them in <hi>France?</hi> And yet have you the faces to make this a reproach of us? And for

the <hi>righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> we are commonly agreed that it is both his Obedience and Paſſion that we are juſtified and ſaved by: though we are not all of a mind about the <hi>reaſon</hi> of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral intereſts; which difference is ſo far from unchriſtening us, that it makes no conſiderable odds among our ſelves, who are cenſorious enough in caſes of difference.</p>
                     <p>And for different forms of worſhip, ſure theſe men do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forget what a number of Offices and Maſs books have been among themſelves and other Churches? and what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Letanies or Liturgies of ſeveral ages and Churches they have given us in the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum?</hi> but more of this anon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as for the <hi>changes and unfixedneſs</hi> which they charge us with, we are contented that 1. Our <hi>principles.</hi> 2. And our <hi>practiſes</hi> be compared with the Papiſts, and then let even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and judicious enemies be judges which of us are more fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or more mutable.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For our <hi>Principles:</hi> we take only Chriſt to be the chief Foundation of our Faith, and his inſpired Prophets and Apoſtles to be the ſecondary foundation: whereas the Papiſts build upon many a moſt ungodly ignorant man, becauſe he is the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> And which of theſe is the firmer founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We take nothing for our <hi>Rule</hi> but the ſure word of God contained in the holy Scriptures: but the Papiſts take the Decrees of all Popes and Councils for their Rule: <hi>Our Rule</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be Divine and infallible: <hi>Their</hi> Rule we affirm to be humane and fallible. Which then is like to be more firm? Our Rule (the ſacred Scriptures in the Originall languages, as to the <hi>words,</hi> and the <hi>matter</hi> of them, as to the <hi>ſence)</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves confeſs unchangeable; but whether they will ſay as much of their own, I will try by two or three Inſtances. 1. What an alteration Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> made in the Vulgar Latine Bible, which is one part of their Rule, I told you before, and Dr. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Bellum Papale</hi> will tell you the particulars. 2. The other part is their Decrees, of which Pope <hi>Leo the tenth in Bulla contr. Luth. in Binnius, page</hi> 655. ſaith <hi>[the holy Popes our predeceſſors never erred in their Canons and Conſtitutions]</hi> And yet hear what Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond ſaith in his General Councill at the Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55445:81"/>
with their approbation, <hi>Cant. pragmat. ſanct. monitor. Binnius, vol.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 560. <hi>[Though the Inſtitutions of ſacred Canons, holy Fathers, and Popes of</hi> Rome<hi>—and their Decrees be judged immutable, as made by Divine Inſpiration; yet the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>who, though of unequal merits, holdeth the place of the Eternal King, and the Maker of all things, and all Laws on earth, may abrogate theſe Decrees when they are abuſed.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee here from the mouth of Infallibility it ſelf (if the Roman faith have any) of what continuance we may judge their Immutable Decrees to be of, which are made as by Divine inſpiration: they are <hi>Immutable</hi> till the <hi>Pope abrogate</hi> them, who being in Gods place, though of unequal merits (O humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion!) is of power to do it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We have a <hi>Rule that was perfected by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> to which nothing can be added, and therefore we are at a <hi>Certainty</hi> for our Religion: for we have a ſure and perfect Rule from Heaven. Nothing may be added to it, or taken from it. But the Papiſts do profeſs that the Determinations of the Pope or Councill may make a point (and ſo five thouſand points, for there is no certain number) to be <hi>de fide</hi> articles of faith, and neceſſary to ſalvation, though not <hi>in ſe,</hi> yet <hi>quoad nos,</hi> as to us. (And what it is for a Law to be obligatory <hi>in ſe,</hi> and not <hi>quoad nos,</hi> is hard to underſtand.) So that the Papiſts never know when their faith is perfect and grown to its full ſtature. For ought they know a thouſand more Articles yet may be added. And yet theſe men of uncertain growing faith, have the face to perſwade men that we are mutable, and they are fixed. You ſee our ſeveral <hi>Principles:</hi> now to our <hi>Practices.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For our part, 1. We never changed our Head, our Lord, our Faith, or one Article of our Faith: if malice it ſelf be able to charge us with changing the ſmalleſt Article of our Faith, let them ſay their worſt: we change not our Rule, the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nor one clauſe or ſentence of it, but endeavour the preſervation of the ſame, which at the firſt we received. In our conteſts with the Papiſts, our great offence is at their mutation from the antient Rule and way; we contend but for the faith once delivered to the Saints: <hi>the old way</hi> with us is the <hi>good way:</hi> we abhor a Religion that is new ſprung up, or is leſs then one thouſand five hundred and fifty years ſtanding at leaſt. If we
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55445:81"/>
change in any thing, it is but by repenting of our former change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs while our Nation was Popiſh; having then changed from the Apoſtolick ſimplicity, we change from that ſinful change, and return to the antient way again. And if we have made any further changes ſince our firſt change at the Reformation, it is but a perfecting the change to Antiquity, and Apoſtolick ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity which we then begun. <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a day, and is not pulled down in a day. The work of Reformation is but one change, though it be not done all at one time. If we find ſome ſpots of Romiſh dirt upon us, that eſcaped us at our firſt waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is no dangerous mutability yet to waſh it off. If a man converted by ſaving grace be not perfectly rid of all his former ſin the firſt day of his Converſion, ſhould he be reproached as mutable for ſtriving againſt it all his life after, and caſting it off by degrees as he is able? If a man did but recover by degrees from the relicks of his diſeaſe, they will not therefore reproach him as mutable? If he ſweep the duſt or dirt out of his houſe every day, they will not ſay, He is mutable and knows not where to reſt. Theſe men might as well reproach us as mutable, becauſe we riſe in the morning and do not ſtill lie in bed; or becauſe we go to bed at night, and do not ſtay up ſtill.</p>
                     <p>But what is it that we are changeable in? we have changed none of the ſubſtance of worſhip: did we baptize before, and do we not ſo ſtill? Did we pray or adminiſter the Lords Supper before, and do we not ſo ſtill? what is the change? why, 1. <hi>We before uſed the common Prayer book and now we do not.</hi> 2. <hi>Before we uſed prayers at the buria of the dead, which now are omitted.</hi> 3. <hi>Before we uſed the Croſs and Surplice, and kneeled at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are now omitted. And what then? therefore we have changed our Religion.</hi> Even as a man changeth his cloaths by bruſhing them, or his houſe by ſweeping it, or his face by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Do theſe men think us ſo ſottiſh as to place our Religion in theſe Circumſtances? God hath bid us <hi>Pray continually:</hi> but he hath not told us whether we ſhall uſe a Prayer book or not, but left that to mens neceſſities or conveniences to determine of. And doth a man change his Religion or Worſhip of God, if he either begin or ceaſe to uſe a Book? If any man had ſo little wit or Religion, as to place their Religion in a Prayer book, its no great loſs to them if they have loſt their Religion, when the

Prayer book is taken from them. We doubt not but Prayer books are profitable to ſome, and hinderances to others: ſome ſhould uſe them, and ſome ſhould not: but whether we uſe them, or not uſe them, is no part of our Religion at all, but a meer Accident, or common help and appurtenance. God hath not told preachers whether they ſhall uſe any Notes for their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Preaching: to one it is an hinderance; to another an help. Doth a man change his Religion when he changeth a cuſtome of uſing Notes? God hath not told us what Chapter we ſhall read, or what <hi>Pſalm</hi> we ſhall ſing, or what Text we ſhall Preach on this day or that day. What if one age think it beſt that ſome Paſtors give Laws to all the reſt, that they ſhall read no Chapter, preach on no Text, and ſing no <hi>Pſalm</hi> but by their direction: and the next age think it meeter to leave it to each Miniſter, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unfit to Ordain ſuch Miniſters that have not wit enough to chooſe their Text, or Chapter, or <hi>Pſalm</hi> according to occaſions. Will you ſay that here is a change of Religion? Theſe outſide Hypocrites tell the world what a thing they take Religion to be, and in what they place it. What if one man uſe an hour-glaſs in preaching, and another uſe none? What if one read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſpectacles, and another without? or if one preach in a Pulpit, and another below: or if one preach in a white garment, or another in a black: or if one ſtand at the Sacrament, and another ſit, and another kneel: Are we therefore of ſeveral Religions? or is this any part of the worſhip it ſelf? Do we not all now either ſtand, ſit, or kneel at the hearing of a Sermon, as we pleaſe? Do we not kneel or ſtand at Prayer as we pleaſe? Yea do not men commonly in ſinging <hi>Pſalms</hi> of Prayer or Praiſe to God, ſit or ſtand as they pleaſe? And what if we do ſo at the Sacrament? Is it not all one? Or doth ſtanding, kneeling or ſitting make another Religion, or any part of it? And for Marrying, Burying, Baptizing, and the reſt, we have altered no part at all of the worſhip of God; but order them in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ſeemeth moſt convenient. What ignorant ſouls are theſe, that think that the uſing a Prayer book, or praying without book, or the uſing this geſture, or that, theſe words, or thoſe words that are to the ſame ſence, doth make different Religions or Ordinances of worſhip? Theſe are tricks that none but the ſottiſhly ignorant will be deluded with, that know not wh<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

Religion or worſhip is. They may as well ſay, If I change my Lecture-day from Thurſday to Friday, that I change my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or the worſhip of God. Theſe are our great changes.</p>
                     <p>Well I will you now hear whether the Papiſts or we be the greateſt <hi>Changlings?</hi> 1. Some <hi>juſt changes</hi> they have made themſelves, that they know well enough are as great as ours. It was ſo common in the antient Church to <hi>Pray only ſtanding on every Lords day, and not to kneel at all in any part of the worſhip of that day,</hi> that it was taken for an univerſal Tradition, and to kneel was taken for a great ſin, and condemned by General Councils many hundred years after Chriſt; and yet the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Churches as well as we, have caſt off this pretended Tradition, violated this Decree of General Councils, and forſaken this univerſal Cuſtom of the Church. And the Papiſts receive the Euchariſt <hi>kneeling,</hi> for all this Law and Cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>In the primitive Church, and in <hi>Tertullians</hi> dayes, a Common Feaſt of the Church was uſed with the Lords Supper, and the Sacrament taken then. But now this Cuſtom is alſo changed. It was then the Cuſtom to ſing <hi>extempore in the Congregation</hi> to Gods praiſe. But now <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf hath no ſuch Cuſtom. It was once the Cuſtom to give <hi>Infants the Lords Supper:</hi> but now <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf hath caſt off that Cuſtom. Once it was a <hi>Canon</hi> that <hi>Biſhops muſt not read the books of Gentiles, (Concil. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag.</hi> 4.) which yet <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of, and the Papiſts now do too much value. Abundance ſuch changes might be mentioned, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then ours, in which we are juſtified by the Papiſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But they have yet other kind of changes then theſe. They have changed the very <hi>Eſſence of the Catholick Church</hi> (in their eſteem;) they have changed the Officers, the Doctrine, the Diſcipline, the Worſhip, and what not, as though they had been born for change, to turn all upſide down.</p>
                     <p>In the Primitive times, the Church had <hi>no univerſal Monarch but Chriſt:</hi> but they have ſet up a new univerſal Monarch at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the primitive times the <hi>Catholick Church was the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Chriſtians:</hi> and they have changed it to be <hi>only the ſubjects of the Pope.</hi>

                        <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and other Churches were: but they have changed it, to <hi>be the Miſtris of all Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For many hundred years after Chriſt, the <hi>Scripture was taken to be a ſufficient Rule of faith;</hi> but they have changed it to be but <hi>part of the Rule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the antient Church all <hi>ſorts were earneſtly exhorted to read, or hear, and ſtudy the Scripture in a known tongue:</hi> but they have changed this into a deſperate reſtraint, proclaiming it the cauſe of all Hereſies.</p>
                     <p>In the antient Church the Bread and Wine was the <hi>Body and Blood of Chriſt Repreſentative and Relative:</hi> but they have changed it into the <hi>real Body and Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heretofore there <hi>was Bread and Wine remaining after the words of Conſecration:</hi> but they have changed ſo, that there remaineth neither Bread nor Wine, but the qualities and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, without the ſubſtance, and this muſt be believed, becauſe they ſay it, againſt Scripture and Antiquity, and in deſpight of ſenſe it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the antient Church the <hi>Lords Supper was adminiſtred in both kinds, bread and wine to all:</hi> but they have lately changed this into one kind only to the people, denying them one half of the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Of old the <hi>Lords Supper was but the Commemoration of the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, and a Sacrament of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him and his members:</hi> but now they have changed it into a propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſins of the quick and dead: and in it they adore a piece of Bread as very God, with Divine worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Of old, men were taught <hi>to make daily confeſſion of ſin, and beg pardon,</hi> and when they had done all, to confeſs themſelves unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants: but now they are ſo changed, that they pretend not only to be perfect without ſin, and to Merit by the Condig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their works with God, but to ſupererogate and be more perfect then innocency could make them, by doing more then their duty.</p>
                     <p>Of old thoſe things were accounted ſins deſerving Hell, and needing the blood of Chriſt for pardon, which now are changed into <hi>venial ſins,</hi> which properly are no ſins, and deſerve no more then temporal puniſhment.</p>

Of old the Saints had no <hi>proper merits</hi> to plead for themſelves; and now men have ſome to ſpare for the buying of ſouls out of Purgatory.</p>
                     <p>Of old the Paſtors of the Churches were ſubject to the Rulers of the Commonwealth; even <hi>every ſoul, not only for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake</hi> was obliged to be ſubject: but now all the Clergy are exempted from ſecular Judgement, and yet the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power is ſubject to them: for the Pope hath power to depoſe Princes, and diſpoſſeſs them of their Dominions, and put others in their rooms, and diſſolve the bonds of Oaths and Covenants, in which the ſubjects were obliged to them, and to allow men to murder them by ſtabbing, poyſoning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, ſtay but till I come to it, and I ſhall give you yet ſome further proof.</p>
                     <p>Would you have any more of the Popiſh Changes? Why I might fill a volume with them. Should I but recite all the changes they have made in Doctrines, and all that they have made in Church Orders, and Diſcipline, and Religious Orders and their Diſcipline, and in Worſhip, and Ceremonies, I ſhould be over tedious: their very Liturgy or Maſſ-book hath been chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made by changes, ſuch abundance of additions it hath had ſince the beginning of it. What changes <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, and <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth made in their Bibles, I told you before: as alſo what changes they have had in the election of their Popes.</p>
                     <p>And now I am content that any impartial man be judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſts or the Reformed Churches are the more mutable and unſetled in their Religion? and which of them is at the greater certainty, firmneſs, and immutability?</p>

To this we ſhall give them once more a brief, but ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry anſwer. I. We are ſo fully aſſured that the oldeſt Religion is the beſt, (ſince the date of the Goſpell) that we are contented that our whole cauſe do ſtand or fall by this tryall. Let him be eſteemed of the true Religion, that is of the oldeſt Religion. This is the main difference between us and the Papiſts: We are for no Religion that is not as old as the dayes of the Apoſtles: but they are for the Novelties and Additions of Popes and Councils. Their own <hi>Polidore Virgil de Inven. Rerum, p.</hi> 410. <hi>lib</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 4. calling us a Sect, doth give you a juſt deſcription of us <hi>[Ita licentia pacta loquendi,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>Having once got leave to ſpeak, that ſect did marvailouſly increaſe in a ſhort time; which is called Evangelicall, becauſe they affirm that no Law is to be received which belongeth to ſalvation, but what is given by Chriſt or the Apoſtles.]</hi> Mark what they confeſs themſelves of our Religion: And yet theſe very men have the face to charge us with Novelty; as if Chriſt and his Apoſtles were not of ſufficient Antiquity for them. <hi>Our</hi> main quarrel with them is, for <hi>adding new inventions</hi> in Religion, and their principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt us is to defend it, and yet they call theirs the <hi>old Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and ours the <hi>new.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Argument lieth thus. <hi>That which is moſt conform to the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is the truly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Religion and Church. But our Religion and Church is moſt conform to the doctrine and practice of the Apoſtles: therefore it is the truly antient Religion and Church.</hi> The Major they will yield: For no older Religion is deſirable, further then as the Law of Nature and Moral Determinations of God are ſtill in force. I ſuppoſe they will not plead for Judaiſm. For the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, we lay our cauſe upon it, and are ready to produce our evidence for the Conformity of our Religion and Churches to the doctrine and practice of the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>That Religion which is moſt conform to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is moſt conform to the doctrine and practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: But our Religion (and Churches) is moſt conform to the holy Scriptures: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They can ſay nothing againſt the Major, but that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is Inſufficient without Tradition: But for that, 1. We have no Rule of faith but what is by themſelves confeſſed to be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55445:86"/>
true: They acknowledge Scripture to be the true word of God; So that the Truth of our Rule is Juſtified by themſelves. 2. Let them ſhew us as good Evidence that their Additional Articles of faith or Laws of life came from the Apoſtles, as we do that the Scriptures came from them, and then we ſhall confeſs that we come ſhort of them: Let them take the Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us point by point, and bring their proof, and we will bring ours, and let that Religion carry it that is Apoſtolicall: But we are ſure that by this means they will be proved Noveliſts. For 1. Their Traditions in matter of faith ſuperadded to the Scripture, are meer Hereticall or Erroneous forgeries, and they can give us no proof that ever they were Apoſtolicall. 2. The Scripture affirmeth its own ſufficiency; and therefore excludeth their Traditions. 3. I ſhewed you how in their own General Council at <hi>Baſil,</hi> the Scripture ſufficiency was defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 4. I have ſhewed you in my Book called the <hi>Safe Religion,</hi> that the ancient Fathers were for the ſufficiency of Scripture. 5. Their Traditions are the opinions of a dividing ſect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Traditions or doctrine of the preſent Catholick Church: the far greater part of Chriſtians being againſt them. 6. We are able to ſhew that the time was for ſome hundred years after Chriſt, when moſt of their pretended Traditions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or abhorred by the Chriſtian Church, and no ſuch things were in being among them. 7. And we can prove that the chief points of Controverſie mantained againſt us, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without Scripture, but againſt it, and from thence we have full particular evidence to diſprove them. If the Scriptures be true, as they confeſs them to be, then no Tradition can be Apoſtolicall or true that is contrary to them: For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the Papiſts Tradition is, that the Clergy is exempt from the Magiſtrates judgement: But the holy Scripture ſaith <hi>[Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher power, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The Papiſts Tradition is for ſerving <hi>God publickly in an unknown tongue.</hi> But the holy Scripture is fully againſt it. Their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is againſt <hi>Lay mens reading the Scripture in a known tongue,</hi> without ſpecial Licenſe from their ordinary: But Scripture and all antiquity is againſt them. The like we may ſay of many other Controverſies.</p>
                     <p>So that theſe ſeven wayes we know their Traditions to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55445:87"/>
deceitfull; becauſe they are 1. Unproved. 2. Againſt the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Scripture. 3. Againſt their own former confeſſions. 4. Againſt the concent of the Fathers. 5. Contrary to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt of the Catholick Church. 6. We can prove that once the Church was without them. 7. And they are many of them contrary to expreſs Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And if Scripture will but ſhew which of us is neereſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the Apoſtles, then the controverſie is ended, or in a fair way to it: For we provoke them to try the cauſe by Scripture, and they deny it: we profeſs it is the Rule and teſt of our Religion; but they appeal to another Rule and teſt. And thus you may ſee which is the <hi>old Religion:</hi> which will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fullyer cleared in that which followeth.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. And that our Church and Religion hath been continued from the dayes of Chriſt till now, we prove thus. 1. From the promiſe of Chriſt, which cannot be broken. Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his word, that that Church and Religion which is moſt conform to the Scripture, ſhall continue to the end: But our Church and Religion is moſt conform to the Scripture: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt hath promiſed that it ſhall continue to the end.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the event. The Chriſtian Religion and Catholick Church hath continued from the dayes of Chriſt till now. But ours is the Chriſtian Religion, and Catholick Church: therefore ours hath continued from the dayes of Chriſt till now. The Major they will grant: the Minor is proved by parts; thus. 1. That Religion which hath all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and doth not deny or deſtroy any Eſſential part of it, is the Chriſtian Religion: but ſuch is ours: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That Religion, which the Apoſtles were of, is the Chriſtian Religion: But ours is the ſame that the Apoſtles were of: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. That Religion, which is neerer the Scripture then the Romiſh Religion, is certainly the Chriſtian Religion: But ſo is ours: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. They that believe not only all that in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that is contained in the Ancient Creeds of the Church, but alſo in generall all that is beſides in the holy Scripture, are of the Chriſtian Religion: But thus do the Reformed Churches believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And for our Church; 1. They that are of that one holy Catholick Church, whereof Chriſt is the head, and all true
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55445:87"/>
Chriſtians are members, are of the true Church: (For there is but one Catholick Church:) But ſo are we: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that are Sanctified, Juſtified, have the love of God in them, are members of the true Catholick Church: But ſuch are all that are ſincere Profeſſors of our Religion: therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all this will not ſerve them without a Catalogue, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them where our Church was before <hi>Luther:</hi> To this we further anſwer; we have no peculiar Catholick Church of our own; for there is but <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>that is</hi> our Church: Wherever the Chriſtian Church was, there was <hi>our Church.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any <hi>Chriſtians were congregate</hi> for Gods worſhip, there were Churches of the ſame ſort, as our particular Churches. And wherever Chriſtianity was, there our Religion was: For we know no Religion but Chriſtianity. And would you have us give you a Catalogue of all the Chriſtians in the world, ſince Chriſt? Or would you have us as vain as <hi>H. T.</hi> in his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that names you ſome Popes, and about twenty profeſſors of their faith in each age, as if twenty or thirty men were the Catholick Church: Or as if thoſe men were proved to be Papiſts by his naming them? This is eaſie, but ſilly diſputing.</p>
                     <p>In a word, Our Religion is Chriſtianity. 1. Chriſtianity hath certain Eſſentials, without which no man can be a Chriſtian; and it hath moreover many precious truths, and duties neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> and alſo <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> to the <hi>better being of a Chriſtian.</hi> Our <hi>being</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is in the <hi>former;</hi> and our <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>better-being</hi> is much in the latter. From the <hi>former, Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> is denominated. Moreover, 2. Our implicite and actuall explicite Belief (as the Papiſts call them) muſt be diſtinguiſhed; or, our General and our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Belief. 3. And alſo the Poſitives of our Belief muſt be diſtinguiſhed from the implyed Negatives; and the expreſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles themſelves, from their implyed Conſectaries.</p>
                     <p>And now premiſing theſe three diſtinctions, I ſhall tell you where our Church hath been in all Ages ſince the birth of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the dayes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles our Church was where they and all Chriſtians were: And our Religion was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55445:88"/>
with them in all its parts, both <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>perfective.</hi> That is, we now Believe 1. All to be true that was delivered by the Apoſtles as from God, with a <hi>General faith,</hi> 2. We believe all the Eſſentials and as much more as we can underſtand, with a <hi>Particular faith.</hi> 3. But we cannot ſay that with ſuch a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faith</hi> we believe all that the Apoſtles believed or delivered; for then we muſt ſay that we have the ſame degree of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as they; and that we underſtand every word of the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the dayes of the A poſtles themſelves, the <hi>Conſectaries,</hi> and implied Verities, and Rejections of all Hereſies were not particularly and expreſly delivered either in Scripture or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (as the Papiſts will confeſs.)</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the next ages after the Apoſtles, <hi>our Church was the one Catholick Church, containing all true Chriſtians, Headed by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and every ſuch Chriſtian (too many to number) was a member of it. And for our Religion, the <hi>Eſſential</hi> parts of it were contained both in the Holy Scriptures, and in the Publick Profeſſions, Ordinances, and Practices of the Church in thoſe ages, (which you call Traditions:) and the reſt of it, even all the doctrines of faith and univerſal Laws of God, which are its perfective parts, they were fully contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the holy Scriptures. And ſome of our Rejections and Conſectaries, were then gathered and owned by the Church, as Hereſies occaſioned the expreſſing of them: and the reſt were all implyed in the Apoſtolical Scripture doctrine which they preſerved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By degrees many errors crept into the Church: yet ſo, that 1. Neither the Catholick Church, nor one true Chriſtian <hi>(in ſenſu compoſito</hi> at leaſt) did reject any eſſential part of Chriſtianity. 2. And all parts of the Church were not alike corrupted with error, but ſome more, and ſome leſs. 3. And ſtill the whole Church held the holy Scripture it ſelf, and ſo had a perfect General or Implicite belief; even while by evill conſequences they oppugned many parts of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When in proceſs of time by claiming the univerſall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, <hi>Rome</hi> had introduced a new pretended Catholick Church,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55445:88"/>
(ſo far as their opinion took) by ſuperadding a New Head and form, there was then a <hi>two fold Church in the Weſt; the Chriſtian as Chriſtian</hi> headed by Chriſt; and the <hi>Papal as Papal</hi> Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope; yet ſo as they called it but <hi>one Church;</hi> and by this uſurped Monarchy as under Chriſt endeavoured to make but <hi>one</hi> of them, by making <hi>both the Heads Eſſential,</hi> when before <hi>one only</hi> was <hi>tolerable.</hi> And if the <hi>Matter</hi> in any part may be the ſame, and the ſame Man be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> and ſo the ſame Aſſemblies: yet ſtill the <hi>forms</hi> are various: and <hi>as Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>part of the Catholick Church,</hi> they are one thing: and <hi>as Papiſts, and members of the ſeparating ſect,</hi> they are another thing. Till this time there is no doubt of our Churches Viſibility.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In this time of the Romiſh Uſurpation, our Church was viſible in three degrees, in three ſeverall ſorts of perſons. 1. It was viſible in <hi>the loweſt degree</hi> among the Papiſts themſelves, not <hi>as Papiſts,</hi> but as <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For they never did to this day deny the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor the <hi>Ancient Creeds, nor Baptiſm, the Lords Supper,</hi> nor any of the ſubſtance of our Poſitive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion. They added a <hi>New Religion</hi> and Church of their own, but ſtill profeſſed to hold all the old in conſiſtency with it.</p>
                     <p>Wherever the <hi>truth of holy Scriptures and the ancient Creeds of the Church</hi> were profeſſed, there was our Religion before <hi>Luther:</hi> But even among the Papiſts the holy Scriptures and the ſaid Creeds were (viſibly) profeſſed: therefore among them was our Religion.</p>
                     <p>And note here that Popery it ſelf was not ripe for a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian faith profeſſed, till <hi>Luthers</hi> oppoſition heightned them. For the Scripture was frequently before, by Papiſts held to be a moſt ſufficient Rule of faith, (as I ſhewed before from the Council of <hi>Baſil:)</hi> and conſequently, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was only pleaded as conſervatory and expoſitory of the Scripture; but now the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath in a ſort equalled them. And this they were lately driven to, when they found that out of Scripture they were unable to confute or ſuppreſs the truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. At the ſame time of the Churches oppreſſion by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, our Religion was viſible (and ſo our Church:) <hi>in a more illuſtrious ſort,</hi> among the <hi>Chriſtians of the moſt of the world,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55445:89"/>
Greeks, Ethiopians, and the reſt,</hi> that never were ſubject to the uſurpation of <hi>Rome,</hi> but only (many of them) took him for the <hi>Patriarch primae ſedis,</hi> but not <hi>Epiſcopus Eccleſiae Catholicae,</hi> or the Governour of the Univerſall Church. So that here was a viſibility of our Church doubly more eminent then among the Romaniſts: 1. In that it was <hi>the far greateſt part</hi> of the Catholick Church that thus held our Religion, to whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts were then but few. 2. In that they did not only hold the <hi>ſame Poſitive Articles of faith</hi> with us, but alſo among their <hi>Rejections,</hi> did Reject the <hi>chief</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh errors</hi> as we do. Beſides many particular points named in my <hi>Safe Religion,</hi> they Rejected with us, the <hi>Popes Catholick Monarchy,</hi> the <hi>pretended Infallibility of the Pope</hi> or <hi>his Councils: the new form of the Papall Catholick Church, as Headed by him,</hi> with other ſuch points; which are the very fundamentall controverſies between us and the Papiſts. So that (beſides that the Papiſts themſelves profeſs our Religion) <hi>the major part of the Catholick Church did profeſs it, with the Rejection of the Papacy and Papall Church;</hi> and ſo you may as eaſily ſee where our Religion was before <hi>Luther,</hi> as where the Catholick Church, or moſt of Chriſtians were before <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. And beſide both theſe, our Religion was profeſſed with a yet greater <hi>Rejection</hi> of Romiſh corruptions, by thouſands, and many thouſands that lived in the Weſtern Church it ſelf, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes noſe, and oppoſed him in many of his ill endeavours againſt the Church and truth, together with them that gave him the hearing, and were glad to be quiet, and gave way to his tyranny, but never conſented to it.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe we have abundant evidence, though abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more we might have had, if the power and ſubtilty of the Papall faction had not had the handling of them. 1. We have abundance of Hiſtories that tell us of the bloody wars and contentions that the Emperours both of Eaſt and Weſt have had with the Pope to hinder his tyranny; and that they were forced by his power to ſubmit to him, contrary to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer free profeſſions. 2. And we have abundance of Treatiſes then written againſt him, both for the Emperours and Princes, and againſt his doctrine and tyranny: ſome ſtore of them <hi>Goldaſtus</hi> hath gathered: And intimations of more you have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55445:89"/>
in their own expurgatory Indices. 3. And we have the hiſtories and profeſſions of the <hi>Albigenſes, Waldenſes, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> and others that were very numerous, and if <hi>Raynerius</hi> ſay true, they affirmed (about the year one thouſand one hundred) that they had coutinued ſince the Apoſtles, and no other Originall of them is proved. 4. Particular evidence unanſwerable is given in by Biſhop <hi>Uſher de Succeſ. &amp; ſtatu Eccl. and Anſwer to the Jeſuites,</hi> and <hi>the Ancient Religion of</hi> Ireland, and <hi>in</hi> Dr. Field, and Morneyes <hi>Myſterie of Iniquity, and of the Church,</hi> and <hi>Illyricus,</hi> and many others. 5. Even Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Popiſh Councils have contended and born witneſs againſt the Popes ſuperiority over a Councill. 6. And in that and other points whole Countreyes of their own are not yet brought over to the Pope. 7. They have ſtill among themſelves Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, Janſeniſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are reproached by the Jeſuites as ſiding with <hi>Calvin</hi> in many Controverſies, as <hi>Catharinus</hi> and many more in others. Moſt points of ours which we oppoſe to Popery, being maintained by ſome or other of them. 8. But the fulleſt evidence is the certain hiſtory or knowledge of of the caſe of the common people and Clergy among them, who are partly ignorant of the main matters in Controverſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us (as we ſee by experience of multitudes for one, to this day) and are generally kept under the fear of fire, and ſword, and torments; ſo that the truth of the Caſe is this: the Roman Biſhops were aſpiring by degrees to be Arch-biſhops, and ſo to be Patriarchs, and ſo to have the firſt ſeat and vote, and to be called the <hi>Chief Biſhops or Patriarchs,</hi> and at laſt they made <hi>another thing</hi> of their office, and claimed (about ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years or more after Chriſt) to be <hi>univerſal Monarchs or Governours of all the Church:</hi> But though this claim was ſoon laid, it was comparatively but few, even in the Weſt, that made it any Article of their faith, but multitudes ſided with the Princes that would have kept the Pope lower, and the moſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple medled not with the matter, but yielded to neceſſity, and gave place to violence, except ſuch as the <hi>Albigenſes, Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans, Wicklefiſts</hi> and the reſt that more openly oppoſed. So that no man could judge of the multitude clearly, which ſide they were on, being forced by fire and ſword, and having not the freedom to profeſs their minds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55445:90"/>
So that in ſumm, our Religion was at firſt with the Apoſtles, and the Apoſtolick Church: and for divers hundred years after, it was with the univerſal Chriſtian Church: And ſince <hi>Romes</hi> uſurpation, it was even with the Romaniſts though abuſed, and with the greater part of the Catholick Church that renounced Popery then, and ſo do now; and alſo with the oppoſers of the Pope in the Weſt under his own noſe. You ſee now what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion we plead, and where our Church and Religion ſtill was.</p>
                     <p>If any deny that we are of the ſame Church and Religion with the Greeks, Abaſsines, and moſt of the Chriſtian world, (yea all that is truly Chriſtian) I eaſily prove it. 1. They that are Chriſtians joyned to Chriſt the Head, are all of the ſame Church and Religion (for none elſe are Chriſtians or united to Chriſt, but the Church which is his Body) But the ſincere Greeks, Abaſſines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we are Chriſtians united to Chriſt the Head: therefore we are all of one and the ſame Church and Religion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that believe the ſame holy Scripture, and differ in no eſſential part of the Chriſtian faith, are of the ſame Church and Religion: but ſo do both we and all true Chriſtians: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are all of one Church and Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They that are truly regenerate, and Juſtified, hating all known ſin, longing to be perfect, Loving God above all, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt his Kingdom and Righteouſneſs, and accounting all things but as dung in compariſon of Chriſt, theſe are all of the true Catholick Church, and the true Chriſtian Religion: but ſuch are all that are ſincere, both of the Greeks, Abaſſines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Reformed Churches; as we prove, 1. To others by our Profeſsion and Practice, by which only they are capable of judging of us. 2. To ourſelves infallibly againſt all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our ſalvation in Hell or Earth, by the knowledge and acquaintance with our own hearts, and the experience of the work of God upon them. All the Jeſuites in the world cannot perſwade me that I love not God, and hate not ſin, and prefer not the Love of Chriſt before all the world, when I feel and know that I do; till they can prove that they know my heart better then I do.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If <hi>Chriſt Conſent</hi> to it, and <hi>we Conſent</hi> to it, then we are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55445:90"/>
all (that are ſincere in their profeſsion) of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church and Religion (for if <hi>he conſent</hi> and <hi>we conſent,</hi> who is there that is able to break the match?) But Chriſt conſenteth, and we conſent: as we prove by parts. 1. <hi>His conſent</hi> is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Goſpel, that <hi>whoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; and whoever will, may drink of the water of life freely.</hi> 2. And <hi>our conſent</hi> we openly profeſſed at Baptiſme, and have frequently renewed, and our own ſouls are acquainted with the ſincerity of it, whatever any that know not our hearts may ſay againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. All that are truly Baptized, and own their Baptiſmal Covenant, are viſible members of the true Catholick Church: (For it is the very nature and uſe of Baptiſme to enter us into that Church:) But Greeks, Abaſſines, Georgians, Armenians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Proteſtants, are all truly Baptized, and own their Baptiſmal Covenant: therefore we are all of the true Catholick Church.</p>
                     <p>What is ordinarily ſaid againſt <hi>this ſucceſſion</hi> of our Church, I have anſwered in my <hi>ſafe Religion.</hi> I now add an anſwer to what another, <hi>viz H. Turbervile</hi> in his <hi>Manuall</hi> ſaith againſt us in the preſent point. The eaſineſs of his Arguments, and the open vanity of his exceptions, will give me leave to be the ſhorter in confuting them.</p>
                     <p>His firſt Argument <hi>(pag.</hi> 43.) is this. <hi>[The true Church of God hath had a continued Succeſſion from Chriſt—But the Proteſtant Church, and ſo of all other Sectaries, hath not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Succeſſion from Chriſt to this time: therefore,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I pray thee Reader be an impartial Judge what this man or any Papiſt ever ſaid with ſenſe and reaſon, to prove that the Eaſtern and Southern Churches have no true Succeſſion. Let them talk what they pleaſe of their Schiſme, the world knows they have had as good a Succeſſion as <hi>Rome.</hi> Are they not now of the ſame Church and Religion as ever they have been? All the change that many of them have made, hath been but in the entertaining of ſome fopperies, common to <hi>Rome</hi> and them. And if any of theſe (which you call Sectaries) can prove their Succeſſion, it deſtroyes your Argument and Cauſe. Me thinks you ſhould not ask <hi>them,</hi> where <hi>their Church</hi> was before <hi>Luther?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:55445:91"/>
2. But how doth this Diſputer prove his Minor, that <hi>we</hi> have no Succeſſion? Only by a ſtark falſhood: forſooth <hi>[by the Conceſſion of the moſt Learned Adverſaries, who freely and unanimouſly Confeſs, that before</hi> Luther <hi>made his ſeparation from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>for nine hundred or one thouſand years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the whole world was Catholick, and in obedience to the Pope of</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> O horrid boldneſs! that a man that pleads for the ſanctity of his Church, dare thus ſpeak ſo notorious an untruth in the face of the world! At this rate of Diſputing, the man might have ſaved the labour of writing his Book, and have as honeſtly at once have perſwaded his Diſciples, that his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries unanimouſly conſeſs that the Papiſts cauſe is beſt. What if the fifteen cited by him had ſaid ſo, when I can bring him one thouſand five hundred of another mind, and cite him fifteen for one of another mind, is that the unanimous confeſsion of his Adverſaries? But unleſs his Adverſaries were quite beſide themſelves, there is not one of them could ſay as he feigneth them to ſay. For doth not the world know, that the Eaſtern and Southern Churches, far exceeding the Romaniſts in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, did deny obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> Would this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his poor Diſciples that we all confeſs, that there are, or were no Chriſtians in the world but Proteſtants and Papiſts? His firſt cited Confeſsion is <hi>Calvins [that all the Weſtern Churches have defended Popery]</hi> A fair proof! Doth this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter believe in good ſadneſs, that the <hi>Weſtern Churches</hi> are <hi>all the world,</hi> or a ſixth part of the world? But this is the Popiſh arguing. What <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks of the Weſtern Churches, that is, the prevailing power in each Nation of them, he interprets of <hi>all the world.</hi> So he deales with Dr. <hi>White,</hi> who expreſly in the words before thoſe which he citeth, affirmeth the viſibility of the Churches of <hi>Greece, Ethiope, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> but only ſaith, that at all times there hath not been viſible diſtinct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies free from all corruption: which one would think every penitent man ſhould grant that knows the corruption of his own heart and life. It would be tedious to ſtand to ſhew his odious abuſe of the reſt: when they that ſay moſt of the word [world] but as it is uſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 1. ſo much of his firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:55445:91"/>
His ſecond is this. <hi>Without a continued number of Biſhops, Prieſts, Laicks, ſucceeding one another in the profeſſion of the ſame faith from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time, a continued ſucceſſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had: But Proteſtants have no continued number,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> And how proves he the Minor? <hi>No how at all;</hi> but puts us to diſprove it; and withall gives us certain Laws, which we will obey when they grow up to the honour of being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. His firſt Law is, that <hi>[We muſt name none but only ſuch as held explicitely the thirty nine Articles, all granting and denying the ſame points that the late Proteſtants of</hi> England <hi>granted or denyed—for if they differ from them in any one materiall point, they cannot be eſteemed Proteſtants] Anſw.</hi> A learned Law! And what call you <hi>[a material point?]</hi> You may yet make what you liſt of it. If they differ in any point <hi>Eſſentiall to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> we grant your impoſition to be neceſſary. But there is not the leaſt Chronologicall, or Geographicall, or other truth in Scripture, but is a <hi>Materiall</hi> Point, though not <hi>Eſſential.</hi> Muſt you needs know which theſe <hi>Eſſentials</hi> are? In a word: <hi>Thoſe which the Apoſtles and the ancient Church pre-required the knowledge and profeſſion of, unto Baptiſm.</hi> And becauſe all your fond exceptions are grounded on this one point, I ſhall crave your patience, while I briefly, but ſufficiently prove that <hi>Men that err, and that in points materiall, may yet be of the ſame Church and Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. If men that err in points material (that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truths of God, which they ought to have believed.) may yet be <hi>true Chriſtians</hi> and hold all the Eſſentials of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: then may they be of the ſame true Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But the former is true: therefore ſo is the later. The Antecedent is proved, in that all truths which may be called Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, are not of the eſſence of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The Apoſtle <hi>Thomas</hi> erred in a <hi>Materiall</hi> point (which is now an eſſentiall) when he would not believe Chriſts Reſurrection: and yet was a member of the true Church: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The Papiſts err in material points, and yet think themſelves of the ſame true Church: therefore they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that differing in <hi>Material</hi> points may be the caſe of members of the ſame true Church. For proof of the Minor, I demand:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55445:92"/>
Are none of the points <hi>Material</hi> that have been ſo hotly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated between the Jeſuites, and Dominicans and Janſeniſts? the Papall party, and the Councill party? The Thomiſts, Scotiſts, Ockamiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At leaſt review the Jeſuite Caſuiſts cited by the Janſeniſts Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm; and tell us whether it be no whit Material <hi>Whether a man may kill another for a Crown? or may kill both Judge and witneſſes to avoid an unjuſt ſentence? Or whether a man ſhould go with good meanings into a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to perſwade them to penitence, that hath found by experience that when he comes there he is naught with them himſelf? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man may lawfully lie and calumniate to put by a calumny? Or ſpeak falſly with mentall reſervations? Or forbear loving God many years together, if not all his life?</hi> Are theſe points no whit <hi>Material?</hi> You know that one part of you (with a Pope and General Council) are for depoſing Heretical Kings, and murthering and ſtabbing them, and others of you diſavow it: Is this <hi>no whit material?</hi> And yet you are all of one Church and Religion. A hundred more of your differences I could name.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. From inſtances of the Fathers that have erred in <hi>Material</hi> points, and yet are taken to be of the ſame Church and Religion. How many Churches differed about <hi>Eaſter</hi> day? what abundance of errors are in your <hi>Clementines,</hi> and other ſuch writers owned by you? <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> was a Millenarie: Numbered divers Infidels with Chriſtians; thought that Angels lived by meat, and generated with Devils, <hi>&amp;c. Athenagoras</hi> thought that ſecond Marriages were comely Adultery and that the Angels fell by the love of women, and begot Gyants of them, <hi>&amp;c. Irenaeus</hi> hath the like: <hi>Theophilus Antioch.</hi> worſe: <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Orrigen</hi> you will confeſs had yet worſe, <hi>Clem. Alexand.</hi> was for the ſalvation of Infidels and Heathens: againſt ſwearing and many ſuch, beſides thoſe before mentioned. <hi>Greg. Thaumaturgus</hi> hath divers, if the confeſſion and other works be his that are aſcribed to him. <hi>Cyprian, Firmilian,</hi> and the whole Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> were for rebaptizing thoſe baptized by hereticks; Againſt all Wars and Oaths <hi>Lactantius</hi> (with many more) was a Millenary, and hath too many great errors. I have no delight to rake into their faults; but if it be neceſſary I ſhall quickly prove many and great errors by fourty more of them at the leaſt. And yet
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55445:92"/>
all theſe or moſt, are confeſſed by you to be of one Church and Religion.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. If there be no perfect concord to be expected till we come to the place of perfect knowledge and happineſs, then it is not perfect concord, that is neceſſary to prove us of the ſame Church or Religion. But the Antecedent is alas too far paſt doubt. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. If the godly and learned Doctors of the Church (and all men) have ſome (alas how many) culpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in matters of Religion (yea of faith, if you call that <hi>de fide,</hi> which we are obliged to believe) then thoſe that have ſuch errors may be of the ſame Church and Religion: But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is ſo true and evident that I think none but a blind proud Phariſee will deny himſelf to beg of God daily to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and heal his culpable errors. So much to prove that men of errors and differing minds (if not about the eſſence of the Church) may be of the ſame Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But why is it that they <hi>muſt all needs explicitely hold the thirty nine Articles?</hi> 1. I pray you tell us, whether all your own Church do explicitely hold and believe all your Articles? that is, all that Popes and General Councils have defined or declared. Dare you ſay that one of five hundred, of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, doth explicitely believe all this? And why then is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in our caſe that all muſt <hi>explicitely</hi> believe all thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? 2. Yea with us it is far more unneceſſary. For we take not <hi>thoſe Articles for the Rule of our faith,</hi> but only the holy Scripture: And therefore you may as well tell us that no man is of our Religion, that did not write or ſpeak all the ſame words that <hi>Jewell, Reignolds, Perkins,</hi> or ſuch other have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55445:93"/>
in their whole works. 3. Its eaſie to prove for all that, that the ſenſe and ſubſtance of thoſe Articles have been owned by the Churches in all ages.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But what if we grant your concluſion, that <hi>[elſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed Proteſtants]</hi> what of that? As if none but <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> were of the ſame Church and Religion with us. Sure you think we make a ſect of our ſelves like you, and exclude all others from the Church and Salvation as you do! The word <hi>[Proteſtant]</hi> is not the firſt denomination of our Religion from its eſſence; for ſo we call our ſelves <hi>[Chriſtians]</hi> only; But it is a title that accidentally accrewed to our Religion, from our <hi>Proteſting againſt your innovations and corruptions;</hi> and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the errors contrary to our Religion which you had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. Now thoſe that were not involved in your errors as our forefathers were, but lived at a further diſtance from you, might have no occaſion to make ſuch a Proteſtation; and yet be of the ſame Church and Religion as we are.</p>
                     <p>Now to your <hi>particular</hi> Laws. 1. Saith <hi>H. T. [Let him not name the Waldenſes: for they held the Real preſence, that the Apoſtles were Lay men, that all Magiſtrates fall from their dignity by any mortal ſin, that it is not lawful to ſwear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> Waldo <hi>lived but in one thouſand one hundred and ſixty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We have better aſſurance of the faith of the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes in their own publiſhed Confeſſions, then from the mouth of their Adverſaries. 2. The Lutherans hold the real preſence, and yet are of the ſame Religion and Church with us. 3. The Apoſtles were Lay-men in the Jews account and ſenſe, as not being <hi>Prieſts or Levites,</hi> but not in Chriſtians account that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved their miſſion: and thus thought the Waldenſes. 4. They thought that Magiſtrates and Miniſters do by Mortal ſin forfeit all the right and title to their office, from which themſelves may have comfort and juſtification in judgement: But they never thought that they were not to be obeyed by others, or that their actions were not valid for the Churches good. 5. Many of the ancienteſt Fathers thought it unlawfull to ſwear at all, that yet are cited by you as of your Church. But the Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſlandered in theſe points. 6. Though <hi>Waldo</hi> was but about one thouſand one hundred and ſixty, yet the ſame Religion and Church under other names, and before thoſe names were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55445:93"/>
on them, was much elder, as <hi>Raynerius</hi> may ſatisfie you. So that for all this, the Waldenſes and we are of one Church and Religion.</p>
                     <p>He adds <hi>[Let him not name the Huſſites, for they held Maſs, Tranſubſtantiation and ſeven Sacraments, that the univerſal Church conſiſted only of the predeſtinate,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> O what a ſort of men have we to deal with? The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> burnt <hi>John Huſs</hi> to aſhes for ſaying that <hi>there remained the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine after Conſecration and that Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was a new word to deceive men with]</hi> as <hi>Binnius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſeth among their accuſations of him: And among the articles for diſcovery of the Huſſites, one was <hi>Whether they take it to be a mortall ſin to reject the Sacraments of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, extream unction and marriage.]</hi> And yet now <hi>Huſs</hi> is burnt for it, the poor lay-Papiſts are perſwaded by their deceivers, that the Huſſites were for Tranſubſtantiation and ſeven Sacraments. Why then did a General Council accuſe or receive accuſation and witneſs againſt him for the contrary? 2. That the univerſal Church as inviſible, and as taken in the firſt ſignification, containeth none but the truly ſanctified (and ſo predeſtinate) we believe as well as <hi>Huſs:</hi> though in the ſecond Analogical ſignification, the Church as viſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all the Profeſſors of faith and Holineſs, whether ſincere or not. 3. And that they were condemned by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Huſs</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> burnt after they had a ſafe conduct, doth ſhew that the faith of Papiſts is perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, (for why ſhould the people be more juſt then a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council?) but it ſhews not that we and they are not of the ſame Church or Religion: you condemned and burnt thoſe of our Religion too: therefore you thought at leaſt that we are neer kin.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>H. T.</hi> proceeds with his precepts <hi>[Let him not name the Albigenſes: for they held all marriages to be unlawfull, and all things begotten</hi> ex coitu <hi>to be unclean: They held two Gods</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe are not only ſuch falſhoods by which you uphold your cauſe, but the more inexcuſable and ſhameleſs, by how much the more frequently and fully detected long ago, and yet continued in. <hi>Perrin, Viguerius</hi> and many others might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented your error: eſpecially Biſhop <hi>Uſher de Succeſ.

And ſee by him there cited what the ſame <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith againſt your Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then judge which he ſpoak hardlier of.</p>
                     <p>As for the Cathariſts next added, they were not the Puritan Waldenſes as you ſpeak, but part of the Manichees: and if ſuch as they are deſcribed, we are content to loſe their names, and are not ambitious to be reputed their Succeſſors.</p>
                     <p>He adds <hi>[Let him not name the Wicklifians: for they held; that all things came to paſs by fatall neceſsity; That Princes and Magiſtrates fell from their dignity and power by mortall ſin.] Anſw.</hi> We know by many of <hi>Wicklifs</hi> own books printed and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript what his judgement was, what ever your Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi> accuſe him of. It was <hi>a Divine Neceſsity</hi> oppoſed to <hi>uncertainty,</hi> and to the <hi>determination of an unruled will,</hi> that he mentioneth. And do not your Jeſuites lay as heavy a charge on the Dominicans ſometimes? and with as great cauſe may many of your Schoolmen be diſclaimed for this as <hi>Wicklife,</hi> if you will underſtand him, and them. <hi>Wicklife</hi> was known to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>teach obedience</hi> to Magiſtrates. But is it not a fine world, when <hi>Wicklife</hi> muſt not be of our Church becauſe he is ſuppoſed to deny the power of Magiſtrates in mortal ſin? and yet the Pope and his Council determine that Princes or Lords that will not root out ſuch as the Pope cals Hereticks muſt be caſt our, and their Countrey given to others. It ſeems you take <hi>Wicklife</hi> to be ſome kin to your ſelves. But we doubt not but he was of the Catholick Church and Religion, and therefore of the ſame with us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>H. T.</hi> adds <hi>[Let him not name the Grecians: for they rejected the Communion of Proteſtants.</hi> Cenſur. Eccl. Orient. <hi>They were at leaſt ſeven hundred or eight hundred year in Communion with the Church of</hi> Rome.<hi>—they were united to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>again in the Council of</hi> Florence: <hi>They held Tranſubſtantiation, ſeven Sacraments, unbloody Sacrifice, Prayer to Saints, and for the dead.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55445:94"/>
whats that to the Millions of Greek Chriſtians that never rejected it? And whats that to all Patriarcks before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that rejected it not? Did <hi>Cyril</hi> reject our Communion, that hath publiſhed a Proteſtant confeſſion, and was ſo malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and treacherouſly dealt with to the death, and falſly accuſed to the Turks by the Jeſuites, for his conſtancy? 2. Do you think the world knoweth not by what inducements you drew a few poor men at <hi>Florence</hi> to ſubſcribe to a certain union with you? and what death the Patriark dyed? and how the Greeks reſented his fact? and what a return they made to your Church? I pray perſwade your ſelves that they and we and all are Papiſts. 3. If the Greeks did diſclaim Communion with us, they are nevertheleſs of the ſame Church and Religion with us, for all that. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were both Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans when they parted in diſſention. If one neighbour in anger call another Traitor unjuſtly, and ſay he will have no Society with him, they may be both the Kings ſubjects and members of one Common wealth for all that. 4. As to the Greeks opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the Papiſts falſe accuſations of them, I have ſpoken already againſt pretended. <hi>Veridicus</hi> in my <hi>Safe Religion.</hi> It is not you nor all the Jeſuites on earth that can prove the Greeks and us to be ſo diſtant, as not to be of the ſame Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church.</p>
                     <p>You add <hi>[Let him not name the Egyptians: for they held Tranſubſtantiation and unbloody Sacrifice, as is manifeſt by their Liturgies; but denyed the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the Son, and held but one will in Chriſt.</hi> Godignus de reb.

You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that they hold Tranſubſtantion. Nor ſhall your bare naming their Liturgy make us believe it. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Liturgy you tell us not where to find, nor I ſuppoſe do you know your ſelves. An <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Liturgy your compilers of the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> have given us, <hi>Tom.</hi> 6. But 1. It hath no mention of Tranſubſtantiation in it, that I can find, but only a

                        <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus,</hi> &amp;c. which we ſay in our Adminiſtration as well as they. 2. And I find that Liturgy ſo contrary to the reports of your own writers concerning the practice of the Ethiopians, (as about the Elevation, Confirmation, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that I muſt needs conclude, that either the Liturgy or much of it is forged, or that the generality of your own Relators of their practice are groſly deceived, and do deceive, (which is not likely, becauſe they are many, and write at ſeveral times, and it is againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.) 3. And as for the <hi>proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the <hi>denyal of two wills in Chriſt,</hi> ſome of your own writers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the former in the Greeks, and the later in many others, is found to be but a verbal difference, the ſame words not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the ſame thing in their eſteem as in ours. 4. However, if they would but become the ſubjects of the Pope, they might be of your Church for all this: and therefore ſeeing they are the ſubjects of Chriſt, we ſhall take both Ethiopians and Copties to be of the ſame Catholick Church with us, for all theſe and many other of their errors.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly ſaith <hi>H. T. [Let him not cite the Armenians: for they hold but one nature in Chriſt, and that his fleſh was changed into his Divinity, and were condemned by the Council of Calcedon.]</hi>

                     <p>

Oth. Friſingenſis</hi> hath the like.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Though they held but one nature in Chriſt, it was not by permixtion or confuſion of the natures, as <hi>Eutiches</hi> imagined, but Conjunction or Coalition: <hi>Nicephor. Hiſt.

And even all this they now deny, as you may ſee in their own Confeſſion publiſhed not eighty years ago, <hi>Artic.</hi> 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. &amp;c. 2. That they change the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt into the Divinity, is your ſlander, and therefore no good argument. 3. That they were condemned by (the five Acts, or in any Act of) the Council of Calcedon, is another untruth: ſure you go much upon truſt, that dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtuff your book with ſuch falſhoods. But the beſt is, your ſimple Papiſts know not but all is true: they muſt believe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55445:95"/>
you, and cannot diſprove you. The Armenians then and we are of one Catholick Church and Religion, notwithſtanding all your forgeries and vain exceptions. I know that one or two petty Councils chid them for not mixing water with wine in the Euchariſt; and more then that, the Canons of the General Council called <hi>Quiniſexti</hi> do condemn the ſame error as theirs, and alſo their deputing the Sons of Prieſts ſucceſsively to the Prieſthood, and not ſhaving their hair: and their eating eggs and cheeſe on Saturdayes and Sundayes in Lent. But 1. We fear not to ſay that we are of the ſame Church with men that err more then not ſhaving, or then eating eggs and cheeſe comes to, or any of this. 2 And remember that this is one of your Reprobate Councils. 3. And one that the third time (when two General Councils before had done it) did <hi>Canon.</hi> 36. give <hi>aequalia privilegia,</hi> equal priviledges to the Seat of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> had. So that I think you will have no mind of this General Council. And if any other have judged them Eutichians, though I renounce that opinion, yet I muſt tell you, that my Charity covereth far greater errors in the Papiſts, or elſe I could not take them for Chriſtians. If the Queſtion had ever been ſtarted in a Council, <hi>whether mans ſoul and body are two Natures or but one,</hi> its ten to one but it would have made another hereſie, and yet perhaps the real difference have been no more then it is now there is no Controverſie about it. But <hi>H.

But yet we may prove the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Religion from thoſe Fathers, and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> of <hi>yours,</hi> and a Succeſsion for thoſe five hundred years: and for the <hi>reſt,</hi> if the whole Chriſtian world had been big
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55445:96"/>
enough for you to ſee, you might have diſcerned our Evidence of a further Succeſsion.</p>
                     <p>He adds [2. <hi>Becauſe thoſe of the ſixth age muſt needs know what was the Religion and Tenets of them that lived in the fifth age, by whom they were inſtructed, and with whom they daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed better then our Proteſtants can now do; who have Proteſted on their ſalvation, that it was the very ſame with theirs, received from them by word of mouth</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Any thing will ſerve for the ſimple that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you. But I pray you tell us whether it were all or ſome of the ſixth age that made this ſolemn Proteſtation that you mention. If all or moſt, or the ten thouſandth man, tell us where we may find that Proteſtation. If a few, they were not the <hi>ſixth age.</hi> 2. If Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> alone was not the ſixth age, tell us where that age did Proteſt on their ſalvation, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by their Fore fathers for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Monarch and Head of the Church (beyond his bare Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of order) 3. What age hath proteſted on their ſalvation, that the Roman prohibition of reading Scriptures, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Euchariſt in both kinds, or other points anon to be mentioned, were the Religion of their Fore-fathers, and ſo from age to age? 4. I pray you tell us where to find this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the tenth age, which <hi>Genebrard, Bellarmine,</hi> and others of your own ſo complain of, as having not learned men, nor any Council, but Apoſtatical Popes and an ignorant wicked Clergy, that ſuſpected a man of Hereſie if he underſtood Greek or Hebrew, and of Magick or Conjuring, if he medled with Mathematicks? 5. It is legible in the writings of the ſixth Age, that they did fetch the doctrine of the fifth age from their <hi>writings,</hi> and not only from word of mouth. What elſe mean the preſervation of thoſe writings and thoſe numerous citations out of them? Nay more; they would not truſt their <hi>memories in a General Council for the Canons of the Church:</hi> no nor for the Canons of the next preceding Council, no nor for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Creed; but had all read and repeated out of the writing before the Council when there was occaſion. And let Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be free to ſpeak truth for a few ſentences, and tell us in good ſadneſs, whether you believe that the Oral Tradition of all the Church did preſerve the Knowledge of <hi>Auguſtines,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55445:96"/>
Epiphanius, Chryſoſtomes,</hi> &amp;c. doctrine, ſo much as their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings do? Is the doctrine of <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Gabriel,</hi> &amp;c. yea the Council of Trent preſerved now more certainly in mens memories, then in writing? If ſo, they have better memories then mine that keep them, and they have better hap then I that light of ſuch keepers. For I can ſcarce tell how to deliver my mind ſo, in any difficult point, but one or other is miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and miſreporting it; and by leaving out or changing a word, perhaps make it another matter: ſo that I am forced to refer them to my writings: and yet there by neglect they miſinterpret me, till I open the book it ſelf to them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Either the Fathers of the fifth age are intelligible in their writings, or not. If they be, then we may underſtand them I hope with induſtry. If they be not, then 1. Much leſs were their tranſient ſpeeches intelligible. 2. And then the writings of the ſixth age be not intelligible, nor of any other: and ſo we cannot underſtand the Council of Trent (as the Papiſts do not that controvert its ſenſe voluminouſly,) nor can we know the Churches judgement.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By your leave, the Roman Corrupters take on them ſo much Power to make new Laws and new Articles of Faith <hi>quoad nos,</hi> by definitions, and to diſpenſe with former Laws, that unleſs they are all Knights of the Poſt, they can never ſwear that they had all that they have from their Fore-fathers.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Well! but all this is the leaſt part of my anſwer. But I grant you that the ſixth age underſtood and retained the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the fifth age, and have delivered it to us. But that there were no Hereticks or corrupters, you will not ſay your ſelves. Well then! the far greateſt part of the Catholick Church did not only receive from the fifth age the ſame Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but alſo kept themſelves from the groſſeſt corruptions of the Pope and his flatterers, that were then but a ſmall part: And thus we ſtick to the Catholick Church ſucceeding to this day, and you to an uſurper that then was newly ſet on the Throne of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Soveraignty. So that your chief Argument treadeth Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in the dirt: becauſe the greater part of the Catholick Church not only in the fifth and ſixth age, but in the ſeventh, eighth, nineth, tenth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and ſixteenth ages, have been aliens or enemies to the Roman univerſal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55445:97"/>
Monarchy: therefore if one age of the Church knew the mind of the former age, better then the Pope did, we may be ſure that the Pope is an uſurper.</p>
                     <p>The third Argument of <hi>H. T.</hi> is, that <hi>the Fathers of the firſt five hundred years taught their tenets: therefore its impoſſible they ſhould be for the Proteſtants. Anſw.</hi> 1. Proteſtants are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, taking the Holy Scriptures for the Rule of their faith. If the Fathers were Chriſtians, they were for the Proteſtants, but its certain they were Chriſtians. If you could prove that they were for ſome of your miſtakes, that would not prove them againſt the Proteſtants in the doctrine of Chriſtianity, and the holy Scriptures; and ſo that we are not their Succeſſors in Chriſtianity, and of the ſame Church, which was it that you ſhould have proved, but forgot the queſtion. And of this we ſhall ſpeak to you more anon.</p>
                     <p>Well! by this time I have ſufficiently ſhewed the ſucceſſion of our Church: and continuation of our Religion from the Apoſtles, and where it was before <hi>Luther,</hi> and given you the Catholick Church inſtead of a dozen or twenty names in each age, which it ſeems will ſatisfie a Papiſt; but yet we have not done with them, but require this following Juſtice at their hands.</p>
                     <p>Seeing the Papiſts do ſo importunately call to us for Catalogues and proof of our ſucceſſion, Reaſon and Juſtice requireth that they firſt give us a Catalogue of Papiſts in all ages, and prove the ſucceſſion of their Roman Catholick Church: which they can never do while they are men.</p>
                     <p>And here I muſt take notice of the deluſory ridiculous Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue wherewith <hi>H. T.</hi> begins his <hi>Manual.</hi> His Argument runs thus <hi>[That is the only true Church of God, which hath had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to this day, (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true:) But the Church now in Communion with the Sea of</hi> Rome <hi>and no other, hath had a continued ſucceſſion from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to this time: therefore, &amp;c.—]</hi> For the proof of the Minor he giveth us a Catalogue. And here note the miſery of poor ſouls that depend on theſe men, that are deluded with ſuch ſtuff, that one would think they ſhould be aſhamed the world ſhould ſee from them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What if his Catalogue were true and proved, would it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55445:97"/>
prove the Excluſion, that <hi>[no other Church:]</hi> had a ſucceſſion? Doth it prove that <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria</hi> had no ſuch ſucceſſion, becauſe the Romaniſts had it? where is there ever a word here under this Argument to prove that excluſive part of his Minor?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And note how he puts that for the Queſtion that is not the Queſtion between us. A fair beginning! The Queſtion is not about <hi>Churches in Communion with you,</hi> but about Churches <hi>in ſubjection to you:</hi> But this is but a pious fraud, to ſave men by decieving them. The Ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had the Church of <hi>Hieruſalem, Corinth, Philippi, Epheſus,</hi> and many a hundred Churches in Communion with her, that never were in ſubjection to her.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And if the Papiſts can but prove themſelves true Chriſtians, I will quickly prove that the Proteſtants are in Communion with them ſtill, as Chriſtians, by the ſame Head (Chriſt) the ſame ſpirit, baptiſm, faith, love, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though not as Papiſts, by ſubjection to the ſame uſurper.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Our queſtion is of the <hi>Univerſal Church:</hi> And this man nameth us twenty or thirty men in an age that he ſaith were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of their Religion: And doth he believe in good ſadneſs that twenty or thirty men are either the univerſall Church, or a ſufficient proof that it was of their mind?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But principally, did this man think that all, or any beſides their ſubjects had their wits ſo far to ſeek, as to believe that the perſons named in his Catalogue were Papiſts, without any proof in the world, but meerly becauſe they are liſted here by <hi>H. T?</hi> Or might he not to as good purpoſe have ſaved his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſaid nothing of them?</p>
                     <p n="6">6 But what need we go any further? we will begin with him at lis firſt Century, and ſo to the ſecond, and if he can prove that Jeſus Chriſt, or the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> or the Apoſtles, or any one of the reſt that he hath named, were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, (much more all of them) I am reſolved preſently to turn Papiſt. But unleſs the man intended to provoke his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to an unreverent laughter about this abuſe of holy things, one would think he ſhould not have named <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that was dead not only before <hi>Rome</hi> had a Church, but alſo before the time that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his Brethren pretend that <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55445:98"/>
his Commiſsion, to be the univerſall Head. And did not this writer know that Proteſtants can give him the ſame names as for them? and if printing them be proof, their proof is as good: If it be not, what proof ſhall we have? Our proof is the Holy Scriptures, written by the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt in thoſe times. Thence we prove that the firſt Church held the ſame belief as we have: yea, though it be not incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us, we will thence prove that the Catholick Church was not then Papiſts. Why elſe do we ſtill appeal to Scriptures, and they refuſe to ſtand to the tryal of it any otherwiſe then as expounded by the Pope, but that we are confident, and they diffident of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We know the Apoſtles faith from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; but the Papiſts will not know it but from the preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They tell you the Apoſtles were for them: but how know we that? Why by the teſtimony of the next age: and where is that teſtimony? Why the third age received it; and how is that proved? Why becauſe the fourth age was of their mind; And how prove you that? Why in the upſhot, becauſe the preſent age is of their mind: Why but moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of the preſent age, are againſt them: yea, but they are none of the Church: It is only the preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Well! but the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> repreſented in a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council may err. I, but the Pope cannot <hi>in Cathedra</hi> and in approving a Councill. So that the ſumm is this: If the Pope himſelf may be judge, the Apoſtles were Papiſts: But if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles may be heard themſelves, they were none.</p>
                     <p>I make no doubt (though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deny it,) but other Churches can prove as good a ſucceſſion as the Romane, as to Biſhops; And poor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> after all is fain to give up this Mark as inſufficient to prove a true Church. <hi>Lib.</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55445:98"/>
that ſhall read theſe words, that, AS SOON AS I SHALL SEE ANY CERTAIN PROOF, BY CATALOGUE OR ANY OTHER WAY, THAT THE CATHOLICK CHURCH, HATH SUC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESSIVELY FROM AGE TO AGE BEEN PAPISTS, I WILL TURN PAPIST WITHOUT DELAY: AND I CHALLENGE THEM TO GIVE US SUCH PROOF IF THEY CAN.</p>
                     <p>Nay if they will prove that in the firſt age alone, or the ſecond, or third alone, the Catholick Church were Papiſts, I am am reſolved to turn Papiſt: Nay I am moſt confident they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that in any one age to this day, the Catholick Church were Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>And as to <hi>H. Ts.</hi> Catalogue, I return him further anſwer, that no one named by him in the firſt age had any one of their errors: And no one named by him to the year four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, (I may add, to the year ſix hundred, if his falſe catalogue be truly corrected) was a Papiſt; ſo well hath he proved the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But for the plainer opening of this, I ſhall add the diſcuſſion of another of their deceits.</p>

ANother notable fraud of the Papiſts, is, <hi>to confound all their own errors and corruptions together, and then to inſtance in ſome of thoſe errors that are common to them with ſome others, and to omit the Eſſentiall parts of Popery:</hi> And ſo they would make the world believe, that if they prove the Antiquity of any points in difference between them and us, they do thereby prove the antiquity of Popery (and ſo of the ſucceſſion) And ſo they would make our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion alſo Eſſentially to conſiſt in every inferiour difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
                     <p>Suffer them not therefore thus to juggle in the dark, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Eſſentials of Popery, or the main diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and us, and the other errors, which are not proper to them alone.</p>

Thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> opens his jugling <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 9. where he pleadeth Antiquity of Doctrine as a Note of the true Church: And (ſaith he) <hi>Jam duobus modis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Two wayes we may by this Mark prove our Church.</hi> 1. <hi>By ſhewing the ſentences of the Ancients, by which we confirm all our tenets, and refute our adverſaries. But this way</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is moſt prolix, and obnoxious to many calumnies and objections.</hi> (Mark Papiſts, and take heed of appealing to Antiquity.) <hi>The other way</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſhorter and ſurer, by ſhewing firſt from the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the adverſaries, that our tenents are the doctrine of all the antients,</hi> &amp;c.] And indeed if the weakneſs or raſhneſs of any Proteſtants be the Papiſts ſtrength, its time for us to be more prudent: but if it be the Papiſts unhappineſs that cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the antients in the antients, but only from the Pope or the Proteſtants, the Fathers are faln into the hands of Babies as well as the Scriptures; and the Proteſtants have too little wit if they will join with the Pope in an abuſive interpreting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the Papiſts. And thus <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proceeds to cite <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the Centuriſts, as giving them the Fathers. But wherein? Forſooth in the point of <hi>Free-will, Limbus, Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, Lent, Lay baptiſm in neceſsity,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore by our Confeſsions Antiquity is for the Papiſts. And this is their ſhorteſt and ſureſt way. (The more fools we then.) Is not here great diffidence in the Fathers, when they have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our ſayings then their writings?</p>
                     <p>But this jugling will not ſerve the turn. Take up the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials of Popery, and prove a Catholick ſucceſsion of them, and you ſhall win the day. In Explication of my former profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I here again ſolemnly promiſe and proteſt, that [WHEN EVER I SEE A VALID PROOF OF A CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOLICK SUCCESSION OF THESE FOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOWING POINTS, I WILL PRESENTLY TURN PAPIST: OR OF ANY ONE OF THEM, I WILL TAKE UP THAT ONE.] And I provoke the Papiſts that boaſt of Tradition, Succeſsion and Antiquity, to do this if they are able.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let them prove a Catholick Succeſsion, or continuation of this point, that <hi>The Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>is appointed by Chriſt to be the univerſall Monarch, Soveraign, Governour, Head of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

But I am reſolved ſo to receive many of them as they can prove a Catholick ſucceſſion of; that is, that they were in all ages the Doctrine of the Univerſal Church: And I crave the charity of ſuch a proof from ſome Papiſt or other, if they have any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in them; and that they will no longer keep univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their purſes.</p>

And when hath done, then let him boaſt of his Catalogue. Till they will perform this task, let them never more for ſhame call to us for Catalogues or proof of ſucceſſion. But if they are ſo unkind that they will not give us any proof of ſuch a Catholick ſucceſſion of Popery, we ſhall be ready to ſupererogate, and give them full proof of the Negative, <hi>[That there hath been no ſuch ſucceſſion of theſe thirty two points,]</hi> as ſoon as we can perceive that they will ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly entertain it: though indeed it hath been often done already.</p>
                     <p>But certainly it belongeth to them that ſuperinduce more Articles of Faith, to prove the continuation of their own Articles through all ages; of which anon.</p>
                     <p>Well! but one of theſe Articles at leaſt <hi>(the Popes Soveraignty) H. T.</hi> will prove ſucceſſively, if you will be credulous enough. In the firſt age he proves it from <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>God choſe</hi> Peter <hi>to convert</hi> Cornelius <hi>and his company: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope is the Univerſall Monarch.</hi> Are you not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by this admirable argument? But he forgot that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Raguſius (in Concil.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55445:101"/>
talks of the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Calcedon, an.</hi> 400. &amp; 451. leſt the firſt age have but a blank page.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond age he hath nothing but the names of a few that never dreamt of Popery, and a Canon (which you muſt believe was the Apoſtles) <hi>that Prieſts muſt communicate.</hi> Of which we are well content.</p>
                     <p>In the third Age he nameth fifteen Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom the laſt was depoſed for offering incenſe to <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, &amp;c.</hi> But not a ſyllable to prove that one of theſe Biſhops was the univerſal Monarch: Much leſs that the Catholick Church was for ſuch Monarchy. But to excuſe the matter, he tells you, that <hi>the ſecond and third Age produced no Councils</hi> (the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers then are the Papiſts that have found us Councils then) and ſo you have no Catholick ſucceſſion proved. <hi>Yea, but</hi> he ſaith, <hi>they have ſucceſſions of Popes, Martyrs and Confeſſors, which is ſufficient for their purpoſes.</hi> See the ſtrength of Popery! Any thing is ſufficient for your purpoſes, it ſeems. <hi>Rome</hi> had Biſhops, therefore they were the Univerſal Rulers of the Church: A ſtrong conſequence! <hi>Rome</hi> had Martyrs and Confeſſors: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the Miſtris of all Churches. Who can reſiſt theſe arguments? But why did you not prove that your Confeſſors and Martyrs ſuffered for atteſting the Popes Soveraignty! If they ſuffered but for Chriſtianity, that will prove them but Chriſtians, and not Papiſts. Thus you ſee to the confuſion of the Papiſts, that they have nothing to ſhew for the ſucceſſion or antiquity of Popery for the three firſt Ages. Yea worſe then nothing: For here he comes in with ſome of the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals forſooth of ſome of their Biſhops. Decretals unknown, till a while ago in the world, brought out by <hi>Iſidore Mercator:</hi> but with ſo little cunning as left them naked to the ſhame of the world; the falſhood of them being out of themſelves fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by <hi>Blondell, Reignolds,</hi> and many more, and confeſſed by ſome of themſelves. Here you ſee the firſt foundation of Papal ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; even a bundle of fictions, lately fetcht from whence they pleaſe to cheat the ignorant part of the world.</p>
                     <p>But in the fourth and fifth ages <hi>H. T.</hi> doth make us amends for his want of proof from the three firſt. But ſuppoſe he do, whats that to a ſucceſſion, while the three firſt ages are ſtrangers to Popery? Well! but lets hear what he hath at laſt. His firſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55445:101"/>
proof (after a few ſilent names) is from <hi>the Council of Nice;</hi> And what ſaith that? why 1. <hi>It defined that the Son of God is conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall to his Father, and true God</hi> And whats that to Popery? 2 <hi>But it defined the Popes Soveraignty:</hi> But how prove you that? Why it is in the thirty ninth Arab. Canon. O what Conſciences have thoſe men that dare thus abuſe and cheat the ignorant! As if the Canons of the firſt General Council had never been known to the world, till the other day that <hi>Alphonſus Piſanus</hi> a Jeſuite publiſheth them out of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> and I know not what Arabick book. Theſe men that can make both Councils and Canons at their pleaſure above a thouſand years after the ſuppoſed time of their exiſtence, do never need to want authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And indeed this is a cheaper way of Canon-making in a corner, then to trouble all the Biſhops in the world with a great deal of coſt and travail to make them. But if this be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the building is anſwerable. Their Biſhop <hi>Zoſimus</hi> had not been acquainted with theſe new Articles of an old Council, when he put his trick upon the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where for the advancement of his power (though not to an univerſall Monarchy, yet to a preparative degree) he layeth his claim from the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as ſaying <hi>[Placuit ut ſi Epiſcopus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatus fuerit,</hi> &amp;c.] which was that <hi>If an ejected Biſhop appeal to</hi> Rome, <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>appoint ſome of the next province to judge; or if yet he deſtre his cauſe to be heard, the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall appoint a Presbyter his Legate,</hi> &amp;c.] In this Council were 217. Biſhops, <hi>Aurelius</hi> being preſident, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being one. They told the Pope that they would yield to him till the true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> were ſearched; for thoſe that they had ſeen had none of them thoſe words in, that <hi>Zoſimus</hi> alledged. Hereupon they ſend abroad to the Churches of the Eaſt, to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. for the ancient Canons. From hence they received ſeveral copies, which all agreed; but none of them had either <hi>Zoſimus</hi> forgery in; nor the forged clauſe which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt have in; much leſs the eighty Canons of <hi>Piſanus</hi> the Jeſuite, or this one which <hi>H. T.</hi> doth found his ſucceſſion on, but only the twenty Canons there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which have not a word for the Popes Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>And here note 1. That <hi>Zoſimus</hi> knew not then of <hi>Piſanus</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, or elſe he would have alledged them; nor yet of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:55445:102"/>
new part of a Canon for the Primacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That <hi>Zoſimus</hi> himſelf had not the faith, the wit or the memory, to plead either Scripture, Apoſtolical Inſtitution, or Tradition, for his priviledge, but only a falſe Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice:</hi> as looking no higher it ſeems for his authority. 3. How early the Roman Biſhops begun both to aſpire, and make uſe of forgeries to accompliſh it. 4. That there was no ſuch Apoſtolick or Church Tradition for this Roman power, as our Maſters of Tradition now plead for; which all the Catholick Church muſt know. For the whole Council, with all the Churches of <hi>Conſtantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. that is, in a manner all ſave <hi>Rome</hi> were ignorant of that which <hi>Zoſimus</hi> would have had them believe, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>H. T.</hi> would have us to believe. 5. Note alſo how little the Church then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Popes infallibility. 6. Yea Note, how upon the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſeveral Copies of the Nicene Canons, they modeſtly convicted <hi>Zoſimus</hi> of falſhood: And how the Council reſolved againſt his uſurpation. See in the African Councils, the Epiſtle of <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Atticus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and the Epiſtles of the Council to <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine.</hi> In their Epiſtle to <hi>Boniface</hi> before they had received their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from other Churches about the Nicene Canons, they tell him that <hi>they believed they ſhould not ſuffer that</hi> Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy <hi>[non ſumus iſtum typhum paſſuri]</hi> But to <hi>Celeſtine</hi> they conclude more plainly, though modeſtly <hi>[Presbyterorum quo<expan>

                     <p>Note here 1. That this Council lookt no higher for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope and other Metropolitans, then to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and thought it a good argument, that the Pope had no ſuch power, becauſe no Council had ſo ſubjected the African Church: And therefore they never dreamt that Chriſt or the Apoſtles had given it him. 2. Note that they evince the Nullity of his pretended power out of the Nicene Council. 3. Note that they took him not to be above a Council, having power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with its Canons. 4. Note that by the Nicene Council, not ſome, but all buſineſs muſt be ended where they begin, and this Council ſo interpreted them: and therefore there's no appeals to the Pope. 5. And that he that ſaith otherwiſe unjuſtly chargeth the Holy Ghoſt to be wanting to the Church. 6. That this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:55445:103"/>
is to be held faſt. 7. That they took it for a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe all might appeal to a provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or general Council. 8. Note that they thought it a thing not to be imagined by a man, that God ſhould give his Spirit to any one man, even to the Pope, to enable him to try and judge, and deny it to a Council, General or Provincial. This ſeemed to them a thing that none ſhould imagine, ſo that they little dreamt of the Roman infallibility or power of Judging all the world. 9. Note alſo that they thought the Pope to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this univerſal judgement, were it but by diſtance, and the natural impediments of age, ſex, and many the like that muſt needs hinder the neceſſary witneſſes from ſuch a voyage or journey. So that they give an Argument from Natural neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity againſt the Popes pretended Soveraignty and judgement. 10. Note alſo that they plainly make ſuch judgements to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid for want of neceſſary witneſs and means of proſecution. 11. And whereas the Pope might object that he could prevent all this by his Legates, they flatly reject that too, and ſay they find no ſuch thing Conſtituted by any Synod: ſo that they both rejected the Popes trying and judging by Legates in other Metropoſitans jurisdiction; and they took it for a ſufficient ground to do ſo, that there was no Council had ſo conſtituted; little dreaming of a Scripture conſtitution, or Apoſtolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And if the Pope may neither judge them by himſelf nor his Legates, he may ſit ſtill. 12. Next they convince the Roman Biſhop of ſending them a falſe Canon of the Nicene Council. 13. And they ſhew us here what way the Pope then took to get and keep his Power: even by ſending to the ſecular commanders of the Provinces, (in whom they had ſpecial intereſt by their reſidence at <hi>Rome,)</hi> to execute their wills by force. 14. And note how the Council plainly accuſeth them for this, of introducing ſecular Arrogancy into Chriſts Church, that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loveth ſimplicity and humility and light. 15. And note how plainly they require the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to do ſo no more. 16. And how plainly they tell him that <hi>Fauſtinus</hi> his ſtay any longer in <hi>Africa</hi> will not ſtand with that honeſty and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> which is neceſſary to the ſafety of brotherly charity.</p>
                     <p>I give you but the plain paſſages of the Council as they lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

And now let <hi>Binnius</hi> and his brethren go make women and children believe that <hi>it was not Appeals to</hi> Rome, <hi>but a trouble ſome manner of tryal</hi> that the Council was againſt.

And let him perſwade ideots and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards that the Catholick Church in the fourth and fifth ages was for the univerſal Government of the Pope. And ſo I proceed to his next proof.</p>
                     <p>Saith H. T. <hi>[The firſt</hi> Conſtantinop. <hi>Council decreed the Biſhop of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>to be chief next the Biſhop of</hi> Rome.]</p>

You ſee then that it was grounded on a ſecular reaſon; for ſo ſaith the Canon <hi>[becauſe it is new Rome.]</hi> 3. You ſee then that the Popes Primacy was but hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and gave him no univerſal Government. For the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy here granted to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> gave them no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over <hi>Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Yea expreſly the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Canon limits all Biſhops without exception to their own Dioceſs.

And the Council, though ſpecially moved by his concurrence to extoll <hi>Celeſtine</hi> to the higheſt, yet 1. Never ſpake a word of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power or Soveraignty, but only his concent: And when they mention the Roman Church, it is only their concent which they predicate. 2.

By <hi>[Univerſal Archbiſhop]</hi> its plain that they meant no more then the <hi>chief in dignity and order of all Archbiſhops;</hi> and not <hi>the Governour of all.</hi> 3. I have ſhewed you before that this very Council in its Canons not only give the Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> equal priviledges with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay that <hi>Rome received this primacy of order</hi> à patribus, <hi>from a Council, becauſe it was</hi> Sedes Imperii, <hi>the ſeat of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> I thought I had given you enough of this Council before. Sure I am when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> comes to this Canon, he hath nothing to ſay for his cauſe, but plainly to charge this famous fourth General Council with lying or falſhood, and to ſay, that the Pope approved not this Canon. But approved or not approved, if this was the Catholick Church repreſentative, ſure I am that their teſtimony is valid to prove that there was then no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reception of the Roman Monarchy as of God, but contrarily a meer primacy of Dignity and Honour given it newly by men.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixth age he had not one Council to pretend it ſeems for the Roman Soveraignty, for he cites none, but about other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (of which anon.)</p>
                     <p>In the ſeventh age (which he calls the ſixth) though then the Soveraignty was claimed by <hi>Boniface,</hi> he citeth no Council for it niether.</p>
                     <p>In the eighth age (from the year ſeven hundred) he cites the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as approving an Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> wherein he ſaith that the <hi>Roman Church is the Head of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.] Anſw.</hi> 1. But whether <hi>Adrian</hi> himſelf by the Head meant the <hi>chief in Dignity,</hi> or the <hi>Governour of all,</hi> is a great doubt. 2. But whatever he meant, the Synods approving his Epiſtle for <hi>Images,</hi> is no proof that they approved every word in it. 3. Yea <hi>Tharaſius</hi> ſeems to imply the contrary, calling him only, <hi>Veteris Romae primas &amp; teſtatorum principum ſucceſſor;</hi> as if his Sea
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55445:104"/>
had the Priviledge only of being the Primate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not the Ruler of the world. 4. But if this Council did (as it did not) openly own the Papal Soveraignty, it had been no great honour to him: For as in their decrees for Images they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted two Councils at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and that at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> contradicteth them; ſo might they as well contradict the Church in this: Even as they defined <hi>Angels to be corporeal,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Laterane</hi> afterward contradicted. But the plain truth is, it was the ſcope of <hi>Adrians</hi> Epiſtle as for Images, which they expreſſed themſelves to approve. And that their Image-worſhip it ſelf hath no Catholick ſucceſſion, me thinks they ſhould eaſily grant, conſidering not only, 1. That there is nothing in the firſt ages for them. 2. And that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and many before him ſpeak expreſly againſt it. 3. But ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that there have been more General Councils of thoſe ages againſt them then for them, and that before this of Nice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed for them, the repreſentative Catholick Church (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſtill the Pope be the Catholick Church) did condemn them.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe by this time you will think it needleſs for me to follow <hi>H. T.</hi> any further in his Catalogue. I am content that any impartial ſober perſon judge, whether here be a ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proof of a Catholick ſucceſſion of the <hi>Papal Soveraignty,</hi> when through ſo many ages, they bring not a word for any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at all; much leſs that it was owned by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: and leaſt of all that all the reſt of Popery was ſo owned.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But at leaſt ſome other points of Popery are proved by</hi> H. T. <hi>to have ſuch a ſucceſſion. Anſw.</hi> Peruſe his proofs and freely judge. Two of the thirty two Articles which I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaks to: The one is that <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons ſhould abſtain from their Wives, or be degraded.]</hi> But 1. The Council which he cites for this, is but a Provincial Council in <hi>Spain</hi> in the fifth Age: and whats this to Catholick ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? 2. The Evidences for the Antiquity of Prieſts marriages are ſo clear and numerous, that I will not thank any of them to confeſs their doctrine a Novelty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Have we not power to lead about a Siſter, a Wife as well as other Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and</hi> Cephas? I hope they will not deny
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55445:105"/>
that <hi>Peter</hi> had a Wife? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 4. <hi>A Biſhop muſt be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the husband of one Wife—One that ruleth well his own houſe, having his children in ſubjection with all gravity.</hi> ver. 12. <hi>Let the Deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children, and their own houſes well,</hi> Tit. 1. 7. <hi>If any be blameleſs, the husband of one Wife, having faithfull children,—</hi>The Antient Canons called the Apoſtles, ſay, <hi>Can.</hi> 6. <hi>Let not a Biſhop or Presbyter put away his own Wife on pretence of Religion. And if he reject her, let him be excommunicated: but if he perſevere, let him be depoſed.]</hi> Let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> perſwade thoſe that will believe him, that this Canon ſpeaks but of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them maintenance: Canons as well as Scripture are unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to theſe men. The Canons at <hi>Trull.</hi> of the fifth and ſixth Council, do expreſly expound this Apoſtolick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non as I do here: and they profeſs it was the Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion then to the Biſhops to marry: and they themſelves forbid any to ſeparate Prieſts from their Wives, and profeſſedly oppoſe the Roman Church in it, <hi>Can.</hi> 12, 13.

Our enquiry is of Catholick Tradition and ſucceſſion, and not of the Popes opinion. But its eaſie to bring much more for this.</p>
                     <p>Another point that <hi>H.

                        <p>AND now having ſhewed you that Papiſts cannot prove any Catholick Succeſſion, or Continuation, or Tradition of their Religion, let us conſider of their ſilly ſhift, by inſtancing in ſome by-points common to them with others. Of which I ſhall ſay the leſs becauſe I have ſpoke to it already in my <hi>Safe Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And before I mention any particulars, remember that I have proved before that ignorance or difference about many points not eſſential to Chriſtianity, may conſiſt with our being of one Religion and Catholick Church, and therefore ſuch differences are nothing to the point of ſucceſſion of the Catholick Church or Religion. This is plain to any reaſonable man. And that the Papiſts may ſee that for their parts they have nothing to ſay againſt it, I ſhall add to what is ſaid, that they tolerate or plead for the toleration of greater differences among themſelves, which yet they affirm to conſiſt with the unity of faith. I will now give you but an inſtance or two.</p>
                        <p>The Jeſuits maintain, that if a man do but believe in their Pope and Church as infallible, he may (not only as ſome ſay, be ignorant of ſome Article of the Creed it ſelf, and yet be a true Catholick, yea and be ſaved, but alſo) believe a falſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as from God and the Church: The former is commonly taught not only by ſuch as <hi>Suarez,</hi> that ſay the Article of Chriſts Deſcent into Hell is not to all of Neceſſity to Salvation, but by many others in the Doctrine of Implicite faith. The later clauſe you may ſee among others in <hi>Franc. Albertinus</hi> the Jeſuite, <hi>Corollar. pag.</hi> 250. where his objectors put this caſe <hi>[Suppoſe twenty Biſhops preach to a countrey man a falſe Article, as if it were ſpoken by God and the Church: that propoſal of the twenty Biſhops is ſo ſufficient, that the Countrey man prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formeth an evident practical judgement, and morally certain,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55445:106"/>
to believe with a ſpeculative aſſent the Article propoſed by the twenty Biſhops, for the Authority of God as the formal reaſon. Three abſurdities ſeem hence to follow.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Countrey man ſhould be obliged under mortall ſin, to believe the twenty Biſhops, and ſo the precept of faith ſhould bind to believe a falſhood.</hi> 2. <hi>The Countrey man ſhould be in Gods Grace without faith. In Grace, becauſe he commits no mortal ſin, yea he obeys the command of believing: Yet without faith, becauſe he believes a falſhood op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to faith, and ſo loſeth faith.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſhould concur to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive—To the firſt</hi> Albertinus <hi>anſwereth that its no Abſurdity that the command of faith do oblige to believe a falſhood, it being not</hi> per ſe, <hi>but</hi> per accidens. To the ſecond he ſaith, that the <hi>Countrey man doth not loſe his grace or faith, becauſe the falſhood believed is not formally oppoſite to the true faith (but materially)—</hi>Here you ſee that a man may hold an Article oppoſite to the faith materially, and yet not only be a true Chriſtian in grace and faith, but alſo in ſo doing obey by accident the command of believing, ſo be it he believe in their Church. And if that be ſo, with what face can theſe men ſay, that our Church or Religion is new, or not the ſame with the Greeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when we have the ſame formal Object of faith, and differ in no Eſſential Material point? See here their lubricity and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
                        <p>One Inſtance more: The ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> that decreed for Image-Worſhip, doth yet expreſly decree that <hi>Latria, Divine worſhip is to be given only to God; Thomas Aquinas ſum.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 25. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. purpoſely maintaineth that <hi>Latria, Divine Worſhip is to be given to the Image of Chriſt, and to the Croſs that he dyed on; and to the ſign of that Croſs.</hi> Here is an Article of their faith expreſly contradicted: And yet <hi>Aquinas</hi> is a member of their Church; And if any ſay, he is no member, its proved paſt doubt, for the Pope hath Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized him for a Saint: So that now it is a part of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take him for a true believer: And <hi>Albertinus</hi> hath (as he thinks) proved, that though in many other matters of fact the Pope be fallible, yet in the Canonizing of Saints he is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, becauſe of ſome promiſe of Gods ſpeciall aſsiſtance (if one knew where to find it.) Abundance of ſuch Inſtances might be brought that prove, that the <hi>Papiſts own men as true believers,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55445:106"/>
that deny or contradict Articles of their faith.</hi> But what need we more, then that <hi>France</hi> and thouſands elſwhere are yet members of their Church, that deny the <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Florentine</hi> definition for the Popes Supremacy above a General Council? and when moſt Papiſts hold that Angels are incorporeal, contrary to the definition of the ſaid ſecond Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> And therefore by their own law, nay much more, we may well ſay that thoſe were of our Religion that differed from us in nothing that is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed or our eſteem Eſſential to the faith. Now to a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Papiſts tell us that [Fulk <hi>confeſſeth that</hi> Hierom, Auſtin, Ambroſe, <hi>&amp;c. held the invocation of Saints]</hi> H. T. p. 49. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If any hold that they ſhould deſire the departed Saints to pray for them, as they do the living, we have reaſon enough to take it for their error, but its no proof that they are not of the ſame Church and Religion with us: As long as they give no part of that adoration or honour to Saints which is proper to God the Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt, it is not inconſiſtent with true Faith and Chriſtianity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But yet we muſt tell you that the Primitive Church was unacquainted with the Romiſh prayer to Saints. Till the end of the fourth Century they are not able to prove that ever three men (if any one) were for any prayer to the Dead at all, except ſuch a conditional ſpeech in an Oration as <hi>Greg. Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> hath <hi>[If holy ſouls have any care or feeling of ſuch things as theſe, receive this Oration] Orat.</hi> 11. I intreat the Reader that needeth information of the way of Antiquity in this point, to read Biſhop <hi>Uſhers</hi> Anſwer to the Jeſuite on this point, <hi>page</hi> 418, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where he ſaith that <hi>[for nine parts of the firſt four hundred years, he dare be bold to ſay that the Jeſuite is not able to produce ſo much as one true teſtimony out of any Father whereby it may appear that any account at all was made of it]</hi> Where he citeth the full expreſs words of the Fathers of thoſe firſt ages againſt praying to Saints, as <hi>Origen in Jus. Hom.</hi> 16. And in <hi>Rom. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And <hi>Contr.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55445:107"/>
3. And when Prayer to the dead did come in, how exceedingly it differed from the Romiſh Prayers to the dead, I pray you read there in the ſame Author. 4. And alſo of thoſe Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Devotions offered by the Papiſts to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> I deſire you to read in the ſame Author, and Place, enough to make a Chriſtian tremble, and which for my part I am not able to excuſe from horrid Blaſphemy or Idolatry, though I am willing to put the beſt interpretation on their words that reaſon will allow.</p>
                        <p n="5">5.

But abundance of the chief Doctors of the Church for divers Ages were of opinion that the Saints are not admitted into Heaven to the clear ſight of God before the day of Judgement (as moſt of the Eaſtern Churches do to this day) therefore they could not be for the Popiſh Prayer to Saints.</p>
                        <p>And here again obſerve, that men may be of the ſame faith and Church with us, that differ and err in as great a matter as this. The Council of <hi>Florence</hi> hath now defined it, that <hi>depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls are admitted into Heaven to the clear ſight of God:</hi> And yet <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Franciſ.

                        <p>Now as all theſe muſt needs be againſt the Popiſh Invocation of Saints, ſo they were againſt that which is now determined to be <hi>de fide;</hi> Whence I gather (on the by) 1. That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh faith increaſeth, and is not the ſame as heretofore. 2. That they had not this Article by Tradition from any of theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or from the Apoſtles by them (unleſs from the Scriptures.) 3. That men that err in ſuch points as are now defined by Councils to be <hi>de fide,</hi> are yet accounted by Papiſts to be of their Church and faith: And therefore they may be of ours,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55445:107"/>
notwithſtanding ſuch errours as this in hand. 4. And note alſo by this taſt, whether the Papiſts be not a perjured generation, that ſwear <hi>not to expound Scripture but according to the unanimous conſent of the Fathers.</hi>

Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> hath copiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that they were Saints, ſuppoſed to be in Heaven or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and not in Purgatory, that were then prayed for: and therefore that it was not the Popiſh praying for tormented ſouls that was then practiſed: And therefore their prayers
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55445:108"/>
then were beſides Commemorations and Thankſgivings, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning of all thoſe following Mercies for them which are not to be received till the reſurrection: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf proving that <hi>though we were certain that the bleſſed ſouls ſhall have a raiſed glorified body, and be juſtified in the laſt Judgement, yet may it be prayed for, becauſe it is yet future.</hi> Now we are far from being of another Church or Religion then thoſe that hold ſuch an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this. Saith <hi>Uſher pag.</hi> 224. when he had cited many teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <hi>[In theſe and other prayers of the like kind, we may deſcry evident footſteps of the primary intention of the Church in her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for the dead: which was that the whole man (not the ſoul ſeparated only) might receive publick remiſſion of ſins, and a ſolemn acquittal in the judgement of that great day; and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both a full eſcape from all the Conſequences of ſin (the laſt enemy being now deſtroyed, and death ſwallowed up in victory) and a perfect conſummation of bliſs and happineſs: all which are comprized in that ſhort prayer of</hi> S. Paul <hi>for</hi> Oneſiphorus <hi>(though made for him while he was alive) [The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day] Yea, divers prayers for the dead of that kind are ſtill retained in the Roman offices; of which the great Spaniſh Doctor</hi> John Medina <hi>thus writeth; Although I have read many prayers for the faithfull deceaſed, which are contained in the Roman Miſſal, yet have I read in none of them that the Church doth petition, that they may more quickly be freed from pains: but I have read that in ſome of them petition is made, that they may be freed from everlaſting pains.] Again there be other prayers</hi> (ſaith Medina) <hi>wherein petition is made, that God would raiſe the ſouls of the dead in their bodies unto bliſs at the day of judgement.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſee then, that our Queſtion is not whether the dead may be prayed for: but what prayers may be made for them. And therefore to find that about three hundred years after Chriſt (more or leſs) men begun to pray for the dead, is no proof that they were not of our Church or Religion; or that therefore we want ſucceſſion. It was not a praying to be ſooner out of Purgatory that then was uſed, as Papiſts do, but a Praying for the mercies promiſed at the Reſurrection: And thus we think it lawfull to pray for the dead; were it not for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55445:109"/>
the accidental evil that might follow with them that will miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and abuſe it.</p>
                        <p>And its further to be noted, that as <hi>Pegna, Stapleton</hi> and others confeſs, the Fathers, Greek and Latine, before mentioned, did believe that men had not their perfect Joyes till the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore they had the far ſtronger motive to pray for the dead. And if Proteſtants had not been partly of this mind (ſave only that we put not the ſoul into hidden recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, nor anywhere but with Chriſt) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had not found ſo much occaſion of that unworthy calumny againſt <hi>Calvin</hi> for the words cited by him in his <hi>Inſtit.</hi> as if he denyed the beatifical viſion, if not the immortality of the ſoul: Even becauſe he took not <hi>our bliſs to be perfect till the Reſurrection, but ſomewhat ſhort of what we ſhall then be.</hi> Now ſeeing the Fathers were ſo commonly of that mind, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians</hi> are ſtill of that mind, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are of that mind, you may ſee that neither in that nor the point of praying for the dead as uſed by the ancients, is our diſtance ſo great as to weaken the proof of our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or make us to be of two Churches or Religions.</p>
                        <p>And here you may ſee the differences between the Prayers for the dead which are uſed by the Papiſts, and by the Eaſtern Churches to this day. And yet if upon private unſound opinions any ſhould go ſomewhat further in this point, it followeth not that ſuch error changeth the faith. I deſire the Reader that would have a fuller ſight of the face of Antiquity in this point, to read Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> of it in the forementioned Anſwer to the Jeſuite.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another point that they much challenge us about, is, <hi>The Veneration or Adoration of Images, Reliques, and the Croſs,</hi> to which I may join, <hi>peregrinations to places eſteemed by them to be of eminent holineſs.</hi> Concerning <hi>Peregrinations,</hi> you may ſee by a plain Epiſtle of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> (in the end of his printed works, but in the midſt of a <hi>M. S.</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> Library) written purpoſely againſt going on Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> what is to be thought of this. He adviſeth even the retired Monaſticks even in thoſe Countreyes that were near <hi>Judaea,</hi> to forbear ſuch Pilgrimages as dangerous and unneceſſary, and not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55445:109"/>
in the Scripture. The Papiſts did as long as they could perſwade the world that this Epiſtle was none of <hi>Gregories,</hi> and when they were made aſhamed of that, they would expound it as prohibiting Pilgrimages to none but the Monaſticks: And ſure if it ſhould be forbidden them, then much more ſhould others be forbidden, that have not the leiſure, and pretend not to the devotions which theſe pretend to. Read but the Epiſtle it ſelf without either <hi>Molinaeus</hi> his notes on our ſide, or <hi>Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> frivilous anſwers, and judge as thou ſeeſt cauſe.</p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Images,</hi> we allow the Hiſtorical uſe of them, and the ſetting them up in Churches the <hi>Lutherans</hi> allow, and we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like it only as dangerous and a needleſs ſnare, but take not our ſelves to be of another Church or Religion from thoſe that are otherwiſe minded: No nor from thoſe that Reverence them as they reſpect the perſons whom they ſignifie. But its one thing to <hi>uſe Images,</hi> and another thing to <hi>uſe them Popiſhly,</hi> which is to make them <hi>mediate objects of Divine worſhip,</hi> yea to worſhip the very <hi>Image it ſelf, and the Croſs and the ſign of the Croſs with the ſame worſhip as we do him that is ſignified by them:</hi> So that we confidently affirm, 1. That the Primitive Church did make no uſe of Images at all in the worſhip of God; no nor endure them in the place of Worſhip. 2. That when they were firſt brought in, the Popiſh uſe of them was ſtill renounced and deteſted. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus Protreptic. ad Gent.</hi> ſaith that <hi>[We are plainly forbidden to uſe that deceitfull Art]</hi> (of painting or image-making)—And <hi>[We have no ſenſible Image made of any ſenſible matter, but ſuch an Image as is to be conceived with the underſtanding] Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Celſus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>page</hi> 373, 384, 386. 387. is large and plain againſt this uſe of Images, as the Proteſtants are.

If Images be improperly only adored, then they are not to be adored ſimply and abſolutely; which is manifeſt Hereſie.

                        <p>But you can agree to leave out the ſecond commandment leſt the very words ſhould deter the people from Image worſhip; and to make an irrational diviſion of the tenth to blind their eyes. And yet you cry up the Teſtimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when you are fain to hide one of the ten commandments, ſo that thouſands of your poor ſeduced followers, know not that there is ſuch a thing. No wonder if you caſt away <hi>Gregory Nyſſen's</hi> Epiſtle againſt <hi>Pilgrimages;</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words (in the end of his Epiſtle to <hi>Johan. Heroſol.)</hi> againſt Images; and if <hi>Vaſquez</hi> (in 3 <hi>Thom. diſp.</hi> 105. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) contrary to the plain words do fain that it <hi>was the Image of a prophane or common man that</hi> Epiphanius <hi>puld down; and</hi> Al.

Fair fall <hi>Vaſquez</hi> that plainly confeſſeth, that <hi>indeed the Scripture doth forbid not only the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of an Image for God, but alſo the worſhiping of the true God in an Image: but</hi> ſaith <hi>that this commandment is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and therefore under the Goſpel we may do otherwiſe.

                        <p>But of this point I ſhall ſay no more now but this. 1. Many Chriſtian Churches do reject Images from their Churches and worſhip as well as Proteſtants. 2. More reject ſtatues that reject not pictures. 3. Many that keep them, worſhip not them, nor God in them, or by them, as by a mediate object. 4. General Councils have been againſt Images, that want nothing but the pleaſure of the Pope to make them of as good authority as the Council that was for them. 5. That Council that was for them <hi>(Nice</hi> 2.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Schoolmen and Pope <hi>Clement</hi> himſelf as Hereticks,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55445:112"/>
for worſhiping them, or the Croſs with Divine worſhip. 6. I again urge any Papiſt <hi>to anſwer Dallaeus</hi> book rationally that can. 7. To ſpare me the labour of ſaying more of the judgement of the ancient Catholick Church againſt the Popiſh uſe of Images, I deſire the Reader to peruſe what <hi>Caſſander</hi> an honeſt Papiſt hath written to that end, <hi>Conſultat. de Imag. et ſimulac.</hi> who begins thus <hi>[Ad Imagines vero ſanctorum quod attinet, certum eſt, initio praedicati Evangelii aliquanto tempore inter Chriſtianos, praeſertim in eccleſiis, imaginum uſum non fuiſſe, ut ex Clemente &amp; Arnobio patet: Tandem picturas in eccleſiam admiſſas ut rerum geſtarum hiſtoriam exprimentes &amp;c.—]</hi> And he produceth abundance from antiquity againſt the preſent Popiſh uſe of them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Another point in which the Papiſts pretend to better Countenance from Antiquity then we, is the point of <hi>the Corporal preſence with Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> But of this there is ſo much ſaid by multitudes of our Divines, that I ſhall now ſay no more, but deſire the ſtudious to Read at leaſt Biſhop <hi>Uſhers</hi> Anſw. to the Jeſuite of it, and <hi>Edmundus Abertinus de Euchariſtia:</hi> a Treatiſe ſo full of evidence from Scripture, Reaſon, and the judgement of the Fathers, that I boldly challenge all the Papiſts in the world to give a tolerable anſwer to it, that is a better then that is given.</p>
                        <p>When we have thus ſhewed them the ſtream of Antiquity to have been againſt them, they paſs us by, and thruſt into the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant peoples hands, a few muſty ſcraps of abuſed words, which are anſwered and cleared over and over: Thus do <hi>H. T. D. Baily,</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the point of Satisfaction and Purgatory, beſides what <hi>Sadeel, Chamier</hi> and others have ſaid, <hi>Uſher</hi> and the foreſaid <hi>Dallaeus</hi> in a full Treatiſe have ſhewed the Papiſts nakedneſs from Antiquity, ſo that modeſty ſhould forbid them to pretend the Fathers for them any more, if any modeſty be left.</p>
                        <p n="6">6.

                        <p>The point of Free will, and moſt of the reſt in which they imagine that we diſſent from Antiquity or the Eaſtern Churches,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55445:112"/>
I have ſpoak to already in my firſt Book againſt Popery. I had thought to have gone through the reſt particularly, at leaſt the reſt mentioned by <hi>H. T.</hi> and <hi>D. Baily;</hi> but finding them ſo frequently and fully handled already, I will forbear ſuch labour in vain.</p>

Not to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> only, nor by name, but equally to the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> without any mention of the Romane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And it was not that the Pope might decide all by his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power, which certainly was ſo neer a way to their relief, that no wiſe man can imagine them ſo mad as to forget it, if it had been a thing then known and approved of. But only they deſire that ſome may be ſent to help them to be the ſtronger party in a Synod, or at leaſt ſome one to comfort them, and put ſome countenance on their cauſe.

                     <p>O but ſay the Papiſts, that was becauſe they had to do only with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that cared for no authority that was againſt them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But would theſe <hi>Arrians</hi> have ſo much regarded the votes of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, yea or a few men ſent from them, and yet not regard the Head of the Church? The <hi>Arrians</hi> ſure had heard of this Headſhip, if any had. And would not the Orthodox deſire ſo much as a word from <hi>Rome</hi> for this advantage? 2. But it is falſe that they were only the <hi>Arrians</hi> that they called for help againſt. They expreſly ſay, that it was <hi>alſo becauſe they were divided among themſelves,</hi> (by perſonal quarrels.) How importunately doth <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> afterward call for help from others, and telleth <hi>Flavianus</hi> in his <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to him, of their miſery as if all were loſt? And the only ſad inſtance was, that <hi>Helladius</hi> (counted a good Biſhop) had proudly neglected him, and made him ſtand at his door (when he went to viſit him) a great while before he was let in; and then did not bid him ſit down; and then did not ſpeak to him firſt but two or three ſtrange angry words. This was the great buſineſs. But to proceed with <hi>Baſil. Epiſt.</hi> 77. he falls to chiding the Weſtern Biſhops, for not ſending to them, nor regarding them and their communion: and to touch their pride, he addeth, <hi>[We have one Lord, one faith, one hope: Whether you think your ſelves the Head of the univerſal Church: the head cannot ſay to the feet, I have no need of you; or if you place your ſelves in the order of other Church-members, you cannot ſay to us, we need you not.]</hi> And would you here believe that the Papiſts have the faces to cite this paſſage of <hi>Baſil,</hi> for their Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, becauſe here is the word <hi>Head!</hi> When as its plain, 1. That <hi>Baſil</hi> by the <hi>Head</hi> means but the <hi>chiefeſt part,</hi> and not the <hi>ſoveraign power.</hi> 2. That he ſpeaks to <hi>all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Weſt,</hi> and not only to the <hi>Romane Biſhop.</hi> 3. That he doth it as a ſmart reproof of their arrogancy, and not in any approbation at all. But any thing will ſerve them.

3. Nore alſo, that when <hi>the Papiſts find but any Hereſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>they cite this as a teſtimony of their Soveraignty:</hi> As if other Patriarch and Biſhops condemned them not as well as they; Or as if we knew no that the Church deſired the moſt general vote againſt Hereticks, and therefore would be loth to leave ſo great a Biſhop out.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>And when they find the Pope excommunicating forreign Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, they cry up this as a Teſtimony of his Headſhip:</hi> As if we did not know, 1. That to refuſe Communion with another Church or Biſhop is no act of Juriſdiction over them. 2. That other Biſhops have made bold alſo to excommunicate the Pope: I'le now but recite thoſe words of <hi>Nicephorus lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. which you uſe to glory in (as many do in their own ſhame) <hi>[Vigilius</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>proceeded to that inſolency, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated</hi> Mennas <hi>for four moneths. And</hi> Mennas <hi>did the ſame by him: But</hi> Juſtinian <hi>being moved to anger with ſuch things, ſent ſome to lay hold on him. But</hi> Vigilius <hi>being afraid of himſelf, fled to the Altar of</hi> Sergius <hi>the Martyr, and laid hold on the Sacred Pipes, would not be drawn away till he had pul'd them down—]</hi> But by the Mediation of the Empreſs <hi>Theodora,</hi> the Pope was pardoned, and <hi>Menna</hi> and he abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one another. A fair proof of the Vicarſhip! 3. And ſo it was, that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was condemned for an Heretick by two or three General Councils.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Alſo <hi>when they meet with any big words of their own Popes (as I command this or that) they take it for a proof of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carſhip:</hi> As if big words did prove Authority. Or as if we knew not how lowlily and poorly they ſpoke to thoſe that were above them.

                     <p n="6">6. Another Roman deceit is this; <hi>When they find any mention of the exerciſe of the (now thriving) Roman Power, over their own Dioceſs or Patriarchal circuit, they would hence prove his univerſal Power over all.</hi> And by that Rule the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> may prove as much.</p>

7. Alſo <hi>when they meet with the paſſages that ſpeak of the elevation of their Pope to be their firſt Patriarch, in the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or any Power that by the Emperors was given him, they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly confound the Empire with the world, and eſpecally if they find it called by the name of the world; and they would perſwade you that all other Chriſtians and Churches on earth, did aſcribe as much to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as the Roman Empire did.</hi> Its true that he was in the <hi>Empire</hi> acknowledged to be firſt in order of dignity, becauſe of <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeat of his <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when General Councils began to trouble themſelves and the world about ſuch matters of precedency. And its well known from the language of their writers, as well as from the words of <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. that they uſually called <hi>the Empire all the world:</hi> And from ſuch paſſages would the Papiſts prove the Primacy at leaſt of the Pope over all the world. But put theſe Juglers to it, to prove if they can, that beyond the Rivers <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes and Euphrates,</hi> and beyond the bounds of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the Pope did either exerciſe Dominion, or was once ſo much as regarded by them, any more then any other Biſhop, except there were any adjacent Iſland or Countrey that had their dependence upon the Empire. I hope they will not deny that the Church extended much beyond the Empire. (Though our Hiſtory of that part of it be much defective.) And let them prove if they can, that ever any of thoſe Churches had any regard to the Roman Biſhop, any more then to another man. Let them tell you where either the Empire of the Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines or any other out of the line of the Imperial power, was any whit like-ſubject to the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But their chief fraud is about <hi>names</hi> and <hi>words. When they meet with any high complemental title given to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>they preſently conclude that it ſignifieth his Soveraignty.</hi> Let us inſtance in ſome particulars, and ſhew the vanity of their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sometimes the Roman Biſhops are called <hi>[Summi Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,]</hi> the <hi>chief Popes:</hi> and hence ſome gather their Supremacy. But I ſuppoſe you will believe <hi>Baronius</hi> (their chief flatterer) in ſuch a caſe as this. And he tells you in <hi>Martyrolog. Roman. April.</hi> 9. that <hi>[Fuit olim vetus ille uſus in Eccleſia, ut Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi omnes, non tantum Pontifices, ſed &amp; ſummi Pontifices diceren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur—</hi>

i. e. <hi>It was the ancient cuſtom of the Church to call all Biſhops not only</hi> Pontifices <hi>Popes, but chief Popes]</hi> And then citing ſuch a paſſage of <hi>Hierom Epiſt.</hi> 99. he addeth <hi>[Thoſe that underſtand not this ancient cuſtom of ſpeech, refer theſe words to the Popedom of the Church of</hi> Rome.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for the names <hi>Papa,</hi> Pope, <hi>Dominus, Pater Sauctiſſimus, beatiſſimus, dei amantiſſimus,</hi> &amp;c. its needleſs to tell you that theſe were commonly given to other Biſhops.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And what if they could find that <hi>Rome</hi> were called <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Churches?</hi> I have formerly ſhewed you, where <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> ſaith of the Church of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> that it is <hi>as the mother of all Churches in a manner.</hi> And <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> hath oft that Title.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Sometime they find where <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Caput Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum,</hi> and then they think they have won the cauſe. When if you will conſult the words, you ſhall find that it is no more then that <hi>Priority of Dignity</hi> which (not Chriſt, but) the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Councils gave them, that is intended in the word. Its called the <hi>Head,</hi> that is, the <hi>chief Seat in Dignity,</hi> without any meaning that the Pope is the univerſal Monarch of the world.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But what if they find the Pope called <hi>the Archbiſhop of the Catholick Church, or the Univerſal Biſhop?</hi> then they think they have the day.

                     </p>
                     <p>Sometime they find the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;</hi> and ſo were others as well as that, as is commonly known.</p>
                     <p>And ſometime the Pope is called the <hi>Pillar of the Church;</hi> And what of that? ſo are many others as well as he; as all the Apoſtles were as well as <hi>Peter?</hi> The Church is <hi>built on the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi> That the Paſtors of the Church were ordinarily called the <hi>Pillars and props</hi> of it, as by <hi>Nicephorus Gildas, Theodoret, Baſil, Tertullian, Dionyſius, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Auguſtine, &amp;c.</hi> you may ſee proved in <hi>Gatakers Cinnus page</hi> 395, 396.</p>

But commonly they make a noſe of wax of Councils and Fathers, as well as of Scripture, and put any ridiculous ſence upon them that ſhall ſerve their turns, though perhaps ſix men among them may have five or ſix Expoſitions.</p>

Now either this is <hi>Baſils</hi> work, or it is not. If it be not, then you ſee what truſt is to be given to the Papiſts Antiquities, and ſuppoſed Fathers: For this is one of them, and this ſtory vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by <hi>Petrus Pantinus,</hi> yea by no leſs a man then the Great <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Maſter of Antiquities, who <hi>Annal.

                     </p>
                     <p>But yet <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks that theſe are not the ſame Books that <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeak againſt: and why ſo? <hi>Becauſe</hi> 1. <hi>Here is no mention of</hi> Theclaes <hi>Preaching and Baptizing, nor of the Lyon baptized.</hi> 2. <hi>Becauſe ſo many Fathers atteſt the ſtory.</hi> But the firſt is a viſible falſhood, contrary to the expreſs words of the ſtory, which feign <hi>Paul</hi> to have ſent her to preach as a true Apoſtle, and mention her baptizing the people of <hi>Seleucia.</hi> And for the <hi>baptized Lyon,</hi> perhaps <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpoke <hi>de baptiſmate ſanguinis:</hi> and meant the Lyon that dyed in the defence of <hi>Thecla:</hi> And in that place <hi>Thecla</hi> is brought as calling <hi>Death a Baptiſm:</hi> However that word which might eaſily be miſtaken, is no great diſproof that this is the ſame ſtory. And for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Teſtimony, as we believe that a famous Martyr called <hi>Thecla</hi> there was, from whence the occaſion of the ſtory roſe, ſo it doth but ſhew how unfit the Fathers are to be the Authors of our Faith, or to be eſteemed infallible, that ſo eaſily believe and recite the forged ſtories of an Aſiatick Presbyter, even when <hi>Tertullian</hi> had before revealed the deceit.</p>
                     <p>But if really this Book was written by <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> and was not ſpurious, then we yet further ſee, that they that reſt upon the Holy Scriptures alone for the matters of their faith, do take a ſurer wiſer way, then they that build all on the credit of ſuch credulous imprudent fabulous Fathers as this author was.</p>
                     <p>By this little taſte you may ſee how their Records and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies from Antiquity are to be truſted: Even as <hi>Zoſimus</hi> report of the Nicene Canon to the African Council was, who proved it a forgery, and ſo rejected it, when the writings are only in their keeping, and their intereſt calleth them to deprave them, they are little to be truſted; who dare venture to corrupt thoſe that are in the hands of the Chriſtian world.</p>

ANother of the Popiſh devices is, <hi>when they have laid their own cauſe upon ſo many forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and uphold it by ſo many falſe reports, to make the people believe that it is we that are the lyars, and that we are not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in any thing that we ſay of them: and that we miſreport the Fathers, belye the Roman Catholicks, and therefore no man ſhould read our Books, or diſcourſe with us, ſo as to afford us any credence.</hi> So that indeed they get as much by meer perſwading the people that we are Lyars, as by any way that I know. We cannot tell them what is in their own Writers, but the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people are commonly taught to ſay, <hi>we ſlander them.</hi> Though we cite the book, and page, and line, and tell them that they were printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Colen,</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> by men of their own Profeſſion, yet they believe us not, for they are inſtructed to hold us for lyars, that we may be unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing them good. If we cite any of the Fathers, they tell us that we miſalledge them, or have corrupted them, or they ſay no ſuch thing. If we ſhew them the books publiſhed by their own Doctors, and licenſed by their Superiors, and printed by Papiſts, yet they will not believe us. And ſo they are taught the eaſieſt way in the world to repell the truth, and confute thoſe that would do them good. It is no more but ſay, <hi>you lye,</hi> and all's done.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch a caſe as this, what is there to be done? Ignorance and Incredulity thus purpoſely conjoyned, are the wall of braſs that is oppoſed to our endeavours. To what purpoſe ſhould we ſpeak to them that will not hear? In ſuch a caſe I know but one of theſe two wayes. 1. To endeavour to revive the ſtupified humanity and Reaſon of theſe men: and ask them, Is Religion the work of a man or of a beaſt? Of a wiſe man, or of a mad man? Is it a Reaſonable or an Unreaſonable courſe? If it be Reaſonable, why then will you go without Reaſon upon other mens bare words? But if you are ſo little men as to venture your ſouls without Reaſon, me thinks you ſhould not venture againſt it? Would you reſt on the bare word of one of theſe men, if it went againſt Reaſon? If ſo, then you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55445:119"/>
your manhood. But ſuppoſe you will be ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet I hope you have your five ſenſes ſtill? What if a Prieſt ſhall tell you that the Crow is white, and the ſnow is black, or that you ſee not when you know you ſee, will you believe him? If you will believe them before your eyes, and taſte, and feeling, then I have done with you; who can diſpute with ſtocks and ſtones, or men ſo far forſaken of God, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all their ſenſes? But if you will not believe a Prieſt againſt your eyes, and other ſenſes, then why do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him that Bread is not Bread, and Wine is not Wine, when the eyes, and ſmell, and taſte of all men ſay it is? And if your ſenſes tell you that your Prieſts deceive you in one thing, me thinks you ſhould not be ſo confident of them in other things, as to believe and hearken to none but them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If this will not ſerve, try whether you can procure their Prieſts to diſcuſs thoſe points before the incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people, that ſo they may hear both ſides ſpeak toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Get a conference between them, and ſome experienced judicious Divine. But this will hardly be obtained. For if it be to diſpute with one that is able, they'l preſently pretend a danger of perſecution: and no promiſe of ſecurity will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them. But if it be a weak unexperienced man that challengeth them, then they will venture, and take the advantage.</p>
                     <p>If nothing elſe can be done, it is the beſt way to offer them ſome ſmall Book againſt Popery to read. If they are ſo captivated that they will neither Hear nor Read, and their Leaders will not be drawn to a Diſpute, I know not what to do but leave them, and let them take what they get by their unreaſonable obſtinacy: They are unworthy of truth that ſet no more by it.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 20. A Nother of their deceits <hi>is by pretended Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> If they do but hear of a Wench that hath the <hi>ſtrangulatus uteri,</hi> or <hi>furor uterinus,</hi> or ſuch <hi>hyſterical Paſſions</hi> in any violent degree, they preſently go to caſt the Devil out of her, that ſo they may make deluded people think that they have wrought a Miracle. And uſually the Countrey people, and perhaps the diſeaſed woman her ſelf, may be ſo much unacquainted with the diſeaſe, as verily to believe the Prieſts, that they have a Devil indeed: and ſo turn Papiſts when the cure is wrought, as thinking it was done by the finger of God. The nature of this diſeaſe is to cauſe ſuch ſtrange ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that moſt ignorant people that ſee them, do think that the perſons are either bewitched, or have a Devil. At this very time while I am writing this, I am put to diſſwade a man from accuſing one of his neighbours of witchcraft, becauſe his daughter hath this diſeaſe, and cryeth out of her. Leſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts get further advantage by this ignorance of the people, I ſhall acquaint them briefly with ſome of the ſymptoms of this diſeaſe. It uſually ſeizeth upon young women between the Age of ſeventeen and thirty two years: And moſt commonly on thoſe that are of a ſound complexion, ſomewhat ſanguine, or at leaſt, fleſhly and ſtrong, and but ſeldom on the weaker ſort (in this manner.) When it is but a meer ſtrangulation, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men commonly know it, by the riſing to their throat, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like: But when it comes to the diſeaſe we mention, it cauſeth them to fall by fits into ſudden trances, and ſwoons: in which at firſt uſually they ſeem ſtupid as dead, if it be in a colder body, but after they grow to violent motions, and ſtrivings, and ragings, ſo that its as much as two can do to hold them. And when the fit is over, they are well again. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time there will be motions like convulſive in the head, the hands, and the fingers diſtinctly: ſo that you ſhall ſee one hand vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently moved to ſome part of the body, ſo that it will be hard to remove it. Sometime one finger ſet double, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after that another, ſo that it will be hard till the fit is over to ſet them ſtrait. Uſually the body toſt up and down
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:55445:120"/>
with raging madneſs. And ſome of them will continue a year, or two, or ſeven in this caſe, daily falling in ſuch fits as one would think ſhould deſtroy or weaken them preſently, and yet after the fits, be almoſt as well as ever, and their ſtrength doth not much decay. If they hear any mention of a Witch, they will likely take a conceit that they are bewitched; and then in their fits they will cry out upon the Witch, and if they ſee her, they will fall into a fit. If they get but a conceit that they are Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Devil, (by hearing the mention of others that were poſſeſſed) they will by the power of corrupted fancy, play the parts of the poſſeſſed, and rage, and rore, and ſwear, and ſpeak as in the perſon of the Devil, and take on them to propheſie, or tell of ſecrets. All this I have known: and I have eaſed ſome of them by medicine in a few moments, and cured them (at that time) in a few dayes: So that I could eaſily have made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people believe that I had caſt out a Devil, if I had but had the deſign and conſcience of a Papiſt. A while ago a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Miniſter told me of a neighbour that was handled thus. I told him what diſeaſe it was, and adviſed him to perſwade her to a judicious Phyſitian. But the next I hear of her was that neglecting the Phyſitian, ſhe was cured by ſome Papiſt Prieſt, and thereupon was turned Papiſt. And no doubt but among themſelves it is reported for a Miracle.</p>
                     <p>The ſame courſe they take alſo in ſome diſtractions and other diſeaſes. And ſometime perſons are trained up by them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and counterfeit a lunatick or poſſeſſed ſtate.</p>
                     <p>And here becauſe <hi>H. T.</hi> in his <hi>Manual, pag</hi> 85, 86. doth plead their Miracles, I ſhall revive the memory of one of the great Miracles that was done among their Proſelites in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Wolverhampton:</hi> though I have mentioned it heretofore. I have the Book by me (Printed at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>F. K.</hi> for <hi>Will. Barret,</hi> 1622.) and have ſpoke with many perſons that knew the Actor himſelf, being yet alive: ſo that I ſuppoſe that no Papiſt about <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> will deny it, what ever they do elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Bilſon</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> there was a Boy named <hi>William Perry,</hi> Son of <hi>Tho. Perry,</hi> who ſeemed to be bewitched or poſſeſſed with a Devil: (about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, but of ſpecial wit above his age.) In his fits he ſeemed to be deaf, and blind, writhing his mouth aſide, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55445:121"/>
groaning and panting, and when he was pricked, pinched, whipped, he ſeemed not to feel. He ſeemed to take no food that would digeſt, but with it caſt up rags, thred, ſtraw, pins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his belly almoſt as flat as his back, his throat ſwel'd and hard, his tongue ſtiff and rolled up towards the roof of his mouth, ſo that he ſeemed alwayes dumb, ſave that once in a fortnight or three weeks he would ſpeak a few words. It was thought he was bewitched by one <hi>Joan Cocks,</hi> becauſe 1. He would diſcern when that woman was brought into the room, though it were ſecretly done, as was tryed before the Grand Jury at <hi>Stafford.</hi> 2. He would not endure the repeating of the firſt verſe of <hi>John, [In the beginning was the word, &amp;c.]</hi> but other texts he would endure. When the Parents had been a while wearyed with him, and the Countrey flockt in to ſee him, a Prieſt of the Romiſh Religion was invited to cure him. The Prieſt exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, him praying in Latine over him, hanging a ſtone about his neck, waſhing him with Holy water, Witch water, and anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with Holy Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſeemed to eaſe him, and make him ſpeak, and ſometime cure him for the time. They Hallowed all his meat and drink: He would not ſo much as eat Raiſins, or ſmell to flowers, unleſs they were bleſt by the Prieſt: He told them that while the Puritans ſtood by him he ſaw the Devil aſſault him in the ſhape of a black bird. The Prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the chief fiend to ſhew himſelf: then the boy puts out his tongue ſwel'd: The Prieſt commandeth him to ſhew the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the ſheet before him, how he would uſe thoſe that dyed out of the Roman Catholick Church. Whereupon he puls, and bites, and toſſeth the ſheet, till the people cry out and weep. Then he commandeth the Devil to tell him, how he did uſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Calvin</hi> and <hi>John Fox:</hi> and he playeth the ſame part more fiercely then before. Then the Prieſt commands him to ſhew what power he had of a good Catholick that dyed out of mortal ſin: and then he thruſt down his arms, and hang'd down his head, and trembled. The Boy promiſeth when his fit is over, that the will live and die a Catholick, perſwading his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On this manner three Prieſts one after another followed the cure, ſtill ſucceeding, but yet not curing him, that they might draw the Countrey to a longer obſervance of them, (and preacht to them in the houſe) and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55445:121"/>
might be the more famous. For forſooth there were many Devils in him, they ſaid, to be caſt out. And it ſtopt the cure, becauſe the Mother would not promiſe them to turn Papiſt if they cured him. But in the mean time the ſuppoſed Witch is brought to tryal at <hi>Stafford</hi> Aſſizes, 1620. before Judge <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton</hi> and Judge <hi>Davies:</hi> But in the end the Judges deſired Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Morton</hi> then preſent to take care of the Boy: who took him home to his Caſtle at <hi>Eccleſhall,</hi> and after certain weeks time (the Biſhop being abroad) the ſaid Biſhop comes to the Boy, and tells him that he underſtood that he could not endure the firſt verſe of <hi>John,</hi> and ſaith he, the Devil underſtandeth Greek as well as Engliſh, being a Schollar of almoſt ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſtanding, and therefore he knows when I recite that verſe in Greek: And ſo calling for a Greek Teſtament, he read the 12. verſe; and the Boy thinking it had been the firſt, fell into his fit: And when that fit was over, the Biſhop read the firſt verſe, and then the Boy had no fit, thinking it had been ſome other verſe. And thus they proved him a deceiver, and the Boy was much confounded, but pretended more diſtraction; and then that he might get away, he complained of extream ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made water in the Urinal, as black as ink, groaning when he made it: But the third day after, they eſpyed him mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ink with his Urine, and nimbly conveying away the Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn. And when they came in upon him, and found him in the conveyance, he broke out into tears, and was ſuddenly cured, and confeſſed all, how he had been taught his art, and how he did all, and confeſſed that his intent was to be cured by a Prieſt, and to turn Papiſt (and whether they have catcht him again or no, I know not; for I hear he is a Quaker in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or at leaſt a reviler of the Miniſtry) The Biſhop took his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination at large, <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. &amp; 13. 1620. If any doubt of the ſtory, they may be ſatisfied yet by the Boy himſelf, or by the Reverend Biſhop yet alive, or by any of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in <hi>Bilſon</hi> that were at age there but thirty ſeven years ago.</p>
                     <p>But before the Biſhop had diſcovered the knavery, one of the Conjuring Prieſts writes the Narrative of the buſineſs (which is printed with the reſt) and is Entituled <hi>[A Faithful Relation of the proceedings of the Catholick Gentlemen with the Boy of</hi>

Bilſon, <hi>ſhewing,</hi> &amp;c.] And they begin with <hi>[Not to us O Lord, but to thy Name give the Glory!]</hi> And ſo they proceed to make their report of it, for deluding the people, as a Miracle. And the writing was by a Papiſt Gentleman examined, atteſted upon Oath to be received from one Mr. <hi>Wheeler,</hi> &amp;c. But when they heard of the Diſcovery, they were aſhamed of their <hi>faithful Relation.</hi> At laſt, the Biſhop brought the Boy at the next ſummers Aſſizes, <hi>July</hi> 26. 1621. to ask pardon openly of God, and the woman accuſed by him, and of the Countrey cheated by him, and there was an end of that Popiſh Miracle. Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more ſuch I could give you out of certain records; but I recited this for the ſake of <hi>H.

                     </p>
                     <p>And for your Miracles; I beſeech you, if you regard not us, yet open your ears to a Jeſuite that ſpeaks the Truth. <hi>Joſeph Acoſta (de temporib. noviſſ. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) <hi>[To all the Miracles of Antichriſt, though he do great ones, the Church ſhall boldly oppoſe the Belief of the Scriptures: and by the inexpugnable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of this Truth, ſhall by moſt clear light diſpell all his juglings as Clouds.—Signs are given to Infidels, Scriptures to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and therefore the Primitive Church abounded with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, when Infidels were to be called: But the laſt, when the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are already Called, ſhall reſt more on the Scripture, then on Miracles. Yea I will boldly ſay, that all Miracles are vain and empty, unleſs they be approved by the Scripture; that is, have a doctrine conform to the Scripture. But the Scripture</hi> it ſelf <hi>is</hi> of it ſelf <hi>a moſt firm Argument of Truth.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the ſame <hi>Acoſta</hi> confeſſeth in his <hi>Indian Hiſtory,</hi> that <hi>they do no Miracles in the Indies</hi> (where the boaſt is.) And if they did, it would confirm Chriſtianity, but not Popery.</p>
                     <p>Yea if Miracles be ſo much to be lookt at, why will you not give us leave to obſerve them? The ſame Miracles that you boaſt of, do teſtifie againſt you, if they be true. To inſtance now but in one. <hi>Proſper</hi> makes mention of a Miracle (which <hi>Thyraeus de Daemoniac. pag.</hi> 76. and many more of yours recite,) that was done by the <hi>Sacramental Wine: A perſon poſſeſſed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was cured, (after many other means uſed in vain) by the Drinking of the Wine in the Euchariſt.</hi> And doth not this Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle juſtifie us that give the people the Wine, and condemn you,

                     <p n="1">1. In a Manuſcript of the Papiſts which I lately received from a Neighbour of <hi>Sturbridge,</hi> as ſent from <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> there are theſe words, with which they conclude <hi>[Luther having richly ſupped, and made his friends merry with his facete conceits, died the ſame night. This is teſtified by</hi> Cochleus <hi>in vita</hi> Lutheri. <hi>And</hi> John Calvin, <hi>a branded ſodomite, conſumed with lice and worms, died blaſpheming and calling upon the Devil. This is regiſtred by</hi> Schluſſelburge <hi>and</hi> Bolſeck; <hi>theſe were the Ends of the Parents of the Proteſtant and Presbyterian pretended Reformed Religions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as if their own tongue muſt ſentence them to Hell, in the very words before they ſay <hi>[All Lyars, their part ſhall be in the pool burning with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death]</hi> And ſo make Application of it to the Proteſtants, as being Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; and when they have done, conclude with the two forecited impudent Lies of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> The like words of <hi>Calvin</hi> hath the late Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter</hi> (or Dr. <hi>Baily</hi> for him) in his Papers to King <hi>Charles;</hi> the whole writing being ſtuffed with ſuch impudent Lies, that one would wonder that humane nature ſhould be capable of ſuch wickedneſs, and that the ſilly people ſhould ſwallow down ſuch heaps of falſhood. And it is not theſe two alone, but multitudes of Papiſts that have written theſe Lies of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin. Thyraeus</hi> the Jeſuite in his Book <hi>de Daemoniacis, part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 21. tells us this ſtory:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55445:123"/>
                        <hi>that the ſame day that</hi> Luther <hi>dyed, there was at</hi> Gheola <hi>a Town in</hi> Brabant <hi>many perſons poſſeſſed of Devils, that waited on their Saint</hi> Dymna <hi>for Deliverance, and were all that day delivered: but the next day they were all poſſeſſed again; whereupon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſt or ſome body asked the Devils where they had been the day before; and they anſwered, that they were commanded by their Prince to be at the Funeral of their fellow Labourer</hi> Luther. <hi>And for proof of this,</hi> Luthers <hi>own ſervant that was with him at his death, looking out at the window, did more then once, to his great terror, ſee a company of ugly ſpirits leaping and dancing about without: and alſo that the Crows followed the Corps all the way with a great noiſe.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O wonderful patience and mercy of God, that ſuffereth ſuch abominable Lyars to live, and doth not cauſe ſome ſudden vengeance to befall them! Reader, I will tell thee now the caſe of theſe two ſervants of Chriſt that are thus reviled (even as their Maſter was before them, that was ſaid to do Miracles by the power of the Devil.)</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Luther,</hi> he was oft taken with a great pain in his breaſt, about the mouth of the ſtomack, and thought his Death when it came would be ſudden; which made him ſay, <hi>Feri Domine, feri clementer, quia ipſe paratus ſum: ſtrike Lord, ſtrike merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I am ready]</hi> Having preached his laſt Sermon at <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge, Jan.</hi> 17. he took his journey the 23. to Count <hi>Mansfields</hi> Countrey, whither he was called. When he came thither, he was grown ſo weak, that they almoſt deſpaired of his life; yet by the uſe of ſomentations he had ſo much eaſe, as that he preached ſometime, and did other work from <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. to <hi>Febr.</hi> 17. The laſt day of his life, though he was weak, yet he ſate at the table with them, and at Supper his diſcourſe was upon the Queſtion, Whether we ſhall know one another in Heaven? which he affirmed and proved, in that <hi>Adam</hi> knew <hi>Eve</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw her, that ſhe was fleſh of his fleſh: and therefore much more ſhall we know one another in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After Supper, he withdrew himſelf as he uſed, for private prayer; but the pain of his breaſt increaſed on him. When he had taken a medicine, he lay down on a Couch and ſlept ſweetly two hours, and then went to his Chamber, ſaying to thoſe about him <hi>[Pray God to preſerve the Doctrine of the Goſpel to us; for the Pope and Council
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55445:123"/>
of Trent have ſtrange Contrivances.]</hi> When he was laid down and had ſlept a while he awakened, and found by the increaſe of his pain, that he was near his End, and ſpoke to God as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their hearing <hi>[O my heavenly Father, the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the God of all Conſolation, I thank thee that thou haſt revealed to me thy Son Jeſus Chriſt, in whom I have believed, whom I have profeſſed, whom I have loved, whom I have Celebrated (or Honoured) whom the Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>and the reſt of the rabble of the ungodly do perſecute and reproach: I beſeech thee O my Lord Jeſus Chriſt receive my ſoul. O my heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, though I am taken from this life, and though my body muſt now be laid down, yet I know certainly that I ſhall abide with thee for ever, and that none can take me out of thy hands.]</hi> Then he ſaid <hi>[So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life]</hi> Then he repeated part of the 68. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> and when he had drunk a medicine that was given him, he ſaid <hi>[I go hence: I now return my ſpirit unto God]</hi> preſently adding <hi>[Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, thou haſt Redeemed me O God of Truth]</hi> And ſo he dyed as if he were ſetting himſelf to ſleep, without any ſign of further pain: but when they ſaw him dying, Dr. <hi>Jonas</hi> and <hi>Caelius</hi> cryed to him <hi>[Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; do you die conſtant through Chriſt in his doctrine which you have hitherto preached?]</hi> And he anſwered <hi>[Yea]</hi> and never ſpoke more. When he was dead (at <hi>Iſlebe) Count Mansfield</hi> would have kept his body, but the <hi>Duke of Saxony</hi> would not ſuffer him, but cauſed it to be brought back to <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> and there with great ſolemnity interred.]</p>
                     <p>This is the true report in brief of <hi>Luthers</hi> Death, delivered to the world by thoſe that ſtood by him, and were eye witneſſes. And yet theſe impudent Lying Papiſts have perſwaded their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers that the Devils were ſeen dancing about him, that when he ſhould be buryed there was a horrible thunder, and the body was taken away out of the Coffin by the Devil, and a ſtink of Brimſtone left behind, with more ſuch ſtuff as this, which they have printed, and which one would think the Father of Lies ſhould be aſhamed of.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Calvin,</hi> not only thoſe before mentioned, but alſo <hi>Bolſecus, Surius, Prateolus, Demochares, Lindanus, Sancteſius,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55445:124"/>
Cahierus,</hi> and others publiſh to the world, not only that he was an Epicure, but a Sodomite, and was burnt on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Sodomie with a hot iron at <hi>Noviodunum</hi> where he was born. Yea <hi>Leſſius</hi> the Jeſuite impudently calls Chriſt to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhall judge all men according to their works, that he doth not deviſe theſe things of his own brain, but from good authors, and forty years currant fame. And his Authors are theſe Papiſts, <hi>Bolſecus, Brigerus, Stapleton, Campian, Durae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Surius,</hi> and <hi>Reginaldus.</hi> Hath Hell any greater calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then theſe to fill the mouths or writings of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
                     <p>Reader, I ſhall ſhew thee what credit theſe men are of by this inſtance. As for the time when they ſay he was ſtigmatized for Sodomie, it was when he was a Papiſt, and therefore if it had been true, it had been a greater diſhonour to them then to us. But its a meer forgery of the Devil and a Fryar. <hi>Hierom Bolſeck</hi> a Fryar, ſeemed to turn Proteſtant, and coming to <hi>Geneva,</hi> he began to preach the Pelagian doctrine there, and openly contend againſt the Paſtors in the Congregation; and being confounded by <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Magiſtrates impriſoned him, and baniſhed him for ſedition. Then he betakes himſelf to the neighbour Towns, to play the ſame game there: but the Magiſtrates of <hi>Bern</hi> alſo baniſh them out of their Countrey. Whereupon he turned Papiſt again, and when <hi>Calvin</hi> was dead, he wrote all theſe abominable lies of him, and all the reſt (with <hi>Schluſſelburgius</hi> the Lutheran, an enemy of <hi>Calvins)</hi> do take up the report from this one Lying heretical Papiſt: and ſo it becomes a currant fame with them, as if it were as true as the Goſpel: Whereupon our writers call to them, provoke them, challenge them to ſearch the Records at <hi>Noviodunum,</hi> where they ſay the thing was done, and prove that ever there was ſuch a thing, or elſe bear the open ſhame of Lyars. But they can bring no proof, but call on us to diſprove it: When the City are Papiſts, and haters of <hi>Calvin.</hi> But after all this, as God would have it, the Papiſt Dean of that City, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jacobus le Vaſſeur,</hi> publiſheth at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1633. the Annals of their Cathedral Church, and therein pouring out his hatred againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſaying what he can againſt him, doth yet out of their records clear him of all theſe accuſations, and lets
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55445:124"/>
the world know that there was never any ſuch thing, and that they had no crime at all againſt him, but that he turned from the Papiſts; and that the Major or chief Governour of the City went away with <hi>Calvin,</hi> when he was forced to fly from his native Countrey. He recites all the paſſages of <hi>Calvins</hi> life there, but profeſſeth that they had no more againſt him. Thus God confounded the Lying Papiſts by one of themſelves, and the Records of that City, where they ſaid the thing was done. And yet they believe one another, and carry on the Lye to this day.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Rob. Amſtrowther,</hi> Chaplain to the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors with the Emperour, being at <hi>Vienna,</hi> heard the Jeſuites and other repeating confidently this ſlander of <hi>Calvin;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he opened to them this Evidence againſt it; and ſatisfied them of the flaſhood, ſo that they told him, they never knew ſo much before, and promiſed him they would never mention it more.</p>
                     <p>If any would ſee the very words of their own Records, and Doctor <hi>Vaſſeur,</hi> he may read them in <hi>Rivets Sum. Contr.</hi> againſt <hi>Baily,</hi> and again in his <hi>Jeſuita Vapulans, Cap.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>And as for the life of <hi>Calvin</hi> after he forſook the Papiſts, if you will but believe that the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and all the Miniſters and others that were about him, in his life and at his death, did know better then <hi>Bolſeck,</hi> a fugitive Apoſtate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt that was his enemy, and then far off, you may ſee at large in <hi>Melchior Adamus,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> the deſcription of ſuch a ſhining burning light as <hi>Rome</hi> hath not to boaſt of. He was a man of admirable wit, judgement, induſtry, and piety. When he had forſaken his own Countrey for the Goſpel ſake, and taken up in <hi>Geneva,</hi> and planted the Goſpel there, with <hi>Farellus</hi> and <hi>Vire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> at laſt the ungodly part getting the Head, the Miniſters were baniſhed. And ſo he ſetled in in another City. The four Bayliffs of <hi>Geneva</hi> that baniſhed the Miniſters, within two years were ruined by the judgements of God. One of them accuſed of ſedition, ſeeking to ſcape through a window fell, and was broken to death. Another was put to death for murder. The other two being accuſed of Mal-adminiſtration, fled and were condemned. <hi>Calvin</hi> is ſent for and intreated to return
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55445:125"/>
to <hi>Geneva:</hi> which by importunity, and <hi>Bucers</hi> perſwaſion, he yieldeth to. There was he continually moleſted by the ungodly, and loved by the good. The Malignants whom he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain by Diſcipline from Whoredom, drunkenneſs, and other wickedneſs, were ſtill plotting or raging againſt him, and called their Dogs by his name. But ſhame was ſtill the end of their attempts. His revenge was to tell them <hi>[I ſee I ſhould have but ſorry wages if I ſerved man: but its well for me that I ſerve him that alway performeth his promiſes to his ſervants]</hi> As for his work, he preached every day in the week each ſecond week, and beſides that, he read three dayes a week a Divinity Lecture. And every Thurſday he guided the Presbyterie; and every Friday at a meeting he held an Expoſitory conference and Lecture: ſo that the whole came to almoſt twelve Sermons a week. Beſides this, he wrote Epiſtles to moſt Countries of Chriſtendom (in <hi>Europe)</hi> to Princes, Divines and others; And he wrote all thoſe great volumes of moſt Learned judicious Controverſies, Commentaries, and other Treatiſes, which one would have thought might have been work enough for a man that had lived an hundred years, if he had done no other. And many Hereticks he confuted, and ſome convinced and reduced. He ſet up among the Miniſters a courſe of teaching every Family from houſe to houſe, of which he found incredible fruit; For all this his labour he endured the affronts, contradictions, and reproaches of the rabble, yea and ſometime hath been beaten by them: becauſe he would not adminiſter the Sacrament to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, that were rulers in the place, he was at firſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and after threatned, and continually moleſted by them, and railing fellows ſet to preach and write againſt him. And whether he were an Epicure, you may ſoon judge: He alwayes uſed a very ſpare dyet: and for ten years before his death did did never taſte one bit, but at ſupper, as his conſtant courſe ſo that every day was with him a better faſt then the Papiſts uſe to make on their faſting dayes. By this extream labour, ſpeaking, and faſting, and watching (for he dictated his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings as he lay in bed much,) he overthrew his body, and falling firſt into a Tertian, and then into a Quartan, after that he fell into a Conſumption, with the gout and ſtone, and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of blood, and the diſeaſe in the Hemorrhoid veins, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:55445:125"/>
at laſt ulcerated by over much faſting, ſpeaking, and uſe of Aloes; beſides the head-ach which was the companion of his life. In theſe ſickneſs he would never forbear his labour, but when he he was perſwaded to it, he told them, that he could not bear an idle life. And when he was near to death was ſtill at work, asking thoſe that intreated him to forbear, <hi>Whether they would have God find him idle?</hi> Under all theſe pains of Gout, Stone, Collick, Head-ach, Hemorrhoids, Conſumption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe that were about him teſtified to the world that they never heard him ſpeak a word unbeſeeming a patient Chriſtian. The worſt was that oft repeated word <hi>[How long, Lord! how long!]</hi> as being weary of a miſerable world. Witneſſes he had enough; for he could ſcarce have reſt, for people crowding to him to viſit him. On <hi>Mar.</hi> 23. he went among the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to their Meeting, and took his farewell of them there. The next day he was wearyed by it: but the twenty ſeventh day he was carryed to the Court to the Senate of the City, where he made a ſpeech to them, and took his farewell of them, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears on both ſides. <hi>April.</hi> 2. he was carryed to Church, and ſtaid the Sermon, and received the Sacrement. Afterward the Senate of the City came to him, and he made an heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to them. On <hi>April</hi> 25. he dictated his Will, which I would his ſlanderers would read. His Library it ſelf, and all his goods being prized, came ſcarce to three hundred Crowns. <hi>May</hi> 11. he wrote his farewell to <hi>Farellus. May</hi> 19. all the Miniſters came to him, with whom he ſate, and did eat, and cheerfully take his leave of them. On the twenty ſeventh of <hi>May</hi> his voice ſeemed to be ſtronger, and ſo continued till his laſt breath that day, which was with ſuch quietneſs as men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to ſleep. The next night and day the City Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, Schollars, people and ſtrangers, were taken up in weeping and lamentation. Every one crowded to ſee the Corps, among whom the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> Embaſſador to <hi>France</hi> was one. He was buryed according to this deſire in the common Church-yard, without any Monument or Pomp: and hath left behind him ſuch a Name, as in deſpight of all the Devils in Hell, and all the Papiſts on earth, ſhall be precious till the coming of Chriſt; and ſuch writings hath he left as are
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55445:126"/>
the comfort of the Diſciples of Truth, and the ſhame of the reproaching Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>Reader, this is that <hi>Calvin</hi> that is ſo hated by the bad, and loved and honoured by the good: whom theſe Papiſts have called an <hi>Epicure</hi> and <hi>Sodomite,</hi> and ſaid <hi>that he died blaſpheming, and calling upon the Devil, and was eaten with lice and worms.</hi> Is not God exceeding patient, that will ſuffer ſuch wretches to live on the Earth? What man could they have named ſince <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> yea ſince the Apoſtles dayes, that was more unfit for ſuch a ſlander then <hi>Calvin?</hi> Yet becauſe one man <hi>Bolſeck</hi> that was baniſhed and turned Papiſt, and lived then I know not in what Countrey, hath written theſe things againſt him, the reſt of them, even as much as the late Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> take them up as confidently, as if the infallible Chair had uttered them.</p>
                     <p>But yet if thou think this Enemy <hi>Bolſeck</hi> is more to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then thoſe that lived with <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> that had continual acceſs to him, I will give thee ſuch a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as ſhall ſhame the Papiſts, that have a ſpark of modeſty. Hear then what other Papiſts themſelves ſay that knew better what they ſaid, or made more Conſcience of their words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florimundus Raimundus</hi> a <hi>Papiſt of</hi> Burdeaux (or the Jeſuite <hi>Richeome</hi> that wrote in his name) writing for the Pope and againſt <hi>Calvin,</hi> hath theſe words of him. <hi>[Under a dry and lean body he had a ſharp and lively wit, ready in anſwering; bold in attempting; a great faſter; even from his youth, whether for his health to overcome the head-ach, or for his ſtudies—There is ſcarce a man found that ever matched</hi> Calvin <hi>in Labours: for the ſpace of twenty three years, in which he remained in the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy of</hi> Geneva, <hi>he preached every day once, and twice on the Lords day of times. And every week he read publick Lectures of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (beſides) and every Friday he was at the conference of the Paſtors: The reſt of his time he ſpent either in writing Books, or anſwering letters.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reader, is this Teſtimony from a Papiſt like the reſt? But yet thou ſhalt have more. <hi>Papirius Maſſonius</hi> a Learned Papiſt, and Schollar to <hi>Baldiom</hi> one of <hi>Calvins</hi> Enemies, wrote <hi>Calvins</hi> life; and he ſaith of him, <hi>[No day almoſt paſſed in which he did not preach to the Citizens. Thrice every eight daies as long as he lived, he profeſſed (or publikely taught) Divinity (in the

He took very little ſleep; and therefore much of his works he dictated in bed to his ſervant that wrote them from his mouth. He did eat but once a day: and confeſſed that he found not a more preſent or ſurer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for his weakneſs of ſtomack and head-ach. His cloathing was of ſmall price, to cover him rather than adorn him.—At</hi> Worms <hi>and</hi> Ratisbone <hi>he exerciſed the ſtrength of an excellent wit with ſo great applauſe of the Germane Divines, that by the judgement of</hi> Melanchthon <hi>and his Aſſociates; by a peculiar priviledge he was called</hi> The Divine. <hi>He wrote as much and as well as any man of the contrary parties, whether you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect number, acuteneſs, language, ſharpneſs, emphaſis, or ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: not a man of all his Adverſaries, whether Catholicks, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Lutheranes, Arrians, or the forſakers of his Party, that wrote againſt him, did ſeem to match him in gravity of writing, and weight of words and ſharpneſs, in anſwering his principles.

This the Jeſuite <hi>Thyraeus de Daemoniacis</hi> writes, and many others, and it goes among them for a currant truth; and all from the report of <hi>Bolſeck.</hi> But, as God would have it, <hi>Pap.

                        <hi>Beza</hi> was eighty years of age, a falſe report came to the Papiſts that he was dead. Whereupon <hi>Claudins Puteanus</hi> with his <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itical</hi> Companions wrote a Book, that at his death he turned Papiſt and renounced his Religion: ſo that the old man (that lived ſeven years longer) was fain himſelf to write againſt them, to prove that he was not dead, nor turned Papiſt: Theſe be the means by which men are reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>As to this point, though Learned men can ſoon confute them by vindicating the Text as in the Original Languages, and then vindicating our Tranſlation; yet the common diſputant need not put them and himſelf to ſo much trouble.

ANother of the Deſigns of the Papiſts is, <hi>to bring all the faithfull Paſtors of the Churches into contempt, or ſuſpicion at leaſt with the People, that ſo they may draw them to refuſe our helps, and the Papiſts may deal with them alone, whom they know they are eaſily able to over-reach.</hi> Though our people have not that abſolute Dependance upon their Teachers as theirs have, yet an ordinate Dependance is Neceſſary to them, or elſe God would never have appointed Teachers and Paſtors for his Church. The Papiſts dare not truſt their followers ſo much as to read a Bible in their vulgar tongue. Much leſs to Read our writings againſt their errors and impieties: No nor their Prieſts and Fryars ordinarily to read them: No nor commonly to read the writings of their own Party: No not thoſe, nor the ſtrongeſt of thoſe that are written againſt us: for fear leſt the objection ſhould prove too hard for the anſwer; or leſt they ſhould underſtand the truth of our doctrine in ſome meaſure. Sr. <hi>Edw: Sands</hi> in his <hi>Europae Specul.</hi> profeſſeth how hard he found it, to meet with the Works of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf in any Book-ſellers ſhop in <hi>Venice</hi> or other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> But our people have all leave to keep and read the Papiſts writings: We dare venture them upon the light upon equal terms: But yet we know them to be inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, for the moſt part, to defend even plain and neceſſary truths againſt the Cavils of adverſaries that overmatch them in learning and other abilities. Now leſt we ſhould but afford them our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Papiſts principal deſign is to bring them into falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the Miniſters, and make us odious to them; that they may neglect our help, and the eaſilyer hearken to other Teachers. And if they can but prevail in this deſign, the day is their own, and the ſouls of our unhappy people are like to be undone.</p>
                     <p>And the more is it to be feared, leſt at laſt they ſhould this way prevail, both becauſe of the ſin that lyeth on our ſelves in too reſerved and negligent a doing of our work; and becauſe of the great obſtinacy and unprofitableneſs of the people, that hate the light, and unthankfully deſpiſe it, or will not obey it, and work by it while they may.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:55445:129"/>
The deſigns of the Papiſts againſt the Miniſtry are theſe 1. They principally endeavour to delade the Rulers of the Land and ſet them againſt them, of which more anon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They are very buſie to procure an overthrow of their eſtabliſhed maintenance: To which end they animate all ſects to rail againſt Tythes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They labour by ſeoffs and nicknames to make them odious. As they were the Authors or chief fomenters of the old ſcorn under the name of <hi>Puritans,</hi> ſo are they of many more of late. If in Court, or Parliament, City or Countrey; you hear men ſet themſelves of purpoſe to ſcorn or vilifie the Miniſtry, its very probable that they are either ſecret Papiſts, or their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſerviters. If they ſpeak of men that regard the Miniſtry, and be not hardened as they to a deſpiſing of Chriſt in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they call ſuch <hi>[Prieſt ridden]</hi> and the Paſtors they ſcornfully call <hi>[Iack-Presbyters, Drivines,]</hi> and many other ſcoffs are at hand, to ſerve the ends of the Devil and the Pope, by alienating the Affections of the people from their Teachers, that ſo they may devour them at pleaſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another of their wayes of reproach is, by telling the people what odious diviſions are among us, and how many minds we are of, and how oft we change, and ſuch like reproaches, by their mouthing it they can make ſomething of; while they never tell them how much more changeable they have been, and what diviſions are among themſelves, incomparably beyond all ours. Nor do they ever tell them how far we are united, and how ſmall the differences among us are, and ſuch as muſt be expected while we all know but in part.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another reproach that the Papiſts caſt on the Miniſtry, is Greedineſs, Covetouſneſs, and being hirelings. And therefore they put theſe into the mouths of Quakers and other Sectaries. And whats their ground? Forſooth becauſe we take Tythes, or other ſet maintenance. Becauſe we have food and rayment, and our daily bread. I have ſaid enough of the Cauſe it ſelf in my ſeveral writings againſt the Quakers. If any doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papiſts be their Teachers, or of the ſame mind, beſides many greater Evidences, the Manuſcript from <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> before mentioned may be full ſatisfaction. This tells men that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55445:129"/>
                        <hi>[for filthy lucre ſake we ſcratch itching ears with doctrines of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty]</hi> and thus it learnedly verſifieth.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>With Pleaſing words they ſcratch all ears that itch.</l>

                           <hi>That</hi> Mammon <hi>(whom they ſerve) may make them rich.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>For they are Merconaries, that will be hir'd</l>
                        <l>To preach what doctrines are by men deſir'd.</l>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt profeſs unfeignedly that the experience of ſuch horrid wickedneſs of men, is a great help to my faith againſt all temptations that ever would provoke me to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Hell; When I ſee and hear that unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able villany, that I ſhould ſcarce have believed humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could have been capable of, if God or ſuch experience had not told it me. But when I ſee Abominations before my eyes as incredible or horrid as Hell it ſelf almoſt, it ſilenceth temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſuch unbelief.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I will give thee a brief compariſon between the Papiſts Prieſts and the Miniſters of Chriſt, that thou maiſt ſee whether theſe men be fit to rail at us as Mercenaries, and ſuch as are the ſervants of Mammon.</p>
                     <p>Its a well known caſe that the Miniſters of this Land, and of all the Reformed Churches commonly do many of them want neceſſaries, and ſome want food and rayment, and the reſt of them for the moſt part have little more: Or if one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred have two hundred pounds a year, its ten to one but taxes and other payments bringeth it ſo low, that he hath no ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And ſome that have not Wives or Children, do give all that they can gather to the poor; and ſome upon my knowledge give more to charitable uſes, then they receive for the work of their Miniſtry, living on their own means. And they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves been the means of taking down the Lordly Prelacy and Riches of the Clergy: and though they would not have had the Lands devoted to the Church to have been alienated, yet they would have had it ſo diſtributed as might but have reacht to have made the maintenance of Miniſters to be an hundred pounds a year. This was the height of their Covetouſneſs and Ambition, as you call it.</p>
                     <p>And now will you take a view of the Popiſh Clergy, for Greatneſs, Riches, and Numerouſneſs. 1. For Greatneſs, the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55445:130"/>
Pope who is their chief Prieſt, pretendeth to the Government of all the Chriſtian world. Emperors and Kings have kiſt his feet, and held him the ſtirrup. One Emperour was forced to wait bare foot at his Gates a long time in patience, till he pleaſed to open them. Another being forced to proſtrate himſelf to him, the Pope ſet his foot upon his neck, profanely abuſing the words of the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. 13. <hi>He ſhall tread on the Lyon and Adder,</hi> &amp;c. Divers Princes hath he depoſed: He hath claimed a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Temporals and Spirituals, and his more moderate flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers ſubject Princes to him <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi> General Councils approved by him, decree that he ſhall Excommunicate and depoſe Princes, that will not extirpate thoſe that he calleth Hereticks, and ſhall commit the Government to others, or give their Countreys to the firſt that can ſeize on them; and abſolve all their V<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſſals from their Allegiance, (in deſpight of Oaths and Gods Commands.) He is a Temporal Prince himſelf, having large Dominions. He hath ſo numerous a Clergy in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of all Popiſh Princes, as makes him great and formidable to them. His Cardinal Prieſts are equal to Princes, and greater then many Princes are. 2. And for their Riches and Numbers, to ſay no more of their Pope and Cardinals, they have ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts, Abbots, Priors, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Jeſuites, and ſuch others, as take up a great part of the Land where they live. I will at this time give you but one Inſtance, and deſire you to compare it with our Miniſters and their maintenance: and that is of the Popiſh Clergy in <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their own writers tells us as followeth. <hi>Bodin</hi> (a Judge in <hi>France)</hi> ſaith, (as <hi>Heylin Geograph. pag.</hi> 148. reciteth it) <hi>That the Revenues of the Clergy there are twelve millions, and three hundred thouſand livres, which is one million and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds of our Engliſh money</hi> per annum; <hi>and that they poſſeſs ſeven parts of twelve of the whole revenue of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is above half.</hi> But we will take up with the lower reckoning of the Book called <hi>Comment. de ſtat.</hi> and ſaith <hi>Heylin,</hi> this tells us that <hi>the Clergy have near a fourth part of the very Lands of all the Kingdom, beſides the Offerings, Churchings, Bur<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>als, Diriges, and ſuch like Caſualties, which amount to as much as their Rents,</hi> (So that there is another fourth part, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55445:130"/>
comes to half the Kingdom) upon which Sr. <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> computes their revenue at <hi>ſix millions yearly:</hi> And for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that one Kingdom hath <hi>thirteen Arch-biſhops,</hi> an <hi>hundred and four Biſhops,</hi> a <hi>thouſand four hundred and fifty Abbies, five hundred and forty Archpriories: twelve thouſand three hundred and twenty Priories, five hundred ſixty ſeven Nunneries: ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Convents of Fryars: two hundred fifty nine Commanderies of</hi> Malta; <hi>beſides all the Colledges of the Jeſuites.</hi> And the Pariſh Prieſts are <hi>an hundred thirty thouſand</hi> of all ſorts. And whereas the Kingdom is ſuppoſed to have about fifteen millions of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Clergy and their Miniſters are judged to be <hi>three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>Judge now like men of reaſon and impartiality, whether the tongues of theſe men be fit to call us Mercenaries, or Hirelings, or ſuch as preach for filthy lucre. Or whether ever greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence was manifeſted by the vileſt Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> then for ſuch men that Lord it over Emperors, Kings and Princes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the wealth of the Chriſtian world, to call poor Miniſters of Chriſt, Covetous, or Hirelings, that are content with food and rayment, and a mean education of their children, and that have done ſo much to take down the Lordlineſs and Riches of the Clergy. Judge of this dealing; and if you had rather have the Popiſh Prieſthood, with the numberleſs ſwarm of Fryars and ſeveral orders, you may take them, and ſay, you had your choice.</p>

Though we need not fetch our Ordination from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet, as to them, we may truly ſay, that if they have any true Ordination and Miniſtry, then ſo have we: For our firſt Reformers were Ordained by their Biſhops, which is enough to ſtop their mouths. If they ſay that our Schiſm hath cut off our power of Ordination, I anſwer <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that (though it is they that are indeed the Notorious Schiſmaticks, yet) if we were what they falſly ſay we are, it would not null our Ordination, Confirmation, or ſuch other acts. And this is the Judgement of their own writers. I ſhall at this time only cite the words of one of them, and of many in that one: and that is <hi>Thom. à Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis de Converſione Gentium, lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. Where he affirms it to be one of the Certainties agreed on <hi>[that Schiſmaticks loſe not, nor can loſe any ſpiritual power conſiſting in the ſpiritual Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Baptiſm, or Confirmation of Orders: For this is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as</hi> Dr. Thomas <hi>teacheth here,</hi> Art. 3. <hi>and</hi> Turrecremata <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,</hi> lib. 4. ſum. part. 1. c. 7. <hi>and Silveſter verb.</hi> Schiſmatici: <hi>and it appeareth by Pope</hi> Urbans Can. <hi>Ordinationes,</hi> 9. q. 1. <hi>Who judgeth thoſe to be truly ordained, that were ordained by Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Biſhops: And from</hi> Auſtin lib. 6. de Bapt. Cont. Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. cap. 5. <hi>where he ſaith that [A Separatiſt may deliver the Sacrament as well as have it.] He next addeth that yet ſuch are deprived of the faculty of Lawfull uſing the Power which they have, ſo that it will be their ſin to uſe it, though it be not a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity if they do uſe it: and that thus thoſe are to be underſtood that ſpeak againſt the Ordination, Confirmation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi> viz. <hi>that it is unlawfull, becauſe their power is ſuſpended
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55445:131"/>
by the Church, but not a Nullity, becauſe they have the Power,</hi> pag. 316. <hi>He puts the Queſtion [Whether Schiſmatical Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and Biſhops do want the Power of Order, or only want Juriſdiction?] And he anſwereth out of</hi> D. Thom. 22. q. 39. art. 3. <hi>that [they want Juriſdiction, and cannot Abſolve, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or grant indulgences, and ſo they cannot elect and give Benefices, and make Laws—But yet they have the holy Power of Orders; and therefore a ſchiſmaticall Biſhop doth truly make and conſecrate the Euchariſt, truly Confirm, truly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; and when he Electeth and promoteth any to Eccleſiaſtical Orders, they truly receive the Character of Order, but not the Uſe, becauſe they are ſuſpended, if knowingly they are ordained by a Schiſmatical Biſhop.] He next asketh, [Whether this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment depriving them of Juriſdiction, take place with all Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks] And anſwers that [ſome ſay that before the Council of</hi> Conſtance <hi>this puniſhment belonged to all notorious Schiſmaticks, but not to the unknown ones: but ſince that Councill, it takes place only on thoſe that are expreſly and by name denounced, or manifeſt ſtrikers of the Clergy] Others ſay otherwiſe: But he himſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that [If a ſchiſmatick be toleraeted, and by the common error of the people be taken for lawfull, there's no doubt but all his acts of Juriſdiction are valid, which we ſhall affirm alſo of Hereticks: But if a Presbyter or Biſhop be a manifeſt Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, then ſome ſay that thoſe acts that require Juriſdiction are invalid; but others ſay that they are all valid in caſe the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick be not by name excommunicated, or a manifeſt ſtriker of the Clergy]</hi> Thus far <hi>Thom. à Jeſu</hi> opening the judgement of the Papiſts Doctors themſelves in the point.</p>
                     <p>And by the way, our new ſuperprelatical Brethren that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade others that want their Ordination, yea or commands, and nullifie their Acts, ſhould learn not to go beyond the Papiſts themſelves, if they will go with them.</p>
                     <p>And obſerve, that it is but their own Canons, that is, their own wills, that the Papiſts here plead when the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> hath ſo altered the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Though this that is ſaid is enough as to the Papiſts, yet I add for fuller ſatisfaction, that <hi>their ſucceſſion is interrupted; and therefore they are moſt unfit to be our Judges in this.</hi> They have had ſo long ſchiſms in which no man knew who was the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55445:132"/>
right Pope, nor knoweth to this day; and ſo long removes and vacancies, and ſuch interpoſitions of various wayes of chooſing their Pope, and interruptions by Hereticall Popes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by General Councils; beſides Murderers, Adulterers, Symoniſts, and ſuch as their own Writers (as <hi>Genebrard)</hi> expreſly ſay, <hi>Were not Apoſtolical, but Apoſtatical;</hi> yea Popes that by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils have been judged or charged with infidelity it ſelf (as I have formerly proved,) that there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more certain then that their ſucceſſion hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They cannot be certain but its every age interrupted, and that theres no true Pope or Biſhops among them, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Ordainer or Conſecrator is with them of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the thing: and no man can be certain of the Intention of the Ordainers. And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is fain to take up with this, that though we cannot be ſure that he is a true Pope, Biſhop, or Presbyter that is ordained, yet we are bound to obey him. But where then is the Certainty of ſucceſſion?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What ſucceſſion of Epiſcopal Conſecration was there in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when <hi>Hierom (Epiſt. ad Evagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um)</hi> tells us that <hi>[At</hi> Alexandria <hi>from</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangeliſt even till</hi> Heraclus <hi>and</hi> Dionyſius <hi>their Biſhops, the Presbyters did alwayes name one man that Biſhop whom they choſe from among themſelves, and placed in a higher degree. Even as if an Army make an Emperour, or the Deacons chooſe one of themſelves, whom they know to be induſtrious, and call him the chief Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.]</hi> Thus <hi>Hierom</hi> ſhews that Biſhops were then made by meer Presbyters. And in the ſame Epiſtle he proves from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Presbyters and Biſhops were then all one. And if ſo, there were no Prelatical Ordinations then at all. And your <hi>Medina</hi> accuſing <hi>Hierom</hi> of error in this, ſaith, that <hi>Ambroſe, Auſtin, Sedulius, Primaſius, Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Theophilact,</hi> were in the ſame hereſie, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf reporteth him. So that Presbyters now may either ordain, or make themſelves Biſhops as thoſe of <hi>Alexandria</hi> did, to do it. And as <hi>Hierom</hi> there ſaith, <hi>[All are the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles,]</hi> and our Biſhops or Presbyters are ſuch, as much, at leaſt, as yours: yet Apoſtles as Apoſtles have no Succeſſors at all, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:55445:132"/>
well teacheth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 25. ſaying, <hi>[Biſhops do not properly ſucceed the Apoſtles, becauſe the Apoſtles were not ordinary, but extraordinary, and as it were, delegate Paſtors, who have no Succeſſors. Biſhops have no part of the true Apoſtolick Authority. Apoſtles could preach in the whole world, and found Churches, but ſo cannot Biſhops. The Apoſtles could write Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books, but ſo cannot Biſhops. Apoſtles had the gifts of tongues and miracles, but ſo have not Biſhops. The Apoſtles had Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the whole Church, but ſo have not Biſhops. And there is no Succeſſion, but to a Predeceſſor: but Apoſtles and Biſhops were in the Church both at once, as appeareth by</hi> Timothy, Titus, Evodius, <hi>and many more. If therefore Biſhops ſucceed Apoſtles, to what Apoſtle did</hi> Titus <hi>ſucceed? and whom did</hi> Timothy <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? To conclude, Biſhops ſucced Apoſtles, but in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Presbyters ſucceed the ſeventy two Diſciples—But its manifeſt that Presbyters do not properly ſucceed the ſeventy two Diſciples, but only by ſimilitude. For thoſe ſeventy two Diſciples were not Presbyters, nor did they receive any Order of Juriſdiction from Chriſt.</hi> Philip, Stephen <hi>and others that were of the ſeventy two had never been after Ordained Deacons, if they had been Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters before]</hi> Thus <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See now what's become of the Popiſh Apoſtolical Succeſſors among their Biſhops? And the ſcope of all this is to prove, that all Biſhops receive their Power from the Pope; and ſo their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion is confined to him alone: and therefore as oft as there have been interruptions in the Papal Succeſsion, ſo oft the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of all their Church was interrupted.</p>
                     <p>But if Biſhops ſucceed not Apoſtles, and have not any of the Apoſtolick Power, who then doth the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceed? Why, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath a ſhift for this: but how ſorry an one it is, you ſhall bear, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. he ſaith that <hi>[The Pope of</hi> Rome <hi>properly ſucceedeth</hi> Peter, <hi>not as an Apoſtle, but as an Ordinary Paſtor of the whole Church.]</hi> Let us then have no more talk of the Apoſtolick ſeat, or at leaſt no more Arguing from that name. You ſee then that <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Univerſal Vicar as an Apoſtle, nor doth the Pope ſo ſucceed him. And do you think this doth not give away the Vicarſhip? Which way here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will they prove it?</p>
                     <p>But an Objection falls in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> way, that <hi>[If this
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55445:133"/>
be ſo, then none of the Biſhops of</hi> Africk, Aſia, <hi>&amp;c. were true Biſhops, that were not made by the Pope: To which he anſwers (as well as he can) that its enough that the Pope do Conſecrate them Mediately, by making Patriarchs and Arch-biſhops to do it: and ſo</hi> Peter <hi>did Conſtitute the Patriarchs of</hi> Alexandria <hi>and</hi> Antioch, <hi>who thus receiving authority from the Pope, did Rule almoſt all</hi> Aſia <hi>and</hi> Africk] But 1. That [almoſt] marreth the whole Cauſe. For where now is the univerſal Headſhip? 2. Did <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> think in good ſadneſs that <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi> were made at firſt the ſeats of Patriarchs, having as large Juriſdiction as afterward they attained? 3. How will he prove that <hi>Peter</hi> made theſe two Patriarchates, and that not as an Apoſtle, but as an Ordinary Vicar General? 4. Who made the Patriarchate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and gave them that vaſt Juriſdiction? Did <hi>Peter</hi> many hundred years after his death? Or did the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that tooth and nail reſiſted, and ſtill ſought to diminiſh his Power? Or rather did not the General Councils do it by the Emperors Commands, the Pope excepting and repining at it. 5. Who made the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> and who made <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> did <hi>Peter?</hi> And who made <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Biſhops? did <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul?</hi> And who gave <hi>Paul</hi> that Power? not <hi>Peter</hi> certainly. Reader, do not theſe men jeſt with holy things? Or is it like that they believe themſelves?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that the <hi>Poteſtas Ordinis, &amp; interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oris juriſdictionis</hi> are both as immediately from God to every Biſhop as to the Pope, <hi>cap.</hi> 22. And why then ſhould it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of the power of <hi>exterior</hi> Juriſdiction? 1. Is one part of the Eſſence of the Office given by the Pope, and the reſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him? 2. And what if it be proved that <hi>exterior</hi> and <hi>interior</hi> Juriſdiction of a Paſtor is all one? Though the matter of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be exterior, yet the Juriſdiction is exerciſed only on the ſoul directly, in one caſe as well as another; it being the mind on which the obiglation lyeth, and the Paſtoral Rule is powerful and effectual: and further then you procure conſent, you are deſpiſed: For its the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> work to uſe violence: Biſhops as Biſhops can but perſwade and deal by words with the inner man.</p>
                     <p>And thus you ſee what is become of the Papiſts Succeſſion.</p>

                     <p>I refer you to three Books of Mr. <hi>Prins,</hi> viz. his Catalogue; his <hi>Antipathy of Lordly Prelates,</hi> &amp;c. and his <hi>unbiſhoping of</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy <hi>and</hi> Titus; where you have the Judgements of many writers of theſe matters. And alſo to what I have ſaid in my <hi>Second Diſputation of the Epiſcopal Controverſiès,</hi> of purpoſe on this point.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The chief error of the Papiſts in this cauſe is expreſſed in their reaſon, <hi>[No man can give the Power that he hath not:]</hi> wherein they intimate, that it is Man that giveth the Miniſterial Power: whereas it is the gift of Chriſt alone: Man doth but deſign the perſon that ſhall receive it, and then Chriſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55445:134"/>
giveth it by his Law to the perſon ſo deſigned: and then man doth in veſt him and ſolemnize his introduction. As a woman may chooſe her an husband, but it is not ſhe that giveth him the Power over her, but God who determineth of that Power by his Law, affixing it to the perſon choſen by her, and her action is but a condition <hi>fine qua non,</hi> or cauſe of the capacity of the matter to receive the form. And ſo is it here. When do but obey God in a right choice and deſignation of the perſon, his Law doth preſently give him the Power, which for orders ſake he muſt be in a ſolemn manner inveſted with. But matters of Order may poſſibly vary; and though they are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as far as may be, yet they alwayes give place to the Ends and ſubſtance of the work, for the ordering whereof they are appoineed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Temporal power is as truly and neceſſarily of God, as Eccleſiaſtical, and it was at firſt given immediately by him, and he choſe the perſon: And yet there is no Neceſſity that Kings muſt prove an uninterrupted Succeſſion. God uſeth means now in deſigning the perſons that ſhall be Governors of the Nations of the earth: But not alway the ſame means: nor hath he tyed himſelf to a ſucceſſive Anointing or Election: elſe few Kings on earth would hold their Scepters. And no man (from any diverſity in the caſes) is able to prove that a man may not as truly be a lawful Church-governor, as a lawful Governor of the Commonwealth, without an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Collation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be forced to maintain that with them it is enough that a Paſtor have the place, and ſeem lawfull to the people, and that they are bound to obey him, though it ſhould prove otherwiſe. Then we may as well ſtand on the ſame terms as they.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In a word, our Ordination being according to the Law of Chriſt, and the Popes ſo contrary to it, we are ready at any time, more fully to compare them, and demonſtrate to any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial man, that Chriſt doth much more diſown their Ordination then ours, and that we enter in Gods appointed way. Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> in <hi>New England</hi> may better Ordain a Paſtor over the Indians converted by him, then leave them without, or ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>England</hi> for a Biſhop, or for Orders.

By their ſanctifying Sacraments and Ceremonies: In all which they ſay that we are wanting, and ſo far wanting, that being out of the Church, there is no true Holineſs among us.</p>
                     <p>When in the Preface of my Book againſt Popery, called <hi>The Safe Religion,</hi> I had truly ſpoken my experience, that I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the happineſs to be acquainted with any Papiſt of a ſerious ſpiritual temper, and holy life, but only ſome of a Ceremonious formall kind of Religion, and but with very few that lived not in ſome groſs ſin, I was paſſionately cenſured by ſome of the Papiſts, as one that condemned all for ſome. When as 1. I only ſpoke of my own acquaintance. 2. And I added withall, that yet I was confident that God had his ſervants among them, though I had not the happineſs to know them. 3. And is it not a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous buſineſs, that theſe ſame men ſhould be ſo paſſionate with me, for ſpeaking but the truth, concerning the ungodlineſs of ſome of them, when at the ſame time they make it an Article of their faith, and an eſſential point of Popery, <hi>That no one Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hath charity, or can be ſaved;</hi> yea, <hi>that no Chriſtian in the world is ſanctified really, and can be ſaved, but a Papiſt.</hi> O the partiality of theſe men! 4. Yea when they neceſſitate us to mention their ungodlineſs, by calling us to it, and laying the ſtreſs of all our cauſe upon the point: yea laying the very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith it ſelf upon the Holineſs of their Church. For we muſt not know that Scripture is Gods word, or that Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the true Religion, till we firſt know that the Church of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55445:135"/>
                        <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, that we may receive it on their credit: And we muſt know that they are the true Church by being the only Holy people in the world. I muſt profeſs that if my faith lay on this foundation, I know ſo much of the falſhood of it, that I muſt needs turn infidell: and I can no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, then I can believe that the ſnow is not white.</p>
                     <p>They confeſs (I thank them for nothing) that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are bad; but yet ſay they, <hi>[there is ſome good ones among us,</hi> Inter haereticos autem nullus eſt bonus: <hi>but among the hereticks not one is good]</hi> So ſaith <hi>[Thom. à Jeſu de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. omn Gent. pag.</hi> 531. And ſaith <hi>H. Turbervile</hi> Manual p. 84. <hi>[But I never yet heard of any Proteſtant Saints in the world.]</hi> O wonderfull perverſeneſs of the hearts of Sectaries! O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Patience of God! Did not this mans heart tremble or ſmite him to write ſo horrid, ſo impudent a reproach againſt ſo many precious Saints of God? Durſt he thus attempt to rob the Lord of the fruit of his blood? and to vilifie his Jewels? and as <hi>Rabſhakah,</hi> to reproach the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God? to attempt to pluck them out of Chriſts hand that are given him by his Father; and to ſhut them out of heaven, that are redeemed and made heirs by ſo dear a Price; and to ſpit in their faces whom Chriſt hath waſhed with his blood? Did he not fear that dreadfull threatning of Chriſt, <hi>Mat</hi> 18. 6. <hi>[but who ſo ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one of theſe little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.]</hi> Though I ſee ſo much impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the Papiſts, I dare not ſay, I dare not think that God hath not ſome Holy ones among them. Its dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thoſe that Chriſt will Juſtifie; and making his members to be the members of the Devil, and abuſing ſo groſly the apple of his eye. If I ſee a man live wickedly, I dare ſay that he is of a wicked life; but I dare not ſay that <hi>All are ſo,</hi> unleſs it be among men, whoſe principles I am ſure are inconſiſtent with godlineſs, and I know that they hold thoſe principles practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or prevalently. And therefore I muſt ſay again, that I have been acquainted with ſome Papiſts, learned and unlearned. The unlearned few of them knew what. Chriſtianity was, nor whether Chriſt were God or Man, Male or Female, nor whether ever he was the King, Prophet or Prieſt of the Church, nor for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:55445:136"/>
what end he dyed, nor what faith, or repentance is; but were infidels under the name of Papiſts, or Catholicks. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unlearned live in ſome groſs ſin or other, either all or neer all that I have been acquainted with. The better ſort would ordinarily ſwear, <hi>[by their Lady, and by the Maſs.]</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time greater oaths. The reſt were ſome fornicators or adulterers, ſome drunkards or revellers, and gameſters, or ſuch like: And never had I the happineſs to be acquainted with one that would ſpeak experimentally and ſavourily of the work of Grace upon his ſoul, of the life of faith, of communion with God, and of the life to come; but their Religion lay in being the Popes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and in faſting on Fridayes and in Lent from ſome ſorts of meat, and in ſaying over ſo many <hi>Ave Maries, Pater Noſters,</hi> or the like; and in obſerving dayes, and hours, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Yet I again ſay, I fully believe that there be better among them, though I am not acquainted with them.</p>
                     <p>But if theſe men that <hi>[never heard of a Proteſtant Saint]</hi> and that conclude <hi>[there is no one ſaved but a Papiſt,]</hi> and build their ſalvation on this as an Article of their faith, had known but thoſe that I have known, and yet know, they would either have been of another mind, or have been left unexcuſable in a malicious reproaching of the Saints of the moſt high. I bleſs the Lord that I can truly ſay, that I know many and many, that (as far as the heart of another can be known, by words and a holy life) do live in much communion with God; whoſe ſouls are daily longing after him; and ſome of them that have vacancy from worldly neceſſities, ſpending much of their lives upon their knees, having had many a ſpecial extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their importunate requeſts: whoſe delight is in the Law of the Lord, in which they meditate day and night (which is lockt up among the Papiſts.) Whoſe hearts ſmite them for vain words or thoughs, or the loſs of a few minutes of time; that live in exemplary humility, meekneſs and ſelf-denyal, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrongs patiently, and doing good to as many as they can, as the ſervants of all; contemning the Riches and Honours of the world, mortifying the fleſh, and ſome of them longing to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, in whom the world never knew either once drunkenneſs, fornication, or one raſh oath, or
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55445:136"/>
any other groſs ſin, that I could ever hear of. And is it certain that all theſe ſhall be damned, becauſe they believe not in the Pope? Nay is it not certain by Promiſe that all ſuch ſhall be ſaved?</p>
                     <p>I muſt again profeſs, that when the Papiſts lay their faith and cauſe on this, that their Church <hi>is Holy, and ours and all other are every man unholy,</hi> its almoſt all one to me as if they ſaid that <hi>no men but Papiſts have ſouls in their bodies,</hi> and laid their faith on this; and as ſoon I think ſhould I believe them, if this were their belief. Its a good preſervative againſt Popery, when a man cannot turn Papiſt without putting out his eyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his wit, and reaſon, and common experience, as well as his charity; yea without denying of what he knoweth by his own ſoul!</p>
                     <p>But let us come to their Evidences. 1. They ſay, <hi>We have no Canonized Saints.</hi> I anſwer 1. All the Apoſtles and Saints of the firſt ages were of our Religion, and many of them have been beholden to the Pope for Canonizing them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have no uſurper among us that pretendeth Infallibly to know the hearts of others, nor to number Gods Saints. But with us, the Holy Ghoſt <hi>maketh Saints,</hi> and their lives <hi>declare it;</hi> and thoſe that converſe with them <hi>diſcern it,</hi> ſo far as to be highly confident, and men diſcern it in themſelves, ſo far as to be Infallibly (though not perfectly) certain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It ſeems the Pope takes Saints to be rare with them, that they muſt be named and written with red Letters in an Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack: And <hi>H. T. Man. pag.</hi> 84. is fain to ſend us for proof to their Chronicles and Martyrologies; and he nameth four Saints that they have had, <hi>viz.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin the Monk,</hi> Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> and Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> Now we all know that none but Saints are ſaved, <hi>and that without holineſs none can ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12. 14. So that it ſeems if ſanctity be ſo rare among the Papiſts, ſalvation muſt be rare</p>
                     <p>But as for us, we make it our care to admit none but Saints to our Church Communion: though we preach to others to prepare them for it: For we believe that the Church is a Holy Society, and find <hi>Paul</hi> calling the whole Churches that he writes to, by the title of <hi>[Saints,]</hi> and we believe it is <hi>[the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints]</hi> that is there to be held. And if we had no more Saints in one County at once, yea in ſome one Pariſh at once,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55445:137"/>
then would fill up the Popes Calendar, ſo as to have one for every day in the year, we ſhould betake our ſelves to bitter lamentation.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> takes in all ſorts of the unclean, and is ſo impure and polluted a ſociety, that its a wonder how they ſhould have the face to boaſt of their holineſs to men that live among them and know them. Thouſands of their members are ſtark Infidels, as not knowing the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Faith. Its known here in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that abundance of them know not who Chriſt was, but that <hi>he was a better man than Saint Patrick:</hi> Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> ſaw it and lamented it, that they periſhed as Heathens for want of knowing Chriſtianity it ſelf, while they went under the name of Catholicks: and therefore he would have perſwaded the Popiſh Prieſts to have Conſented that they ſhould be all taught a Catechiſm of the common principles that we are agreed in; but he could not procure it: when Dr. <hi>Jo. White</hi> asked one of them in <hi>Lancaſhire, who Jeſus Chriſt was?</hi> ſhe anſwered, that <hi>[ſure it was ſome good thing, or elſe it ſhould not have been put into the Creed.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And how much ſwearing, whoredom, drunkenneſs, and other wickedneſs is in their Church, is known not only by the complaints of their own writers, but by the too common experience of Travailers. We have known Papiſts that have turned from them by the experience of one journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeeing what is there. And for Church cenſures by which any of theſe ſhould be purged out, they are laid by, and reſerved for other uſes, even as thunder-bolts for the Popes Adverſaries, and the ſervants of Chriſt whom they take for Hereticks; and for Princes whom the Pope would have depoſed and murdered. Theſe things are not meer words, but the lives of many Kings and Princes have been the ſacrifice of the Roman Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>And what need you any further proof that their Church is as the common wilderneſs, and not as the Garden of Chriſt, and is a Cage of all unclean birds, then that they actually keep them all in their Communion. It made my heart riſe at their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and filthineſs, to read one ſentence in one of the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſober, and honeſt of all their Biſhops that have written, and that is <hi>Albaspinaeus Obſervat.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 1. ſaith he <hi>[Siquis unquam hoc ſeculo, (quod neſcio an acciderit) Communione fuit
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55445:137"/>
privatus, ſola fuit Euchariſtiae perceptione: in reliquis ſuae vitae partibus, quam ante Excommunicationem habuit, eandem cum caeteris fidelibus conſuetudinem, &amp; uſum retinuit.]</hi> That is <hi>[If ever any one man in this age was put from the Communion (which I know not whether ſuch a thing hath come to paſs,) it was only from the receiving the Euchariſt; in the other parts of his Life, be retained the ſame familiarity and converſe with other believers, which he had before his Excommunication.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you ſee from a credible Biſhop that lived in the thickeſt of their Clergy in <hi>France,</hi> that he knew not that any one perſon in the age that he lived in, was ever kept from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but if he were, yet that was all: he was ſtill a member of their Church, and familiar with the reſt. Let the Chriſtian world then obſerve by their practice, what an abominable hypocritical conteſt they make, for to prove the Power of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be only in their Pope, and the Prelates to whom he giveth it; and when they have done, do make no more uſe of the Power which they ſo pretend to, as not to exerciſe the Cenſures of the Church upon one offendor there in an age. How were that man worthy to be thought of, or to be uſed, that would ſet all the world on fire by contending, that no Schoolmaſter or Phyſitian ſhould be ſuffered in the whole world, but himſelf and ſuch as he giveth power to: and when he hath done, will not by himſelf or his ſubjects and dependants teach or heal one perſon in an age? were ſuch an one meet to live on the earth? Or ſhould we judge that man in his wits that would believe him? O what a ſtye is the Roman Society! what dunghills are in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies? and yet muſt not the Shovel or the Beeſom be uſed once in an Age? what! no weed pulled up? no ſuper fluous branch cut off? Is this the uſe of all the Canons of their Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Excommunication, and abſtention? Muſt the Chriſtian world be at ſuch a vaſt expence, to maintain ſo rich and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Clergy for this? And muſt we caſt out our Paſtors to receive ſuch as theſe? when we ſhould be aſhamed, if we had not exerciſed more of the cleanſing power of the Keyes in one Pariſh Church, then <hi>Albaſpinaeus</hi> knew of among the Papiſts in a whole age.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps there is little of this filth among them to be caſt out: He that readeth their own writers, or liveth among them,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55445:138"/>
and ſeeth their lives, will hardly think ſo. He that had but ſeen the Murders of their Popes for the obtaining of the Popedom, or how Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> raged againſt the Carcaſs of Pope <hi>Formo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> drawing it out of the grave, and changing its Pontifical habit to a ſecular, and cutting off his fingers; or he that had ſeen Pope <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> caſting the Corps of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the fift into the River <hi>Tiber;</hi> or Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> keeping the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> bound in priſon; or Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſeventh putting out his Cardinals eyes; would ſcarce believe that the Holy Seat of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter</hi> were indeed Holy: (all which <hi>Platina</hi> and others of their own writers give us notice of.)

                     <p n="2">2 THE ſecond Proof which they bring of the Holineſs of their Church, is, the <hi>ſtrict life of their Fryars,</hi> as <hi>Carthuſians, Franciſcans,</hi> and others. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Having been ſo long already on this point, I will be but ſhort on this branch. In a word, 1. I have no mind to deny the Graces of the ſpirit in any that have them. Though travellers tell me lamentable ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of your Fryars, <hi>&amp; Guil. de Amore,</hi> and his companions ſaid much more, and many other Popiſh Writers paint them out in an odious garb, yet I do not doubt but God hath his ſervants among them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I muſt tell you that this alſo ſhews the Pollution of your Church in compariſon of our Churches; that Holineſs and Religion are ſuch rarities, and next to Miracles among you, that it muſt be cloiſtred up, or confined to certain orders that are properly called Religious, as if the People had no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or Holineſs. When our care and Hope is to make all our Pariſh Churches far more Religious and Holy then your Monaſteries or Convents: Yea were not this Church much more Religious and Holy where I live, I think I ſhould have ſmall comfort in it.</p>

I ſhall now add but the words of your <hi>Dominicus Soto de Inſtit. &amp; Jure qu.</hi> 6. <hi>art.</hi> 1. cited by <hi>Rivet, [We do not deny</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in the Clergy, ſuch as keep Concubines, and are Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, are frequent.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have many that live unmarryed, as well as you, but not on your terms.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We know that <hi>Paul</hi> directed <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain him a Biſhop that was the Husband of one Wife, and ruled well his houſe, having his children in ſubjection; and that the Church a long time held to this doctrine, and that <hi>Greg. Nyſſen</hi> was a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed Biſhop. But if you are wiſer then the Spirit of God, or can change his Laws, or can prove the Holy Ghoſt ſo mutable, as to give one Law by <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles, and another by the Pope, we will believe you, and forſake the Scripture, when you can ſo far bewitch us, and charm us to it.</p>
                     <p>We believe that a ſingle life is of very great Convenience to a Paſtor, when it can be held: and that Chriſts Rule muſt be obſerved <hi>[Every man cannot receive this ſaying, but he that can, let him receive it]</hi> And whether Miniſters be Marryed or not Marryed (as many now living in the next Pariſhes to me are not, no more then my ſelf) it is a ſtrange thing with us to hear of one in many Counties that was ever once guilty of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his life: and if any one be but once guilty in the Miniſtry, he is caſt out, though he ſhould be never ſo penitent, as any man that readeth the Act for ejecting ſcandalous Miniſters and Schoolmaſters may ſee. As alſo you may there ſee, that if he were but once drunk, if he ſwear, curſe, or be guilty of other ſcandalous ſins, he is caſt out without any more ado. And none
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55445:142"/>
are ſo earneſt for the through execution of this Law as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. If a Miniſter do but go into an Alehouſe, except to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the ſick, or on weighty buſineſs, it is a ſcandalous thing among us: we do not teach as the Jeſuites cited by the <hi>Janſeniſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taltus,</hi> that a man may lawfully go into a Whorehouſe to exhort them from Whoredom, though he hath found by experience, that when he comes among them he is overcome, and playes the Whoremonger with them.</p>
                     <p>Leſt the vices of your Clergy ſhould be laid open and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you exempt them from the ſecular power, and will not have a Magiſtrate ſo much as queſtion them for whoredom, drunkenneſs, or the like crimes. It is one of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees <hi>(as</hi> Caranza <hi>pag.</hi> 395. recites them) that <hi>[No Lay man muſt judge a Prieſt, nor examine any thing of his life. And no ſecular Prince ought to judge the facts of any Biſhops or Prieſts whatſoever]</hi> And indeed that is the way to be wicked quietly, and ſin without noiſe and infamy. But for our parts, we do not only ſubject our ſelves and all our actions to the tryal of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and the loweſt Juſtice of Peace, as far as the Law gives him power, but we call out to Rulers daily to look more ſtrictly to the Miniſtry, and ſuffer not one that is ungodly or ſcandalous in the Church. And if one ſuch be known, our Godly people will all ſet againſt him, and will not reſt till they caſt him out (in times when there is opportunity for it) and get a better in his ſtead. The whole Countrey knows the Truth of this.</p>
                     <p>If you ſay, as the Quakers do, that yet the moſt among us are ungodly; I anſwer, that Thoſe among us that are known ungodly and ſcandalous are not owned by us, nor are members of our Church, or admitted to the Lords Supper, in thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations that exerciſe Church-diſcipline; but they are only as Catechuments, whom we preach to and inſtruct, if not caſt out.</p>
                     <p>Your eighth General Council at <hi>Conſtantinople, Can.</hi> 14. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that <hi>[Miniſters muſt not fall down to Princes, nor eat at their Tables, nor debaſe themſelves to them; but Emperors muſt take them as Equals]</hi> But we are ſo far from eſtabliſhing Pride and Arrogancie by a Law, that though we hate ſervile flattery and man-pleaſing, yet we think it our duty to be the ſervants of all, and to condeſcend to men of low eſtate, and much more to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55445:143"/>
honour our Superiors, and God in them.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Council decreed, <hi>Canon.</hi> 21. that <hi>[None muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any Accuſations againſt the Pope]</hi> No marvail then if all Popes go for Innocents. But we are lyable to the accuſations of any.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe you charge our Churches with Unholineſs, and that with ſuch an height of Impudency, as I am certain the Divel himſelf doth not believe you, that provokes you to it; even that there is not One Good among us, nor one that hath Charity, nor can be ſaved (unleſs by turning Papiſt,) I ſhall therefore go a little higher, and tell you that I doubt not but the Churches in <hi>England</hi> where I live, are purer far than thoſe were in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtine, Hierom,</hi> &amp;c. yea and that the Paſtors of our Churches are leſs ſcandalous then they were then; what if I ſhould compare many of them even to St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and ſuch others, both in Doctrine and Holineſs of Life? ſhould I do ſo, I know you would account it arrogancy: but yet I will preſume to make ſome compariſon, and leave you to Judge impartially if you can.</p>
                     <p>As for the Heavenlineſs of their writings, let but ſome of ours be compared with them, and you will ſee at leaſt that they ſpake by the ſame ſpirit: and for their Commentaries on Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, did we miſs it as oft as <hi>Ambroſe, Hierom</hi> and many more, we ſhould bring our ſelves very low in the eſteem of the Church: Even your <hi>Cajetane</hi> doth more boldly cenſure the Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries then this comes to.</p>
                     <p>And as to our lives, the Lord knows that I have no pleaſure in opening any of the faults of his Saints, nor ſhall I mention any but what are confeſſed by themſelves in Printed Books, and mentioned by others; and to boaſt of our own Purity I take to be a deteſtable thing, and contrary to that ſenſe of ſin that is in every Saint of God. But yet if the Lords Churches and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are ſlandered and reproached as they were by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of old, the vindicating them is a duty which we owe to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Miniſters that I Converſe with are partly Marryed, and partly unmarryed. The Marryed live ſoberly, in Conjugal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, as burning and ſhining lights before the people, in exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Holineſs of Life. The unmarryed alſo give up themſelves
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55445:143"/>
to the Lord, and to his ſervice: and I verily think that of many ſuch that converſe with me, there is not one that ever defiled themſelves by incontinency, and I am confident would be ready to take the moſt ſolemn Oath of it, if any Papiſt call them to it. And for the people of our Communion, through the mercy of God ſuch ſins are ſo rare, that if one in a Church be guilty once, we all lament it, and bring them to penitence, or diſown them.</p>
                     <p>And were the Churches better in the third, fourth, fift, ſixt, or following Ages? I doubt not. And I judge by theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. 1. By the ſad Hiſtories of the Crimes of thoſe times.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the lamentable complaints of the Godly Fathers, of the Biſhops, and people of their times. What dolefull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints do <hi>Baſil, Gregory Nazianz.</hi> and <hi>Greg. Nyſſen,</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Auſtin,</hi> &amp;c. make? (it were too long to recite their words.) What complaints made <hi>Gildas</hi> of the Brittiſh Church? What a doleful deſcription have we of the Chriſtian Paſtors and People in his dayes, from <hi>Salvian,</hi> through his whole Book <hi>de Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. I judge alſo by the Canons, and by the Fathers directions concerning Offendors. For example; <hi>Gregory Mag.</hi> ſaith of drunkards <hi>[Quod cum venia ſuo ingenio ſunt relinquendi, ne dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores fiant, ſi à tali conſuetudine evellantur.]</hi> And was this the Roman Sanctity even then? And was this St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? that Drunkards muſt be let alone with pardon, leſt if they be forced from their cuſtome, they be made worſe! Then fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Miniſters of <hi>England:</hi> If ſuch advice were but given by one of us, it would ſeem enough to caſt us out of our Miniſtry. We dare not let one drunkard alone in our Church-communion, where Church-diſcipline is ſet up.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith <hi>[that Drunkenneſs is a mortal ſin,</hi> Si ſit aſſidua, <hi>if it be daily or uſual.</hi> And that they muſt be dealt with <hi>gently and by fair words, and not roughly and ſharply.]</hi> If one of us ſhould make ſo light of Drunkenneſs, what ſhould we be thought?

                     <p>In an Engliſh Council at <hi>Berghamſted an.</hi> 697. the ſeventh Canon is this <hi>[If a Prieſt leave his Adultery, and do not naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defer Baptiſm, nor is given to drunkenneſs, let him keep his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and the priviledge of his habit]</hi> Spelman, <hi>pag.</hi> 195.

                     <p>All this ſhews that the Church then was much more corrupt then ours now in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea the beſt of the Fathers had ſuch blots, that I may well make their <hi>Confeſſions</hi> another diſcovery, that our Churches are as pure and holy as theirs. I will name but few of the chief, becauſe I would not rake into their faults needleſly, who are pardoned, glorified Saints in Heaven. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> whileſt he leaned to the Maniches had a baſtard, and confeſſeth himſelf guilty of fornication. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> that was ſo vehement for Virginity, and lived a Monaſtick life, doth yet confeſs that he was not a Virgin. St. <hi>Bernard</hi> that lived ſo Contemplative a life, in his <hi>Serm. de beata virgine poſt ſerm.</hi> 5. <hi>de Aſſumpt.</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>ſe carere virginitate,</hi> that he lacked his virginity. And though <hi>Bellarmine (de ſcriptor. Ecccleſ. pag.</hi> 224.) do from that only reaſon queſtion whether it be <hi>Bernards,</hi> yet it is in the ſecond Tome among his undoubted writings, and this reaſon is a poor diſproof.</p>
                     <p>Now if one of our ordinary Miniſters ſhould be but guilty of ſuch a ſin, though but once, and that before Converſion, no doubt but it would lye heavye on their Conſciences; and I am ſure it would leave ſuch a blot on their names, that were never likely to be worn off while they live.</p>

When we tell the Papiſts of their Licenſing Whore-houſes at <hi>Rome, Bononia, &amp;c.</hi> they commonly fly to the words of <hi>Auſtin, lib. de Ordine,</hi> ſaying <hi>[Aufer Meretrices de rebus humanis, &amp; turbaveris omnia libidinibus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Take away Whores from among men, and you will diſturb all things with luſts.]</hi> Though this was written when <hi>Auſtin</hi> was but a young convert, and it ſeems that he after changed his mind, yet this ſhews that our times are far from the abominations of thoſe; and our Paſtors are far more ſtrict then <hi>Auſtin</hi> then was.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As for the Holineſs of their Church by Ceremonies, as Holy Water, Holy Oil, Relicks, Altars, and an hundred ſuch things, I think it not worth the ſpeaking of: all things are ſanctified to us by the word and prayer.

                     <p>Were there not abundance of Novelties introduced, when <hi>Auguſtine ad Januarium</hi> ſaid that <hi>[They load our Religion with ſervile burdens, which God in mercy would have to be free, with a very few and moſt manifeſt Sacraments of Celebration, ſo that the condition of the Jews was more tolerable, that were ſubject to Legall Sacraments, and not to the preſumptions of men]</hi> Theſe words of <hi>Auſtin</hi> your own <hi>Joh.

Among which, as ſo many ſnares of ſouls, and entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nets, there's ſcarce any man that walks ſecure, and is not taken (or catcht.)]</hi>
                     </p>

When all is thus overcome with Novelty, do you make any queſtion whether any thing be new?</p>
                     <p>It ſeems that <hi>Bernard</hi> thought that humane Traditions were too much befriended, when he thus deſcribeth the Aſſemblies that he approveth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 91. <hi>[Such a Council (do I delight in) in which the Traditions of men are not obſtinately defended, or ſuperſtitiouſly obſerved; but they do diligently and humbly enquire, what is the good, and well pleaſing, and perfect will of God.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it ſeems to me that General Councils by error intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Novelties, when Later Councils were fain to undo what the former had done: For ſo doth bleſſed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> profeſs they did, ſaying, <hi>De Baptiſ. cont. Donat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>[And Councils themſelves that are gathered through ſeveral Regions or Provinces, do without any ſcruple yield to the authority of more plenary Councils that are gathered out of the whole Chriſtian world; and thoſe ſame plenary Councils do often yield (or give place) the former to the later, when by ſome experiment of matters, that which was ſhut is opened, and that which lay hid is known]</hi> Sure here are alterations made even by General Councils that correct one another.</p>
                     <p>And what ſhould hinder the Introduction of Novelty when General Councils do ſo often err? Nay if ſuch Councils be Morally and Interpretatively the whole Church, as the Papiſts ſay, then the whole Church doth err in the reception of ſome Novelty, before they declare it by their decrees. If you ſay, that General Councils cannot err, nor introduce ſuch Novelties, your Champion <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and many of your own, will give you the Lie: ſaith he <hi>De Concil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>[Ne<expan>

                     <p>And what ſhould hinder, when there is but one mans vote againſt it, even the Popes, but that Novelty and error may enter at any time; and when that one man is oft ſo wicked and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical as he is. For General Councils are but a meer name and mockery. The packing of them ſhews it: the Paucity and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Univerſality of them ſhews it. The Management of their affairs ſhews it. They do nothing ſince the Papal reign, but what the Pope will (excepting the condemned Councils) They have no Being till he Will; nor make any Decrees but what he Will: Nor are their Decrees of any further power, then he is pleaſed to give them. So that his Will is the ſenſe of the General Council or univerſal Church. I need not turn you for this to <hi>Sleidan,</hi> or <hi>Uergerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Trent,</hi> that tell us the Holy Ghoſt came to that Council in a Cloak-bag from <hi>Rome:</hi> nor to <hi>Eſpenſaeus in Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 42. ſeeing <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks it out, <hi>De Concil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. ſaying, <hi>[We muſt know that the Pope is wont to ſend Legates inſtructed concerning the judgement of the Apoſtolick ſeat, with this Condition, that if the Council do conſent to the Judgement of the Apoſtolick ſeat, it ſhall be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Decree; If not, the forming of the decree ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>being adviſed with, ſhall return his anſwer]</hi> And ſaith <hi>Bellarmine de Concil. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>[In the Council of</hi> Baſil, Seſ. 2. <hi>it was decreed by common conſent, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Popes Legate, that a Council is above the Pope; which certainly is now judged erroneous]</hi> And the Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> decreed the contrary.

                     <p>Mark Papiſts: General Councils with the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> may bring in Novelties in faith, againſt the cleareſt light of the Goſpel, and the full Conſent of Antiquity; and yet theſe Councils affirmed their opinions to be <hi>de fide,</hi> and the contrary to be Heretical and Damnable, and contrary to all Antiquity. You ſee then that Novelties are among you in matters of faith. And the French to this day are guilty of thoſe <hi>Novelties,</hi> and alſo charge their Adverſaries with Innovation.</p>
                     <p>Nay what will you ſay, if General Councils themſelves are but Novelties, though they are the foundation of the faith of one half of the Papiſts (as the Pope is of the other) <hi>I ſay not ſo,</hi> but judge whether your Champion <hi>Pighius ſay ſo, Hierarch.

Is your Repreſentative Church the foundation of your faith, a <hi>Novelty</hi> of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> invention; and yet are you in the old way, and muſt we be put to prove you to be <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſts?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do you think thoſe Popes did go the Old way, of whom <hi>Alvarus Pelagius</hi> ſpeaks <hi>(de planctu Eccleſ. art.</hi> 15. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.) that <hi>[they ſucceeded in authority, but not in Sanctity, intruding themſelves, procuring, bargaining,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>building Towers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces in Babylon, that is, in</hi> Rome <hi>according to</hi> Hierom] Some foul innovation ſure they were guilty of that ſo re-edified <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        <pb n="238" facs="tcp:55445:147"/>
So that this is my firſt proof that you are Noveliſts; from the General Accuſations of others, and Confeſſions of your own.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another proof that changes may be, and yet the time and Authors be unknown, is from the inſtance of other Churches that have been corrupted or ſubverted by Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet the time and authors are unknown. You accuſe the Churches in <hi>Habaſſia</hi> of many errors your ſelves; and you are not able to tell us when they came in, or who introduced them. The ſame may be ſaid of the Georgians, Armenians, Egyptians, yea and of the Greeks and Ruſſians. Can you tell us when, and by whom each error was introduced that corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Churches mentioned in the Scripture? as <hi>Corinth, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, Coloſs, Theſſalonica, Epheſus, Laodicaea,</hi> and the reſt: you know you can give us no better an account of this, then we can of the Authors of your Corruptions, nor ſo good.</p>
                     <p>You know that among the Primitive Fathers, whoſe writings are come to our hands, many errors had the Major vote, as that of the <hi>Corporeity of Angels,</hi> (which your ſecond General Council at <hi>Nice</hi> owned) and their <hi>Copulation with women before the flood,</hi> the <hi>Millenary conceit,</hi> and many more which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be errors. Tell us when any of theſe came in, if you can (unleſs you will believe that <hi>Papias</hi> received the laſt from <hi>John,</hi> and then its no error.) Who did firſt bring the Aſian Churches to celebrate Eaſter at a ſeaſon differing from yours? Who firſt brought the Brittains to it? Nay we know not certainly who firſt Converted many Nations on earth, nor when they firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Chriſtianity: and how then ſhould we know when they firſt received each error?</p>
                     <p>And we find that good men did bring in Novelties; and what was by them introduced as indifferent, would eaſily by cuſtom grow to ſeem Neceſſary: and what they received as a doubtfull opinion, would eaſily grow to be eſteemed a point of Faith. The Presbyters and whole Clergy of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> were offended with <hi>Baſil</hi> for his Innovations, <hi>viz.</hi> for bringing in a new Pſalmodie, or way of ſinging to God; and for his new order of Monaſticks: and they told him that none of this was ſo in <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes; and what anſwereth <hi>Baſil?</hi> He denyeth not the Novelty of his Pſalmodie, but retorts again on them, that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55445:147"/>
their Letany alſo was new, and not known in the time of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory (Thaumaturgus)</hi> yea, ſaith he, <hi>How know you that theſe things were not in the dayes of</hi> Gregory? <hi>For you have kept nothing unchanged to this day of all that he was uſed to]</hi> you ſee what chopping and changing was then in the Church among all ſorts, when ſuch an alteration was made in leſs then forty years. Yet <hi>Baſil</hi> would not have unity to be laid on any of theſe things, but addeth, <hi>[But we pardon all theſe things, though God will examine all things: only let the principal things be ſafe]</hi> Baſil <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 63. Iſidore Peluſiota <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 90. ſaith, that <hi>[the Apoſtles of the Lord ſtudying to reſtrain and ſuppreſs unmeet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity, and ſhewing themſelves Maſters of modeſty and gravity to us, did by wiſe Council permit women to ſing in the Churches. But as all Gods documents are turned into the contrary, ſo this is turned to diſſoluteneſs, and the occaſion of ſin. For they are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with deep compunction in ſinging Divine Hymns; but abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſweetneſs of the ſinging, to the irritating and provoking of luſt, they take it for no better then ſtage-play ſongs:] therefore he adviſeth that they be ſuffered to ſing no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you ſee 1. That changes had happened about many Divine things. 2. That he adviſeth himſelf the introducing of this novelty, that women be forbidden ſinging in the Church, becauſe of the abuſe, though he confeſs it a wiſe Apoſtolick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So that for Novelty by good men to creep into Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is not ſtrange.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover the Nature of the thing may tell all the world, that neither you nor we can be accountable of the beginning of every error that creepeth into the Church: For 1. The diſtance of time is great. 2. Hiſtorians are not ſo exact: and what they tell us not, neither you, nor we can know. 3. Much Hiſtory is periſhed. 4. Much is corrupted by your wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, as hath been oft proved to you. 5. Mixtures of Fables have hindred the credit of much of it. 6. Nations are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſons, but conſiſt of millions of individuals: And as it is not a whole Nation that is converted to the faith at once, ſo neither is it whole Nations that are perverted to Hereſie at once, but one receiveth it firſt, and then more and more, till it over-ſpread the whole. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that ſuch doctrine eateth like a Gangrene; and that is by degrees, beginning on one part, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55445:148"/>
proceeding to the reſt. 7. As I ſaid before, that which is at firſt received but as an Opinion and an Indifferent thing, muſt have time to grow into a Cuſtom; and that Cuſtom maketh it a Law, and makes Opinions grow up to be Articles of Faith, and Ceremonies grow to be Neceſſary things. You know that this is the common way of propagating opinions in the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I have in another Book ſhewed you out of many of your own writers the riſe of divers of your vanities. And <hi>Uſher</hi> hath told the Jeſuite more: and ſo he hath told you of your thriving to your preſent height, in his Book <hi>de ſucceſs. &amp; ſtatu Eccleſ.</hi> And ſo hath <hi>Mornay</hi> in his <hi>Myſterie of Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> in the Defenſe of him againſt <hi>Cofferellus;</hi> and <hi>Pet.

To theſe therefore I remit you for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Objection.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Can you tell us your ſelves, when many of your doctrines or practices ſprung up? When took you up your <hi>Sabbaths faſt,</hi> for which you have been condemned by a Council? You know that when the twentieth Canon of the Nicene Council was made, and when the Canons at <hi>Trull.</hi> were made, it was the Practice of the Church through the known world, to pray and perform other worſhip ſtanding, and to avoid kneeling on the Lords Day. Tell us when this Canon and Tradition was firſt violated by you, and by whom? It was once the cuſtom of your Church to give Infants the Euchariſt; who firſt broke it off? It was once your practice to Communicate in both kinds: who firſt denyed the Cup to the Laity? At firſt it was only a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Opinion, that Saints are to be Prayed to, and the dead pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, which came into mens minds about the third or fourth Century? But who firſt made them Articles of faith? <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> began to doubt, whether there were not ſome kind of Purgatory: But who firſt made this alſo a point of faith? Who was it that firſt added the Books of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> and many others to the Canon of Scripture, contrary to the Council of <hi>Laodicaea,</hi> and all the reſt of the concent of Antiquity, which Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> and others have produced? Who was it that firſt taught and practiſed the putting an Oath to all the Clergy of the Chriſtian Church within your power to be true
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55445:148"/>
to the Pope, and to obey him as the Vicar of Chriſt? Who firſt taught men to ſwear, that they would not interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but according to the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers? Who was the firſt that brought in the doctrine or name of Tranſubſtantiation? and who firſt made it an Article of faith? Who firſt made it a point of faith to believe that there are juſt ſeven Sacraments, neither fewer nor more? Did any before the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſwear men, to receive and profeſs without doubting, all things delivered by the Canons and Oecumenical Councils, when at the ſame time they caſt off themſelves the Canons of many General Councils, and ſo are generally and knowingly perjured? (as <hi>e. g.</hi> the twentieth Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> forementioned) Theſe and abundance more you know to be <hi>Novelties</hi> with you, if wilfulneſs or groſs ignorance bear not rule with you; and without great impudence you cannot deny it. Tell us now when theſe firſt came up, and ſatisfie your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>One that was afterward your Pope <hi>(Aeneas Sylvins, Epiſt.</hi> 288. ſaith, that <hi>before the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>there was little reſpect had to the Church of</hi> Rome: You ſee here the time mentioned, when your foundation was not laid.</p>

Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. c.</hi> 13. &amp;c. tells you how much your Pope hath gotten of late: and plainly tells you, that the Papacy is <hi>but of Poſitive right, and that Prieſts are equall, and that it is ſubjectional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that gives the Pope and Biſhops their Majority, and that the diſtinction of Dioceſſes, and that a Biſhop be over Presbyters, are of Poſitive right, and that Chriſt gave no more to</hi> Peter <hi>than the reſt; and that if the Congregate Church ſhould chooſe the Biſhop of</hi> Trent <hi>for their Preſident and Head, he ſhould be more properly</hi> Peters <hi>Succeſſor then the Biſhop of</hi> Rome] Tell us now when the contrary doctrine firſt aroſe?</p>
                     <p>Gregory <hi>de valentia (de leg. uſu Euchar. cap.</hi> 10. tells you that the <hi>Receiving the Sacrament in one kind, began not by the decree of any Biſhop, but by the very uſe of the Churches, and the conſent of believers:</hi> and tels you, that <hi>it is unknown when that Cuſtom firſt begun, or got head, but that it was General in the Latine Church, not long before the late Council of</hi> Conſtance. And may you not ſee in this, how other points came in?</p>

If Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi> had but had his will, and the Fathers of the <hi>Carthage</hi> Council had not diligently diſcovered, ſhamed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his forgery, the world had received a new Nicene Canon, and we ſhould never have known the Original of it.</p>
                     <p>Its a conſiderable Inſtance that <hi>Uſher</hi> brings, of uſing the Church ſervice in a known tongue. The Latine tongue was the Vulgar tongue, when the Liturgy and Scripture was firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it (at <hi>Rome</hi> and far and neer it was underſtood by all.) The ſervice was not changed, as to the language: but the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage it ſelf changed; and ſo Scripture and Liturgy came to be in an unknown tongue; And when did the Latine tongue ceaſe to be underſtood by all? Tell us what year, or by whom the change was made? ſaith <hi>Eraſmus (Decl. ad cenſur.

                        <head>An Anſwer to the foregoing Argument.</head>
                        <p>IF the Author of this Argument thinks as he ſpeaks, its a caſe to be lamented with tears of blood, that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be abuſed, and the ſouls of men deluded by men of ſo great ignorance. But if he know that he doth but juggle and deceive, its as lamentable that any matter of Salvation ſhould fall into ſuch hands.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This Argument I have before anſwered, <hi>Detect.</hi> 13. The word Church here is ambiguous, and either ſignifieth, 1. A particular Church, which is an Aſſociation of Chriſtians for perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Gods worſhip. 2. Or divers ſuch Aſſociations or Churches Aſſociated for Communion by their officers or dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, for unity ſake. 3. Or elſe it may ſignifie ſome one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris Church that is the Ruler of all the reſt in the world. 4. Or elſe it may ſignifie the Univerſal (Catholick) Church it ſelf, which containeth all the particular Churches in the world.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſt ſhould not have plaid either the blind man or the Jugler by confounding theſe, and never telling us which he means. 1. For the firſt, we grant him that <hi>Rome</hi> was once an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent flouriſhing Church: And ſo was <hi>Epheſus, Hieruſalem, Philippi, Coloſſe</hi> and many more.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond ſence it is humane, or from Church cuſtom, ſo to take the word Church, for Scripture, that I find doth not ſo uſe it: But for the thing, we are indifferent: Though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that in Scripture times <hi>Rome</hi> had any more then a particular Church; yet its all one as to our cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As to the third and fourth ſenſes, we deny, as confidently as we do that the Sun is darkneſs, that ever in Scipture times <hi>Rome</hi> was either a Mother to all Churches, or the Ruler and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris of all, or yet the Univerſal Church it ſelf. Prove this, and I will turn Papiſt.</p>
                        <p>But there's not a word for it in the Texts cited, but an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much againſt it. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>Rome</hi> a Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth its faith. True, but doth he not ſo by the <hi>Theſſalonians, Coloſſians, Epheſians, Philippians, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>John</hi> by the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphians, Pergamus, Thyatira</hi> and others, as well? And will
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55445:151"/>
not this prove that <hi>Rome</hi> was but ſuch a particular Church as one of them?</p>
                        <p>The citation of Proteſtants are done it ſeems by one that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read them, nor would have others read them; which makes him turn us to whole books to ſearch for them, if we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to do, and to miſcited places. But we know that all our Divines confeſs that <hi>Rome</hi> was once a true and famous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, but never the Univerſall Church, nor the Ruler of the world, or of all other Churches, in <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes. Would you durſt lay your cauſe on this, and put it to the tryal? Why elſe did never <hi>Paul</hi> make one word of mention of this Power and honour, nor ſend other Churches to her to be Governed?</p>
                        <p>And now I pray conſider to what purpoſe is the reſt of your reaſoning? What is it to me, whether <hi>Rome</hi> be turned either Apoſtate, Heretical, or Schiſmatical, any more then whether <hi>Jeruſalem, Epheſus, Philippi,</hi> or any other Church be ſo faln? If you are not faln I am glad of it; if you are I am ſorry for it; and ſo I have done with you (unleſs I knew how to recover you.) Would you not laugh even at the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that was truly the Mother Church of the world, if they ſhould thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>[We are not faln away: therefore we muſt Rule over all the world, and no man is a Chriſtian that doth not obey us?]</hi> This is the ſport you make in the cheating of ſouls.</p>
                        <p>Well; but let us follow you, though our cauſe be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. 1. I anſwer, that we accuſe you not of renouncing the name of Chriſt. 2. We muſt needs fear, that according to to your own definition of Hereſie, you are guilty of many Hereſies.</p>
                        <p>And to your Queſtions, I anſwer. 1. I pray you tell us what General Councils did ever condemn one half of the Hereſies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Epiphanius, Auguſtine</hi> or <hi>Philaſtrius?</hi> Was there ever a greater rabble of Hereſies then before ever a General Council was known? and were they dead and buryed before the firſt General Council was born? 2. Did you not ſmile when you wrote theſe deluſory Queſtions? How can a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil condemn you, or any great part of the Church: for inſtance the Greeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you be not there its not a General Council? And will you be there to condemn your ſelves? you have more wit and leſs grace then ſo. And I pray, what General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55445:152"/>
did ever condemn the Greeks, for thoſe many errors charged on them? If the Greeks themſelves were not there, it was not a General Council; ſo conſiderable a part are they of the Church. And what General Council hath condemned the Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, Egyptians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Do you think General Councils are ſo ſtark mad or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly impious, as to condemn ſo many Kingdoms with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for Hereſie? Why, they know that men muſt be heard, before they be condemned, and a Kingdom conſiſteth of many millions of ſouls. And it is not enough to know every mans faith, if we know the faith of the King, or Pope, or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, or Biſhops: And how long ſhall they be examining each perſon in many Kingdoms?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But yet I can ſay more of your Church then of others. He that kills the Head, kils the Man: Your Uſurping Head is an Eſſential part of your New-formed Church: But your Head hath been condemned by Councils; therefore your Church in its eſſential part hath been condemned by Councils. Do you not know that all the world (as well as the feigned Council <hi>Sinueſſan.)</hi> condemned your Pope <hi>Marcellinus</hi> for Offering to Idols? Know you not that two or three General Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> as a Monothelite? Yes: no doubt you know it. Know you not that the ſecond General Council of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> condemned and excommunicated your Pope? And that the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> called by him did the like? If you do not, ſee <hi>Bellarmines</hi> parallel of them <hi>de Conciliis lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. Do I need to tell you what the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did? Or for what <hi>John</hi> 22. <hi>alias</hi> 23. and <hi>John</hi> 13. and other Popes were depoſed by Councils?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And for Fathers, do I need to tell you how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Marcellinus, Liberius, Honorius</hi> and others? How oft <hi>Hilary Pictav. (in fragmentis in recit. Epiſt. Liberii)</hi> doth cry out <hi>Anathema tibi Liberi, prevaricator:</hi> preſuming to curſe and excommunicate your Pope. Need I tell you what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith againſt <hi>Zephernius:</hi> Yea what <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of your own ſay againſt <hi>Liberius, Honorius, Anaſtaſius, Celeſtine;</hi> and tell us that many Popes have been <hi>Hereticks?</hi> At leaſt give us leave to believe <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> the ſixth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Read <hi>Dom. Bannes in 2<hi rend="sup">m</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi> q.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 10. Where he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55445:152"/>
proves at large againſt <hi>Pighius,</hi> that a Pope may be an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and laughs at <hi>Pighius</hi> that now after two hundred years would prove them falſe witneſſes, which write that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was condemned for an Heretick by three Popes, <hi>viz. Agatho, Leo</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſecond.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But perhaps you'l ſay, that <hi>though your Popes have been condemned by Councils, yet ſo have not your maintained doctrines. Anſw.</hi> Yes, that they have too. Did not the Councils at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> condemn the Doctrine of the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council for Image-worſhip, and the Council at <hi>Frankford</hi> do the like? And thoſe two at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were as much General as your Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was, and much more.</p>
                        <p>And yet that ſame Council at <hi>Nice</hi> did condemn the doctrine of St. <hi>Thom. Aquinas,</hi> and your Doctors commonly of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Image of Chriſt, and Croſs, and ſign of the Croſs with <hi>Latria,</hi> divine worſhip.</p>
                        <p>And did not your General Councils at <hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that the Pope is above a Council, and that they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet your General Councils at <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> determine the contrary as an Article of Faith, and expreſly affirm the former to be Hereſie. See then your own doctrine, even in a fundamental point condemned by General Councils of your own (which ſide ſoever you take, the Popes, or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.)</p>
                        <p>And did not the ſixt Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> was a principal member, not only detect Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi> forged Canon of <hi>Nice,</hi> but alſo openly and prevalently reſiſt and reject your Uſurpation, and refuſe your Legates and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to you? If you would cloak this, believe your own Pope <hi>Boniface, Epiſt. ad Eulalium,</hi> ſaying <hi>[Aurelius ſometime Biſhop of</hi> Carthage, <hi>with his Colleagues, did begin, by the Devils inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to wax proud againſt the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in the times of our Predeceſſors,</hi> Boniface and <hi>Celeſtine.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And if you have learnt to except againſt this Epiſtle, ſee your Biſhop <hi>Lindanus</hi> juſtifying it, <hi>Panopl. l. cap.</hi> 89 Or at leaſt believe your Champion <hi>Harding</hi> againſt <hi>Jewels</hi> Challenge, <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> 19. <hi>[After the whole African Church had perſevered in ſchiſm the ſpace of twenty years, and had removed themſelves from the obedience of the Apoſtolick ſeat, being ſeduced by</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius

                           <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Carthage.] Again note, that <hi>Auſtin</hi> was one of them.</p>
                        <p>But you'l ſay, that this was not a General Council: <hi>Anſw.</hi> True; for when part riſeth againſt part, it cannot be the whole that is on either ſide.</p>
                        <p>Moreover do you not know that the Greeks have condemned you oft? And truly their Councils have been much more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral then yours at <hi>Trent</hi> was, where about forty Biſhops alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Canon of Scripture, and made Tradition equal with it. I think verily this one County would have afforded a far better Council of a greater number.</p>
                        <p>But I'le once more name one General Council that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned your very foundation; and that is the fourth General Council at <hi>Calcedon</hi> before mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>Can.</hi> 28. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 16. where you may find, 1. That the ancient Priviledges of the Roman Throne were given them by the Fathers (in Council) 2. That the Reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City. 3. They give Equal Priviledges to the ſeat of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> becauſe it was now become New <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. That the Roman Legates would not be preſent at this act. 5. But the next day when they did appear, and pretended that this act was forced, the Biſhops all cryed <hi>[No man was compelled: Its a juſt decree; we all ſay thus; we all approve it: Let that ſtand that is decreed; its all right.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Here ſpecially note that this General Council thought they needed not the Popes Approbation for the validity of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, when they paſs them, and take them for valid, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of the Pope. Speak you that bear the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to a General Council. Did this Council think that their Decrees were invalid, if the Pope approve them not? You ſee, if you be not wilfully blind, they did not. And who is now to be believed? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and his party, and the preſent prevalent party of the Papiſts, that ſay, Councils not approved by the Pope are invalid or without authority; or the Council of <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> that thought otherwiſe?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Note that the Popes Legates called this <hi>[An humbling, and depreſſing, and wronging of the Papacy, and therefore entred their diſſent: ſee</hi> Bellarmines <hi>Confeſſion lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> notes on this <hi>Council.</hi> Baronius <hi>an.</hi> 451.</p>

8. Note alſo that the ſhifts of <hi>Bellarm. Binnius, Baronius, Becanus, Gretſer,</hi> &amp;c. are apparently falſe, that ſay this Canon was ſurreptitiouſly brought into the Council: for <hi>Aetius, Act.</hi> 16. openly profeſſed the contrary, and all the Biſhops profeſſed their conſent to the laſt.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Note alſo that this is one of the four Great Councils which the Papiſts themſelves compare to the four Goſpels; and in it were ſix hundred and thirty Fathers.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Note alſo that this great Council is againſt them, and on the Proteſtant ſide in the very foundation of all our differences, Whether the Roman Priviledges be <hi>jure divino</hi> or <hi>humano?</hi> And though it be but the Priviledges, and not the now claimed Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that was in Queſtion, yet the Concluſion is the ſtronger againſt them, becauſe the leſſer was denyed.</p>
                        <p>But their laſt ſhift is, that this Clauſe or Canon was not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and ſo is Null. 1. Mark then you that wrote this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, that we have General Councils againſt you; but we want the Popes Approbation. And in good ſadneſs was that the meaning of your Queſtion <hi>[What Council, that is, what Pope condemned our Church?]</hi> Can it be expected that this one man ſhould condemn himſelf? or can you be no Heretick till then?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But let it be ſo this once. Did not your Pope approve of this Council, when <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt did liken it with the other three to the four Goſpels? and ſaid of this <hi>[Tota devotione Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plector: integerrima approbatione cuſtodio] I embrace it with my whole devotion; I keep it with moſt entire approbation] Greg.</hi> 1. <hi>Regiſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 24. <hi>cited in the Decrees, Diſt.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 2. I think this is expreſly a full Approbation, not without excepting any part only, but excluding all ſuch exceptions. And the like Approbation of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in the Roman Council is cited there alſo in the Decrees, <hi>ibid. pag.</hi> 33.</p>
                        <p>I did alſo before inſtance the ſixt General Council againſt you, approved by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Tharaſius</hi> in the ſecond Nicene Council.</p>
                        <p>And indeed it is no hard matter to prove you condemned by your own Popes alſo. If you could but underſtand the plaineſt words in a matter that is againſt your opinions and wills, there needed no talk to perſwade you that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:55445:154"/>
the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop or Patriarch,</hi> profeſſing earneſtly that he was the forerunner of Antichriſt that would uſurp it. But the plain truth is, as ſad experience teacheth us, no words of Fathers, Popes or Councils, much leſs of Scripture, are intelligible to you, when your wills are againſt the matter. But we may truly ſay of you, that lay all on the will of the Pope, as <hi>Auſtins</hi> Obſervator, your <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> freely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>(in ſchol. in Auguſt. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de Civit.

                        <p>Well; but you have a third Queſtion <hi>[By what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was ſhe otherwiſe reproved?]</hi> Anſw. By the Authority of that Precept, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. and many the like. By the ſame Authority that <hi>Paul</hi> reproved <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2. and withſtood him to the face: by ſuch Authority as any man may ſeek to quench a fire in his neighbours houſe, or pull a man out of the water that is drowning: or as any one Paſtor may reprove another when he ſinneth. By the ſame Authority as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> rebuked <hi>Victor,</hi> and the Aſian Biſhops withſtood him, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> reproved <hi>Stephen;</hi> and the reſt aforecited did what they did. By as good Authority as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemneth the Greek Church, doth the Greek Church and many another condemn the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The next caſe is about the Roman <hi>ſchiſm.</hi> To your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, I anſwer, 1. To Queſtion whether Papiſts be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, is to queſtion whether <hi>Ethiopians</hi> be black. Do you not at this day divide from all the Chriſtian world, ſave your ſelves? Do you not unchurch moſt of the Chriſtians on earth (O dreadful preſumption! when Chriſt is ſo tender of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and his ſervants, and is bound as it were, by ſo many promiſes to ſave them and not forſake them.) You ask, what <hi>Church you left? and when was it? and whoſe company?</hi> Senſleſs Queſtions. By a Church if you mean the Univerſal Church, there is but One in all: and therefore One Univerſal Church cannot forſake another: but when part of it forſaketh the other
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55445:154"/>
part, and arrogateth the title of the whole to themſelves, do you doubt whether this be Schiſm? If you mean a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church: How can <hi>Spain, Italy, France,</hi> and many more Kingdoms go out of a particular Church, that contain ſo many hundred particular Churches in them? No more then <hi>London</hi> can go out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Church. The Catholick is but One con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all true Chriſtians on earth: and you have been guilty of a moſt horrid Schiſm, as ever the Church knew. For 1. You have ſet up a Church in the Church: An Univerſal Church in the Univerſal Church: A new form deſtructive to the old. Your Pope as Chriſt-repreſentative is now an Eſſential part of it, and no man is a member of it, that is not a member of the Popes body, and ſubject to him. So that even the <hi>Antipdes</hi> and the poor <hi>Abaſſians</hi> that know not whether the Pope be fiſh or fleſh, or never heard of ſuch a name or thing, muſt all be unchriſtened, unchurched and damned, if you be Judges. Yea and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us (which indeed your Church Conſtitution doth infer) that all that are duly baptized, are interpretatively or implicitely baptized into the Pope.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And as you have deviſed a New Catholick Church: ſo you hereby caſt off and diſown all the Chriſtians of the world that be not of your party: determining it as <hi>de fide,</hi> that none of them can be ſaved; who yet had rather venture on your Curſe and Cenſure, then into your Hereſie and Schiſm.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And hereby you fix your ſelves in this Schiſm, and put us (that unfeignedly long for peace) out of all Hope of ever having Peace with you: becauſe you will hearken to it on no terms, but that all men become ſubjects to your uſurping Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative-Chriſt, which we dare as ſoon leap into the fire as do. Do you know now where the Church or Body was that you forſook? It was all over the world where ever there were any Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Were it not a great Schiſm, think you, if a few Anabaptiſts ſhould ſay, <hi>We are the whole Church, and all others are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or Schiſmaticks?</hi> Or was it not a great Schiſm of the Donatiſts to arrogate that title to themſelves, and unchurch ſo many others? And what Church did they forſake? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tells them over and over what the Catholick Church was that they withdrew from? even all true Chriſtians diſperſed over
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55445:155"/>
the earth: Or that Church which begun at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and thence diffuſed it ſelf through the world. But he never blames them for ſeparating from the Univerſal Roman Head or Vicar: but from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a conſpicuous combination of particular Churches. <hi>Optatus</hi> and he do blame them for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, as alſo from other Churches.</p>
                        <p>What if <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in proſecution of his title of Univerſal Patriarch, had concluded as you, that none in the world are Chriſts members but his members, nor of the Church, but his ſubjects, had not this been a notorious ſchiſm? Tell us then what Church he had forſaken, and anſwer your ſelf.</p>
                        <p>But your laſt Caution in a parentheſis, doth condemn your ſelves. What I Muſt that Church that's true be viſible from Chriſts time? then as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor moſt other were never true Churches (which is falſe) ſo <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was never a true Church (which is falſe alſo) Did you think that there was a Church at <hi>Rome</hi> in Chriſts time? Sure you are not ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. By this Rule there ſhould be no true Church, but that at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Judaea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But ſuppoſe you had ſaid <hi>[ſince the Apoſtles time]</hi> This alſo had excluded moſt Churches on earth. But if you mean the Univerſal Church, we grant you eaſily, that it hath been viſible ever ſince Chriſts time: but not alway in one place or Country. Is not the greater part of Chriſtians in the world, whom you ſchiſmatically unchurch, a viſible company? Doubtleſs you know they are. Yea the <hi>Abaſſines</hi> and many Churches that being out of the Roman Empire, did never ſo much as ſubmit to your Primacy of Order, nor had you ever any thing to do with them (more then to own them as Chriſtians) yet now are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by your Arrogancy, becauſe they will not begin in the end of the world, to enter into a new Church, which they nor their Fore-fathers had ever any dependance on. It was a ſhrewd anſwer of an old woman, that the Emperor of <hi>Habaſſia's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave to <hi>Gonzalus Rodericus</hi> the Jeſuite, preſſing her to be ſubject to the Pope as the Vicar of Chriſt, or elſe ſhe could not be ſubject to Chriſt <hi>[Neque ego, inquit illa, neque mei ſancto Petro obedientiam negamus: in eadem nunc ſumus fide, in quae fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ab initio: ea ſi recta non erat, cur per tot aetates ac ſecula nemo repertus eſt, qui nos errrantes commonerent] i. e.</hi> We are in the

ſame Belief as we were from the beginning: If it were not right, why did no man in ſo many ages warn us of our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror till now?] Mark here a double Argument coucht againſt the Pope, One from Tradition, even Apoſtolical Tradition, (for <hi>Godignus</hi> himſelf ſaith, that no man doubts but <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia</hi> received the faith from the beginning, even from the the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and St. <hi>Mathew.)</hi> The other is, that ſure that Pope that cannot in ſo many ages look after his flock, no not ſo much as to ſend one man to tell them that they erred till about one thouſand five hundred years after Chriſt, was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to be the Univerſal Governour of the world.

                        <p>But we do not hence conclude that all that have lived and dyed in your profeſſion, have been no members of the Church, becauſe that your Church is guilty of Hereſie, and notoriouſly of Schiſm. For we know that millions that live among you conſent not to your uſurpations; Nay do not ſo much as underſtand your errors thereabout. And ſome hold them but Notionally as uneffectual Opinions: And every one is not a Heretick that holdeth a point that is judged Heretical, and which is Hereſie in another that holdeth it in another ſort. And there are errors called Hereſies by moſt, which are not deſtructive to the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Chriſtianity, but only to ſome Integral part. And there is a ſchiſm that doth not unchurch men, as well as a ſchiſm that doth (of which this is no place to treat.) But <hi>ad hominem,</hi> me thinks your own writers put you hard to it, who conclude (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and many more do, though <hi>Alphonſus à Caſtro</hi> and others be againſt it) that Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are no members of the Church. And <hi>Melch. Canus (Loc. Theol. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 117.) ſaith that <hi>[that Hereticks are no parts of the Church, is the common concluſion of all Divines, not only of thoſe that have written of late, but of them alſo that by their Antiquity are eſteemed the moſt Noble; This is atteſted by</hi> Cyprian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Gregory, <hi>the two Councils of</hi> Lateran <hi>and</hi> Florence: <hi>Rightly therefore did Pope</hi> Nicolas <hi>define that the Church is a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Catholicks.]</hi> If this be true, it is an Article of faith: And then <hi>Alphonſus à Caſt.</hi> and all of his mind are Hereticks and loſt men. And I pray you note what a caſe you are in. Two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved General Councils have determined that a Heretick is no member of the Church: But multitudes of your own writers, and Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> and many more of your Popes have judged that a Pope may be a Heretick: and conſequently no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church. And conſequently judge whats become of your Church, when an Eſſential part of it is no part of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Your common ſhift (which <hi>Canus ibid.</hi> and others fly to) is, that <hi>He muſt be a judged Heretick before he is diſmembred.</hi> But 1. Sure that is but for manifeſtation to men; for before God he is the ſame, if men never judge him. 2. Where the caſe is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55445:156"/>
the offendor is <hi>ipſo jure</hi> cut off. 3. Then it is in the Popes Power to let whole millions of Hereticks to be ſtill parts of the Church. And ſo the world ſhall be Chriſtians or no Chriſtians as he pleaſe: and why may he not let Turks and Infidels on the ſame grounds be parts of the Church? For he may forbare to judge them, if that will ſerve. 4. Then all the Chriſtians in the world that the Pope hath not yet judged and caſt out, are members of the Church: And then millions and millions are of the Church that never were ſubjects of the Pope. If you ſay, It is enough that there is a General condemnation of all that are guilty as they are: I anſwer, then it is enough to cut off a Pope, that there was a General condemnation againſt ſuch as he.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But if all this ſatisfie you not, yet I told you before, that two or three Councils and three Popes did all judge Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> guilty of Hereſie (and conſequently both Popes and General Councils have judged that a Pope may be an Heretick) therefore you have been judged Heretical in your Head, which is an eſſential part of your Church.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have ſhewed you what is the ſchiſm of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which being but a part, hath attempted to cut off all the reſt, and ſo hath made a new pretended Catholick Church: As a part of the Old Church which conſiſteth of all Chriſtians united in Chriſt, we confeſs all thoſe of you, ſtill to be a part, that deſtroy not this Chriſtianity: But as you are new gathered to a Chriſt-Repreſentative, or Vicar General, we deny you to be any Church of Chriſt. If you be Church members or ſaved, it muſt be as Chriſtians; but never as Papiſts. For a Papiſt may be a Chriſtian, but not as a Papiſt.</p>
                        <p>And if yet you cannot ſee the Church that you ſeparate from, open your eyes and look into much of <hi>Europe,</hi> and all over <hi>Aſia</hi> almoſt where are any Chriſtians: look into <hi>Armenia, Paleſtine, Egypt, Ethiopia,</hi> and many other Countries, and you ſhall find that you are but a ſmaller part of the Church.

ANother of their Deceits is this: <hi>To charge us with introducing New Articles of faith or points of Religion, becauſe we contradict the New Articles which they introduce; and then they require us to prove our doctrines which are but the Negatives of theirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We receive no Doctrines of faith or worſhip but what was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55445:157"/>
delivered by the Apoſtles to the Church: Theſe men bring in abundance of New ones, and ſay without proof, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from the Apoſtles. And becauſe we refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Novelties, they call our Rejections of them <hi>[the Doctrines of our Religion;]</hi> and feign us to be the Innovators. And by this device, it is in the Power of any Heretick to force the Church to take up ſuch as theſe men call New points of faith. If a Papiſt ſhall ſay, that beſides the Lords Prayer Chriſt gave his Diſciples another Form, or two, or three, or many; or that he gave them ten New Commandments not mentioned in the Bible, or that he oft deſcended after his Aſcenſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them, or that there are many more worlds of men beſides this earth; or that Chriſt inſtituted twenty Sacraments, how ſhould we deal with theſe men, but hy denying their fictions as ſinfull Novelty, and rejecting them as corrupt additions to the Faith? And were this any Novelty in us? And ſhould they bid us prove in the expreſs words of Scripture or antiquity, our Negative Propoſitions, [that Chriſt gave but one form of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he did not oft deſcend, that he gave no more Decalogues, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Is it not a ſufficient proof of any of theſe, that they are not written: and that no Tradition of them from the Apoſtles is proved; and that they that hold the Affirmative, and introduce the Novelty, muſt prove, and not we? Our Articles of faith are the ſame, and not increaſed, nor any new ones added: But the Papiſts come in with a new faith as large as all the Novelties in the Decretals and the Councils, and theſe innovations of theirs we reject Now our Rejections do not increaſe the Articles of our faith, no more then my beating a dog out of my houſe, or keeping out an enemy, or ſweeping out the filth, doth enlarge my houſe, or increaſe my family They do not take all the Anathema and Rejections in their own Councils, to be Canons or Articles of faith.</p>
                     <p>For example, The Pope hath made it an Article of faith, <hi>that no Scripture is to be interpreted but according to the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of the Fathers.</hi> This wereject, and make it no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our faith, but an erroneous Novelty. Do we hereby make a new Article? becauſe we reject a new one of theirs, (yea a part of the Oath of their Church made by Pope <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> after the Council of <hi>Trent)</hi> 1. If this be an Article, prove it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55445:158"/>
if you can. 2. If it be a Truth, and no Novelty, I pray you tell us which be Fathers, and which not? and help us to know certainly when we have all, or the unanimous Conſent. And then tell us whether every man is not forſworn with you that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets any text of Scripture before he have read all the Fathers. or any text which ſix of them never expounded; or any text which they do not unanimouſly agree on? And yet (though it be not our neceſſary task) we can eaſily prove to you, that this is a New Article of your deviſing. 1. Becauſe elſe no man muſt expound any Scripture at all before theſe Fathers were born. For how could the Church before them have their unanimous conſent? And 2. Becauſe that otherwiſe theſe Fathers themſelves wanted an Article of faith, unleſs it was an Article to them, that they muſt expound no Scripture but by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. 3. Becauſe theſe Fathers do few of them expound all, or half, or the twentieth part of the Scripture. 4. Becauſe they took liberty to diſagree among themſelves, and therefore do not unanimouſly conſent in abundance of particular texts. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tell us that they are fallible, and bid us not take it on their truſt. 6. Becauſe the Apoſtles have left us no ſuch rule or precept, but much to the contrary. 7. Your own Doctors (for all their Oath) do commonly charge the Fathers with error and miſexpounding Scripture, as I ſhewed before, <hi>Canus</hi> and many others charge <hi>Cajetan</hi> (a Cardinal and pillar in your Church) with making it his practiſe to differ from the Fathers, and chooſing expoſitions purpoſely for the Novelty; <hi>pro more ſuo, as his cuſtom:</hi> And when he hath highly extolled <hi>Cajetan: (Loc. Theol. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 223.) he adds, that <hi>[yet his doctrine was defiled with a Leproſie of errors, by an affection and luſt of Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, or confidence on his wit, expounding Scripture as he liſt, happily indeed for the moſt part, but in ſome few places more acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then happily, becauſe he regarded not antient Tradition, and was not verſt in the reading of the Fathers; and would not learn from them the Myſteries of the ſealed book]</hi> And in another place he blames him, that he alway followed the Hebrew and Greek text: And many other Papiſts by him and others are blamed for the ſame faults: <hi>Andradius,</hi> and more of the later plead for it. And yet theſe men are counted members of your Church, that go againſt an Article of your new faith and Oath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55445:158"/>
So Tranſubſtantiation is one of your New Articles in that Oath. Do we make a New one now if we reject it? Or need we be put to prove the Negative? And yet we can eaſily do it: And <hi>Edm. Albertinus</hi> (among many others) hath done it unanſwerably.</p>
                     <p>Another of your Articles is, that <hi>[it belongeth to your Holy Mother the Church to judge of the true ſence of Scripture]</hi> And you mean the Roman Church; and that they muſt judge of it for all the Chriſtian world. Prove this to be the Antient doctrine if you can. If we reject this Novelty, are we Innovators? or need we prove the Negative? And yet we can do it, and have oft done it at large. Did <hi>Athanaſius, Baſil, Nazianzen, Nyſſen, Auguſtine, Hierom, Chryſoſtome, Epiphanius,</hi> and the reſt of the Fathers, ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſence of the Scriptures which they expound, or did they procure the Popes Approbation before any of them publiſhed their Commentaries? You know ſure that they did not.</p>
                     <p>The like may be ſaid of all the reſt of your New Articles, and Practiſes: We ſtand our ground. Some of your Novelties we reject as trifles, ſome as ſmaller errors, and ſome as greater: but ſtill we keep to our antient faith, of which the Scripture is a full and ſufficient Rule (as <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſ. ubi ſupra)</hi> though we are glad of all helps to underſtand it, we ſay with <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian de carne Chriſti, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Nihil de eo conſtat, quia Scriptura non exhibet.—Non probant, quia non Scriptum eſt—His qui inſuper argumentantur nos reſiſtemus.</hi>

ANother of their Deceits is this: <hi>They make advantage of our charitable Judgement of them, and of their uncharitable judgement of us and all other Chriſtians, to affright and entice people to their ſect.</hi> They ſay that <hi>we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor be ſaved, nor any that are not of the Roman Church:</hi> But <hi>we</hi> ſay that <hi>a Papiſt may be ſaved:</hi> They ſay that <hi>we</hi> want abundance of the Articles of faith that are of neceſſity to ſalvation: We ſay that the Papiſts hold all that is neceſſary to ſalvation: <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaith that the Kernel of true faith is yet in the Church of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55445:159"/>
                        <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore ſay they, <hi>Let Proteſtants take the ſhell.</hi> And hence they make the ſimple people believe, that even according to our own Confeſſions, their Church and way is ſafer then ours.</p>
                     <p>I have anſwered this formerly in my <hi>[Safe Religion,]</hi> but yet ſhall here once more ſhew you the nakedneſs of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Papiſts denying the faith and ſalvation of all other Chriſtians, doth no whit invalidate our faith, nor ſhake our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Our Religion doth not ceaſe to be true, when ever a peeviſh adverſary will deny it, or accuſe it. Men are in never the more danger of damnation, becauſe a Papiſt or any other partial Sectary will tell them that they ſhall be damned. We believe not that the Pope hath ſo far the Power of the Keyes of Heaven, as that he can keep out whom he pleaſe. We have a promiſe of ſalvation from Chriſt, and then we can bear the threatning of a Pope. When <hi>Bellarmine</hi> judgeth Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> damned himſelf, its ſtrange that he ſhould have a power before to diſpoſe of Heaven for others, and ſhut out whom he pleaſed, that muſt be ſhut out himſelf. The Novatians, Donatiſts, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, or any ſuch Sect, that held the ſubſtance of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, might have pleaded this Argument as well as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: for they alſo have the courage to paſs the ſentence of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon others, if that will ſerve turn: and we have the Charity to ſay, that ſome of them may be ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If by the Papiſts own confeſſion, Charity be the life of all the graces or holy qualities of the ſoul, and that which above all others proveth a man to be Juſtified, and in a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then judge by this Argument of their own, whether our charitableneſs, or their uncharitableneſs be the better ſign: and whether it be ſafer to joyn with the charitable or the uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? yea with them that are ſo notoriouſly uncharitable, as to condemn the far greateſt part of the Church of Chriſt, meerly becauſe they are not Papiſts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we ſay that a Papiſt may be ſaved, it is with all theſe limitations. 1. We ſay that a Papiſt as a Chriſtian may be ſaved, but not as a Papiſt. As a man that hath the Plague may Live; but not by the Plague. 2. We ſay that Popery is a great enemy and hinderance to mens ſalvation; and therefore that thoſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55445:159"/>
among them that are ſaved, muſt be ſaved <hi>from</hi> Popery, and not <hi>by</hi> it. 3. We ſay, that therefore ſalvation is a rarer thing among the Papiſts, then among the Reformed Catholicks: where it is moſt difficult, it is like to be moſt rare: many more of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox are like to be ſaved then of the Papiſts. 4. And we ſay, that where Popery prevaileth againſt Chriſtianity, and ſo much maſtereth the heart and life, that the Chriſtian doctrine is not Practically received, there is no ſalvation to be had for ſuch without Converſion. Thus is it that we ſay a Papiſt may be ſaved. And for my part, I will not be the more uncharitable to them, for fear of giving them advantage. I know <hi>Hunnius</hi> hath written a Book to prove them no Chriſtians, and <hi>Perkins</hi> hath written another to prove, that a Papiſt cannot go beyond a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: and I muſt needs ſay ſo too, of all thoſe in whom Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is predominant practically, and overcometh Chriſtianity. But yet I doubt not, but God hath thouſands among them that ſhall be ſaved: partly of the common people that are forced to forbear contradicting the Prieſts; and that underſtand not, or receive not all the myſteries of their deceit: and partly among the Fryars and Jeſuites, where ſome of them take in the venom but ſpeculatively: or not predominantly and practically give themſelves to Mortification and an holy Life: though I have known none ſuch, yet when I read the writings of <hi>Gerſon, Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis, Thaulerus, Ferus, Barbanſon, Benedictus Anglus,</hi> the Life of <hi>Mounſieur de Renty,</hi> and ſuch others (though I ſee in ſome much of error, and meer affectation, yet) I am eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe, that they had the ſpirit of God, and that there are many more ſuch among them. But I ſhould be ſorry if Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs were not much more common among us, and freer from the mixtures of error and affectation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And for our ſaying that <hi>they have the Kernel, and ſo much as is neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> it is true; but it is the ſame <hi>Kernel</hi> that we hold: and we have it undefiled and unpoyſoned, and the Papiſts mix it with the venom of their Errors. He that hath all things in his meat and drink that I have in mine, may yet make it worſe then mine, if he will put dung or poyſon in it. When you have all things neceſſary in a precious Antidote or other Medicine, you may ſoon marr all, by putting in more then all, as the Papiſts do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:55445:160"/>
The plain truth is, the Papiſts and Reformed Catholicks are both Chriſtians, and Chriſtianity is enough to ſave them that mar it not, but keep it practically and predominantly: even as a man that takes poyſon, and he that taketh none, are both of them men: and he that takes the poyſon may be ſaid to have all the ſame parts and members as the other; and yet not be ſo likely to live, as he that lets it alone: And I cannot ſay but many that take it may recover: and if you ask me <hi>Which be they?</hi> I ſay, <hi>All thoſe that timely caſt it up again, or elſe whoſe ſtrength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prevaileth againſt it, and keepeth it from maſtering the Heart or vital Powers, ſhall be recovered and live:</hi> but thoſe in whom the poyſon prevaileth and is predominant, ſhall die. So all thoſe Papiſts that ſo receive the Errors of Popery, as either to caſt them up again; or that they are not predominant to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of the power of Chriſtian Faith and Holineſs, (by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from being ſincere, and practical, and predominant) theſe ſhall be ſaved, but not the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Now if upon theſe grounds, any man ſhall think that Popery is the ſafer way, becauſe we ſay, that they have all that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation (objectively in their Creed) and that a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt may be ſaved; upon the ſame terms that man may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it is ſafeſt taking poyſon, becauſe that he hath all the parts of a man that takes it, and poſſibly nature may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, and he may live. But yet I ſhall chooſe to let it alone.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſame Papiſts that ſay, that a Proteſtant cannot be ſaved, do yet maintain that an Infidel may be ſaved, or one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the very Articles of the Chriſtian faith. You will think this ſtrange. But I will a little inſiſt on the proof of it, to theſe uſes. 1. That you may ſee, that their cenſures proceed from meer deſign or partiality. 2. That you may ſee, that they make believing in the Pope to be more neceſſary then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt, or in the Holy Ghoſt. 3.

                     <p>I before cited the words of <hi>Albertinus</hi> the Jeſuite. I ſhall now give you many more, and more fully, which <hi>Franſ. à Sancta Clara</hi> hath gathered to my hands in his <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia, Problem.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. <hi>pag.</hi> 109 &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 110. he tells us himſelf that <hi>[the Doctors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly teach, that a juſt and probable ignorance ought to excuſe: and that it is</hi> probable, <hi>when one hath a probable foundation (or ground) as a Country-man, when he believes that a thing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, drawn by the Teſtimony of his Pariſh Prieſt or Parents: or when a man ſeeing reaſons that are probable on both ſides, doth chooſe thoſe which ſeem to him the more probable, which yet indeed are againſt the truth, to which he is otherwiſe well affected: in this caſe he erreth without fault, though he err againſt the truth, and ſo labour of the contrary ignorance] [Hither is it to be reduced, when the Articles of Faith are not propounded in a due manner, as by frivolous reaſons, or by impious men: for then to believe, were an act of imprudence, ſaith</hi> Aquin. 2. 2. q. 1. ar. 4.]</p>
                     <p>So that if the truth of Scripture be ſo propounded as to ſeem moſt improbable, it is no ſin to disbelieve it: and if ſuch are excuſed, as by a Parent or Pariſh-Prieſt are ſeduced, and that have not a due propoſal of the Truth, then it muſt follow, that the Heathens and Infidels are innocent, that never had Chriſt propoſed any way to them, and by their Parents have been taught Mahometaniſm, or Paganiſm. But what if I can prove, that even the want of a due propoſal is a puniſhment for their ſin? and that they ought themſelves to ſeek after the truth? and that it is long of their own ſins that neceſſary truths do ſeem improbable to them? will ſin excuſe ſin?</p>

invincible ignorance in reſpect of the Law of Nature and the Decalogue.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And note for the underſtanding of all this, that this which they call an <hi>Implicite faith in Chriſt,</hi> is <hi>no actual faith in Chriſt at all.</hi> He that only <hi>believes as the Church believes,</hi> and knows not that the Church believes in Chriſt, in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath no actual belief in Chriſt or the Reſurrection at all. <hi>Ignoti nulla fides:</hi> If I believe that one of you is true of his word, it doth not follow that I actually believe the particular propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I never heard. This which they call an implicite Belief, is nothing but the explicite actual belief of the Formal Object of Faith, Divine or Humane, as that God is True, or the Church True and infallible; but it is no belief at all of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular material object.</p>
                     <p>And note that every one in the world that believeth that there is a God, muſt needs believe that he is no Lyar; and ſo hath in God an Implicite belief. Now if this will ſave men, without a particular belief in Chriſt, then Chriſtianity is not neceſſary: Every Turk, and Jew, and Infidel that believeth in God, may then be ſaid to have an Implicite faith in Chriſt, in the Popiſh language; becauſe he believeth all that God revealeth to be true; But if an Implicite faith in God will not ſerve, how ſhould an implicite faith in the Church ſerve; unleſs the Church, that is the Pope, be better then God.</p>
                     <p>See here, whether they make any more of the Chriſtian faith then a meer ſhooing horn, to draw and keep men to their ſide. By a General Council and the Pope it is determined that no man can be ſaved out of their Church; as headed by the Pope: To believe in the Pope is of Neceſſity to Salvation; but to believe in Chriſt, in his Incarnation, Death, Reſurrection, is not ſo. An Implicite faith in the Pope or Church, yea or erring Doctors may ſave, and men may merit by following them in error; but an Implicite faith in God himſelf will not ſave, if we believe not in the Pope. So that if we were Infidels we might be ſaved, ſo we were of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and believed in the Pope: but the Holieſt Chriſtian that believeth explicitely in God, and all the Articles of the faith, cannot be ſaved, if he believe not in the Pope. Do you think they believe theſe Doctrines themſelves? or rather frame them to the building of their Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:55445:163"/>
And what a wonder is it that Learned Doctors ſee not their own contradiction? they ſuppoſe a man to believe in the Pope, or as the Church believeth, and yet not to believe in Chriſt! And is not the Church eſſentially a <hi>company of Chriſtians;</hi> the ſpouſe, and body, and ſchool, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt? And is not the Pope eſſentially the pretended Vicar of Chriſt? How then can they believe in Chriſts Vicar, or Chriſts School, or Kingdom, or followers, before they believe in Chriſt himſelf?</p>
                     <p>And by all this you may perceive the Holineſs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and the nature of that Diſcipline or Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that all the world muſt needs ſubmit to, or be damned. Even ſuch as takes in Infidels and all, and layeth the Church as common to the world, for as many as will but believe in the Pope and Clergy.</p>
                     <p>You ſee here alſo another myſterie opened: that a man may have enough to Juſtifie him, that yet will not ſave him: For moſt of them are here ſaid to hold that a man may be juſtified without an explicite faith in Chriſt, or that the knowledge of Chriſt is not neceſſary to his Juſtification, but to his ſalvation it is (Though the other half ſay, that its neceſſary to neither) And if a man die in a Juſtified State, muſt he be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee alſo here what their Baptiſm doth, that can <hi>ex opere operato</hi> infallibly put away the ſins of all theſe Infidels, and ſo the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet they muſt not be ſaved for all that their ſins are all done away. O what a Maze is the Romiſh Divinity! And you ſee how well they are agreed about theſe fundamentals, when half of them think that <hi>an Actual belief in Chriſt is neceſſary to ſalvation, and not to Juſtification;</hi> and others that <hi>its neceſſary to both:</hi> and a great part <hi>that its neceſſary to neither.</hi> And you ſee here the benefit of having an <hi>Infallible Living judge of controverſies,</hi> and <hi>expounder of Scriptures:</hi> and how admirably he hath ended all their differences.</p>
                     <p>And again I ſay, If formally theſe <hi>Unbelievers</hi> are in their Catholick Church, they ſhall give us leave to ſay that the Greeks and other Eaſtern and Southern Chriſtians are in the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55445:163"/>
Church as we are, when we differ not ſo much.</p>
                     <p>And when they have made the Non-belief of Articles of the faith conſiſtent with ſalvation, they will never while they breath be able to confute him that on the ſame grounds affirmeth the contrary belief conſiſtent with ſalvation, in caſe of the ſame want of teaching and ſufficient means.</p>
                     <p>And by this time I hope you ſee of how ſmall moment the Popiſh Cenſures are, when they judge <hi>that a Proteſtant cannot be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Its true that S. <hi>Clara</hi> here judgeth otherwiſe: but 1. Its ſaid his Book was burnt or condemned at <hi>Rome</hi> for it. 2. He allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Infidels as much. 3.

ANother of their Deceits, and I think the moſt ſucceſsfull of all the reſt is, <hi>Their ſuting their Doctrines, and Government and Worſhip to the fleſhly humours of the ungodly: by which means the Greateſt and the Moſt are alwayes like to be on their ſide:</hi> When on the contrary our Doctrine, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and worſhip is all ſo contrary to carnal intereſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, that we are ſtill like to loſe the moſt, if not the greateſt, and conſequently to be a perſecuted people in the world. This is their unanſwerable Argument: By this means they captivate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their Tyranny. The Moſt are every where almoſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, ſenſual, worldly and unſanctified: Wiſe men and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are few in compariſon of the reſt of the world. And it is the multitude commonly that hath the ſtrength, and the Great ones that have the wealth. So that I confeſs I take it for a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of mercy, that they are not Lords in every Countrey, and that the Reformed Catholicks be not uſed every where as they be in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> For where they have but opportunity to ſhew themſelves, the Principles and Practiſes of the Papiſts
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55445:164"/>
are ſuch, as will be moſt likely to win the Rabble rout to them, and make them Maſters of the multitude, and of all except a few believing Heavenly perſons: (For the flock is little that muſt have the Kingdom.) And then, when they have got the multitude thus to follow them, and club'd the reſt into priſons, or burned them in the flames, they reckon of this as one of the ſureſt Evidences that they are the Catholick Church, becauſe forſooth <hi>they are the greater number</hi> (in the Countries where they have advantage,) and <hi>it is but a few</hi> whom they were able to perſecute or burn as <hi>Hereticks that were againſt them.</hi> The very Argument of the Jews againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons why they have not by this Policie won the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world to their ſide, are (under God, the great Defender of the innocent) theſe four; 1. Becauſe in the Eaſtern and Southern Churches they have not had opportunity to lay their ſnares, as they have had here in the Weſt: And alſo thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have too many corruptions and neglects at home for the gratifying of the worſer ſort. 2. Becauſe God hath been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome places ſo to bleſs the endeavours of the ſmaller part, as to enable them againſt the multitude to preſerve ſome liberty. 3. Becauſe God hath ſometime given Wiſe and Godly Princes to the people, that will not be cheated with the Popular deceits. 4. And principally becauſe that the Papal Tyranny is directly contrary to Princes Rights, ſo that its only thoſe that are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ignorance, or ſtrengthened by an extraordinary league with <hi>Rome,</hi> or forced by the multitude of Popiſh ſubjects and neighbours, that put their necks into the Romiſh yoke. For what by the Popes pretended Power in temporals, at leaſt <hi>in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ad ſpiritualia,</hi> and what by his excommunicating Princes, and his pretended power to depoſe them and give their kingdoms to another, and to abſolve their ſubjects from their oaths and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (which is an Article of their faith, agreed on by the Pope and General Council, <hi>Later. ſub.

The Reformed Catholicks hold, that none ſhould be taken into the Church by Baptiſm, unleſs themſelves, or their Parents, if they be Infants, do make Profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, and of an holy life, for the time to come, and ſeem to underſtand what they ſay and do, and be ſerious in it; which exaſperateth the groſly ignorant and ungodly, when we deny them this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Believers. But the Papiſts admit of the ignorant, ungodly, and ſuch as believe not explicitely in Chriſt, as you heard even now; and ſo pleaſe the people, and fill their Church.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Orthodox hold, that Baptiſm giveth Remiſſion of ſin to none but true believers and their ſeed. The Papiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade many millions more, that all their ſins are not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but actually aboliſhed <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> in their Baptiſm, which is comfortable News to ſuch ungodly ſouls.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Proteſtants ſay, that Original ſin liveth after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in ſome degree; though it reign not, or condemn not thoſe that are true believers; and that Concupiſcence, that is, all inordinacy of the ſenſual appetite, or inordinate inclination to ſenſual objects is a ſin. The Papiſts tell them that when once they are baptized, there is no ſuch thing in them as Original ſin, and that Concupiſcence is no ſin at all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Orthodox hold, that none are to be admitted to the Euchariſt and Communion of the Church therein, but thoſe that believe actually (or profeſs ſo to do) the Articles of the faith, and underſtand the nature of the Sacrament, and live according to the Laws of Chriſt. But the Papiſts give it to all, and drive men to the Sacrament; ſo that <hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> before cited, ſaith, he knows not whether ever any one was kept away in his age.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Proteſtants hold, that men are not to be let alone in ſcandalous ſin, but admoniſhed privately, and then openly before
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55445:165"/>
the Church, and if yet they Repent not, and Reform not, to be caſt out; and not to be abſolved or re-admitted, without a Publick Confeſſion and Penitence anſwerable to the ſin: And this wicked people hate at the very heart, and will not endure. But the Papiſts have got a device to pleaſe them by Auricular ſecret Confeſſion to a Prieſt, where if he will but confeſs and ſin, and ſin and confeſs again, he may have a pardon of courſe without any open ſhame or true Reformation. If we durſt but imitate the Papiſts in this one particular, we ſhould do much to pleaſe the people that are now exaſperated: for I find, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any of them will confeſs in ſecret that they have ſinned, that will not endure the open ſhame.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Proteſtants hold, that every ſin deſerveth death, and that every breach of the Law is ſuch a ſin; (though God will not inflict the Puniſhment on them that have a pardon) But the Papiſts tell us of a multitude of ſins that are but venial, that is, ſins that deſerve pardon, and yet deſerve not Hell, and are indeed no ſins, but analogically ſo called. And they make thoſe to be ſuch venial ſins, which Proteſtants account abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly groſs; as ſome lying, ſome ſwearing in common talk, ſome drunkenneſs, ſome fornication, and the like, are with them but venial ſins, which are properly no ſins (And yet here alſo they are by the ears among themſelves, ſome ſaying that venial ſins are properly ſins, and moſt denying it) Yea all ſins that are not <hi>deliberated</hi> on, are with them but <hi>venial ſins.</hi> So that if they will but ſufficiently brutifie themſelves by ſuſpending the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of reaſon, and will ſwear, curſe, murder, without <hi>delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they are then free from ſin and danger. And how eaſie and pleaſing is this to the ungodly? Thoſe are but Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails with the Papiſts, that are the Precepts or Laws of Chriſt to the Proteſtants.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Proteſtants teach men, that it is their duty to ſeek the underſtanding of the holy Scripture, and to meditate in it day and night: but the Papiſts do forbid the Common people to read it in a language which they underſtand, and ſave them all that labour that Proteſtants put them on: Nothing can win the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more then cheriſhing them thus in ſloth and ignorance.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Proteſtants ſay, that a man cannot be juſtified or ſaved without an actual faith in Chriſt (or being the Infant of a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55445:165"/>
believer Dedicated to Chriſt) and that this faith muſt extend to all things that are Eſſential to Chriſtianity. But what the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts ſay of the Juſtification and Salvation of Infidels, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Pope, you heard in their own words in the laſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</hi> A comfortable doctrine to the unbelieving world, to whom God hath ſpoken no ſuch Comfort.</p>
                     <p>We confeſs that thoſe that never had the Goſpel, are under the Law of nature or works, and that the penalty of this is ſuch as God can in ſome caſes diſpenſe with (or elſe we could not be ſaved by Chriſt) and ſo that all Pagans are not under the Perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory undiſpenſable threatning of the Goſpel againſt final Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unbelievers: But yet, though God may pardon ſome of theſe, he hath made them no promiſe that he <hi>will;</hi> and therefore they can have no poſitive hope grounded on a promiſe; nor can any man ſay, that <hi>God will ſave any of them, or that he will not;</hi> it being certain that they are under the condemnation of the Law, which God <hi>can</hi> diſpenſe with, in wayes of ſecurity to his Juſtice and Ends, but uncertain whether he will or not; and therefore is to be left among his unrevealed things. The true believer is under a <hi>certain promiſe of ſalvation.</hi> The <hi>unbeliever that hath had the Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>might have had it and would not,</hi> is under the <hi>Goſpel ſentence of damnation,</hi> which is <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>irreverſible,</hi> if he die in that Condition. The <hi>negative unbeliever</hi> that <hi>never had or could have the Goſpel,</hi> is under the <hi>Condemning ſentence of the Law</hi> (of works or nature,) that is, <hi>his ſin De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth eternal death;</hi> but this ſentence is not <hi>peremptory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable;</hi> but yet it is ſuch as God <hi>will</hi> not diſpenſe with raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but on terms that may ſecure his Ends and Juſtice. This is the true mean between extreams in this weighty point.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Proteſtants ſay, that all our beſt works are imperfect, and the ſin that adhereth to them deſerves Gods wrath, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of works, though he pardon it by the Law of Grace: and that when we have done all, we are unprofitable ſervants, and properly Merit nothing of God for the worth of our works, or in Commutative Juſtice. But the Papiſts take thoſe very works to Merit heaven, <hi>ex Condigno,</hi> and (for here they are by the ears again) ſay ſome of them, <hi>by the Proportion of the work, and in Commutative Juſtice,</hi> which the Proteſtants ſay, deſerve damnation for their ſinful imperfections, and therefore
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55445:166"/>
need a pardon through the blood of Chriſt. Yea they take theſe works to be perfect, and the man to be perfect, and ſay, that by ſuch works as theſe, they may Merit for others as well as for themſelves. And how eaſie and pleaſing is this to proud cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Proteſtants think, that no Faith Juſtifieth, but that which is accompanyed with unfeigned Love and Reſolution for Obedience. But the Papiſts make Faith that's ſeparated from Charity, and joyned with Attrition, to be ſufficient for admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament, which ſhall be inſtead of Love or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo ſhall put away all ſin.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Proteſtants knowing that God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in Spirit and truth, do teach people a ſpiritual way of worſhip, which Carnal men are undiſpoſed to, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. But the Papiſts do accommodate them by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Ceremonies, Images, and a Pompous hiſtrionical kind of worſhip, which is eaſie and pleaſant to fleſh and blood. To have an Image before them, and Copes, and Ornaments, and abundance of formalities, and to drop ſo many Beads, and be ſaved for ſaying over ſo many <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> or ſuch like words; what an eaſie kind of Religion is this, and how agreeable to fleſh and blood? How much eaſier is it to ſay over their offices, then to Love God above all, and deſire after Communion with him in the ſpirit, and to delight in him, and to pray in Faith, and heavenly fervour?</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Proteſtants tell men of Hell-fire, as the remedileſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe ſins, which Papiſts ſay deſerve but a Purgatory: and they have hopes of coming out of Purgatory; but there's none of coming out of Hell.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Proteſtants tell them of no hope of eaſe or pardon of ſin after this life, if it be not pardoned here. But Papiſts tell them, that when they are in Purgatory, the Pope hath power to pardon them, and the ſaying of ſo many Maſſes for their ſouls, may eaſe them, or rid them out; and the Merits of other folks may deliver them.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Proteſtants tell them, that they muſt be holy for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but Papiſts tell them, that they may hire another man to ſay their prayers for them, which may ſerve turn.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Proteſtants do ingenuouſly confeſs, that they have
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55445:166"/>
no way to end all Controverſies in this life, but that we have a ſufficient way ſo far to decide them as is neceſſary to the peace of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Commonwealth;</hi> but no way for a final abſolute Deciſion, till the day of Judgement. The Paſtors of the Church are to be Judges, ſo far as they are to execute: And the Magiſtrates are to be Judges ſo far as they muſt execute: And every Chriſtian hath a judgement of Diſcerning ſo far as he is to execute. But the abſolute final judgement is reſerved to the laſt day; when God will fully end our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. But this ſatisfyeth not men that would have all in hand, and the ſentence paſt before the Aſſizes: And therefore the Papiſts better fit their humour, and tell them (and they do but tell them) of an End of all their controverſies at hand; of an eaſie cheap remedy by believing the Infallible Pope and Council; and ſo putting an end to all diviſions and doubts.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Proteſtants would have none but ſeeming Profeſſing Saints in their Churches: But the Papiſts Canonize a Saint as a wonder; and ſhut them up in Monaſteries, and call a few <hi>[Religious]</hi> that are ſeparated from other Chriſtians, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians formerly were from the world: which brings the people to think that Holineſs and Religion is not neceſſary to all but to a few Devotaries that will be better then they are commanded to be.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Proteſtants bind men to keep their vows, and fidelity to their Governors: But the Papiſts tell them that the Pope hath Power to free them from their fidelity, and diſpenſe with their oaths.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The Papiſts teach men to faſt: by eating the pleaſanteſt meats: but the Proteſtants uſe a total abſtinence while they faſt, unleſs in meer neceſſity.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The main buſineſs and adminiſtration of Proteſtant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, is againſt that fleſh that is predominant in the unregenerate, and therefore muſt needs be diſtaſtefull to the multitude of the ungodly. Our preaching is to open mens ſin and miſery, and cauſe them to perceive their loſt condition, and ſo to reveal to them a crucified Chriſt, and then to ſet them on the holy ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying heavenly life that Chriſt hath preſcribed them. And to ſpeak terrour to the rebellious, and to caſt the obſtinate out of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55445:167"/>
our communion, and to comfort none as the heirs of heaven, either in life or at death, but only the truly ſanctified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſouls. But for the Papiſts, their Preaching in moſt places is but ſeldome; but they have a Maſs in Latine: And as the old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>[The Maſs doth not bite.]</hi> It galleth not a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſee a Maſs, and here a many of Prayers which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not: And when they do preach, when they ſhould ſhew wicked men their miſery, they flatter and deceive them too often by their falſe doctrine: They cannot humble them in the ſenſe of their Original ſin and Miſery, for that they tell them was quite extinct and done away in Baptiſm: And for their following ſins, Abſolution upon their cuſtomary confeſſions, hath done away all the guilt at leaſt: ſo that here is no Miſery for the Miſerable ſouls to ſee: but like a Conſtables preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at a Seſſions, an <hi>Omnia bene:</hi> Unleſs perhaps ſome groſs actual ſin be apparent among them: and then they ſhall have an Oration againſt it, to drive them to <hi>auricular confeſſion,</hi> and to receive the Body of Chriſt, and be Abſolved. And ſo do they by Ceremonies and Sacraments <hi>ex opere operato</hi> quiet the Conſciences of unſanctified men, and humour them in all their rites and cuſtoms, and at laſt curn them to Heaven or Purgatory with an Abſolution, and Extream Unction. And how pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Religion this is to the ungodly people, thoſe Miniſters can tell, that ſee the rage of ſuch, againſt thoſe that deny them even better Forms and Ceremonies when they deſire them; to pacifie their Conſciences inſtead of real Holineſs and Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Laſtly, how the Jeſuites have fitted their whole frame of Moral doctrine and Caſe Divinity to humour the unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Montaltus the Janſeniſt</hi> will fully ſhew you through the whole (fore-cited) <hi>Myſterie of Jeſuitiſm.</hi> Thoſe that would eſcape any worldly trouble or danger, the Jeſuites have a help at hand for, even their doctrine of Equivocation, and Mentall reſervation (which makes the Popes Diſpenſation with oaths and promiſes needleſs.) What accommodations they have for him that hath a mind to Murder his adverſary, to calumniate another, to take Uſe without Uſury, to forbear reſtoring ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten goods, to commit fornication, to rob another, and many the like, you may ſee in their own words cited in the ſaid Book.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55445:167"/>
Yea what comfort they have for a man that loveth not God, ſo he will not hate him. Truſt not my report, but read the Book; for its worth the reading.</p>
                     <p>So that we ſee the advantage that the Papiſts have to ſweep away the vicious ignorant multitude, and then to boaſt that they are the Catholicks, and we but Schiſmaticks, becauſe they are the greater part: and then they are armed alſo by the Multitude, to oppreſs us by their violence.</p>
                     <p>Now what remedy to uſe againſt this <hi>Fraud,</hi> I cannot tell, but only to deal plainly and faithfully, though it do diſpleaſe, and to adminiſter Gods Ordinances as he preſcribeth, though never ſo diſtaſtefull to fleſh and blood; and ſo to commit our ſelves to God, and truſt him with his Church and cauſe, who is able to preſerve it, and is moſt engaged to appear for us when we lay all upon him, and have none to truſt but himſelf alone. Let us not hearken in this caſe to fleſh and blood that would adviſe us to remit the reins of Diſcipline, and to bend our Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſome pleaſing complyance with carnal minds. We diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage God when thus we begin to ſhift for our ſelves out of his way. But withall we muſt acquaint thoſe Princes that are faithfull to Chriſt, how much it is their duty in this caſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us; not by any cruelty to the Papiſts (that I deſire not) but only by quieting the ungodly part of our People in a ſtate of Catechumens, or expectants, or a Learning condition fitted to their ſtate; and to reſtrain ſuch in the mean time as would take advantage of their diſcontents, to ſeduce them by pleaſing licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious doctrines to their undoing.</p>

ANother of their frauds is, <hi>by culling out all the harſh, unhanſome paſſages, or miſtakes that they meet with in any Proteſtant Writers, and charging all theſe upon the Proteſtant Religion, as if they were ſo many Articles of our Faith: or at leaſt were the common doctrines of our Churches.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They will not give us leave to do ſo by them, when yet we have much more reaſon for it. For 1. They teach the People that <hi>they are bound to believe as their Teachers bid them:</hi> and they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55445:168"/>
reproach us for confeſſing that we are not in all points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine infallible: And yet we ſtill confeſs this fallibility, and ſay in plain terms, that we know but in part. 2. Divers of their particular Doctors that we uſe to cite, are ſuch as the <hi>Pope hath Canonized for Saints:</hi> and they tell us that in Canonizing he is infallible: And therefore an Infallibly Canonized Saint muſt not be ſuppoſed to err in a point of faith. 3. They boaſt ſo much of Unity and Concent among themſelves, that we may the better cite particular Doctors. And yet we think our ſelves bound to ſtand to their own Law in this, and to charge nothing on them as the faith of their Church but what their Church doth own: and therefore while they refuſe to ſtand to <hi>particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> we will not urge them to it: for its good reaſon that all men ſhould be the Profeſſors of their own belief.</p>
                     <p>But what reaſon is there then that we may not have the ſame meaſure from them which they expect? We profeſs to take no man, nor Council of men, for the Lords of our faith, but for the <hi>Helpers</hi> of our faith. They tell us, that they know not where to find our Religion. We tell them it is <hi>entirely in the written word of God,</hi> and that we know no other Infallible Rule; becauſe we know no other Divine Revelation (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing what in Nature is revealed.) They tell us that, <hi>All He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks do pretend to Scripture, and therefore this cannot be the Teſt of our Religion?</hi> I anſwer, that ſo all cavillers, and defrauders and extortioners, may pretend to the Law of the Land, to undo poor men by quirks of wit, or tire them with vexatious ſuits: And yet it follows not that we muſt ſeek another Rule of Right, and take the Law for inſufficient: And what if Hereticks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Tradition, to General Councils and the Decretals of the Popes (as you know how frequently they do) Will you yield therefore that theſe are an infufficient Rule, or Teſt of your own Religion? Open your eyes, and judge as you would be judged.</p>
                     <p>But I will come to ſome of the particular Opinions which they charge us with. And becauſe I know not a more weighty renowned Champion of their cauſe then <hi>Cardinal Richleiu</hi> (then Biſhop of <hi>Lucion:)</hi> I ſhall take notice of his twelve great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which he ſo vehemently chargeth on the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as contrary to the Scripture. And ſure I ſhall do much
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55445:168"/>
to make clean our Churches, if I fully wipe off all the pretended blots of errour, that ſo wiſe a man could charge upon them. In his <hi>Defenſ. contra ſcript.</hi> 4. <hi>Miniſtr. Charenton. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 12. &amp;c. he begins his enumeration thus.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We believe both the words of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James.</hi> that a <hi>man is Juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law, and ſaved through Faith—not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Rom. 3. 28. Epheſ. 2. 8, 9. and alſo that <hi>a man is Juſtified by works, and not by Faith only,</hi> Jam. 2 Did not this Learned man know that we believe all the Bible? why then ſhould he charge us with denying that which we retain, and publickly read in our Churches as the word of God? Did he think that we ſet ſo much by <hi>Luthers,</hi> or any mans writings, as by the Bible? 2. But if he can prove that we underſtand not theſe words aright, he ſhould have evinced it better then by the uſe of the words <hi>[Faith alone]</hi> For our Churches by <hi>[Faith alone]</hi> do profeſs openly to mean no more then <hi>Paul</hi> doth by <hi>[Faith without works]</hi> And can they find fault with <hi>Paul?</hi> 3. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are not all agreed upon the fitteſt Notion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Faith and works in our Juſtification: but our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is more in words and notions then matter, of which ſee my <hi>Diſput. of Juſtification.</hi> 4. And. why do you not quarrel with your own Cardinal <hi>Contarenus de Juſtif.</hi> and others of your own, that joyn with us in the doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Accuſation is, <hi>[The Scripture ſaith, that we can Love God with all the heart: you ſay, that no man can Love God with all the heart, which is no where read in Scripture: and yet do you not reſiſt the Scriptures?]</hi>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55445:169"/>
excludeth all ſinful imperfection:</hi> And thus we ſay, that no man actually doth Love God perfectly in this life: nor do we think he ſpeaks like a Chriſtian, that dare ſay, <hi>Lord I Love thee ſo much, that I will not be beholden to thee to forgive the imperfection of my Love, or to help me againſt any ſinful imperfection of it.</hi> Your own Followers whom you admire as the higheſt Lovers of God, do oft lament the imperfections of their Love (as <hi>M. de Renty,</hi> for inſtance, in his Life.) But now if the queſtion be only of the <hi>poſſe,</hi> and not the <hi>act,</hi> we ſay, that the <hi>Potentia naturalis</hi> is in all: and the <hi>Potentia Moralis,</hi> which is the Habit, is in the ſanctified: but this <hi>Moral Power</hi> is not <hi>perfect</hi> it ſelf, that is, of the higheſt degree, and without any ſinful imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though yet it hath the perfection of ſincerity, and in ſome, the perfection of an eminent degree. And will not this content you?</p>
                     <p>His third Accuſation is, <hi>[The Scripture ſaith, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is the Body and Blood of Chriſt, with the adjunction of thoſe words that ſignifie a true Body and Blood: you ſay that it is not Chriſts Body and Blood, but only a figure, ſign, and teſtimony, which the Scripture no where ſaith.]</hi>

The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture often calls it <hi>Bread</hi> after the Conſecration; which you condemn us for: therefore we are taught to call it ſo. 3. The Scripture ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>[That Rock was Chriſt]</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>[I am the door,</hi> John 10. 7. <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> John 15. 1.] <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>[I am a worm and no man,</hi> Pſal. 22. 6.] we believe all this. But muſt we be therefore reproached, if we ſay, that <hi>David was a man;</hi> that the Rock was Chriſt typically;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55445:169"/>
that he was a Vine and Door Metaphorically only? And yet theſe are as plain as, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This is my Blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His fourth Accuſation is, <hi>[The Scripture ſaith, that Baptiſm ſaveth us, and that we are cleanſed and regenerate by the waſhing of water: On the contrary you ſay, that Baptiſm doth neither ſave us, nor regenerate us, but is only to us a ſymbol of ſalvation, ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and regeneration, which is no where ſaid in Scripture.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A childiſh conteſt about words! we ſay, that two things go to our full poſſeſſion of our ſtate of Regeneration, Juſtification, and Cleanſing: One is <hi>our fundamental Right,</hi> which the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Goſpel gives us upon our <hi>Heart conſent</hi> or Covenant with God: the other is our <hi>Solemn Inveſtiture:</hi> in regard of the former, we are Chriſtians, and Regenerate, and Juſtified before Baptiſm: In regard of the later, we are made Chriſtians, regenerate, juſtified, ſaved by Baptiſm. This we commonly hold, and ſo never denyed what you falſly ſay we deny. As a man is made a King by his Coronation, that yet in a ſort was one before; or as Marriage makes them Husband and Wife by publick ſolemnization, that were fundamentally ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Private Covenant; or as poſſeſſion is given by a Key, a twig and a turf (as I ſaid) of that which a man had right to before; ſo are we ſolemnly inveſted with thoſe benefits by baptiſm, which we had a fundamental Title to before. Do not your own writers confeſs this of a man that is Baptized many years after he had Faith and Charity? Do you think <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the reſt that had the Holy Ghoſt before Baptiſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. had not Juſtification before? Do you think that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great was unpardoned, unregenerate and no Chriſtian till he was Baptized? Or rather would you make quarrels againſt your own Confeſſions?</p>
                     <p>His fifth Accuſation is <hi>[Scripture ſaith, that Prieſts do forgive ſin: on the contrary you ſay that they do not remit them, but only teſtifie that they are remitted, which the Scriptures no where ſay.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> As if <hi>Teſtification</hi> could not be a <hi>Remiſſion.</hi> We ſay, that <hi>whoſe ſins</hi> the Paſtors of the Church <hi>remit, they are remitted.</hi> Do you not know that theſe very words were uſed to every Presbyter in our Ordination here in <hi>England?</hi> We ſay 1. That Paſtors do as Gods Embaſſadors, proclaim his General Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Pardon unto all. 2. That they are Gods Miniſters to make a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55445:170"/>
particular Application, and delivery of pardon in Baptiſm, on ſuppoſition that the Baptized be qualified for pardon. 3. That they are as his Miniſters, to make the ſame Application by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Delivery in the <hi>Abſolution of the Penitent;</hi> on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that their <hi>penitence</hi> be ſincere. 4. And as Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, they may on good conſiderations ſometimes remit ſome humbling diſgraceful acts that were impoſed on the penitent for the teſtification of his repentance, and the ſatisfaction of the Church. And are not theſe four conceſſions enough? Or are you minded to pick quarrels, that your ſelves and others may have fewel for the rancour and uncharitableneſs of your minds?</p>
                     <p>But indeed we do not think that any man can primarily as the chief Agent forgive ſins; but God muſt be the firſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner: Nor that any man can pardon the ſins of the dead, and abate or ſhorten the pains of the ſoul in a fire called Purgatory. Here we leave you.</p>
                     <p>And verily if the Pope have power to remit but the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, he is a cruel wretch that will not forgive men, even good men, the torments of the Gout, and the Stone, and an hundred diſeaſes; nay that will not remit them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no nor the pains of death, when he is ſo loath to die: (But I forgot that the Pope hath no body to forgive him, becauſe none above him) He that connot remit the puniſhments which we ſee, and feel, how ſhall we believe him (without any Divine Teſtimony) that he can remit a penalty that he never ſaw nor felt, nor no man elſe, that can be proved.</p>
                     <p>His ſixth Accuſation is <hi>[Scripture ſaith, If a Virgin marry ſhe ſinneth not: but you ſay that the juſt ſin in all works: which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions not.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do you believe in your Conſcience that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meaneth that a Virgin ſinneth not at all in any circumſtance or defect in the manner or Concomitants of her Marriage? Then I pray tell your <hi>Nuns</hi> ſo, that if <hi>they marry they ſin not.</hi> Tell Prieſts ſo, that if <hi>they marry they ſin not.</hi> Your own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can expect no other ſenſe in the words, but that <hi>Marriage, as ſuch, is no ſin to the Virgin.</hi> And this we grant: But yet if you think that in this or in any other work, you ſee God as apprehenſively, and believe as ſtrongly, and reſtrain every
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55445:170"/>
wandring thought as exactly, and Love God as much as you are bound to do by the very Law of Nature it ſelf; ſo that you are perfectly blameleſs, and need not be beholden to the blood of Chriſt, to the Mercy of God, to the Spirit of Grace, either for the forgiveneſs of theſe failings; or the cure of them, you ſhew then a proud Phariſaical ſpirit, unacquainted with it ſelf and with the Goſpel. Do you go on and ſay, <hi>Lord I thank thee that I am not as other men:</hi> and I will rather ſay, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a ſinner:</hi> and which ſhall be rather juſtified, Chriſt hath told us. The ſtreams cannot be perfectly ſinleſs, till the fountain be ſo: and <hi>[Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> Prov. 20. 9.] <hi>[For there is not a juſt man upon earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not, Eccl.</hi> 7. 20.] Chriſt telleth us that the fruit will be like the Tree, the actions like the heart: and therefore an imperfect Heart will have imperfect duties. If you dare ſay there is no remnant of ſin in your hearts, you have ſo much of it that hindereth you from ſeeing it. Humility and ſelf-knowledge would ſoon end this controverſie. We ſay not that all our works are ſins, that is, either <hi>materially forbidden,</hi> or <hi>done in wickedneſs,</hi> and from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious predominant habits; But that the ſame works which <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially are good,</hi> are tainted with our ſinfull imperfections, having not in them that meaſure of knowledge, faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we ought to have; and therefore that we muſt beg pardon for our imperfections, and fly to the blood and merits of Chriſt, through whom God will accept both our works and us, for all the imperfections, which he pardoneth to us of his grace.</p>
                     <p>His ſeventh Accuſation is <hi>[Scripture ſaith that there are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men and reprobates, that believe in Chriſt: But you contend that they believe not, but have only a ſhadow of faith: which no Scripture ſaith.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Again, a quarrel about the name of faith, unworthy ſerious men! We ſay that Reprobates do believe, and we ſay that they believe not, taking belief in different ſenſes. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ever the Scripture ſaith, even that the Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and tremble: and yet as Believers and Chriſtians are all one, we are loath to call the Devils Believers and Chriſtians; but you may do it, if you pleaſe. As <hi>Belief</hi> ſignifieth a bare uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55445:171"/>
conviction or ſuperficial Aſſent which you call <hi>fides informis,</hi> ſo we ſtill confeſs that the wicked may believe. But as <hi>Belief</hi> ſignifieth our <hi>Receiving of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Coming to him,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted into him as his members,</hi> and <hi>taking him heartily as Chriſt, our Lord and Saviour,</hi> and ſo <hi>becoming Chriſtians and Diſciples:</hi> as it ſignifieth ſuch a faith that hath the promiſe of pardon of ſin, of Adoption, and of Glory, ſo we ſay that the wicked have but a ſhew or ſhadow of it. And this is the ſenſe of the words of <hi>Calvin, P. Martyr, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Danaeus,</hi> whom you cite. And do you not think ſo your ſelves? Indeed you know not what to believe in this, as I have ſhewed in Poſtſcript to my Diſput. of Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>His eighth Accuſation is this <hi>[Scripture ſaith, that there are ſome that believe for a time, and after at another time believe not. You deny that there are any that believe for a time, and then fall from faith, and that he that once believeth doth ever loſe that faith, which is not in any Scripture to be found.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is too light in ſerious matters, to play thus upon words. 1. We ſtill maintain that there are ſome that believe but for a time, and afterward fall away: but we ſay it is but with an uneffectual or common aſſent that they believe, ſuch as you call <hi>fides informis.</hi> Your accuſation therefore is falſe. The <hi>ſemen vitae</hi> and faith that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaks of, in the place which you cite, is meant only of a ſaving faith, ſuch as you call <hi>fides charitate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata.</hi> If any of you think that faith is called <hi>charitate formata,</hi> or juſtifying or ſaving faith, only by an extrinſecal deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, from a concomitant, and that there is no difference in the faith it ſelf between that of the unjuſtified and of the juſtified, you are miſtaken againſt all reaſon. Your own Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers frequently maintain that the will (which is the ſeat of charity) followeth the practical dictates of the Intellect (which is the ſeat of Aſſent.) And therefore according to thoſe Philoſophers, a Practical Belief muſt needs be accompanyed with charity. And thoſe that deny this, do yet maintain that a powerfull clear Aſſent of the Intellect will infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the determination of the Will, though every aſſent will not, and though it do it not Neceſſarily. So that on that account (and in common reaſon) there muſt needs be an intrinſick dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between that Aſſent which prevaileth with the will to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55445:171"/>
determine it ſelf, and that which cannot ſo prevail: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your unformed and your formed faith, have ſome intrinſick difference.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. the <hi>Lutherans</hi> that are half the Proteſtants, do think that juſtifying faith may be loſt. So that (be it right or wrong) you cannot charge this on them all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The reſt which be not of their mind, do hold a brotherly communion with them; and therefore take not that point to be of ſo much moment as to break communion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Are you not at odds among your ſelves about perſeverance? ſome laying it firſt on mans free will, and ſome with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> aſcertaining perſeverance to the Elect, becauſe Elect, and laying it on Gods free Gift; and ſome Jeſuites and School men affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the confirmed in Grace are not only certain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, but that they neceſſarily believe and are ſaved, and cannot mortally ſin (ſtrange doctrine for a Jeſuite!) Of all this controverſie of perſeverance, I deſire the Reader to ſee a few ſheets called <hi>An Account of my Judgement</hi> hereabout.

                     </p>

                     <p>This is more then Proteſtants ſay, And yet will you quarrell?</p>
                     <p>His ninth Accuſation is this <hi>[Scripture ſaith, If thou will enter into life, keep the commandments: You ſay that there is no need of keeping the Commandments, and that he that ſaith, it doth deny Chriſt and aboliſh faith, of which the Scripture ſpeaketh not a word.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Still confuſion playes your game, and you ſtrive
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55445:172"/>
about words. We diſtinguiſh between the <hi>keeping of that Law of Works, or Nature, which made perfect obedience the only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life:</hi> and the keeping of <hi>the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and the keeping of the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> For the two firſt, we ſay that no man can be juſtified by the works of the Law. Is this a doubt among Papiſts, that believe <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles? But as for the <hi>Law of Chriſt, as ſuch,</hi> we muſt <hi>endeavour</hi> to keep it <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> (thats neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti;)</hi> and muſt <hi>needs</hi> keep it ſincerely <hi>(neceſſitate medii)</hi> if we will be ſaved. This all Proteſtants that ever I ſpoke with are agreed in: And dare any Papiſt deny it? If we be not all (nor you neither) agreed on the ſenſe of that text of Scripture, yet are we agreed on the doctrine, and yet you quarrel.</p>
                     <p>His tenth Accuſation is <hi>[Scripture ſaith, that ſome that were illuminated and made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, did fall, and crucifie again to themſelves the Son of God. But you defend, that whoever is once partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, cannot fall from his Grace: which Scripture ſpeaketh not.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſame again: and a meer untruth! We ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that thoſe words of Scripture are of certain truth. But we diſtinguiſh between the common and the ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit. The common gifts may be loſt: we never denyed it: The ſpecial gifts that accompany ſalvation, ſome of us judge are never loſt: others of us think are left only by thoſe that are not predeſtinate, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thought, and your Dominicans think. And what cauſe is here of your quarrell?</p>
                     <p>His eleventh Accuſation is this <hi>[Scripture ſaith that God taketh away, and blotteth out our iniquity as a cloud: and puts our iniquities far from us, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, and maketh us as white as ſnow; You ſay, that he takes not away, nor blotteth out our ſin, but only doth not impute it, and doth not make us white as ſnow, but leaveth in us the fault and uncleaneſs of ſin: which Scripture no where ſpeaks.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is half <hi>falſhood,</hi> and half <hi>confuſion,</hi> raked up to make a matter of quarrel with. 1. Its <hi>falſe</hi> that we ſay, <hi>He doth not take away, nor blot out our ſin, nor make us white as ſnow:</hi> Do not all Proteſtants in the world affirm all this? 2. There are theſe things here conſiderable. 1. The Act of ſin. 2. The Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. 3. The guilt, or obligation to puniſhment. 4. The cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55445:172"/>
or <hi>reatus culpae.</hi> 1. As for the <hi>Act,</hi> how can you for ſhame ſay, that God takes it away, when it is a <hi>tranſient act</hi> that is gone of it ſelf as ſoon as acted, and hath no exiſtence, as <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and all your own take notice. 2. As to the <hi>Culpability,</hi> you will not ſure for ſhame ſay, that God ſo put away, <hi>e. g. Davids</hi> Adultery, as to make it <hi>reputable as a vertue, or not a vice.</hi> 3. As to the <hi>Reatus ad paenam,</hi> the full Guilt, we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it is <hi>done quite away:</hi> and if your eyes be in your head, you may ſee that it is in regard of this guilt and puniſhment that the Scriptures mentioned by you ſpeak (or principally ſpeak at leaſt) For I pray you tell us, what elſe can they mean, when they ſpeak of actual ſins that are paſt long ago, and have no exiſtence. Learned wranglers! would you make us believe, that Grace is given to <hi>David</hi> to put away the Act of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Adultery, ſo that it may be <hi>quid praeteritum, &amp; non jam exiſtens?</hi> a thing paſt and gone, which it is without grace? ſo that when you feign us to ſay, that <hi>God takes not away ſin, but only not imputeth it,</hi> you feign us to make ſynonymal terms to be of different ſences. He takes them away by not imputing them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But if you ſpeak not of the ſence of a particular Text, but of the <hi>Matter</hi> in difference, it can be nothing but the <hi>habit</hi> of ſin that you mean, that we ſay, that <hi>God takes not away.</hi> And here you play partly the Calumniators, and partly the erroneous Phariſees. 1. You Calumniate, in feigning us to deny, that <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſin is done away.</hi> Becauſe our Divines ſay, that it is not the work of meer pardon (which we call Juſtification) to put it away, therefore you falſly ſay, that we hold it is not put away at all: whereas we hold (without one contradicting vote that ever I read or heard) that all that are <hi>Juſtified,</hi> are <hi>Sanctified, Converted, Regenerate, Renewed,</hi> and <hi>muſt live an holy life:</hi> And that all their ſins are ſo far deſtroyed, that they ſhall not have dominion over them: that Groſs and Wilfull ſin they forſake, and the leaſt infirmities, they groan, and pray, and ſtrive againſt to the laſt, and then obtain a perfect conqueſt. 2. But if you mean, that no <hi>degree of habitual or diſpoſitive ſin,</hi> or <hi>abſence of holy qualities remaineth</hi> in the Juſtified ſoul, it is a Pharaſaical error, yea worſe then a Phariſee durſt have owned. And it ſeems this is your meaning, by the words of <hi>Calvins</hi> which you cite.

And dare you ſay that you have no ſin to reſiſt, or purge, or pardon? Are you in Heaven already?

                     <p>You ſee here the Council curſeth all thoſe as intolerable Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, that ſay the Lords prayer, deſiring him daily to forgive or remit their ſins, and yet think that they have no ſins to forgive, yea or that every Saint hath not ſuch ſins. What can a Papiſt ſay to this, but by making Councils as void of ſence, as they feign the holy Scriptures to be?</p>
                     <p>Hus twelfth and laſt Accuſation is this <hi>[The Scripture ſaith, that Bleſſedneſs in the Reward, the Prize, the Penny, the wages of Labourers, and the Crown of Righteouſneſs: you contend that its meerly the free gift of God, and not a Reward, which no Scripture doth affirm]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A meer Calumny, and perverting of <hi>Calvins</hi> words, who often ſaith, as we conſtantly do, that <hi>Eternal life is given as a Reward and Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> But we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Act of God</hi> in his <hi>Goſpel Promiſe,</hi> which is a Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deed of Gift of Chriſt and Life to all that will Accept them, and the <hi>execution</hi> of this by Judgement and Glorification. And
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55445:173"/>
we ſay that it was <hi>Antecedenter meerly of Gods free Grace</hi> that he <hi>made ſuch a Deed of Gift</hi> (the blood of Chriſt being the purchaſing cauſe,) and nothing of our works had a handin the procurement (Dare you deny this?) But that our <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Judgement,</hi> and our <hi>Glorification,</hi> which are the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of the Law of Grace, do make our works the Reaſon; not as having merited it <hi>ex proportione operis,</hi> or in <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> but as having performed the condition of the free Gift, and ſo being the perſons to whom it doth belong. And this is the ſenſe of <hi>Scotus</hi> and of one half of the Papiſts, (for ſtill you are together by the ears) who ſay that <hi>Merit of Condignity</hi> is but <hi>ex pacto</hi> by vertue of Gods Promiſe.</p>
                     <p>And now I leave it to the Conſcience of any ſober Papiſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be guilty in any one point that this great Cardinal chargeth us with? And whether Papiſts and Proteſtants were not in a fair way for reconciliation, if we differed not more in other things then in theſe?</p>
                     <p>And here again I muſt let them know, that Scripture only is the Rule and Teſt of our Faith and Religion. Their <hi>Polidor Virgil</hi> in this ſpeaks truly of us, ſaying <hi>[They are called Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, becauſe they maintain that no Law is to be received in matters of Salvation, but what is delivered by Chriſt or his Apoſtles]</hi> (ſo ſapleſs and putid is their ſcorn of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium quintum.)</hi> If therefore <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> or any man ſpeak in any word amiſs, blame the man that ſpoke it for that word; but blame not all, or any others for it, if you are men. <hi>Auſtin</hi> Retracted his own errors, and which of us dare Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie every word that hath faln from our mouths or pen, before God? How many hundred points do Schoolmen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators charge on one another as Erroneous, among your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? ſhall all the errors of the Fathers be charged on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or all your writers errors upon yours?</p>
                     <p>And that we do well to ſtick to the Holy Scriptures as the ſufficient Rule, we are the more encouraged to think, by the conceſſions of our adverſaries of greateſt Note (as well as by the Teſtimony of the Scripture it ſelf, and the concent of the ancient Doctors of the Church, and the unprovedneſs of of their pretended additonals.) Among others even this great Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 38. <hi>[Nos autem nullam
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55445:174"/>
aliam,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. <hi>As for us we put (or aſſert) no other Rule but Scripture, neither of another ſort, nor totall: Yea we ſay that it is the Whole Rule of our Salvation: and that on a double account, both becauſe it containeth immediately and formally the ſumm of our ſalvation; that is, all the Articles that are neceſſary to mans ſalvation, by neceſſity of means</hi> (N. B.) <hi>and becauſe it medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately containeth whatſoever we are bound to believe, as it ſends us to the Church to be inſtructed by her, of whoſe infallibility it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly confirmeth us.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note here that 1. He grants us that all Articles neceſſary to our Salvation, as Means, are immediately and formally in the Scripture: And then ſurely they may be ſaved that believe no more then is in the Scripture: 2. That we are to believe no Church but that which the Scripture ſends us to, and to believe its infallibility no further then the Scripture doth confirm it. And that the Scripture is our whole and only Rule. O that all Papiſts would ſtand to this! But let them not blame us now for ſtanding to it. Had this Cardinall done no more by Policie and Power then by Diſputing againſt the Reformation, he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been dealt with.</p>

ANother of their frauds is, <hi>By ranking the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants among the rabble of Sects and Hereſies that are in the world, and then asking ignorant ſouls, If you will needs be of any ſect, how many are here before you? and what reaſon have you rather to be of the Proteſtants, then of any other?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed this queſtion is worth the conſidering by a Papiſt, or any ſectary; but the true Catholick is quite out of the reach of it. The Church of Chriſt is one, and but One. This one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church containeth all the true Chriſtians in the world. This is the Church that I am a member of, which is far wider then the Roman Church. The Church that I profeſs my ſelf a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of, containeth three parts; 1. <hi>The moſt ſound and healthfull
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55445:174"/>
part;</hi> and that is the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> 2. <hi>The moſt unſound in doctrine,</hi> though poſſeſt of many Learned men; and that is the <hi>Papiſts themſelves; (not as Papiſts</hi> ſimply, but <hi>as Chriſtians,</hi> though infected with Popery.) 3. The <hi>middle part,</hi> which is ſounder then the Papiſts in doctrine, but leſs learned; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Proteſtants in both: and that is all the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>other Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern Churches</hi> that are no ſubjects of the Pope. All theſe, even all true Chriſtians, are members of the Church that I belong to, though ſome of them be more ſound, and ſome be leprous or lamentably polluted. To theſe I may add many particular leſſer ſects, that ſubvert not the foundation, as ſome Anabaptiſts, and divers others. And will you ask me now why I will not be of another ſect, as well as of the Proteſtants? Why, my anſwer is ready: A Sect divided from the body, I abhor: I am of no Sect, It is the Unity, Univerſality and Antiquity of the Church that are its honourable attributes in my eyes. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants that unchurch all the reſt of the world, and count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the whole Church of Chriſt, do in ſome ſort make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Sect: But where is there any ſuch? I know none ſuch, nor I hope ever ſhall do: And therefore I may ſay that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are no more a ſect, then the Patients in an Hoſpital that are almoſt healed, or then the higher form of Scholars in a ſchool, or then the Merchants or richer ſort of Tradeſmen in a City: And ſuch a Sect God grant that I may be of, even one in the Church that ſhall be of ſoundeſt underſtanding, and of pureſt worſhip, and of the moſt carefull, holy, honeſt life; But ſtill I ſhall acknowledge them of the loweſt form, even them that learn the A. B. C. to be in the ſame School with me: And if they (Papiſts or any others) will diſclaim me, that ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church me, as long as Chriſt diſclaims me not: Nor ſhall it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke me to diſclaim them any further then I ſee Chriſt leading me the way. So that the Papiſts may ſee that if they will deny the Church that I am of, they muſt deny their own, and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
                     <p>But how will they anſwer this themſelves? Seriouſly I profeſs, that beſides their other errors, it is one of the greateſt reaſons why I dare not be a Papiſt, becauſe then I know I muſt be a Sectary. What is a Papiſt but as meer a ſectary as any that retaineth a name in the Church? They are a company of men
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55445:175"/>
that have ſet up a Humane Uſurping Head or Vice-chriſt over the Catholick Church, owning him themſelves, and unchurching and condemning all the Church that will not own him. The Church that I am of is neer thrice as big as the Papiſts Church is. Theirs is but a piece, and a polluted piece, that would divide it ſelf from all the reſt by condemning them.</p>
                     <p>And now I would ſeriouſly deſire any Papiſt living to reſolve the queſtion, If he will needs be of a ſect, and forſake the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, why of the Popiſh ſect rather then another? If becauſe it is the greateſt, I anſwer, its leſs then the whole. If becauſe it is the pureſt, it is one of the moſt impure: If for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, it is founded (as Papal) upon Novelty. If becauſe it is the Richeſt, their money periſh with them that meaſure the Church and truth of Chriſt by the Riches and ſplendor of this world. For my part I cannot help you out of this ſnare.</p>

ANother of their juglings is, <hi>By working upon the peoples natural affections, and asking them, Where they think all their fore-fathers are that dyed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Roman Church? Dare they think they are all damned?</hi> Intimating that its cruelty to ſay their anceſtors are in Hell; and if they ſay they be in Heaven, then there is but one way thither, and therefore you muſt go the way that they went.</p>
                     <p>But a weak underſtanding may eaſily deal with this kind of Sophiſtry, if it be not maſtered by affection. For 1. What if we grant that many of our fore-fathers that dyed Papiſts are in Heaven? Doth it follow that we muſt therefore be Papiſts? No: becauſe it was not by Popery that they came to Heaven, but by Chriſtianity. What if many recover and live that eat not only Earth and Dirt, but Hemlock or Spear-wort, or other poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; muſt I therefore eat them? Or doth it follow that there is no other way to health?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Our fore-fathers were all ſaved that were holy, juſtified perſons, and no others. But among ſo many and great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Popery caſt in their way, we have great reaſon to fear that far fewer of them were ſaved, then are now among the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55445:175"/>
Reformed Churches. And muſt I needs go that difficult way to Heaven, becauſe that ſome of them get thither? Muſt I needs travail a way that is commonly beſet with thieves, becauſe ſome that go that way do ſcape them? This is our caſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If this were a good way of Reaſoning, then may all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Infidels, Mahometans, uſe it, that have been educated in darkneſs. And indeed it is the Argument which the barbarous Heathens uſe, when the Goſpel is preached to them; <hi>[What think you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is become of our fathers? If they were ſaved without the Goſpel, ſo may we.]</hi> The ſtory of that Infidel Prince is common, that being ready to go to the water to be baptized, ſtept back, and asked, <hi>Where are all my Anceſtors now?</hi> And when he was told that they were in Hell, and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians go to heaven, he told them then he would be no Chriſtian, for he would go where his Anceſtors are.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If this be good reaſoning, then we may uſe it much more then you. For we would ask you, where be all our fore fathers that are dead ſince the Reformation? and where be all thoſe that dyed between the Reſurrection of Chriſt and the appearing of Popery, or the prevailing of it in the world? And where be all that die in the Eaſtern and Southern Churches, that are no ſubjects of the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> Have we not as little reaſon to think that all theſe millions of men are damned, as to think ſo of our Popiſh Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Why ſhould we be more fooliſh for our ſouls then for our bodies? I would not be poor becauſe my Anceſtors were ſo: Nor would I have the Stone or Gout becauſe my Anceſtors had them: Nor will I ſay that they are no diſeaſes, for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring my Anceſtors that had them. And why then ſhould I willfully lick up any Popiſh errors, becauſe my Anceſtors by the diſadvantage of the times and of their education were caſt upon them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is not our fore-fathers but God that we muſt follow: It is he, and not they, that is the Lord of our faith and of our ſouls. It will not excuſe us in judgement for diſobeying God, to ſay that our fore-fathers led us the way; Nor will it eaſe us in Hell to ſuffer with our fore-fathers. Chriſt tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. of a Rich man that in Hell would have had his brethren warned, leſt they ſhould follow him: But theſe men would have us to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:55445:176"/>
follow our fore-fathers, even in their ſin againſt God. Whereas the Scriptures conſtantly make it an aggravation of a peoples ſin, when they follow their fathers in it, &amp; take not warning by their falls. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians were redeemed from the <hi>vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, received by Tradition from their fathers,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 7. 51, 52. <hi>[As your Fathers did, ſo do yet which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted?]</hi> Chriſt condemneth the <hi>Jews</hi> for allowing the <hi>deeds of their fathers, Luk.</hi> 11. 47, 48. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 32. Nay God asketh wicked men <hi>where their fathers are,</hi> with a clean contrary meaning to this queſtion of the Papiſts, [Zach. 1. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Turn unto me ſaith the Lord of Hoſts be not as your fathers unto whom the former Prophets have cryed, Turn—your fathers, where are they, and the Prophets, do they live for ever?]</hi> Ezek. 20. 18, 27, 30. <hi>[I ſaid unto their children,—walk ye not in the Statutes of your Fathers, neither obſerve their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor defile your ſelves with their Idols: I am the Lord your God, walk in my Statutes—</hi>30. <hi>Say unto the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> Jer. 44. 9. <hi>[Have ye forgotten the wickedneſs of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers—They are not humbled even to this day.]</hi> The 18. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> is almoſt all of this, that the ſon that followeth his father in his ſins, ſhall die, and he that takes warning and avoideth his fathers ſins, ſhall live. A hundred more ſuch texts there are.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Our fore-fathers might be ſaved that ſinned in the dark, and yet we be damned if we will follow them in the Light, or at leaſt we ſhall be beaten with more ſtripes then they, if both muſt periſh. They had not our means, or liberty: If they had ſeen and heard what we have done, many of them would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes.

                     </p>
                     <p>He begins his proof with a cheat, as groſs as common, even an abuſe of <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. where <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks for the neceſſity of obeying <hi>One in the Church,</hi> meaning a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church,</hi> (as the whole ſcope of his Epiſtle teſtifieth): And this man would make them ſimple believe that he ſpeaks of the <hi>Univerſal Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Reaſons proceed thus: <hi>Firſt</hi> (p. 128. &amp;c.) <hi>he tells us,</hi> that <hi>[the inviſible God thinks meet to Govern the world by viſible men.] Anſw.</hi> And who denies that Chriſt alſo governeth his Church by men?</p>
                     <p>But he concludeth hence <hi>[Num alia ratione,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall we believe that Chriſt doth govern his Church in another way then God governeth the whole world?] Anſw.</hi> Reader, doth not this man give up the cauſe of the Pope, and ſay as much againſt it fundamentally as a Proteſtant? Saith <hi>Boverins [We muſt not believe that Chriſt doth govern the Church in another way then God doth govern the world.]</hi> But (ſaith common ſenſe and experience) <hi>God doth not govern the whole world by any one (or two, or ten) Univerſal Vice-monarch: Therefore Chriſt doth not Govern the Church by any one Univerſal Vice-monarch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His next Reaſon is, <hi>[Becauſe Chriſt was a viſible Monarch once on earth himſelf. And if the Church had need of a viſible Monarch then, it hath need of it ſtill.] Anſw.</hi> 1. Here the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may ſee, that it is to no leſs then to be Chriſts ſucceſſor, or a Vice-chriſt, that the Pope pretendeth. And then the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it were of any worth, would as well prove, that there
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55445:177"/>
muſt be one on earth ſtill that may give the Holy Ghoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and make Articles of Faith <hi>de novo,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> for the Church (with promiſe of Salvation) and may appoint new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and orders in the whole Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why not one alſo to live without ſin, and to die for our ſins, and riſe again, and be our Saviour? And why not one to give us his own body and blood in the Sacrament?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt himſelf doth oppoſe himſelf to all terreſtrial inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitans, ſaying, <hi>[One is your Maſter, even Chriſt.]</hi> And what then? why <hi>[Be not ye called Maſters?

                     <p n="3">3. We do on theſe and many other Reaſons, deny your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. It follows not that we muſt ſtill have a Chriſt on earth, becauſe we once had.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chriſt hath choſen another Vicar (though inviſible) as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls him: and that is, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whom he ſent to make ſuch ſupply as was neceſſary, by various gifts propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the ſeveral ſtates and members of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If Chriſt would have left a Vice-chriſt upon earth, which ſhould have been an Eſſential part, even the Head of his Church; he would doubtleſs have plainly expreſſed it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and deſcribed his Office and Power, and given him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to exerciſe it, and us directions how to know which is he, and to obey him: But there is not a word of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Scripture, (nor Antiquity) when yet it is a point (if true) of ſuch unſpeakable importance.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. You might at well feign, that if it were then neceſſary to have twelve or thirteen Apoſtles, it is ſo ſtill: and if then it was neceſſary to have the gift of tongues and miracles, it is ſo ſtill: which yet the Pope himſelf is void of.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It is not enough for your ſilly wit, to ſay its <hi>fit that Chriſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55445:177"/>
have a Succeſſor,</hi> therefore <hi>he hath one:</hi> but let him that claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo high an honour as to be the Vice-chriſt, produce his Commiſſion, and prove his claim if he will be believed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Chriſt is ſtill the viſible Head of his Church, ſeen in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as much ſeen over all the world, except <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> as ever he was. When he was on earth, he was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at <hi>Rome, Spain, Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. He that is Emperor of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Monarchy, perhaps was never perſonally an hundred miles from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> is no viſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> And if all the world except <hi>Judea</hi> might be without a Preſent Chriſt, then why that may not as well as the reſt, you muſt give him an account, if you will tie him to be here reſident.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And yet if the Pope would uſurp no more Power then Chriſt exerciſed viſibly on earth, it would not be all ſo bad as it is or hath been. He would not then divide inheritances, nor be a temporal Prince, nor wear a Triple Crown, nor keep ſo glorious a Court and Retinue, nor depoſe Princes, nor deny them tribute, nor exempt his Prelates from it, nor from their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seats, nor abſolve their Subjects from their fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor trouble the world as now he doth: He would not exerciſe the power of putting any to death: much leſs would he ſet up Inquiſitions, to burn poor people for reading the Scriptures, or no being of his mind.</p>

He makes Chriſt the <hi>viſible Pope while he was on earth, and</hi> tells us that <hi>Promulgating the Goſpel, ſending Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, inſtituting Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were</hi> Pontificalia munera, <hi>Papal Offices. Anſw.</hi> And indeed was Chriſt a Pope? and is the Pope a Chriſt? Jeſus I know, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> I know: but this Vice-chriſt I know not. If indeed the Vice-chriſt have power to do theſe Papal works, to promulgate a new Goſpel, to ſend out Apoſtles, to inſtitute Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Chriſt did, let us but know which be the Popes Sacraments, and which be Chriſts; which be the Popes Apoſtles, and which be Chriſts; and which is the Popes Goſpel, and which is Chriſts, and we ſhall uſe them accordingly. The <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> will help us to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 134. He comes to prove that <hi>Chriſt hath a Succeſſor:</hi> and his firſt proof is from <hi>Mic.</hi> 2. Let the Reader peruſe it, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55445:178"/>
judge without any help of mine, what proof there is that the Pope is a Vice-chriſt.</p>
                     <p>The next is in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. which ſpeaketh of the return of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Captivity. Let the Reader make his beſt on it for the Pope, for I think it not worth my labour to confute the Papiſts impudent perverting ſuch Texts as theſe.</p>
                     <p>By the way he tells us (as <hi>Card. Richlieu</hi> and the reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do) that <hi>[its no diſhonour to Chriſt to have a Deputy, no more then for the King of</hi> England <hi>to have a Deputy, or Vice-king in</hi> Ireland.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. But our firſt queſtion is, <hi>Whether</hi> de facto <hi>ſuch a thing be?</hi> Prove that Chriſt hath Commiſſioned a Vice-chriſt, and we will not preſume to ſay that he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Thought it ſhould not diſhonour Chriſt, it is ſuch a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent honour to man, as we will not believe that any man hath, that proveth not his claim. It was no diſhonour to the Godhead to be united to the manhood of Chriſt in Perſonal union; but if the Pope ſay, that the Godhead is thus united to his manhood, verily I will not believe him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though we ſhould not have preſumed to queſtion Chriſt if he had done it, yet we muſt preſume to tell the Pope that he is guilty of diſhonouring Chriſt by his uſurpation. 1. Becauſe he ſets up himſelf as Vice chriſt, without his Commiſſion; and takes that to himſelf, that is, Chriſts Prerogative. God ſaith, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed, Hear him]</hi> And the Papiſts ſay of the Pope, <hi>This is the Vice-chriſt, Hear him]</hi> 2. Becauſe the Power of a King is more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, then the Power of Chriſt, it being ſuch as is fit for one meer man as well as for another. But the Power of Chriſt is ſuch as no meer man is fit for. The capacity of the Subject is Conſiderable as Neceſſary to the reception of the form of Power. He that is God as well as Man is fit for an Univerſal Monarchy, when he that is meer man is not. From whence we argue thus.</p>
                     <p>If there was never ſuch a thing by Gods inſtitution as a meer man to be the Chriſt or Univerſal Head of the Church, then there is no ſuch thing to be imagined now: But there never was ſuch a thing: Therefore there is no ſuch—
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55445:178"/>
Chriſt that was the viſible Head was God and Man: when the Pope is ſo, we will believe in him as his Succeſſor.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It would ruine the Church to have built on ſo ſandy a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and to have laid ſo much work on one that is ſo unable to perform it. Doubtleſs common reaſon tells us, that if God made any one man the Monarch of the whole world (eſpecially leaving his Commiſſion as obſcure, as the Popes is, were it any) and ſhould not give him a divine or ſupra-humane ſtrength to execute it, it would be the confuſion of the world. I am not well acquainted with the Power of Angels; but I hope without diſhonouring them, I may ſuſpect, that the due managing of ſuch an Univerſal Monarchy is above their abilities: At leaſt I am confident, it is an honour that their Modeſty and Reverence of Chriſt will not permit them to own, as the Pope doth. If this Vice-chriſt be not a falſe Chriſt, he may apply that of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>[Being made ſo much better then Angels, as he hath by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance obtained a more excellent name then they: For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time]</hi> thou art the Succeſſor of Chriſt, thou art the Univerſal Head of the Church? Whether the Pope will be called the Vice-ſon of God, the Vice-ſaviour, and ſay, <hi>[Let all the Angels worſhip him; ſit thou on my right hand,</hi> &amp;c.] I leave to his modeſty to conſider? But I muſt profeſs here to the Reader, that though my modeſty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of my weakneſs, hath made me ſo ſuſpicious, leſt I underſtand not the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> as to ſuſpend my judgement, whether the Pope be the Antichriſt, the Beaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the reading of their ſerious immodeſt arguings, to prove the Pope to be the <hi>Vice-chriſt on Earth,</hi> doth exceedingly more increaſe my ſuſpicion that he is <hi>The Antichriſt.</hi> For to be <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, as a firſt Apoſtle, is a contemptible thing in theſe men eyes. This is not it that they plead for. <hi>Bellarmine (ubi ſupr.)</hi> expreſly tells us, that the Pope ſucceeds not <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apoſtle. No, it is as a <hi>Vice-chriſt</hi> to the whole Church, as <hi>Boverius</hi> here profeſſedly maintaineth. And this they make the Foundation of their Catholick Church, and the acknowledgement of it Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to every member of it. Which I even tremble to read and think of.</p>
                     <p>Next <hi>Boverius</hi> comes to his proofs from the New-Teſtament. And thoſe are the ſame that I have anſwered (as <hi>Bellarmines)</hi>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:55445:179"/>
in my <hi>[Safe Religion]</hi> and are an hundred times anſwered by our writers, and therefore the Reader may excuſe me, if I put him to no long trouble about them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the old <hi>[Tues</hi> Petrus, <hi>&amp; in hanc</hi> Petram, <hi>&amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> 1. He doth not ſay <hi>[Thou art Chriſt, or the Vice-chriſt, or my Succeſſor, or the Univerſal Monarch of the Church: No ſuch words as theſe.</hi> 2. It is Chriſt himſelf her that is called the <hi>Rock,</hi> and not <hi>Peter. q. d. [Thy name is</hi> Peter <hi>who confeſſeſt me, in alluſion to which I tell thee, that I whom thou haſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed am</hi> Petra, <hi>the Rock upon which I will build me a Church, which the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt.]</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith of the ſpiritual <hi>Rock,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. <hi>That Rock was Chriſt.]</hi> So may I of this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But if it had been ſpoken of <hi>Peter,</hi> it had been no more then is ſpoken of the other Apoſtles, on whom as on a <hi>Foundation</hi> the Church is ſaid to be built, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the head corner ſtone, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
                     <p>But what need we more, if we put not out our eyes, then to find in all the New Teſtament, that <hi>Peter</hi> was never called or taken for a Vice-chriſt by the Apoſtles, (unleſs <hi>Secundum quid,</hi> as every Embaſſador of Chriſt is that ſpeaks his meſſage in his ſtead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.) and that he never is ſaid to exerciſe any Univerſal Government over the reſt of the Apoſtles, nor ſo much as give them a Law, or Convent them before him, or ſend them out, or do any more in Ruling them, then they in Ruling him, nor ſo much as <hi>Paul</hi> did in rebuking him to his face for diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly walking, <hi>&amp;c. Gal.</hi> 2. Yea when <hi>Paul</hi> calls them <hi>carnall</hi> that ſided with <hi>Peter,</hi> though but in the ſame over-valuing way as others did of <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying <hi>[I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I am of</hi> Cephas,] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. He ſaith to them that ſaid <hi>[I am of Chriſt] [Is Chriſt divided?]</hi> as ſhewing that he was the common Univerſal Head and Maſter of them all. But when he mentioneth meer men, he hath no ſuch word: He ſaith not <hi>[Is</hi> Peter <hi>divided]</hi> But implying all in one, he ſaith <hi>[Was</hi> Paul <hi>crucified for you, or were yee baptized into the name of</hi> Paul?] And <hi>[Who then is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo? (implying alſo, Who is <hi>Peter) but Miniſters by whom ye believed as the Lord gave to every man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.] See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 144. <hi>Boverius</hi> playes his game with Metaphors and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55445:179"/>
and ſaith <hi>[The Church is Chriſts Kingdom, an Army, a Sheepfold, a Houſe, a Ship, or</hi> Noahs <hi>Ark; and whats a Kingdom without a viſible King: or an Army without a Viſible General: or a Flock without a viſible Shepheard: or a Houſe without a Houſholder: or a Ship without a Pilot?] Anſw.</hi> 1. The whole earth is Gods Kingdom! And can he not Govern it without a Viſible Monarch? Why then did the world never hear of ſuch a man? Yea the whole world is the Kingdom of Chriſt himſelf, though not in that ſpecial ſort as his Church is: <hi>For all Power in heaven and earth is given him,</hi> Mat. 28. 18, 19. and <hi>for that end he Dyed, Roſe and Revived, that he might be Lord of the Dead and Living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. and <hi>he is made Head over all things to the Chruch, Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23. And hath this Kingdom an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Viſible Monarch? Yes: the Pope is the man: Long hath he laid claim to it. Princes, you ſee whoſe hands your Crowns and Kingdoms are in: Deceive not your ſelves, they are the Popes: For certainly they are all Chriſts; and if he be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, he is the Vice-chriſt, and ſo ſucceedeth him in the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the world. But then why doth not this ſimple Pope lay claim to the Empire of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> and <hi>Tartarie,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as well as of theſe ſmaller Kingdoms of <hi>Europe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. And for the Metaphorical title of an <hi>Army,</hi> I anſwer, It ſufficeth that it hath an Univerſal General in Heaven, that can command it twice as well there as the Pope can on earth, yea and is as Viſible to the Antipodes, yea to me, as ever the Pope was. All the world is Gods Army: But I will not ſay that the Pope or any man is Generall of it (ſave Chriſt) nor will I call him, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. And for the <hi>Sheepfold</hi> of Chriſt, he ahth appointed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Shepheards to watch for the ſeveral parts of the flock. But if one man were to look to all the ſheep in the world, he would make ſuch work as the Pope would do with the ſheep of Chriſt. If you tell us ſtill that Chriſt is out of ſight, I anſwer, He is even <hi>at hand:</hi> he <hi>is coming:</hi> he will not be long: In the mean time it is the duty of every Paſtor <hi>[to feed the flock of God that is among them—not as Lords over Gods Heritage</hi> (as the Vice-chriſt would be:) and when <hi>the chief Shepheard doth appear, we ſhall receive the Crown,]</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                        <pb n="304" facs="tcp:55445:180"/>
never dreamed, poor man, that he was the chief Shepheard himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the Metaphor of a Family, I anſwer, That God can Govern all the Families in the world: and when the Pope can do ſo, then all the world ſhall acknowledge him the Maſter of the Family. Till then we have learned that the whole Family of Heaven and Earth is named of God, and of the Redeemer-God-and-Man: but not of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. And for the ſimilitude of a Ship, I anſwer, One man can Govern a ſhip of the common ſize; but a ſhip as big as all the world, I think no man but Chriſt can govern: And ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent am I in this opinion, that I profeſs I will not be in that ſhip as big as the world which the Pope ſhall undertake to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, if I do but know how to get out of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 146. He goes on to tell us, that <hi>even the bruits have their Governours,</hi> and inſtanceth in <hi>the Bees. Anſw.</hi> I am not well acquainted with <hi>Irrational Governours or Governments:</hi> but ſeriouſly it is no Article of my faith, that one <hi>Bee can Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the Bees in the world:</hi> Nor one Ape all the Apes in the world. Let it ſuffice the Pope that every particular Church be a <hi>Bee-hive,</hi> and every <hi>Hive</hi> have its proper Governour.</p>
                     <p>Next he again tells Prince <hi>Charls [that we ſhould not deny that to the Church which we ſee is neceſſary to all humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties] Anſw.</hi> Was this man in his wits! Have <hi>all Societies,</hi> or <hi>any Society</hi> an Univerſal Humane Governour? Who is it that is the Univerſal Chancellor of all the Academics on Earth? Who is it that is the Ruler of all the Colledges of Phyſitians in the world? I know what Schoolmaſter we have in our own School here; but I never heard of an Univerſal Schoolmaſter for all the world; nor for all <hi>England:</hi> who is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Governour of all the Companies of Merchants in the world? Or who is the Univerſal King?</p>
                     <p>In the Concluſion he gathers up all into ſeven reaſons, <hi>Why the Church ſhould have a Vice-chriſt</hi> [1. <hi>That the militant Church might be like the triumphant, who have one Inviſible Head.] Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt is viſible to the Church in Heaven. 2. When you have proved that any meer man is Chriſt, or Head in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then we will grant that a meer man ſhall be Chriſt and Head on earth. 3. Earth is not yet fit to be conformed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55445:180"/>
in its Government. 4. Is it not the trueſt conformity, that Heaven and Earth have one and the ſame Lord, though viſible to them and not to us, yet ruling us by viſible officers? 5. But if this will not ſerve, lets have on earth a viſible Government: therefore let us have no Pope that is inviſible to almoſt all the world; but Paſtors that are viſible in their particular Churches.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reaſon is <hi>[That the militant Church differ not from it ſelf, but as each particular Church hath one Viſible Head or Paſtor, ſo the whole ſhould have.] Anſw.</hi> 1. Content, if the Pope can ſhew as good a Commiſſion for the whole, and be as able to Govern the whole, and will really be preſent with the whole, and viſible to them. 2. Is the world unlike it ſelf, if all the world have not one King, as every particular Kingdom hath? Or one Schoolmaſter, as every particular School hath?</p>
                     <p>The third Reaſon is <hi>[For preſerving Unity.] Anſw.</hi> 1. And well it is done by you? And what unity will you keep at the Antipodes? Or in the vaſt dominions of Heathen and Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Princes, where Chriſtians are diſperſed, but you come not neer them? 2. We have a better unity already in One God, One Chriſt, One Spirit, One Goſpel, One Baptiſm, One Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. The Mahometans have more unity then you.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Reaſon is <hi>[To fulfill the doctrine of the Prophets and Chriſt.] Anſw.</hi> You ſhould have better ſhewed ſuch a doctrine before you had made uſe of it as a reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The fifth Reaſon is <hi>[That the Chriſtian Church may be like the Jewiſh] Anſw.</hi> When the Chriſtian univerſal Church is no bigger then the Jewiſh, that one may Govern it as well, we will hearken to you: Let the Pope undertake no larger a Circuit.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth Reaſon is <hi>[That there may be ſome one Supream judge to puniſh Biſhops, and define matters of faith, call Councils, extinguiſh hereſies and ſchiſms.] Anſw.</hi> 1. One Chriſt is enough for the Catholick Church for all theſe uſes. I find the Articles of ſaith as well defined by Chriſt, as by the Vice-chriſt. I have ſearcht the writings both of Chriſt and the Vice-chriſt, and in my poor judgement there is no compariſon between them, nor hath the Pope one jot mended the Scripture. 2. And for Hereſies and Schiſms, Chriſt hath extinguiſht many, but
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55445:181"/>
for ought I ſee the Pope rather increaſeth them. In good ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did God ſend <hi>John</hi> the twenty ſecond, <hi>alias</hi> the twenty third, to extinguiſh Hereſies, with all thoſe Abominations and all that Infidelity that was charged on him by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil? And was <hi>John</hi> the thirteenth a Vice chriſt to extinguiſh Hereſies by all that diabolical villany that he was depoſed for by a Council? 3. And for <hi>calling Councils,</hi> they have learnt more wit, ſince <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> have let them know what Councils mean to do by them. Unleſs they can pack up forty or fifty (or what if it were an hundred, or two hundred) as they did at <hi>Trent,</hi> to ſay their leſſon, as it was brought to them from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to call themſelves a General Council for folks to laugh at them. Is this all that we muſt have a Vice-Chriſt for? How many General Councils did the Pope call for ſix hundred years after Chriſt? Tell us without Lying, and let us ſee why he was created.</p>
                     <p>The ſeventh Reaſon is <hi>[That the Divine Inſtitution of Chriſt, and the plain Scripture about</hi> Peters <hi>Primacy may take place.] Anſw.</hi> 1. Where ſhall a man that hath eyes find your pretended inſtitution? The blind may ſooner find it by the half. 2. Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Monarchy are not all one. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can tell you, that its one thing to be the firſt Apoſtle, and another thing to be the Vice-chriſt to the Church Univerſal. <hi>Peter</hi> was none ſuch. 3. No nor was he properly any more the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> then of many another place. <hi>Antioch</hi> claims the inheritance by birth-right, as <hi>Peters</hi> firſt ſuppoſed ſeat, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before them both.</p>
                     <p>Well, Reader thou ſeeſt now how <hi>Babel</hi> is built, and what is the ſtrongeſt ſtuff that the learned Spaniards had to aſſault Prince <hi>Charls</hi> with: For verily I have not bawkt their ſtrength: And were it not for the loſs of precious time to you and me, I would quickly thus ſhew you the vanity of abundance more of their moſt applauded writings.</p>

                     <p>For our parts, the cunning Sophiſters ſhall find us very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable with them in this point: but if they be faln out with Reaſon it ſelf, there's no way to pleaſe them but by turning bruits. And we will not buy their favour at thoſe rates.</p>
                     <p>Our judgement in this point, I ſhall lay down diſtinctly, though briefly, as followeth. 1. The Holy Scripture is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Teſtament and Law of Chriſt. And we ſhall add nothing to it, nor take ought from it. The uſe of it as a doctrine, is to inform us of the will of God in the points there written. The uſe of it as a Teſtament, is to ſignifie to us the laſt will of our Lord concerning our duty and Salvation. The uſe of it as a Law, is to appoint us our Duty and Reward, or Puniſhment; and to be the Rule of our obedience, and in a ſort, the Rule by which we ſhall be judged.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All Laws are made to Reaſonable creatures, and ſuppoſe the uſe of Reaſon for the underſtanding them. To uſe Reaſon about the Law, is not to add to the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſubject muſt have this uſe of Reaſon to diſcern the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55445:182"/>
ſence of the Law that he may obey it. And the judge muſt Rationally paſs the ſentence by it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This is the Application of the Law to the fact and perſon: And though the fact and perſon be not in the Law, yet the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Law to the fact and perſon is no addition to it. Otherwiſe to uſe any ſuch thing would be to add to it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As the fact is diſtinct from the Law, ſo muſt the ſentence of the Judge be, which reſults from both.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. To ſpeak the ſame ſence or thing in equipollent terms, is not to add to the Law in matter or ſence.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Yet we maintain the Scripture ſufficiency <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> in terms and ſence: So that we ſhall confeſs that equipollent words are only Holy Scripture as to ſence, but not as to the terms.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But there is no Law but may many wayes be broken, and no Doctrine but may be divers wayes oppoſed. And therefore though we yield that nothing but the expreſs words of God are the Scripture, for terms and ſence, yet many thouſand words may be againſt Scripture, that be not there expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in terms.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The Law of Nature is Gods Law, and the Light of Nature is his Revelation. And therefore that which the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeeth immediately in Nature, or that which it ſeeth from Scripture and Nature compared together, and ſoundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from theſe premiſes, is truly a revelation from God.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Concluſion followeth the more debile of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, in point of evidence or certainty to us. Where Scripture is the more debile, there the concluſion is of Scripture faith: but where the fact or Propoſition from the Light of Nature is more debile, there the concluſion is of Natural Evidence: But in both, of Divine diſcovery. For there is no Truth and Light but from God the Father of Lights. This is our judgement herein.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Papiſts, you may ſee their folly thus; 1. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the bare words of a Law may be heard in Tryals, then all Laws in the world are void and vain. For the ſubjects be not all named in them; nor the fact-named: And what then have witneſſes, and jurors, and judges to do? The Promiſe ſaith, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> But it doth not ſay that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:55445:182"/>
or <hi>Veronius</hi> believeth: Doth it follow, that therefore they may make no uſe of it for the comforting of their ſouls in the hopes of Salvation: The Threatning ſaith, <hi>that he that believeth not is condemned:</hi> But it ſaith not <hi>that ſuch or ſuch a man believeth not:</hi> ſhould they not therefore fear the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By this trick they would condemn Chriſt himſelf alſo, as adding to the Law in judgement. He will ſay to them, <hi>I was hungry and ye fed me not,</hi> &amp;c. But where ſaid the Scripture ſo, <hi>that ſuch or ſuch</hi> a man fed not Chriſt? It needs not: Chriſt knows the fact without the Scripture. The Scripture is ſufficient to its own uſe, to be Rule of Obedience and Judgement: but it is not ſufficient to every other uſe which it was never made for. The Law ſaid to <hi>Cain, Thou ſhalt not murder.</hi> But it ſaid not to him, <hi>Thou haſt killed thy brother, therefore thou ſhalt die.</hi> It was the Judges part to deliver this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By this trick they would give a man leave to vent any Blaſphemy, or do any villany, changing but the name. But they ſhall find that the Law intended not bare words, but by words to ſignifie things: And if they do the things prohibited, or hold the opinions condemned, what ever names or words they cloath them with, they ſhall feel the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. By this they would leave almoſt nothing provable by the Scripture, ſeeing a Papiſt or Heretick may put the ſame into other terms, and then call for the Proof of that. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they may ask where God commandeth or inſtituteth any one of the Sacraments in Scripture? And when we tell them where Baptiſm and the Lords Supper were inſtituted, they may reply, that there is no mention of Sacraments; and ſo turn real Controverſies into verbal.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Yea it ſeems by this they would make all Tranſlations to be of little uſe. And a man might lawfully ſin in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God for bad it only in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. If this be the way of it, let us remember that they muſt in Reaſon ſtand to their own Rules. Let them tell us then what Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Peter was the Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Head of the Catholick Church: or the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, or that <hi>the Pope is his Succeſſor,</hi> or that <hi>the Pope is the Vice-chriſt, or Univerſal Biſhop.</hi> Where is there expreſs Scripture for
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55445:183"/>
any of this? Yea ſo much as <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Literal ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And why do not theſe blind and partial men ſee, that the ſame courſe alſo muſt be taken with their own Laws? And that all their Decretals and Canons are inſufficient, according to theſe Rules. It's eaſie for any Heretick to form up his Error into other words then thoſe condemned by Pope or Council: And if you go again to the Pope, and get him to condemn thoſe new expreſſions, the men in <hi>Mexico</hi> may uſe them long to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the ſouls of men, before the damnatory ſentence be brought to them. And when it comes, they can again word their Hereſie anew. The <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ſhew how well the Popes deciſion of wordy Controverſies is underſtood, and doth avail. But really if they will hold that no part of the <hi>Popes Laws</hi> oblige but in the literal ſenſe, or that none offend that violate not the Letter, they will make a great alteration in their affairs. And perphaps any of their ſubjects may Blaſpheme the Pope himſelf in <hi>French, Dutch, Iriſh, Engliſh, Slavonian,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe he forbids it only in <hi>Latine;</hi> For if <hi>Tranſlations</hi> be not Gods Word, then they are not the <hi>Popes</hi> word neither. A pretty crochet for a Jeſuite. It is <hi>mendacium,</hi> and not <hi>a Lye,</hi> that the Pope forbids. It is ſaid that a <hi>Traytor</hi> or <hi>Murderer</hi> may be hang'd: but it is not ſaid that ſuch or ſuch a man ſhall be hang'd; or that he was a traytor or murderer.</p>
                     <p>Their common inſtance is, <hi>[The Scripture no where calls it ſelf the whole word of God; nor no where tells us which be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and yet theſe are Articles of Faith.] Anſw.</hi> 1. The Scripture doth call it ſelf the Word of God, and ſignifie its own ſufficiency, and ſeveral Books have particular teſtimonies to be Canonical. 2. Though ſecondarily ſo far as Scripture affirmeth its own Divinity, it be to be beleived: yet Primarily, that this is Gods Word, and that theſe are the Books, and that they are not corrupted, and that they are all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are points of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge antecedent in order of nature to Divine Belief of them. There are two great Foundations antecedent to the Matter of Divine Faith. The one is <hi>Gods veracity;</hi> that <hi>God cannot lie:</hi> The other is, <hi>His Revelations;</hi> that <hi>This is Gods Word:</hi> The firſt is the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of Faith: The ſecond is a <hi>Neceſſary Medium</hi> between the <hi>formal object</hi> and the <hi>ſubject; ſine quo non,</hi> without which there is no poſſibility of Believing. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55445:183"/>
object</hi> called the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> preſuppoſe both theſe, as points of Knowledge, proved to us by their proper evidence. And that this is <hi>All the Word of God,</hi> is a meer Conſequence, from the actual Tradition of this much and no more.</p>
                     <p>To give you an undenyable illuſtration by inſtance. Let us enquire <hi>which be the Adminiſtring Laws of this Common-wealth.</hi> And we ſhall find that 1. <hi>The Authority of the Law-givers is none of</hi> them, for that is in the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> before the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration;</hi> and it is the <hi>formale objectum</hi> of every <hi>Law,</hi> which is more noble then the <hi>Material object:</hi> 2. And the <hi>Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Laws,</hi> is not it ſelf a Law; but a <hi>neceſſary Medium, ſine quo non,</hi> to the actual obligation of the Law. 3. And <hi>that there is no other Laws but theſe,</hi> is not a Law; but a point known by the <hi>non-promulgation of more.</hi> 4. And that all theſe Laws are the ſame that they pretend to be, and that they are not changed or depraved ſince, this is not a Law neither, but a Truth to be proved by Common Reaſon, from the Evidences that may be brought from Records, Practiſe, and abundance more.</p>
                     <p>So is it in our Caſe. 1. <hi>That God is True,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign Rector,</hi> is firſt a point to be known by evidence; the one being the formal object of Faith, and the other the formal object of obedience: and eaſily proved by Natural Light, before we come to Scripture. 2. And that <hi>this is Gods Revelation, or Promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his Law,</hi> is a point alſo firſt to be proved by Reaſon, not <hi>before</hi> we ſee the Book or hear the Word, but <hi>out of</hi> the Book or Doctrine it ſelf, <hi>(propria luce)</hi> together with the full Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Evidence, and many other reaſons, which in order of Nature lie before our Obligation <hi>fide divina</hi> to <hi>believe.</hi> So that this is not Primarily an Article of Faith, but ſomewhat higher, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> of our believing. 3. And that <hi>there is no other Law, or Faith,</hi> is not <hi>Primarily</hi> a Law or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, but a Truth proved by the <hi>Non-Revelation</hi> or <hi>Promulgation</hi> of any other to the world. He that will prove us obliged to believe more, muſt prove the valid Promulgation or Revelation of more. 4. And that theſe Books are the ſame, and not corrupted, is not directly and primarily an Article of Faith, but an Hiſtorical verity to be proved as aboveſaid. And yet <hi>ſecondarily,</hi> Scripture is a witneſs to all or moſt of theſe, and ſo they are <hi>de fide.</hi> But of this I refer the Reader for fuller
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55445:184"/>
ſatisfaction to my Preface before my ſecond Part of the <hi>Saints Reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus it is manifeſt, that it is an unreaſonable demand of the Papiſts to call for expreſs Scripture, for theſe that are not Articles of Faith in proper ſence.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Commonly they deal with women and ignorant people in ſecret, who they know are not able to gainſay their falſeſt, ſillieſt reaſonings.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If they deal with a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> it is uſually with one that hath ſome at leaſt of theſe diſadvantages. 1. Either with ſome young or weak unſtudyed man, that is not verſt in their way of Controverſie. 2. Or one that is not of ſo voluble and plauſible a tongue as others. For they know how much the tonguing and toning of the matter doth take with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. 3. Or with one that hath a diſcontented people, that bear him ſome ill will, and are ready to hearken to any one that contradicteth him. 4. Or elſe with one that hath fixt upon ſome unwarrantable notions, and is like to deal with them upon terms that will not hold. And if they ſee one hole in a mans way of arguings, they will turn all the brunt of the Contention upon that, as if the diſcovery of his peculiar Error or weakneſs were the Confutation of his Cauſe. And none give them greater advantage here, then thoſe that run into ſome contrary extream. They think to be Orthodox by going as far from Popery as the furtheſt; About many notions in the matter of <hi>Juſtification, Certainty of Salvation,</hi> the <hi>nature of Faith,</hi> the <hi>uſe of Works,</hi> &amp;c. they will be ſure to go with the furtheſt. And a Jeſuite will deſire no better ſport, then to have the baiting of one that holds any ſuch opinion, as he knows himſelf eaſily able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. One unſound Opinion or Argument is a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the moſt learned Diſputant. Moſt of all the inſultings and ſucceſs of the Papiſts, is from ſome ſuch unſound paſſages
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55445:184"/>
that they pick up from ſome Writers of our own (as I ſaid before.) And they ſet all thoſe together, and tell the world that <hi>This is the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Juſt as if I ſhould give the Deſcription of a Nobleman from all the blemiſhes that ever I ſaw in any Nobleman. As if I have ſeen <hi>one crook-backt,</hi> another <hi>blind,</hi> another <hi>lame,</hi> another <hi>dumb,</hi> another <hi>deaf,</hi> another a <hi>whoremonger,</hi> another a <hi>drunkard,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhould ſay, that A <hi>Nobleman is a whoremonger, and drunkard,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that hath neither eyes, nor ears, nor limbs to bear him,</hi> &amp;c. So deal they by Proteſtants; And what a Character could we give of Papiſts on theſe terms?</p>
                     <p>But I would intreat all the Miniſters of Chriſt to take heed of giving them any ſuch advantage. By over-doing, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too far into contrary extreams, you will ſooner advantage them, and give them the day, then the weakeſt Diſputants that ſtand on ſafer grounds. Inconſiderate heat, and ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and making a faction of Religion, is it that carryeth many into extreams: when Judgement, and Charity, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, are all for Moderation, and ſtanding on ſafe ground. A <hi>Davenant,</hi> a <hi>Lud. Crocius,</hi> a <hi>Camero,</hi> a <hi>Dallaeus,</hi> &amp;c. will more ſucceſsfully confute an <hi>Arminian,</hi> then a <hi>Maccovius,</hi> a—ſo it is here. The world ſees in the Anſwer of <hi>Knot,</hi> what an advantage <hi>Chillingworth</hi> had by his Principles; when the Jeſuite having little but the reproachful ſlander of a <hi>Socinian name and cauſe</hi> to anſwer with, hath loſt the day, and ſhewed the world how little can be ſaid for Popery.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In this and ſuch Helliſh practiſes as this, they have been more ſucceſsful then in all their Diſputations. But whether the Cauſe be of Heaven or Hell that muſt be thus upheld, I leave to the conſiderate to judge.</p>

What they have done abroad in this way, I leave others to enquire that are more fit; But we all ſmart by what they have done at home.</p>
                     <p>Yet this I may well ſay, that if their own ſecular Prieſts are to be believed, (as <hi>Watſon</hi> and many more) It is their Jeſuites that have ſet many Nations in thoſe flames, whoſe cauſe the world hath not obſerved. And I may well ſet down the words of a Prieſt of their own, <hi>John Brown, aged ſeventy two, in his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Confeſſion to a Committee of Parliament,</hi> as it is in Mr. <hi>Prins Introduct. pag.</hi> 202.</p>
                     <p>Saith he <hi>[The whole Chriſtian world doth acknowledge the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which the Univerſity of</hi> Paris <hi>doth foreſee in two ſeveral Decrees they made</hi> Anno 1565. <hi>When the Society of Jeſuites did labour to be members of that Univerſity:</hi> Hoc genus hominum natus eſt ad interitum Chriſtianae Reipubliae &amp; ſubvertionem literarum. <hi>They were the only cauſe of the troubles which fell out in</hi> Muſcovie, <hi>when under pretence to reduce the Latine Church, and plant themſelves, and deſtroy the Greek Church, the poor King</hi> Demetrius <hi>and his Queen, and thoſe that followed him from</hi> Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>were all in one night murdered by the monſtrous Uſurper of the Crown, and the true progeny rooted out. They were the only cauſe that moved the Swedes to take Arms againſt their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full King</hi> Sigiſmund, <hi>and chaſed him to</hi> Poland: <hi>and neither he nor his ſucceſſors were ever able to take poſſeſſion of</hi> Sweden. <hi>For the Jeſuites intention was to bring in the Romiſh Religion, and root out Proteſtants. They were the only cauſe that moved the</hi> Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>to take Arms againſt the ſaid</hi> Sigiſmund, <hi>becauſe they had perſwaded him to marry two ſiſters, one after the other; both of the houſe of</hi> Auſtria. <hi>They have been the ſole cauſe of the war entered in</hi> Germany <hi>ſince the year one thouſand ſix hundred and nineteen, as Pope</hi> Paulus 15. <hi>told the General of their Order, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Viceleſcus, <hi>for their avarice, pretending to take all the Church lands from the Huſſites in</hi> Bohemia <hi>to themſelves; which hath cauſed the death of many thouſand by ſword, famine and peſtilence in</hi> Germany. <hi>They have been the cauſe of civil wars in</hi> France, <hi>during all which time moving the French King to take Arms againſt his own ſubjects the Proteſtants, where innumerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have loſt their lives, as the ſiege of</hi> Rochell <hi>and other places will give ſufficient proof. For the Jeſuites intentions were to ſet
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55445:185"/>
their ſociety in all Cities and Towns conquered by the King, and quite to aboliſh the Proteſtants. They were the cauſe of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the laſt King of</hi> France. <hi>They were the only projectors of the Gunpowder Treaſon, and their Penitents the actors thereof. They were the only cauſe (namely Father</hi> Parſons) <hi>that incenſed the Pope to ſend ſo many fulminate Breves to theſe Kingdoms, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oath of Allegiance and lawfull Obedience to their temporal Prince, that they might ſtill fiſh in troubled waters. Their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrine to deſtroy and depoſe Kings, hath been the cauſe of the Civil wars, likely to befall theſe Kingdoms, if God in mercy do not ſtop it]</hi> So far the Popiſh Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>You ſee here, if their own pens are to be credited, thoſe very Actions of the Swedes, Germans, French, which they caſt as a reproach in the face of the Proteſtant; (as you may ſee in a Book called <hi>The Image of the two Churches)</hi> were indeed their own, and to be laid at their own doors. I omit abundance of better proof, becauſe I will give them the words of none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this.</p>
                     <p>How far they were the cauſes of the old broils in <hi>Scotland, Knox,</hi> and <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> and all their later Hiſtories will tell you.</p>
                     <p>How buſie they were in <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, the Popes Bulls, and the many Treacheries committed ſignifie. Even in King <hi>James</hi> his dayes, who wrote againſt them, they ſo far prevailed, as to cauſe him to ſwear to thoſe Articles for Toleration of Popery, in order to the Spaniſh Match, which you may read in <hi>Prins Introduct. pag.</hi> 44, 45. Yea ſo far as to prevail with King <hi>James</hi> before the Lords of his Council to ſay, that <hi>[His Mother ſuffered Martyrdom in this Realm for the profeſſion of the Catholick Religion; a Religion which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely profeſſed for many ages in this Realm, confirmed by many great and excellent Emperours, and famous in all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, by an infinite number of Martyrs, who had ſealed it with their blood: that the Catholicks well knew that there was in him a grand affection to the Catholick Religion in ſo much that they believed at</hi> Rome <hi>that he did but diſſemble his Religion to obtain the Crown of</hi> England: <hi>That now he had maturely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the penury and calamities of the Roman Catholicks, who were in the number of his faithfull ſubjects, and was reſolved to relieve them; and therefore did from thenceforth take all his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                     <p>What a hand the Papiſts had in the late Innovations, and wars in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is too evident.

the Proteſtant Religion, and ſet up Popery, and reconcile us to <hi>Rome;</hi> and to that end to attempt the perverting of the King, and to engage us in a war with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and if the King would not be perverted, then to poyſon him.</p>
                     <p>The Jeſuites (of whom four ſorts were planted in <hi>London,</hi> and had built them a Colledge, having Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> for their <hi>Protector)</hi> crept into all Societies, and acted all parts, (ſave the peace-makers,) and being a foreſeeing Generation, they lookt further before them then the ſhort witted men whom they over-reacht. When they had by the Countenance of the Queen got ſo conſiderable a ſtrength at the Court, and ſo much intereſt in the Prelates, and influence on all Eccleſiaſtical affairs, they ſet afoot the foreſaid innovations in worſhip, againſt the Lords Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the foreſaid perſecutions of faithfull, yea and conformable Miniſters; and ſtill they went Dilemmatically to work, thinking to make ſure which way ever things went, to effects their ends. <hi>They ſee that either their firſt attempt</hi> would prevail <hi>without oppoſition</hi> or not: <hi>If</hi> it do, <hi>then the Calvinifts, and Puritan, and Proteſtant Preachers will be removed, and the places filled with</hi> Arminians, <hi>and</hi> masked Papiſts, <hi>and ignorant men, unable to reſiſt them, and ductile world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that will alway be on the ſtronger ſide, and their ends will be eaſily attained. But if there be any Oppoſition, Murmuring, Diſcontents, either it</hi> will provoke <hi>the Diſcontented to open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Reſiſtance,</hi> or not: <hi>If not, their Diſcontents will hurt none but themſelves. If it do, then either they</hi> will be cruſht <hi>in the beginning, or</hi> able to bring it to a war. <hi>If the firſt; then we ſhall have the Day, and this to boot, that they will lie under the</hi> Odium <hi>of Rebellion, and be trod the lower, and be the leſs able ever to riſe: and we ſhall be able with eaſe to drive on the change to a higher degree, in Oppoſition to ſo odious a party. But if</hi> they he able <hi>to make a war of it, either they will be</hi> conquered, <hi>or</hi> conquer, <hi>or</hi> make Peace. <hi>The laſt is moſt unlikely, becauſe Jealouſies and Engagements will preſently be multiplyed, ſo that an apparent neceſſity will ſeem to lie on each party not to truſt the other: And the flames are eaſier to be kept in then kindled: And if ſo unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a thing ſhould come to paſs, yet it muſt needs be to our advantage. For we will openly all appear for the King, and ſo in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>we ſhall be conſiderable: He will remember that he was

But if one part conquer it will be the</hi> King, <hi>or the</hi> Puritans <hi>(for ſo the Proteſtants muſt now be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) If the</hi> King prevail, <hi>then will the</hi> Puritans <hi>be totally trod down, and we by whoſe help the victory was got, ſhall certainly be incomparably better then we are, if not have preſently all our will.

                     <p>And what power and intereſt they had in the <hi>Kings</hi> Armies and Counſels in the wars, is a thing that needs no further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.

Whence came thoſe motions againſt the Miniſtry and Churches into our Councils? Whence was it that ſo many men of note did call the friends of the Miniſtry <hi>[Prieſt ridden fellows]</hi> and the Miniſters <hi>[Iack Presbyters]</hi> to teach the Nation to bring them into ſcorn? I well know that all this came from Hell. But whether by the way of <hi>Rome.</hi> I leave to your inquiry. Yea, whence was it that motions have been made to pull down all the Miniſtry at once?

I know the Papiſts are not for ſuch liberty in <hi>Spain,</hi> or any where, where they can hinder it: but with all I know, that it is one of their fundamentals, that ſuch matters belong only to the Pope and Prelates, and Magiſtrates muſt but be their Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; and I know that its truly the Magiſtrates Power for which the uſurping Pope contendeth: and I know that the Papiſts are moſt Zealous for Liberty of Conſcience in <hi>England,</hi> though deadly enemies to it elſewhere.</p>

3. And whence came the <hi>Hiders</hi> Body of Divinity, that hath infected ſo many high and low? How come ſo many called <hi>Seekers</hi> to ſeem to be at a loſs; whether there be any Scripture, Church, or Miniſtry? or which be they?</p>

                     <p n="7">7. And where are the ſwarms of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuites and Fryars, that are known to have emptyed themſelves upon us from their Colledges beyond Sea?</p>
                     <p n="8">8. How came it to paſs, that the Petitions of the Proteſtant Presbyters of <hi>London,</hi> and of other Proteſtants for the Life of the King, could not be heard? but that the Levelling party car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on their work, till they had ſet the forreign and domeſtick Papiſts on reproaching the Proteſtants as King-killers? and had (though very falſely) turned the odium of that horrid kind of crime upon the innocent Proteſtants, which the Papiſts are known to be moſt deeply guilty of: And now in all Nations they make the ignorant people believe, that the death of that King was the work of the Proteſtants or Presbyterians, and the blot of their Religion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Whence came it to paſs, that Levelling went on with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſucceſs till the Houſe of Lords, with the Regal Office was taken down, and an engagement put (on all thoſe ductile ſouls that would take it) to be [True to the Common-wealth, as eſtabliſhed without a King or Houſe of Lords?]</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Whence came it that the Weekly News Books contained the Letters of the Agents of the Agitators from <hi>France,</hi> telling us how good men the Jeſuites were, and how agreeable to them in their principles for a Democracy, (which they vainly call a Republick, as if there were no Common-wealth, but a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy) and telling us what exceeding meet materials for ſuch a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55445:188"/>
Common-wealth the Jeſuites would be. The Agencies of particular men with Jeſuites I ſhall purpoſely omit.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Whence came it that all the maddeſt dividing parties had their liberty; and the reproach and envy was moſt againſt the united Miniſtry? and if the Lord Protector had not ſtept in, they had been likely to be taken down.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And whence came it that <hi>Sexby,</hi> and others, that have been Souldiers in our Armies, have confederated with <hi>Spain</hi> to murder the Lord Protector? And whence came their Jeſuitical Treaſonable Pamphlets (ſuch as Killing no Murder) provoking men to take away his life?</p>
                     <p>Much more may be propoſed tending to a diſcovery, how far the Papiſts have crept in among us, and had to do in our affairs. But I think God hath yet much more in ſeaſon to diſcover. Truth is the daughter of time.</p>
                     <p>As concerning the death of the King, I ſhall not meddle at this time with the Cauſe, nor meddle with the Reaſons brought for it or againſt it. But, ſuppoſe as bad of it as you can, the Providence of God hath ſo contrived it, that nothing but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or blind malice can lay it upon the Proteſtants, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal, or Presbyterian, that ſtrove ſo much againſt it, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo much for it as they have done. When many on the other ſide, charged the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the impriſoned Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> with thoſe that were put to death, for going too far on the other ſide, in manifeſting their diſtaſtes: Of which I take not on me to be judge, but mention it only as Evidence that clears them from the deed.</p>
                     <p>And to vindicate the Proteſtants openly before all the world, and to all poſterity, from that Fact, it is moſt publikely known, 1. That both Houſes of Parliament in their Proteſtations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves and the Nations, to be true to the King. 2. That they openly profeſſed to mannage their war for King and Parliament: Not againſt his Perſon or Authority, but againſt Delinquents that were fled from Juſtice, and againſt evill Counſellors. 3. That the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> did in the midſt of the wars ſwear in the Solemn League and Covenant to he true to the King. 4. That the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, Commanders, Miniſters and people through the Land, profeſſed openly to go only on theſe terms, as managing but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55445:189"/>
war againſt the Kings miſcarriages, but an Offenſive againſt Delinquent ſubjects. 5. In that it was known that the Army was quite altered (not only by a new modelling, but) by an inteſtine Jeſuitical corrupting of multitudes of the Souldiers, before this Odious fact could be done. 6. And it was known, that the corrupted part of the Army, though the fewer, did ſo excell the reſt in induſtry and activity, that thereby they hindered their oppoſition. 7. And it is known that the Jeſuited part (that afterward ſo many of them turn'd <hi>Levellers)</hi> did draw into them the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Libertines,</hi> and other Sects, upon a conjunction of <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and by many ſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes, eſpecially tying all together by the predicated Liberty for all Religions. 8. And yet after all this, the world knows they were fain before they could accompliſh it, to Maſter the City of <hi>London,</hi> to Maſter the Parliament, to impriſon and caſt out the Members, and to retain but a few that were partly of their mind, and partly ſeduced or over-awed by them, to joyn with them in the work. 9. It is known that before they were put out, and impriſoned by the Army, the Commons voted the Kings Conceſſions in the Treaty to be ſo far ſatisfactory, as that they would have proceeded on them towards a full Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. See Mr. <hi>Prins</hi> large Speech in the Houſe to that end. And if they had not ſuddenly been ſecluded and impriſoned, they had agreed with the King. 10. And it is well known to all that dwell in <hi>England,</hi> that before and ſince the doing of it, the thing is diſowned, diſtaſted and deteſted by the main Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, Nobility, Gentlemen, Miniſters and people: Yea, to my knowledge multitudes that are now firm and loyal to the preſent Power, ſuppoſing it to be ſet over us by God, (and therefore would abhor the like practiſes againſt them) do yet deteſt that fact that intervened and made way to it. So that experience may ſatisfie all men, that Proteſtants, even thoſe called <hi>Puritans,</hi> were the <hi>Enemies,</hi> and not the <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> of it. 11. And it is well known how the Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that had engaged in the war for King and Parliament, were ſo great Adverſaries to the putting of the King to death, that they oppoſed it, and diſſwaded from it, and thereby drew the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Corrupted part of the Army upon them; and that the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters unanimouſly concuered in an Addreſs to
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55445:189"/>
the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to prevent it, and printed their abhorrence of it, and publiſhed it to the world: And that many of them were impriſoned, and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> beheaded, and many others put to death, or other ſufferings, for being againſt theſe deſigns, and endeavouring to oppoſe the progreſs of them. 12. And laſtly, it is known, that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> diſowned it from firſt to laſt, and ſo far proceeded in oppoſition to it, and in adheſion to the ancient line, as coſt them the miſeries of a grievous war, and a conqueſt of their Kingdom. I ſpeak but of the matter of fact that is known to the world. So that it is againſt all humane Reaſon and Equity, that when we have all ſworn to the contrary, and endeavoured it, and the Parliament men of one Kingdom are ſecluded, and Impriſoned for it, and the other Kingdom conquered for it, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſtill generally diſown it, that yet it ſhould be charged on the Proteſtants, or their Religion, that they put to death their King. This is moſt unreaſonable in juſtice; eſpecially from thoſe men that were the cauſers of it.</p>
                     <p>I do therefore leave it here to poſterity (having been my ſelf a member of the Army four years, or thereabouts) that it was utterly againſt the mind and thoughts of Proteſtants, and thoſe that they called <hi>Puritans,</hi> to put the King to death; the twelve Evidences fore-mentioned are undenyable Arguments that it was the work of <hi>Papiſts, Libertines, Vaniſts,</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> and that the Proteſtants deeply ſuffered by oppoſing it; as the face of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſadly teſtifie to this day. And yet (though we have ſuch open Evidence that this cannot be charged on our Religion or us), I muſt needs adde, that every wiſe man ſees that the Caſe it ſelf much differs from the Papiſts. If the Body of a Common-wealth, or thoſe that have part in the Legiſlative Power, and ſo in the Supremacy, ſhould unwillingly be engaged in a war with the Prince, and after many years blood and deſolations, judicially take away his life as guilty of all this blood, and not to be truſted any more with Government, and all this they do, not as private men, but as the remaining Soveraign Power, and ſay they do it according to the Laws; undoubtedly this caſe doth very much differ from the Powder-plot, or Papiſts murdering of Kings, and teaching that its lawful for a private hand to do
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55445:190"/>
it, if he be but an Heretick, or be but depoſed, yea or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Pope. <hi>A war</hi> and a <hi>treacherous murder</hi> are not all one: Nor is <hi>a part of the Soveraign Power</hi> all one with a <hi>private hand,</hi> or <hi>forreign Prelate,</hi> pretending to a Dominion over the lives and ſtates of Princes, and over the Kingdoms of the world, and that the <hi>Vice-chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Vice-God</hi> on earth.</p>
                     <p>It is a grievous caſe that the Senate or Body of a Nation ſhould think themſelves neceſſitated to defend themſelves, and the Church and State againſt their Prince, or any that act by his commands. It will ſtrongly tempt them to think that the end is to be preferred before the Means; and that it ceaſeth to be a Means which is againſt and deſtructive to the End: and that it is eſſentiall to a Governing Power to be for the common good: and therefore that it is no Authority which is uſed againſt it: It will tempt them alſo to think that God never gave power to any againſt himſelf or above his Laws, or againſt the Ends of Government. And a Senate or the Body of a Nation will be apt to think themſelves fit to diſcern when the publick ſafety is dangerouſly aſſaulted; and will hardly be brought to truſt any One to be the final Judge of their Neceſſity, as thinking ſuch a publike Neceſſity proves it ſelf, and needs no judge but ſence and reaſon to diſcern it. And if they alſo think that the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution of the Government doth make the Senate the higheſt Judge of the ſafety or danger of the Republick, and ſo that the Law is on their ſide, and that it is Treaſon againſt the Common-wealth (and as Politicians ſay, againſt the <hi>Majeſtas Realis)</hi> to riſe againſt them; the temptation then is much the ſtronger. And where the Legiſlative power, and higheſt Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power is by the Conſtitution of the Government divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and Senate, and ſo the Soveraignty divided, many will be ready to think with <hi>Grotius de jure Belli, lib.</hi> 1. §. 13. <hi>p.</hi> 91. that the Prince invading the Senates right, may juſtly be reſiſted, and may loſe his right: <hi>Quod locum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius) habere cenſeo, etiamſi dictum ſit, belli poteſtatem penes Regem fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: Id exim de bello externo intelligendum eſt: cum alioqui quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Imperii ſummi jus partem habeat, non poſſit, non jus habere, eam partem tuendi. Quod ubi fit, poteſt Rex etiam ſuam Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii partem belli jure amittere.]</hi> And indeed when a war is once begun, the difficulty of re-uniting is exceeding great:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55445:190"/>
If a Prince engage either hired ſtrangers, or fugitives, or home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred delinquents, or others, to riſe up againſt the Senate or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either its lawfull to Defend themſelves by Arms; or not. If not (eſpecially if they have a ſhare in the Soveraignty) then is his power abſolute and unlimited, and neither Laws nor any thing below are any ſecurity againſt his will to the common ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (The contrary whereto our late King declared in his nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwer to the nineteen Propoſitions.) But if their Defence be lawfull, then if their Souldiers muſt know before hand, that if they do purchaſe a victory by their blood, when they have all done they muſt be all Governed by him whom they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and lye at his Mercy, they would hardly ever have an Army to defend them: For who will do the utmoſt that is poſſible to exaſperate him that he knows muſt rule him when all is done? I ſpeak not this by way of Juſtification, or any way deciding ſuch caſes as theſe, but leaving that (as a controverſie that I am not here to decide) to the judgement of others, I only ſhew the world again that there's a great deal of difference between ſuch a war and conqueſt of a Prince by the Senate and Body of the people, and their allowing Popes to depoſe them and alienate their Dominions, and private men to rebell, and to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, if the Pope conſent, or excommunicate them. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were in the right or wrong, I am not the judge, but ſurely it was the judgement of the Parliament, that upon the Diviſion, the power was in them to defend themſelves and the Commonwealth, and ſuppreſs all ſubjects that were in Arms againſt them; and that thoſe that did reſiſt them, did reſiſt the higher powers, ſet over them by God, and therefore were guilty of the damnation of reſiſters: And this they aſſured the people was the Truth. And the forecited conceſſions of the King, (againſt the nineteen Propoſitions) acknowledging their part in the Legiſlative power and defence of the people, (which is known to be the higheſt part of Soveraignty,) did much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline many to believe the Parliament: Eſpecially knowing that they had ſo long exerciſed the ſaid Legiſlative power, and that we were all governed by Laws of their making. So that thoſe that did obey the Parliament, did verily think that they obeyed the higheſt power that upon the diviſion was left in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and that they had the Laws on their ſide, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55445:191"/>
did adhere to the Common good, which is the end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>And as they have thus cauſed our wars, and miſeries, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, ſo have they continued to multiply ſects among us of all ſorts; ſo that there is ſcarce a ſect but is a ſpawn of the Jeſuites and Fryars; and ſcarce an honeſt party but they creep in among them to work their ends. And here I ſhall briefly mention ſome of the parties with whom they have inſinuated to work their ends, and then ſome of the ſects that they have bred or animated.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As for the old Engliſh Biſhops and conformable Miniſters, who were of the faith and doctrine publikely here profeſſed, I confeſs I find but little evidence that ever the Papiſts had much to do with them, ſave only to inſtigate them againſt the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and draw ſome of them to a complyance with ſuch as did out-go them. Yet in their times <hi>Biſhop Goodman</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was ſuſpected to be a Papiſt, and ſo profeſſed himſelf by his laſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament at his death, ſince the wars.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> I do not ſee any reaſon to think that ever the Papiſts had any intereſt in them of any men, there being none that they more hate then theſe two ſorts (the old ſound Epiſcopal men, and the Presbyterians) But yet both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> they have cunningly wrought upon them <hi>ab extra,</hi> alarming them into diſturbances by the wild-fire which they have caſt in.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for the new Epiſcopal party that followed <hi>Grotius (Arminius</hi> in doctrine) and the Greek Church, and were for a reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> on thoſe terms (which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Rome</hi> would never have yielded to) the intereſt that the Papiſts had among them, and influence that they had on them or their proceedings, is evident from what is ſaid before; and much from the copious Proofs produced by Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> in his forementioned Book <hi>(Canterburies Tryal, with the Introduct.)</hi> The Jeſuites Letter cited by <hi>Prin, ib. pag.</hi> 89. ſaith <hi>[Now we have planted that Soveraign drugg Arminianiſm, which we hope will purge the Proteſtants from their hereſie, and it flouriſheth and bears fruit in due ſeaſon.]</hi> The Articles exhibited in Parliament againſt many of the Biſhops will tell you by their works who were the inſtigators of them. Of themſelves I know of none but <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:55445:191"/>
that hath profeſſed himſelf a flat Papiſt; and I ſhall not think it my duty to ſuſpect any one man of holding an Opinion which he profeſſeth not himſelf, unleſs the evidence be very ſtrong to move ſuſpicion. But that many Papiſts were at work with them in that pretended Reconcilement, <hi>Franciſ. à S. Clara</hi> and divers others put us paſt doubt. And that Papiſts crept into places in the Chruch under the garb of conformable Arminians, is too well known. It is no wonder therefore that Dr. <hi>Baily,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goffe,</hi> Dr. <hi>Vane, Hugh Paul de Creſſy,</hi> and many more of them did opnely revolt when the game ſeemed to be ſpoiled that was plaid underboord. It had been far leſs hurt to us I think if all the reſt had been as open.</p>
                     <p>As for the King himſelf that was their Head, if any conjecture that he was a flat Papiſt, as I have heard many raſhly ſay, I think there is much evidence to confute them. 1. That very Letter to the Pope (forementioned) on which the ſuſpicion is moſt grounded, if you mark it exactly, doth intimate no more then a deſire of a union and Reconciliation, with ſome additions that may bear a tolerable ſence. 2. His own Profeſſion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion is ſufficient evidence. 3. His Diſputation with the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter</hi> cleareth it. 4. His ſpeech at death, and Papers ſince publiſhed clear it more. So that I think we may be confident that he was no nearer to <hi>Rome</hi> then was the reconcilable part of the Greeks: and that he deſired no more then Biſhop <hi>Bromhal,</hi> and other of his Biſhops offer them, to have the Church governed by Patriarcks, and the Pope to be <hi>Principium Unitatis, &amp;c.</hi> If any would know what Party <hi>Grotius</hi> was of, I deſire them carefully to peruſe but theſe places in his writings (which I have cited elſewhere) <hi>Diſcuſ. Apolog. Rivet. pag.</hi> 255. <hi>&amp; pag.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; vot. pro Pace, pag.</hi> 1, 2, 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yea for my own part I am perſwaded, that the Papiſts were as much afraid of King <hi>Charls</hi> and the <hi>Grotian</hi> deſign, as of any thing that of long time hath been hatcht againſt them. They are not all of a mind at home. The French and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate party no doubt applauded the deſign, and liked ſuch writings as S. <hi>Clara's,</hi> and would gladly have married
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:55445:192"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in Religion. But others (the Italian, Spaniſh Jeſuited party) might eaſily foreſee what danger was in brewing for them. Had <hi>France, England, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and the <hi>German Lutherans</hi> agreed together, to bear down the Calviniſts as unreconcilable on one ſide (as <hi>Grotius</hi> intimates it neceſſary) and the Italians and their adherents that ſet up the Pope above a Council, on the other ſide, it would have made the Pope afraid, as no doubt he was. For though he was glad that we would draw neerer him, and make him the Head in any ſort, yet he knew not how to ſtop ſo great an inundation as was like upon the union to over-flow him. And hence was the malice of the Jeſuites againſt the life of the King (and withall that he was fain into ſuch hands where he was like to do them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſervice.) <hi>Secret. Windebanks</hi> Letter recited by <hi>Prin, ubi ſup.</hi> tells us that it was the <hi>Jeſuites that were the death of Father</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, and <hi>ſo were the Enemies of Franciſ. S. Clara and his Book,</hi> (which cauſed it to incur a Roman Cenſure) So that with one part of them that is the beſt way, which the other is more afraid of then of Proteſtants. We ſee it by the Janſenian conteſt. We ſee it in that <hi>Caſſander, Eraſmus, Vives, &amp;c.</hi> are excellent Catholicks with ſome of them, and Heretical and vile with the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The perſecuted Nonconformiſts of the Proteſtant party, though they were moſt adverſe to the Papiſts, yet had ſome of the Popiſh brood at laſt crept in among them, not only to ſpie out their minds and wayes, but to head the party, and ſow among them the ſeeds of further diſcontent and error, and to make them a Nurſery for various ſects. For every where by their good wils the Jeſuites will have ſome. If you ask me for my proof of this, I ſhall at this time give you but theſe two. 1. The fruits that ſprung up from among them, and the manner of Production, (of which more anon.) 2. The words of the Jeſuites Letter recited by Mr. <hi>Prin, Introd. pag.</hi> 90. <hi>[I cannot chooſe but laugh to ſee how ſome of our own coat have re-incountred themſelves: you would ſcarce know them if you ſaw them; and it is admirable how in ſpeech and geſture they act the Puritans: The</hi> Cambridge <hi>Schollars to their wofull experience ſhall ſee, we can act the Puritans a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better then they have done the Jeſuites: they have abuſed our ſacred Patron St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>in jeſt, but we will make them ſmart
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55445:192"/>
for it in earneſt. I hope you will excuſe my merry digreſſion, for I confeſs to you I am at this time tranſported with joy, to ſee how happily all inſtruments and means, as well great as leſſer co-operate to our purpoſes.]</hi> Yet cannot I hear of any conſiderable infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction among this party that way before Sir <hi>Henry Vane's</hi> dayes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. How far they crept into all Societies under the name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants,</hi> is opened by ſo many already in Print, that I ſhall add no more of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And its a thing notorious, that they have crept in among the Anabaptiſts, and formented that Sect. The ſtory of the Scottiſh Miſſionary that pretended himſelf a Jew, and gave the Anabaptiſts the glory of his Converſion, and Rebaptizing at <hi>Hexham,</hi> and was diſcovered at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> is publiſhed and commonly known: (whether he be yet in Priſon, or releaſt, I know not.) And too many more have more cleanly plaid their game. And though many of the more ſober Anabaptiſts would not be ſo uſefull to the Papiſts as they expected, yet multitudes of them too far anſwered their expectations.</p>
                     <p>If you ask now what the Papiſts get by all this, I anſwer, you ſee in the Inſtance but of this one ſect, and the products of it. 1. By this means our Councils, Armies, Churches have been divided, or much broken. 2. By this trick they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the minds and tongues of many (and their hands if they had power) againſt the Miniſtry, which is the enemy that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in their way. 3. They have thus weakned us by the loſs of our former adherents. 4. They have found a Nurſery or Seminary for their own Opinions, which one half of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts too greedily receive. 5. By this they have prepared them for more and worſe. 6. By this means they get an Intereſt in our Armies, or weakned our own. 7. By this they have got Agents ready for miſchievous deſigns (as hath been lately too manifeſt.) 8. By this they have caſt a reproach upon our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as if we had no unity or conſiſtence, but were vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous for want of the Roman pillar to reſt upon. 9. By this they have looſned and diſaffected the common people, to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minds and waies, and hear ſo much contending, and have looſt them from their former ſtedfaſtneſs, and made them ready for a new impreſſion. 10. Yea by this means they have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55445:193"/>
of Predicating their own pretended unity, and hereby have drawn many to their Church of late. All this have they got at this one game. What then have they got by all the reſt?</p>
                     <p>I ſhall next tell you of ſome of thoſe Hereſies or parties among us, that are the Papiſts own Spawn or progeny; Either they laid the Egg, or hatched it, or both.</p>
                     <p>And 1. It is moſt certain that <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> or <hi>Freedom for all Religions,</hi> was ſpawned by the Jeſuites, who hate it in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but love it in <hi>England.</hi> I have met with the masked Papiſts my ſelf that have been very zealous and buſie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> (as they deceitfully called it.) For by this means they may have Liberty for themſelves, and Liberty to break us in pieces by ſects, and alſo Liberty under the Vizor of a Sectary of any tolerated ſort, to oppoſe the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and doctrine of truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But the principal deſign that the Papiſts have upon our Religion, at this day, is managed under a ſort of <hi>Juglers,</hi> who all are confederate in the ſame grand principles, and are buſie at the ſame work, and are agreed to carry it on in the dark, and with wonderfull ſecrecy do conceal the principal part of their opinions; but yet they uſe not all one vizor, but take on them ſeveral ſhapes and names, and ſome of them induſtriouſly avoid all names. The principal of theſe <hi>Hiders</hi> are theſe following. 1. The <hi>Vani,</hi> whoſe game was firſt plaid openly in <hi>America</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> where God gave in his Teſtimony againſt them from Heaven upon their two Propheteſſes, Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Dyer:</hi> The later brought forth a Monſter with the parts of Bird, Beaſt, Fiſh and Man, which you may ſee deſcribed in Mr. <hi>Welds</hi> Narrative, with the diſcovery, the concomitants and Conſequents. The former brought forth many (neer 30.) monſtrous births at once, and was after ſlain by the Indians. This providence ſhould at leaſt have awakened <hi>England</hi> to ſuch a Godly Jealouſie, as to have better tryed the doctrines which God thus ſeemed to caſt out, before they had ſo greedily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them, as in part of <hi>Lincolnſhire, Cambridgeſhire,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other parts they have done. At leaſt it ſhould have wakened the Parliament to a wiſe and Godly Jealouſie of the Counſels and deſigns of him that was in <hi>New England,</hi> the Maſter of the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55445:193"/>
game, and to have carefully ſearcht how much of his doctrine and deſign were from heaven, and how much of them he brought with him from <hi>Italy,</hi> or at leaſt was begotten by the Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Monſters. Such extraordinary providences are not to be deſpiſed. They had a great Operation in <hi>New England</hi> among thoſe wiſe and godly men that ſaw them, or were neer them, and knew the wayes of them that God thus teſtified againſt. That which healed them ſhould have warned us. But God had a judgement for us, and therefore we were left in blindneſs, to overlook that Judgement that ſhould have warned us. They are now diſperſed in Court, City, and Country, and what God will ſuffer them, and the Papiſts by them further to do, time will diſcover.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The next ſort of <hi>Hiders,</hi> are the <hi>Paraceſians, Weigelians,</hi> and <hi>Behmeniſts,</hi> who go the ſame way in the main with the former, and are indeed the ſame party, but think meet to take another name, and fetch their vizor from <hi>Jacob Behmen:</hi> of their life of Community, and Chaſtity, and Viſible converſe (as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) with Angels, you may ſee ſomewhat in the Narrative of Dr. <hi>Pordidge</hi> of himſelf, together with Mr. <hi>Fowlers</hi> of him. The moſt clean and moderate piece of their doctrine that hath been lately publiſhed, is Mr. <hi>Bromleyes way to the Sabbath of Reſt;</hi> or <hi>Treatiſe of Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another ſort of the <hi>Hiders</hi> are thoſe called <hi>Seekers,</hi> among whom I have reaſon to believe the Papiſts have not the leaſt of their ſtrength in <hi>England</hi> at this day. They practiſe the leſſon that <hi>Boverius in Apparat. ad Conſultat,</hi> taught Prince <hi>Charls</hi> long ago <hi>[Primum eſt, ut quoniam vera Religio tibi inquirenda eſt, antequam ad eam inveſtigandam accedas, omnem prius Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem apud te ſuſpectam habeas: lubeat<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> tamdiu à Proteſtantium fide ac Religione animum ac voluntatem ſuſpendere, quamdiu in veri inquiſitione verſaris—]</hi> We muſt ſuſpect all Religion it ſeems, and be firſt of no Religion, if we will become Papiſts. A fair begining! We muſt then be unchriſtned, and ſuſpect Chriſt and Scripture, that we may be eſpouſed to the Pope. And this is the Papiſts work by the <hi>Seekers,</hi> to take us off from all, or from our former Religion, and blot out all the old impreſſions, that we may be capable of new. And if they can accompliſh this, they have us at a fair advantage. For he that is not a
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55445:194"/>
ſtark Atheiſt or Infidel, but believes that he hath a ſoul to ſave or loſe, muſt needs know the Neceſſity of ſeeking his Salvation in ſome Religion or other: and therefore take him off from this, and you muſt needs bring him to ſome other: And he that could prevail to take him off his old Religion, is likelieſt to have ſo much intereſt in him as may alſo prevail to bring him to another. And the Papiſt thinks that on the pretence of Unity, Antiquity and Univerſality (of which indeed they have but a deluſory ſhew) they can put as fair for him that is once indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as any other can.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe <hi>Seekers</hi> there are theſe Sub-diviſions, or Sects. The firſt and moſt moderate do only profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Seekers</hi> for the <hi>true Church and Miniſtry;</hi> holding that ſuch a Church and Miniſtry there is, but they are at a loſs to know which is it. A likely thing it is indeed, that men that take themſelves for extraordinary wiſe, ſhould think there is exiſtent ſuch a Church and Miniſtry as they predicate, and yet have no conjecture which it is. As if they ſhould believe that there is ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Moon, but be not able to know it from the Stars.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of <hi>Seekers</hi> are to ſeek whether there be any Organized Political Church, or any Miniſtry, or any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances proper to a Church at all, or not. Not denying them, but <hi>Doubting</hi> and <hi>Seeking;</hi> that ſo when they have found them at <hi>Rome,</hi> they may prove but <hi>Finders,</hi> and not groſs changlings: And withall they yield that private men may Declare the Word, and pray together, and read the Scripture. The moſt rational and modeſt that hath wrote for this way, is the Author of <hi>[Aſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Word to a Serious People]</hi> A likely thing indeed it is, that ſo rational a man ſhould heartily believe, that Chriſt hath planted ſo excellent a Miniſtry, and Church, and Ordinances as himſelf deſcribeth, and to thoſe ſtanding neceſſary uſes which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, even inſtead of Chriſt, to take men into the holy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and yet that all ſhould be left but for an Age or two, and that ever ſince there is no ſuch thing, or at leaſt, no certainty of it. The Stile ſhews us that this Author is no ſuch dotard as to think as he ſpeaks.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another ſort of <hi>Seekers</hi> are thoſe that do not only <hi>Doubt</hi> of, but <hi>flatly deny any Miniſtry,</hi> and Political Churches, and Church-ordinances on Earth, as things that are loſt in an <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Apoſtacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="333" facs="tcp:55445:194"/>
4. Another ſort of <hi>Seekers</hi> do not only <hi>doubt of, or deny</hi> theſe <hi>Particular Churches</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> but alſo they are to <hi>ſeek for the Univerſal Church it ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>holy Scriptures;</hi> yea many of them not only <hi>Queſtioning</hi> them, but flatly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that we have no certainty that the Scripture is true, or that we have the ſame that was written by the Apoſtles, or that there is ſuch a thing as true Miniſtry, or State of Chriſtianity in the World. Hence it is that ſome of them pour out ſo many reproaches againſt the Miniſtry and the Holy Scriptures, as you may find in <hi>Clem. Writer,</hi> in two ignorant <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> that have ſcorn in the <hi>very Titles,</hi> as well as through the bulk; one called, <hi>The Jus Divinum of Presbyterie;</hi> and the other <hi>Fides Divina:</hi> In which he maintaineth the cauſe of the Infidels. The opinion which this ſort of men openly profeſs, is, that no <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man is bound to believe the Goſpel, but thoſe that have themſelves ſeen Miracles to confirm it:</hi> and therefore in the firſt ages when Miracles were wrought, thoſe that ſaw them were bound to believe in Chriſt, and at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, when again he ſhall be witneſſed by Miracles, it will again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a duty to be Chriſtians: but not to others that ſee no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, however they may hear of them. This doctrine <hi>Clem. Writer</hi> hath profeſſed to me with his own mouth. But I may not cenſure him to be ſo weak as to believe himſelf. It's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſuch a ſilly ſoul may be found, that ſhall think that Chriſt came into the world to ſet up Chriſtianity as the true Religion for thoſe only in an Age or two, or more, that ſaw Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but it's unlikely that a man that hath any conſiderable uſe of his reaſon ſhould be ſo ſilly. Who will not deſpiſe Chriſt that thinks he came on ſo low a deſign? Who would not be an Infidel, that thinks ten thouſand Infidels are ſaved for one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? Yea who can be himſelf a Chriſtian, that thinks that he is not bound to be a Chriſtian, becauſe he ſees not Miracles? It's moſt evident therefore that this is but a Juggle, and that ſuch are either <hi>Infidels or Papiſts. Infidelity</hi> is the thing <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,</hi> and therefore that we take them for Infidels, they cannot blame us: But yet in <hi>Charity</hi> I hope (and not without cauſe) that <hi>ſome</hi> of this Profeſſion are but <hi>Papiſts;</hi> though others I have found to be deſperate Infidels.</p>
                     <p>A fifth ſort called <hi>Seekers</hi> alſo there are, that own the Church
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55445:195"/>
and Miniſtery, and Ordinances; but yet ſuppoſe themſelves above them: for they think that theſe are but the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt to men in the paſſage to a <hi>higher ſtate,</hi> and that ſuch as have received the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and have the Law once written in their hearts, are under (as they call it) the ſecond Covenant, and ſo are paſt the lower form of Ordinances, Scripture, Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and viſible Churches.</p>
                     <p>And a ſixth ſort of <hi>Seekers</hi> there are that think the whole company of believers ſhould now be over-grown the Scripture, Miniſtry and Ordinances: For they think that the Law was the Fathers Adminiſtration, and the Goſpel Miniſtry and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the Sons Adminiſtration, and that both theſe are now paſt, and the ſeaſon of the Spirits Adminiſtration is come, which all muſt attend, and quit the lower forms. The <hi>David-Georgians</hi> were the chief that taught the world this leſſon, their Leader taking himſelf to be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> All theſe ſorts of <hi>Seekers</hi> are bred or cheriſhed by the <hi>Jeſuites and Fryars.</hi> And the truth is, when a man is made a <hi>Seeker,</hi> he is half made a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: As a Dog when he hath loſt his Maſter will follow almoſt any body that will whiſtle him; ſo when men have loſt their Miniſtry, Church and Religion, they are eaſily allured to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For they are a body as conſpicuous to a carnal eye as any other. And who will not rather be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Religion then of none?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another ſort of <hi>Hiders</hi> are the <hi>Quakers;</hi> an impudent Generation, and open enough in pulling down; but as ſecret and reſerved as the reſt in aſſerting and building up. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts the Papiſts have in breeding and feeding this Sect among us, hath been partly proved from the Oaths of Witneſſes, and Confeſſions of Fryars, and ſomewhat I have ſpoken of it in three ſeveral Papers againſt them. The Doctrine of this fourth ſort is the ſame, or ſcarſe diſcernable from the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A fifth ſort of <hi>Hiders,</hi> are thoſe Enthuſiaſts, that ſhun the affected bombaſted language of <hi>Behmen,</hi> and ſuch like, but yet give us much of the body of Popery, Headed by an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Prophetick Spirit, inſtead of the Pope. Such as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Book againſt the Aſſemblies Confeſſion, owned by <hi>Parker,</hi> but ſaid to be written by a <hi>London</hi> Doctor: And many ſuch Doctors I know and hear of abroad in <hi>England.</hi> They
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55445:195"/>
take on them to be adverſaries to the Pope; but they are friends to his Doctrines, and maintain the neceſſity of an infallible living Judge, and ſend us to Prophets for this infallible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And could the Papiſts bring men once to this, it's an eaſie matter to ſtrike off the the feigned Prophetick head, by diſgracing ſuch as meer fantaſticks, and to ſet on the ancient Papal Head, which only will agree with the Body which they have received. So much of the Libertines and the Hiders of their Religion, (of ſeveral ſorts).</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another ſort that are ſpawned by the Papiſts, are ſtark Heathens, Atheiſts, or Infidels: Theſe carry their judgement as to the poſitive part as cloſe as any of the reſt, and are grown in <hi>England</hi> to a far greater number and ſtrength then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagined. It is not only Leviathan or his Ocean that is guilty of this Apoſtaſie, (however they uſe the name of Chriſt) but abundance that lurk under ſeveral names. A great while I knew not what to make of this cloſe Generation; but now I have found out that which ſhould make a believing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart to bleed: even groſs Infidelity, cauſing them ſecretly to ſcorn at Chriſt and the holy Scripture, and the life to come, as bitterly as ever <hi>Julian</hi> did: And this is crept ſo high, and ſpred ſo far, that it is dreadful to thoſe few that are acquainted with its progreſs. Some that have lately profeſſed to turn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (for what ends I know not) are known to be ſtark Infidels: And ſome that have long gone for leading men with them, have ſatisfied us by their writings that they are <hi>Romaniſts</hi> of the moſt ancient ſtrain; even of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion that was ancienter then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> And many of the unſetled ſort of Proteſtants, are ſo far forſaken of God, as to Apoſtatize to the ſame condition. <hi>Montaltus</hi> the <hi>Janſenian</hi> takes the Jeſuites for falſe unworthy calumniators, for giving out that they have long had a deſign at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> to overthrow the Goſpel, and ſet up Infidelity and meer Deiſm. But I am ſure they deſerve much harder words of us in <hi>England,</hi> between them, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much to deſtroy the Chriſtianity of many, in order to the ſetting up of Popery. I do not charge it all and only on the Papiſts. I know the Devil hath more ſorts of Inſtruments then one: But that they have had a notable hand in this Apoſtaſie, we have good reaſon to ſatisfie us. Not that they deſire that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55445:196"/>
men ſhould be abſolutely and finally Infidels: But 1. they would make the world believe, that all muſt be Infidels that will not receive the Chriſtian Faith upon the <hi>Roman</hi> account and terms: And in order to this they induſtriouſly ſeek to diſgrace the Scripture, and overthrow all the grounds of the Faith of ſuch as they diſpute with. And ſo make them Infidels in order to the proof of that their affirmation. 2. And then they think that they muſt take them off all Religion (as <hi>Boverius</hi> afore cited) to prepare them for the Popiſh Religion. 3. And the malice of ſome of them is ſuch, that they had rather men were Infidels then Proteſtants; or at leaſt they will venture them upon Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in the way, rather than not take them off from being Proteſtants. And no wonder, when they allow Infidels ſo much more charity then Proteſtants, as to their ſalvation, as all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cited by <hi>S. Clara</hi> before do ſignifie: And when <hi>Rome</hi> burneth Proteſtants, but giveth toleration for <hi>Jews.</hi> And thus by theſe Deviliſh devices, the Hiders in <hi>England</hi> that keep cloſe their Religion, are diſcovered at laſt to be one part of them Infidels or Heathens, and another part of them Papiſts. And no wonder if they would lately have introduced the <hi>Jews</hi> here into <hi>England,</hi> and if they have ſo many other deſigns to promote this Apoſtaſie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another ſort that Popery hath here hatch or cheriſhed are the Socinians; a Sect with whom both Papiſts and Heathens do joyn hands, as the Bond of their Conjunction. Yet I know that they were not bred at firſt by Popery: and I know that the genuine Papiſt that holds faſt the Articles of their Faith, muſt needs diſown the Socinian: But however it comes to paſs, I am ſure there are too many of late (ſelf-conceited men, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaters in Philoſophie) that have reduced their Theologie to their novel Philoſophie, and expounded Scripture by ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits as ſuit with the Socinians.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the Millenaries, the Levellers, and many ſuch like. But here in the cloſe, I would deſire any Papiſt that is conſcious of the promoting of any of theſe fore-mentioned abominations, to tell us whether this be like to be the way of God? Or whether <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> did ever take ſuch a courſe as this to plant the Goſpel, or build up the Church? And whether it be like to be the Cauſe of God that muſt be maintained by ſuch
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55445:196"/>
means? Is not their damnation juſt, that ſay, Let us do evill that good may come thereby? Should not the means be ſuited to the end? Hath the glory of God any need of a lie? This courſe will never ingratiate your opinions with any wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men. This is but working with the Devil for God: like one that doth conſult with a Witch or Conjurer, to find the goods of the Church when they are ſtoln. Do you think God needs the Devils help? Or is it like to be help that comes from him? But the truth is, it is your bad Cauſe that requires theſe evils means: and it is your bad hearts that ſet you on work to uſe them: Though you think perhaps that you do God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by it, yet you know not what Spirit you are of. Chriſt owneth not ſuch ways as theſe, and therefore his ſervants will not own them.</p>

                        <hi>Detect.</hi> 37. ANother Practical fraud of the Papiſts is, <hi>In hiding themſelves and their Religion, that they may do their work with the more advantage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall tell you briefly, 1. The way by which they do this, and 2. The advantage they get by it. And 3. Help you to detect them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The principal means by which they conceal themſelves is, <hi>By thruſting themſelves into all Sects and Parties, and putting on the vizor of any ſide, as their cauſe requireth.</hi> It's well known that formerly we had abundance of them that went under the name of Proteſtants, and were commonly called by the name of <hi>Church-Papiſts:</hi> But there is great reaſon to think that there are more ſuch now. Some of them are <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> and ſome of them call themſelves <hi>Independants:</hi> ſome creep in among the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> and ſome go under the cloak of <hi>Arminians,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Socinians,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and all the other Sects before mentioned. They <hi>animate</hi> the <hi>Vaniſts,</hi> the <hi>Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniſts,</hi> and other <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> the <hi>Seekers,</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> the <hi>Origeniſts,</hi> and all the <hi>Juglers</hi> and <hi>Hiders</hi> of the times: It is they that keep life in <hi>Libertiniſms,</hi> and in <hi>Infidelity</hi> it ſelf. Among
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55445:197"/>
every one of theſe parties you may find them, if you have the skill of unmasking them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another way of <hi>Hiding</hi> themſelves is, by having a <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to come to any of our Aſſemblies,</hi> or join in worſhip with any party, good or bad: Or elſe they will prove it lawfull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Diſpenſation, where the Pope interdicteth it not. And their way is this: that all the old known Papiſts, eſpecially of the poorer ſort, ſhall be ſtill forbidden to come to our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, leſt they bring the blot of levity and temporizng on their Religion and leſt there ſhould not be a viſible party among them to countenance their cauſe. But the New proſelites, eſpecially ſuch as are of any power and intereſt in the world, and may do them more ſervice in a masked way, and can fairly avoid the Imputation of Popery, theſe ſhall have leave to come to our Aſſemblies, when their cauſe may make advantage of it. That you may ſee I feign not all this of them, (beſides the proof from certain experience which we daily ſee) let me lay before you the Deciſions of one of their principall <hi>Directors,</hi> in this work <hi>of propagating their faith;</hi> and that is, <hi>Thom. à Jeſu de Converſ. Gentium.</hi> How far they are for favouring of Heathens and Infidels, and Liberty of Conſcience for them (for all their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to Proteſtants) you may ſee him, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Dub.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 207. Where he tells you that the ſentence commonly received in the Schools is, that it is not lawfull for Chriſtian Princes to uſe any force againſt Infidels, for ſins againſt the Law of Nature it ſelf: and citeth <hi>Caject. Victoria, Covarruv. Greg. de valent.</hi> And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf decides it in the middle way of <hi>Azorius, [That Pagans may not be puniſhed for deſpiſing the honour and worſhip of God, though they may for not giving every man his own, and for theft, murder, falſe witneſs, and other ſins that are againſt mens right]</hi> Compare this with Sir <hi>H. Vane's</hi> doctrine of Liberty.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>Dub.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 220. he teacheth that <hi>[A Catholick living among Hereticks may (when the ſcandalizing of others forbids it not) for fear of death, go to the Temples of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and be among them in their meetings, and aſſemblies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it ſelf it is a thing indifferent; For a man may for many cauſes go to the Temples of hereticks, and be among them in their aſſemblies, as that he may the eaſilyer and more effectually and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly confute their errors, or on other juſt occaſions, (unleſs
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55445:197"/>
accidentally it ſcandalize others.) Yea as</hi> Azorius <hi>ſaith, he may do it to obey a Prince, though he be an heretick, when he feareth the loſs of his honour, maintenance or life: For in this he only obeyeth his Prince: eſpecially if among the faithfull</hi> (that is, the Papiſts) <hi>he openly affirm, that he doth it only to obey his Prince, and not to profeſs the heretical ſect: For by that open atteſtation he avoideth the offence and danger of Catholicks, and well declineth the unjuſt vexation of the Prince.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that Papiſts may <hi>eat fleſh on dayes when their Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, to hide themſelves among hereticks,</hi> he determineth <hi>in Dub.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 218, 219. So that the Papiſts are abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for their ſecurity, againſt ſuch as would diſcover them when it ſtands not with their ends to diſcloſe themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another moſt effectual way of <hi>Hiding themſelves</hi> is, by <hi>Equivocation</hi> or <hi>mental reſervations,</hi> which we uſe to call Lying, when they are examined about their Religion, their Orders or their actions. Lying that hurteth not another, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly maintain to be but a venial ſin, which ſay moſt of them, is properly no ſin at all. And to equivocate or reſerve one half of your anſwer to your ſelves, ſay the Jeſuites, is not Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor unlawfull, in caſe a mans intereſt requireth him to do it. See the words of their own Caſuiſts cited for this by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taltus the Janſeniſt.</hi> Were it a thing that needed proof, I would give you enough of it. <hi>Thom. à Jeſu the Carmelite, ubi ſup. Dub.</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 218. ſecureth them ſufficiently: His Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>[Whether one that denyeth it when he is asked of a Heretick whether he be a Prieſt, or a Religious man, or whether he heard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice, do ſin againſt the confeſſion of faith?]</hi> He anſwereth, <hi>[No: for that is no denying himſelf to be a Chriſtian, or Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: For it is lawfull to diſſemble or hide the perſon of a Clergy man or a Religious man, without a lye in words, leſt a man be betrayed and in danger of his life; and for the ſame cauſe he may lay by his Habit, omit prayers,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—becauſe</hi> (N. B.) <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws for the moſt part bind not the ſubjects conſcience, when there is great hazard of life, as in this caſe</hi> Azorius <hi>hath well taught. Juſt. Mor. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 27.] So that by the conſent of moſt, there is no danger to a Papiſt in any ſuch caſe from his own confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Another way of <hi>Hiding their Religion</hi> and themſelves, is by
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55445:198"/>
                        <hi>falſe Oaths,</hi> which we called, wilfull perjury, but the Jeſuites take for a Lawfull thing, when a <hi>mentall Reſervation</hi> or <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> ſupplyeth the want of verbal truth, as their words cited by the forementioned Janſenian, teſtifie. And who will ever want ſo eaſie, ſo obvious, ſo cheap a Remedy againſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of perjury, as a <hi>mental Reſervation is?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea that the Pope can ſufficiently diſpenſe with any of their Oaths of fidelity or Allegiance, or the like, I ſhall ſhew you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the laſt Detection. The Parliament hath impoſed on them an Oath of Abjuration, but do they not know how little the Clergy, and ſuch as have their countenance will ſtick at that, ſuch Nets are too wide to catch them in. Hear the words of one of their own Prieſts <hi>(Io. Browns Voluntary Confeſſ. in Prins Introduct. p.</hi> 203.) ſaith he, <hi>[Its ſtrange to ſee the Stratagems which they uſe with their penitents concerning the Oath of Allegiance! If they be poor, they tell them flatly, (when they are demanded to take the Oath) that it is damnable, and no wayes to be allowed by the Church: If they be of the richer ſort, they ſay they may do as their conſcience will inſpire them. And there be ſome of them that make no conſcience at all, to have it taken ſooft as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.]</hi> What would you have more, then ſuch diſcoveries by themſelves?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>But what get they by this Hiding of themſelves? Anſw.</hi> 1. They hereby ſecure themſelves from danger. 2. They do the more eaſily prevail for the multiplication of their ſect: For worldly perſons would not ſo eaſily flock into them without ſome ſuch ſecurity from ſuffering. 3. They preſerve thoſe that are come over to them from revolting, by the diſcouragement of ſuffering, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Rich and Honourable. 4. They angle for ſouls with the leſs ſuſpition, when they ſtand behind the buſh: Papiſts are become ſo diſtaſted with the people by the Power-plot, and many other of their pranks, that they may take more with them, if they come masked under another name. 5. By this means they may openly revile and oppoſe the Miniſtry, and Ordinances, and Churches, and Proteſtant doctrine, without diſturbance by the Magiſtrate. A Papiſt in the Coat of a Quaker, an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, a Seeker, or the like, may rail at us and our doctrine in the open Streets, and Market place, and call us all to naught, and teach abundance of their own Opinions, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55445:198"/>
And many a poor ſoul will take an Anabaptiſt Papiſt, or Seeker into their boſome, and familiarly hear them, and eaſily ſwallow down what they ſay, that would be afraid of them if he knew them to be Papiſts. 6. By this means they have eaſier acceſs to a greater number then openly they could have. 7. And by this means they may inſinuate into our Counſels, and know all our wayes, and how to reſiſt us. 8. But above all, by this means they may be capable of any office and truſt among us. They may be Miniſters, or Juſtices of Peace: They may be Parliament men, and Leaders in our Councils, and have the conduct of our affairs: They may have a great influence on the reſt that know them not; They may come to have power in our Armies. And if once the Masked Papiſts come to make our Laws, or guide our Councils and Affairs, and influence or command our Armies, you may ſoon know what would become of Proteſtants: Kings and Parliaments, Prelates and Presbyters ſhall all go one way, if they can accompliſh it: Its eaſie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſcern that their principall Artifice lyeth in Hiding themſelves (ſo be it ſtill there be a viſible body of their open profeſſors.) And for my own part, I think I have good reaſon to fear leſt the Papiſts are far ſtronger at this day in <hi>England</hi> that are unknown, then that are known: and that wear the Vizard of <hi>Seekers, Vaniſts,</hi> and other Sects, then that appear bare faced: Yea I believe that our danger of the open Papiſts is nothing in compariſon of our danger from theſe Juglers. And I confeſs I think an ingenuous open Papiſt ſhould have a great deal more gentle dealing from our Magiſtrates, then theſe <hi>Deceivers</hi> that have ſuch ſtretching Conſciences. For my own part I muſt confeſs I feel a great deal of charity in my heart for a conſcientious plain dealing Papiſt; and I would never be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cruelty or rigor to them. But this <hi>jugling</hi> in the matters of God and Eternal life, my very ſoul abhors. I have been ſet upon by theſe <hi>Juglers</hi> my ſelf, and by ſome of the moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them; but as ſoon as I perceived any of them purpoſely chooſe the dark, and hide themſelves in affected cloudy terms or methods, I was more a verſe from their documents, and took them for men that were either enemies to truth, or elſe had not received it into honeſt hearts themſelves. Truth is moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in its nakedneſs; It loveth plain dealing, and abhorreth
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55445:199"/>
fraud. It takes that for its greateſt friend, that layes it moſt naked to the view of all, and that for its enemy that purpoſely obſcureth it. We have all ſuch a natural inclination to truth, that he ſcarce deſerves the name of a man, much leſs of a Chriſtian, that would not embrace it if he knew it. Did I think that the Papiſts had the truth, the Lord knows I would run after them, and follow them till I had learned it: If ever any of them would work on me, they muſt come bare faced: for I naturally abhor a Jugler in Religion, and a friend of darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>But how ſhall theſe Hiders be Detected? Anſw.</hi> 1. You have cauſe to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> all that uſe a <hi>Mask,</hi> and purpoſely hide their minds. To ſuſpect them I ſay, to be Papiſts or worſe: They walk not in Gods way that walk in Darkneſs: It is the Kingdom of Satan that is the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and it is he that is the Prince of Darkneſs, and his ſervants that are the ſons of Darkneſs. Me thinks a man that intendeth Deceit, what ever his end be, ſhould not take it ill to be ſuſpected for a deceiver, God is ſo good a maſter that no body ſhould be aſhamed of him. Truth is ſo amiable, that the genuine ſons of Truth are not aſhamed of it. Its no true Religion that aſſureth not men of that which will ſave them harmleſs, and bear them out againſt all the malice of earth and hell, and repair all loſſes that they can ſuſtain in the defending of it. <hi>Qui non vult intelligi, debet negligi.</hi> He that would not be fully underſtood, ſhall never be my Teacher, nor be much regarded by me. And therefore the <hi>Vane</hi> and <hi>Steril</hi> language of Paracelſian Behmeniſts, and Popiſh Juglers, doth ſerve with me for no other uſe but to raiſe me into ſuſpicion of their Deſigns and Doctrines, and to ſignifie a <hi>Vaine</hi> and <hi>Steril</hi> mind. Who will not ſuſpect that Tradeſmans weres that chooſeth a dark Shop, and refuſeth to open his wares in the light? I know that Scripture hath its diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and ſtrong meats. But that is from our incapacity of underſtanding higher points, till we are prepared by the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: It is from the altitude of the matter, and not that God doth envy us the truth, which he pretendeth to reveal: If a Propheſie be purpoſely obſcured, which concerneth not the world ſo neerly, yet ſo are not the Doctrines that our life or death lyeth on. But ſaith <hi>Clem. Writer</hi> to me, (recited in his late Book againſt me) <hi>[Would you not hide your mind or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:55445:199"/>
in</hi> Spain? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No: I would not; whenever I found my ſelf capable of ſerving God moſt by the diſcovery; which is the common caſe. 2. Till then, I would not put on the vizor of any thing that I knew to be falſe; and make uſe of Poſitive Jugling and Diſſembling to hide my Religion. 3. If Chriſtians againſt Infidels, or Proteſtants among Papiſts, had thought this diſſimulation lawfull, there had not been ſo many thouſands of them martyred or murdered as were. 4. What Opinion is it that brings men in <hi>England</hi> into any great danger at this day? Either your Opinion muſt be Atheiſtical, or at leaſt Infidelity, if you ſuppoſe it will bring you now into any great ſuffering: or if it be ſome ſmall matter that you fear, it ſeems you think not your Religion worthy to be openly owned in ſo ſmall a danger. I'le never be of a Religion that is not worthy my openeſt confeſſion, even to the death, when there is ſo much danger.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Jugling Papiſts may be known by this, that they are alwayes looſening people from their Religion, and leading them into a diſlike of what they have been taught; that they may be receptive of their new Impreſſions. And therefore of any one Sect in <hi>England,</hi> there is none to be ſo much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of a ſpirit of <hi>Jeſuitiſm,</hi> as the <hi>Seekers</hi> of all ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Jugling Papiſts may be much detected by this, that they are all upon the <hi>Deſtructive</hi> part in their Diſputes, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little on the <hi>Aſſertive</hi> part. They pull down with both hands, but tell you not what they will build up, till they have prepared you for the diſcovery. They tell you what they are againſt. But what they are for, you cannot draw out of them. As if any wiſe man will leave his houſe or grounds till he knows where to be better: or will forſake his ſtaff that he leaneth on, or the food that he feedeth on, till he know where to have a better proviſion or ſupport. Do they think wiſe men will be made irreligious? They deal by the poor people, as one that ſhould ſay to paſſengers on Shipboard <hi>[What fools are you to venture your lives in ſuch a ſhip that hath ſo much encumbrance and danger, and ſo many flaws, and but a few inches between you and death, and is guided by ſuch a Pilot as may betray you, or caſt away your lives for ought you know?]</hi> They know now that none but mad men will be perſwaded by ſuch words as theſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:55445:200"/>
to leap into the Sea to ſcape theſe dangers: and therefore they do this but to make men willing to paſs into their ſhip, and take them for our Pilots. If you are wiſe therefore hold them to it, and leap not over-board, but keep where you are, till they have ſhewed you a ſafer Veſſel and Pilot: which they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do.</p>
                     <p>When I did but privately deſire of <hi>Cl. Writer</hi> that he would acquaint me with that truth that he thought me ignorant of, and that we might privately and lovingly conſider how far we were agreed, and where we differed, that we might debate the caſe, and try who was in the right, he reſolutely denyed to have any debate with me, or to open any of his judgement, but <hi>pag.</hi> 46. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth this very motion, as proceeding from <hi>[my aims of a monſtrous ſhape and ugly looks]</hi> ſo monſtrous a thing doth it appear to theſe deceiving Juglers, to tell men what Religion they are of, and would have us to receive, when they will freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Religion which we profeſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And you may ſtrongly conjecture at the quality of theſe Juglers, by their conſtant <hi>oppoſition againſt the Miniſtry.</hi> It is <hi>Miniſters</hi> that are their eye-fore; the hinderers of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Could they but get down theſe, the work were done, the day were their own: And therefore their main buſineſs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vizor they put on, is to bring the people into a diſlike or contempt of the Miniſtry. If they ſeem Quakers, they will rail at them: If they ſeem Seekers, they will diſpute againſt their calling: If they ſeem the gentleſt Behmeniſts, they have their girds at them, to acquaint the world that they are miſguided by them. But at firſt, they will not let you know which is the true Miniſtry, if ours be not; or which is the true Church, if ours be not: Here they leave you.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Jugling Papiſt, what vizor ſoever he wears, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly putting in for his own opinions, of the <hi>Neceſſity of a Judge of Controverſies, an Infallible Church, a ſtate of perfection here, the magnifying of our own inherent Righteouſneſs,</hi> without any great eſteem of <hi>Juſtification by the forgiveneſs of ſin:</hi> and many ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Papiſts have ſtill an aking tooth at the <hi>Authority and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Scripture;</hi> and therefore on one pretence or other, are ſtill diſgracing and impugning it, and leading men aſide to ſome other Rule.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:55445:200"/>
7. Papiſts have ſtill an enmity againſt the <hi>Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in matters of Religion:</hi> For in ſuch matters their <hi>Vice-chriſt</hi> muſt be the only Judge. Whereas indeed, by that time the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> hath judged, <hi>Who is Puniſhable by the Sword,</hi> and the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Particulars Churches</hi> have judged, <hi>Who is excommunicable,</hi> (which are their undoubted works) there is nothing left for a Pope to do. Suſpect them that are for a Liberty for all; or at leaſt for all that are no worſe then Papiſts. They that ſet open this door intend to creep in at it themſelves at laſt.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And it is a ſuſpicious ſign when you find men enemies to the Unity, Peace and Settlement of our Churches, but would ſtill keep us in diviſion and diſtraction. And yet ſome of theſe men will lament our Diviſions, and cry up Unity, but they will ſecretly hinder it, or do nothing to attain it.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And it is ſomewhat ſuſpicious to ſee men hang looſe from all our Churches in their practiſe, and joyn with none, nor communicate in the Sacraments. If they know not Sacraments and Church-communion to be both our Duty, and the Means of our ſtrength and comfort, it is doubtful whether they are Chriſtians or Infidels. But if they know this of the Neceſſity and uſe of Sacraments, and Church-communion in general, and yet joyn not with any of our Churches herein, it's a ſhrewd ſuſpicion that they have an eye upon ſome other Church. For ſure a tender conſcience would not be many years in reſolving of ſo great and practical a point, no more then he would live many years without prayer, on pretence of being unſatisfied in the mode of Prayer.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And yet on the contrary ſide, there are ſome Jugling Papiſts, eſpecially in our Councils, Civil and Eccleſiaſtick, that play their game by over-doing, and making every thing to be Popiſh and Antichriſtian, to drive us into extreams, and into opinons in which we may eaſily be bafled. And it's not a little that they have won of us at this game.</p>

Swarms of them are buſie day and night, for the ſeducing of Princes, and Nobles, and Rulers of all ſorts, and of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Armies. Of their diligence abroad we may know ſomewhat by their ſucceſs on divers of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and the late Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and on many of the Nobles of <hi>France,</hi> and ſuch others.</p>
                     <p>At home we have ſmarted by the fruits of their induſtry. What abundance of aſſaults were made on the late King? from his going to <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Popes Letters to him there, and to the Biſhop of <hi>Conchen</hi> to take care for his ſeduction, and ſo all along to the laſt, I need not mention. And what Noblemen or Perſons of Intereſt in <hi>England</hi> lay not under aſſaults and ſolicitations in thoſe days? And are all the Jeſuites and Fryars dead? Or have they not ſtill the ſame cauſe and induſtry as then? Is the Court, or Councils of the Land, or the Nobility, Gentry or Army now free from their fraudulent ſolicitations? How far they have prevailed time will fullier reveal: but what they will endeavour we may eaſily judge. And certainly the number of <hi>Seekers</hi> and ſuch other Sects among them, doth tell us that they have not loſt their labour.</p>
                     <p>If theſe lines ſhall fall into the hands of any of our Rulers or Commanders, I intreat them for the ſake of their ſouls, and the Common-wealth, to be prudent and vigilant in a matter of ſuch conſequence. I do not intend to intreat them from error unto truth without ſufficient light and evidence: But that which I deſire is but reaſonable; 1. That you would not be too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of your own underſtandings to deal with ſuch Juglers in your own ſtrength, without aſſiſtance. They have made it their ſtudy all their days, and are purpoſely trained up to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: whereas you are much wanting in their way of ſtudy, and much unfurniſhed to reſiſt; how highly ſoever you may think of your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That you would read a little more the learned ſolid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of our Divines againſt the Papiſts, ſuch as Dr. <hi>Fields, Crakenthorps, Uſhers, Chillingworths, Jewels, Rivets, Chami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Ames, Reignolds, whittakers,</hi> and ſuch like, beginning with Sir <hi>Humfrey Linds Via Devia, &amp; via Tuta, (&amp; du Pleſſis</hi> of the Church, and his Myſterie of Iniquity, and Dr. <hi>John White.</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That you will not hearken to Papiſts ſecretly, nor masked,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:55445:201"/>
nor coming to you by indirect and Jugling ways: but open their perſwaſions, and call to ſome able ſtudyed Divines to deal with them in your hearing, if needs you will hear them, that ſo you may hear one ſide as well as the other.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That you take heed what Retainers, Servants, or Familiars are about you: For ſome that pretend to be acquainted with theſe men, are much miſtaken, if they be not more frequent at your elbows, and in your Bed-chambers, then many do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. If they cannot be of your Councils, and your neer atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, they will rather be your Porters, or the Grooms of your Stables, then they will be kept out. We fear not any thing that they can do in an open way, in compariſon of their ſecret whiſpers and deceits, when there is no body to gainſay them. Had they the Truth, we ſhould be glad to entertain it with them. It is not therefore Truth in their mouths that we are afraid of: But ſeeing the Nations and our Poſterity have ſo much dependance on your Integrity, we call for ſo much Juſtice at your hands, as that you will not caſt open your ears to each deceiver, eſpecially in ſecret, or on unequal tearms: Let not all our peace and ſafety be hazarded by the ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, or imprudence of you that are our Rulers. Seeing it is you that muſt give us Laws, or ſet the Vulgar the pattern which they are ſo much addicted to imitate; We adjure you in the Name of the moſt High God, that you be not too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and facile in hearkening to Seducers, and corrupting thoſe Intellects which the whole Nation hath ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in: and that you be not henceforth as children toſt to and fro, and carryed about with every wind of doctrine by the the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſs whereby they lie in wait to deceive, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. But we beſeech you mark them which cauſe Diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them. For they that are ſuch, ſerve not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and by good words and fair ſpeeches deceive the hearts of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18. Hearken not to every one that ſaith, Lo here is Chriſt, or Lo there is Chriſt; here is the Catholick Church, or there is the Catholick Church: As if Chriſt were divided, or the Catholick Church were more then One? Or it were confined to a Sect or Party, whether Papal or any
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55445:202"/>
other, and did not contain all Chriſtians through the world? All parts of this Church are not equally pure, but all are Parts: Be you of the pureſt part, but do not therefore take that part for the whole: much leſs the polluted part. Have compaſſion on the diſeaſed and tumified part: but do not therefore ſo far doat, as to love the tumor or diſeaſe, and ſay that none is the Church but this. We are willing to be as Charitable to that Proud Throne of <hi>Rome,</hi> and uſurping Vice-chriſt, as will ſtand with the ſafety of our ſouls and of the Church. But God forbid that we ſhould therefore be ſo blind, as to run into their Peſt-houſe, and drink the poyſon by which they are thus tumified &amp; intoxictaed.</p>
                     <p>Look on their Principles, and ſee what an aſpect they have on Chriſt, on the Catholick Church, and upon Princes? Look back on their Practiſes, and ſee what their Principles proved in the fruits? Yea what need we go further for a warning, then to remind you of that which one would think ſhould be deep and freſh in your minds; even what they have brought upon Kings, Queens, Lords, Prelates, and this whole Land? But this leads me to the next Detection.</p>

THE laſt of their Practical frauds (at home) and the moſt deſperate is, <hi>Their Treaſons againſt the lives of Princes, and the Peace of Nations, and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the bonds of Oaths and Covenants, and making Perjury and Rebellion to ſeem to be Duties and Meritorious works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would be a voluminous task to relate the Hiſtories of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Treſons: How the <hi>Roman</hi> Vice-chriſt having laid a claim to both Swords, Spiritual and Temporal, hath plaid the Traytor againſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, diſpoſſeſſing them of the Weſt; and againſt the Emporors of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſtirring up their own ſubjects, and the Chriſtian Princes and States againſt them; ſetting his foot on the neck of one, and making another wait barefoot long at the <hi>Roman</hi> gates; and keeping many of them in wars. It was this Horrid Treaſon and Tyrannical uſurpation over all the Chriſtians Princes, that cauſed all thoſe Treatiſes on that ſubject wrote againſt him, in the Defenſe of Princes and their
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:55445:202"/>
Rightt, which <hi>Mich. Goldaſtus</hi> hath preſerves and conjoyned in divers Volumes. It was this that cauſed <hi>England, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and ſo many other Princes, to be the readier to ſhake off his yoke. Kings are not Kings where the Pope is fully Pope; except only the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom he is forced to gratifie, as the only prop of all his tyrannie. <hi>France</hi> that hath ſo much ſtood for its Liberties, hath felt the fruits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Principles, and League; and two of their moſt renowned Kings ſucceſſively have been baſely and inhumanely butchered by them: And to this day the numerous ſwarm of the Popes dependant Clergy, doth not only devour, as is thought, about a third part of the Lands, but alſo aws and ſwaies the Princes. Even in <hi>Ireland</hi> before our wars, a Biſhop <hi>(Bedle</hi> in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Laud</hi> in <hi>Prins</hi> Introduct. <hi>pag.</hi> 102.) doth open the Power of the Clergie, and their inſolencies as ſuch, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>[His Majeſty is now with the greateſt part of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as to their hearts and conſciences, King, but at the Popes deſcretion]</hi> And in another Letter to the ſaid Archbiſhop <hi>(ibid. pag.</hi> 112.) he ſaith <hi>[I that know that in this Kingdom of his Majeſty, the Pope hath another Kingdom far greater in number, and as I have heretofore ſignified to the Lords Juſtices, and Council (which ſince is juſtified by themſelves in print) conſtantly guided and directed by the order of the new Congregation,</hi> de propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda fide, <hi>lately erected at</hi> Rome—] ſee the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Do I need to tell <hi>England</hi> of the many treacheries ſince the Reformation againſt our Princes? Or who it was that would have depoſed as well as Excommunicated Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and expoſed her Kingdoms to the will of others? Or who it was that wrote againſt King <hi>James</hi> his Title to the Crown? Or who were the Actors of the Helliſh Powder-plot? Or who it is that hath been ſtill blowing the fire, and caſting all into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances for their ends? Do I need to mention their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the Murdering of Princes, and the pretence of power to diſpenſe with oaths of Allegiance and fidelity, and who hath actually ſo oft pretended to diſoblige the ſubjects, and expoſe Princes and their Dominions to the firſt occupant? I know that many of the ſeculars in <hi>England</hi> diſowned this doctrine: But 1. So never did the Pope, but hath owned and practiſed it. 2. By diſowning it, they diſown Popery it ſelf, if they know
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:55445:203"/>
what they do: For it is an Article of their Faith, and ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their Religion, as explicitly held; and is determined by a Pope and an approved General Council, even 12. the fourth at <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, as I before recited the words at large in the third Argument againſt them here.</p>
                     <p>I know ſome of the Papiſts would perſwade the world that it was none but <hi>Mariana</hi> the Jeſuite that wrote for King kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and that it was firſt condemned by themſelves. But the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> tells another ſtory of them, as it is recited by <hi>Thuanus</hi> (who was Preſident and then preſent) <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 130. <hi>ad. an.</hi> 1604. And <hi>Rivet</hi> names them <hi>Guignardus</hi> (that wrote in praiſe of the murder of <hi>Henry</hi> the third) and of <hi>Ode Pichenatus, Barterius</hi> ſuborned by <hi>Varada,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Albine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Jeſuite did hear the Murderer of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs before he did the fact, and put off the examiners with this anſwer, that God had given him that ſpecial gift to forget when once he had abſolved a ſinner whatſoever was confeſſed by him. And why was it that <hi>France</hi> did expel the Jeſuites, and ſet up a Pillar of Remembrance of their villanies, till <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth would needs gratifie the Pope by calling them in again, and told the Parliament, that the peril of it ſhould be on him; and ſo it was; for it coſt him his life. And why did the ſame Parliament of <hi>Paris, Novemb.</hi> 1610. condemn <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> book againſt <hi>Barclay,</hi> as an engine of treaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? And the Theological faculty of <hi>Paris, April.</hi> 4. 1626. condemned <hi>Santarellus</hi> Book as guilty of the ſame villany, ſtirring up people to Rebellion and King-killing? And <hi>May</hi> 12. the Univerſity confirmed it: And <hi>March</hi> 13. the Parliament condemned the Book to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>And it's worth the reading which <hi>Rivet</hi> recites of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the Jeſuites in <hi>Paris,</hi> when the Parliament askt them their judgement of that Book, <hi>viz. [Seeing their General had approved the Book, and judged the things that are there written to be certain, whether they were of the ſame mind?]</hi> They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that <hi>[Living at</hi> Rome <hi>he could not but approve what was there approved of.]</hi> [But ſay the Parliament, <hi>What think you?</hi> Say the Jeſuites, <hi>the clean contrary.</hi> Say the Examiners, <hi>But what would you do if you were at</hi> Rome? Say the Jeſuites, <hi>That which they do that are at</hi> Rome. At which ſaid ſome of the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:55445:203"/>
Parliament, <hi>What! have they one Conſcience at</hi> Rome, <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at</hi> Paris? <hi>God bleſs us from ſuch confeſſors as theſe.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet ſome of the Papiſts will ſeem ſo honeſt, as to ſay that <hi>private men may not kill a King till he be depoſed.</hi> Very true! But withall it is their currant doctrine, that if once he be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, he is then no King, yea or if he be an Heretick; and ſo being <hi>no King,</hi> they may kill the man, and not kill the King. This is the jugling of theſe ſeeming Loyall ſubjects. You may ſee it in their own writings; <hi>Suarez adverſ. Sect. Anglic. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22, 24. <hi>&amp; Azorius Jeſuita Inſtit. Moral. part.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. He that would ſee more of their mind in this, let him read the <hi>Myſterium Patrum Jeſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and the <hi>Janſenians myſterie of Jeſuitiſm,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Rob. Abbots Antilogia ad Apolog. Eudaemojohan:</hi> But what need we more then the Decrees of a Pope and General Council, and the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſo many ages?</p>
                     <p>And for the Popes power to abſolve them from all oaths of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance and fidelity, the foreſaid Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and his approved General Council have told the world enough of their mind to put us out of doubt of it.</p>
                     <p>But (leaving abundance of forreign inſtances) I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one or two at home. The Papiſts have lately had the confidence to affirm that the Powder-plot and the Spaniſh inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in one thouſand five hundred eighty eight were not upon a quarrell of Religion, nor owned by the Pope. King <hi>James</hi> hath ſaid already ſo much againſt them in theſe points, that I think it needleſs to ſay any more (eſpecially alſo after Biſhop <hi>Abbots An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilogia)</hi> but only here to produce one Teſtimony of their own, concerning the Spaniſh Invaſion.</p>
                     <p>Cardinal <hi>Oſſatus</hi> in his 87. <hi>Epiſt. ad D. de Ville-roy,</hi> tels us that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth (one of the beſt of all the late ones) did preſs for the King of <hi>France</hi> to join with <hi>Spain</hi> in the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>England,</hi> and the Cardinal anſwered that the King was tied by an Oath to the Queen of <hi>England:</hi> to which the Pope replyed, that <hi>[The Oath was made to an Heretick, but he was bound in another Oath to God and the Pope]</hi> adding withall <hi>[that Kings and other Princes do permit themſelves all things</hi> (or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves in all things) <hi>which make for their commodity: and that the matter is gone ſo far, that it is not</hi> (or ſhould not be)
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:55445:204"/>
                        <hi>imputed to them, or taken for their fault: and he alledged the</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Franciſcus Mariae Duke of</hi> Urbine, <hi>that indeed every one doth blame a Noble man, or Great man that is no Soveraign, if he keep not his Covenants, (or fidelity,) and they account him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous; but ſupream Princes may without any danger of their reputation, make Covenants and break them, lye, betray, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate other ſuch like things]</hi> This was good Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth. And can we look for better from the reſt? You ſee what Oaths and Covenants are with them.</p>
                     <p>And that the deſign was ſtill carried on againſt the Queen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of Religion, and the Realm to have been invaded by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> on that account, and that the principal point of the Plot was to prepare a party within the Realm that might adhere to the invaders; all this with much more Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> (that well knew) hath teſtified to <hi>Monſieur Critoy</hi> in his Letter, <hi>Cabal. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</p>
                     <p>Thuanus <hi>a Moderate Papiſt (and a moſt knowing and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Hiſtorian) tells you</hi> (lib. 89. p. 248, 249. ad an. 1588.) that, <hi>[the Spaniards pretended to undertake the expedition only for Religion ſake, and therefore took with them</hi> Martin Alarco <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car general of the Holy Inquiſition, with abundance of Capuchins and Jeſuites: and that they had with them the Popes Bull, which they were to publiſh as ſoon as they landed, and that Cardinal</hi> Allan <hi>was appointed as the Popes Legate to land at the ſame time, and with full power to ſee to the reſtoring of Religion. And that the ſaid Bull had theſe expreſſions: that the Pope, by the Power given from God by lawfull ſucceſſion of the Catholick Church, for the defection of</hi> Henry the eighth <hi>who forcibly ſeparated himſelf and his people from the communion of Chriſtians, which was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> Edward the ſixth <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>who being pertinaceous and impenitent in the ſame Rebellion and Uſurpation—therefore (the Pope) incited by the continual perſwaſions of many, and by the ſuppliant prayers of the Engliſh men themſelves,</hi> (N. B.) <hi>hath dealt with diverſe Princes, and ſpecially the moſt potent King of</hi> Spain<hi>—to depoſe that woman, and puniſh her pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adherents in that Kingdom—] Read the reſt there; for though wicked, its worth the reading. The Pope there ſaith, that Pope</hi> Sixtus <hi>before him preſcribed the Queen, and took from her all her Dignities, Titles, and Rights to the Kingdom of</hi> England
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:55445:204"/>
                        <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>abſolving her ſubjects from the Oath of fidelity and obedience: He chargeth all men on pain of the wrath of God, that they offord her no favour, help, or aid, but uſe all their ſtrength to bring her to puniſhment; and that all the Engliſh join with the Spaniard as ſoon as he is landed: offering rewards and pardon of ſins, to them that will lay hands on the Queen; and ſo ſhewing on what Conditions he gave the Kingdom to</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Spain. This and more you may ſee in <hi>Thuanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet ſome of our Juglers that ſay they are no Papiſts, perſwade the world that Papiſts hold not the depoſing of Princes, nor abſolving their ſubjects from the Oaths of fidelity; and that the Spaniſh invaſion was meerly on Civil accounts, and that they expected not any Engliſh Papiſts to aſſiſt them: with other ſuch impudent aſſertions.</p>

When he had placed all his ſecurity in that Oath, ho thought he had framed ſuch a manner of oath, with ſo many circumſtances, which no man could any way diſſolve with a ſafe conſcience. But he could not ſee, that if the Pope diſſolve the Oath, all its knots, whether of being faithfull to the King, or of admitting no Diſpenſation, are accordingly diſſolved. Yea I will ſay a thing more admirable. You know I believe, that an unjuſt Oath, if it be evidently known to be ſuch, or openly declared ſuch, obligeth no man. That the Kings oath is unjuſt, is ſufficiently declared by the Paſtor of the Church himſelf. You ſee now that the Obligation of it is vaniſhed into ſmoak, and that the bond which ſo many wiſe men thought was made of iron, is leſs then ſtraw.]</hi>

                     <p>Theſe are the words of Papiſts themſelves. From their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed writings we tell you their Religion.</p>
                     <p>I know they will here again tell us abundance of falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Proteſtants, ſuch as <hi>[the Image of both Churches]</hi> heapeth up; and they will tell us of our <hi>war,</hi> and <hi>killing the King in</hi> England. But of this I have given them their anſwer
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:55445:205"/>
before. To which I add, 1. The Proteſtant doctrine expreſſed in the Confeſſions of all their Churches, and in the conſtant ſtream of their writers, is for obedience to the Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and againſt reſiſting them, upon any pretenſes of Hereſie, or Excommunication, or ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The wars in <hi>England</hi> were raiſed between a King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that joyned together, did conſtitute the Higheſt Power; and upon the lamentable <hi>diviſion</hi> (occaſioned by the Papiſts,) the people were many of them uncertain which part was the Higher, and of greateſt Authority: ſome thought the King, and others thought the Parliament, as being the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> body of the people (in whom Polititians ſay is the <hi>Majeſtas Realis,)</hi> and the <hi>Higheſt Judicature,</hi> and having the <hi>chief part in Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Declaration what is juſt or unjuſt, what is Law and what is againſt Law:</hi> Had we all been reſolved in <hi>England</hi> which ſide was by <hi>Law the Higher Power,</hi> here had been no war. So that here was no avowed reſiſting of the <hi>Higher Powers.</hi> None but a Parliament could have drawn an Army of Proteſtants here under their banner.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And withall that very Parliament (conſiſting of Nobles, Knights, Gentlemen and Lawyers, who all declared to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that by Law they were bound to obey and aſſiſt them) did yet profeſs to take up offenſive Arms only againſt Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, or rather, even but defenſive againſt thoſe men that had got an Army to ſecure them from Juſtice: And they ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and vowed fidelity to the King which, as I have ſhewed, they manifeſted to the laſt of their power, till they were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecluded. Read Mr. <hi>Irins</hi> Speech for Agreement with the King: and read the writing of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the General, and publiſhed againſt the Kings death: and Read the Vindication of the ſecluded members, and read the Paſſages of the war with <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the Impriſonment of many <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, and of the death of Mr. <hi>Love</hi> and others: and tell me whether you can do men greater wrong then to defame them for being cauſers of that which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned, though it coſt them the loſs of Liberty, Eſtate, or Life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And really if you take either Vaniſts or Levellers (who were the chief agents in this) for Proteſtants, you may as well
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:55445:206"/>
ſay that Papiſts are Proteſtants. The world knows that the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Petitions, Proteſtations, and other endeavours of the Proteſtants, even the Presbyterians, was for the preventing the death of that King, how ever many of them diſliked his courſe, and joyned with the Parliament againſt his adherents. This is the very truth, which they that have been eye witneſſes all along have good reaſon to know, whatever any Papiſt ſay to the contrary.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And what Proteſtants be they that give power to any man on earth to depoſe Princes, and give their Kingdoms to others; or to diſoblige all their ſubjects, and warrant them to kill them, and diſpenſe with oaths, and turn them all into ſmoak and ſtraw as yours do?</p>
                     <p>Renounce your treacherous Principles, and we will ceaſe to charge you with them. Let a General Council and Pope but Decree the contrary to what the forecited Pope and General Council have Decreed, or elſe do you all declare that you think this Pope and Councill erred, and then we will ſhake hands with you; for then you will either ceaſe to be true Papiſts, or at leaſt become tolerable members of humane ſocieties. Why doth not the Pope himſelf at leaſt condemn theſe doctrines, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he diſown them? The caſe is too plain.</p>

And yet theſe men cry up <hi>Antiquity and Tradition.</hi> I wonder what Biſhop in all the world for above three hundred years after Chriſt, did ever claim or exerciſe the temporal ſword, as much as to be a Juſtice of Peace? nay it was their judgement that it did not belong to them. Neither the Pope nor any Biſhop on earth, as ſuch, hath any thing to do with the coercive power of the ſword; nor may not inflict the ſmalleſt penalty on body or purſe, but only guide men by the Word of God; and the utmoſt penalty they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict is, to excommunicate them.

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as ſeems to me, when Gods work began to be done in an humane manner, God ſeparated the two ſorts of life, and one of them was made ſacred, and the other appointed for Rule and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For ſome he turned to theſe Materiall (or common, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) things, and ſome he aſſociated with himſelf: The former were appointed for ſecular buſineſs; the later for prayer. But from both doth God require that which is honeſt (or Good.) Why then doſt thou revoke this? Why wilt thou conjoin what God hath ſeparated? who wouldſt not have us indeed to do the work of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rulers, but by doing it to deprave (or marr) it; then which what can be more unhappy? Doſt thou need a Ruler? (or Patron) Go to him that manageth the Laws of the Commonwealth. Doſt thou need God in any thing?

Rulers <hi>(ad An.</hi> 411.) as <hi>Syneſius</hi> with the Council did <hi>Andronicus.</hi> But 1. He went not out of his own circuit to play the Biſhop in other mens Dioceſs. 2. Much leſs did he take up the Temporal Sword againſt him, but diſclaimeth and deteſteth any ſuch thing. Why doth not the Pope when he hath paſt his Excommunications, content himſelf that he hath done his part; but he muſt excite Princes, yea force them to execute his rage, and fall upon the Lives and Dominions of ſuch Princes as he will call Heretical? He knows how ſmall account would be made of his brutiſh thunderbolts, if he had not a ſecular Arm to follow them: Nay why is he and many of his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Biſhops, ſecular Princes themſelves? Why joyneth he thoſe Functions of Magiſtracie and Prieſthood which <hi>Syneſius</hi> here tells us God hath ſeparated, and made incoherent in one and the ſame perſon? Let the Pope uſurp what Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical power he pleaſe, he would not ſo much diſturb the Church by it, if he did not ſecond it by another power. It is violence that he truſteth too. He knows if it were not for Arms and Violence, he would ſoon be ſpewed out by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. And yet many of his followers that ſeem more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, confeſs he hath nothing to do as Pope with any but the Spiritual Sword (which works no further then Conſcience doth conſent and yield.) And yet his Kingdom ſtandeth on thoſe legs, which the doctrine of theſe more moderate men do diſown.</p>
                     <p>The ſame doctrine alſo <hi>Bernard</hi> taught the Pope himſelf. <hi>Ad Eugen. P. R. de Conſiderat. l.</hi> 2. Saying <hi>[Quid tibi dimiſit S. Apoſtolus?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What did the holy Apoſtle leave thee? Such as I have ſaith he, that give I to thee: And what was that? One thing I am ſure of; it was not gold, nor ſilver, when he ſaid himſelf, Silver and gold have I none. If thou canſt claim this by any other title, ſo let it be; but not by Apoſtolical right: For he could not give thee that which he had not: ſuch as he had, he gave, a care of the Churches, but did he give thee a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Hear himſelf [Not as Lords (or Ruling as Lords) ſaith he, in the Clergy (or heritage) but as examples of the flock. And leſs thou think that he ſpoke it only in humility, and not in verity, it is the voice of the Lord himſelf in the Goſpel: The Kings of the Gentiles rule over them, and they that have
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55445:207"/>
power over them, as called Benefactors, (or Bounteous) and he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth [Butlyou ſhall not be ſo] It is plain, that Domination is forbidden the Apoſtles. Go thou therefore, and uſurp if thou dareſt, either Apoſtleſhip whileſt thou Ruleſt as a Lord, or a Lordly Rule (or Domination) while thou art Apoſtolick. Plainly thou art forbidden one of the two: If thou wilt have both alike, thou loſeſt both.]</hi> So far <hi>Bernard.</hi> By whoſe verdict the Pope and his Biſhops are deprived of both; by graſping at both long ago.</p>
                     <p>Nay the Pope makes himſelf a Temporal Prince in every Princes Dominion on earth, where he is able to do it, and takes all the Clergy out of their Government into his own. So that actually he hath diſpoſſeſſed them of part of their Dominion already, by taking ſo conſiderable a part of their ſubjects from under their power, yea and thoſe that have ſo great an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon all the reſt: What by publick Preaching, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governing, and ſecret Confeſſing, and dependance on them for the Sacraments, one would think it ſhould be no hard matter for a <hi>Romiſh</hi> allowed numerous Clergy, to be Maſters of any Kingdom where they are. And thus Princes are more then half conquered already, without a war. If any believe not that the Pope doth not thus exempt his Clergy from the ſecular power, it is becauſe he knows not their moſt notorious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practiſes. Nay even in <hi>England,</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> his Articles for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> match, the Pope had the confidence to demand this Prerogative, and therefore himſelf added to the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article, which freed them from Laws about Religion, <hi>[Eccleſiaſtici verò nullis legibus ſubjaceant, niſi ſuorum ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Eccleſiaſticorum]</hi> that is <hi>[Eccleſiaſtick perſons ſhall be under no Law, but of their Superiour Eccleſiaſticks (or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)].</hi> Is not this plain <hi>Engliſh?</hi> See <hi>Prins Introduct. p.</hi> 6. So that no Church-man muſt be under any Law of the Land, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Secular Princes. And when they have ſuch a ſtrength in our own Garriſons, a forreign Enemy is eaſily let in. To the exciting of whom they will never be wanting, having their Agents in one garb or other at the ears of the Princes and States in Chriſtendom, and of moſt of the Great and Noble perſons that are deeply intereſſed in the Government. Yea, and with Infidel Princes ſometimes, as <hi>Cyril</hi> the Patriarck of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
                        <pb n="360" facs="tcp:55445:208"/>
proved, to the loſs of his life, for being ſo much againſt the Papiſts. And the more cauſe have all Chriſtian Princes and States to be vigilant againſt theſe incendiaries, 1. Becauſe they truſt to War and Violence, and build their Kingdom on it, and therefore ſtudy it day and night. 2. And becauſe they have ſuch a frie of politick Jeſuites all abroad continually upon the deſign; whoſe contrivances and endeavours are day and night to bring Princes and Nations to their will, and to kindle diviſions and wars among them to attain their Ends. They make a trade of this imployment. And expert prepared men, that follow a buſineſs all their days, are like enough to make ſomething of it at laſt; eſpecially while others ſleep, or ſilently look on, and let them alone to play their game. If the Papiſts can but get into the Saddle, either by deceiving the Rulers, or Commanders, or by bringing forreign force againſt us, they will give us leave to diſpute, and write, and preach againſt them, and laugh at us that will ſtand talking only, while they are working: And when the Sword is in their hand, they will ſoon anſwer all our Arguments, with a fagot, a hatchet, or halter; <hi>Smithfield</hi> confuted the Proteſtants, that both the Univerſities could not confute. Their Inquiſition is a School where they diſpute more advantagiouſly then in Academies. Though all the Learned men in the world could not confute the poor <hi>Albigenſes, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> yet by theſe Iron Arguments they had men that preſently ſtopt the mouths of many thouſands, if not hundred thouſands of them: Even as the Mahometans confute the Chriſtians. A Strappado is a knotty Argument. In how few days did they confute thirty thouſand Proteſtants in and about <hi>Paris,</hi> till they left them not (on earth) a word to ſay. In how few weeks ſpace did the ignorant <hi>Iriſh</hi> thus ſtop the mouths of many thouſand Proteſtants? Even in <hi>Ulſter</hi> alone, as is ſtrongly conjectured, by teſtimony on Oath, about an hundred and fifty thouſand men were mortally ſilenced: Alas we now find that the poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> commonly know but little more of Chriſt, but that he is a better man of the two then Saint <hi>Patrick:</hi> And therefore how long might they have been before they could have ſilenced ſo many Proteſtants any other way? There's nothing like <hi>ſtone-dead,</hi> with a Papiſt. They love not to tire themſelves with Diſputes, when the buſineſs may be ſooner and more ſucceſsfully diſpatcht.</p>

                        <pb n="361" facs="tcp:55445:208"/>
Well, ſeeing this is the way that they are reſolved on, and no peaceable motions will ſerve for the preventing it, all men that have care of the Church and Cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and the happineſs of their poſterity, have cauſe to ſtand on watch and guard: Not to be cruel to them (leave that to themſelves,) but to be ſecured from their cruelty. I ſhould be abundantly more earneſt then I am, to preſs all men to ſuch a patience and ſubmiſſion in Cauſes of Religion, as leaves all to God alone, but that we all ſee how the Papiſts are ſtill at the dore with the Swords in their hands, and watching for an opportunity to break in. And if in modeſty we ſtand ſtill and let them alone, they will give us free leave when they have the day, to call them Traytors, or perfidious, or what we pleaſe. Let looſers talk: Let them have the Rule, and then make the beſt you can of your Arguments. If they can once get <hi>England</hi> and other Proteſtant Countries, into the caſe of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> their Treachery ſhall not be caſt in their teeth; for they will leave none alive and at liberty to do it. When we ſee in good ſadneſs that it is Navies, and Armies, and ſtabbings of Kings, and Powder-plots, and Maſſacres that we have to diſpute againſt, it's time to be able to Anſwer them in their own way, or we loſe the day. It is not a good Cauſe, or wit, or learning, or honeſty, that will then ſerveturn. I know God is al-ſufficient for his Church, and in him muſt be our Truſt: But he requireth us to expect his bleſſing in the uſe of lawful probable means. He can give us Corn without plowing, and ſowing: but we have little reaſon to forbear theſe and expect it: He can Convert men without preaching: But yet the bleſſing of God doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe <hi>Pauls</hi> planting, and <hi>Apollo's</hi> watering. He can Rule and Defend us without Magiſtrates, but it is not his appointed way. And he can ſave us from deceitful bloody men, without our care, and vigilancy and reſiſtance: but it is not his ordinary appointed courſe in which he would have us look to him for deliverance.</p>
                     <p>And therefore in the Name of God let Princes and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be vigilant: for they watch for the outward ſecurity of the Church and Common-wealth (as Miniſters do for our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wel-fare) as thoſe that muſt give account. And let the people take heed what Parliament or Magiſtrates they chooſe:
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55445:209"/>
And let all that love the Goſpel, and the proſperity of the Chriſtian world, and of their poſterity, have their eyes in their head, and take heed of that bloody hand, that hath in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Savoy, Low-countries, Germany, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> &amp;c. already ſpilt ſo many ſtreams of Chriſtian blood. If the Wiſe, the Learned, Moderate Lord <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> was ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the <hi>Lawfulneſs of Neceſſary Defence,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> chargeth him, as to put it into his <hi>Teſtament,</hi> (whom he makes alſo the Author of <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> I know not on what ground) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he knew with whom he had to do, and thought that every <hi>Guiſian League</hi> was not a Law of God or of the King.</p>
                     <p>Some Princes think that it is their ſafeſt way to pleaſe the Pope and Jeſuites, and ſo will be Papiſts, on the terms as ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> worſhip the Devill, becauſe he is ſo naught, that he may not hurt them. But theſe men were wiſer, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that the malice of Infernal Spirits is not to be avoided by pleaſing them, but by reſiſting them. They are too bad to be ever pleaſed by any means, but what will be your utter ruine: And they are not ſtronger then the Devil himſelf, who will flie if we reſiſt him. If the <hi>beſt</hi> were not the <hi>moſt Powerful,</hi> what would become of the world? And if God be ſtronger then the Devil, <hi>he</hi> ſhould rather be pleaſed then the Devil; for he is able to defend you from the Devils diſpleaſure: and he is moſt able to hurt you if you be diſpiſers of his power: which Juſtice will effect more certainly on the bad, then Satans malice can do upon the good. Men think themſelves wiſe, that ſhift for their ſafety by carnal and unlawful means: But they ſhall all find at leaſt, that plain honeſty is the beſt policy, and the favour of God the beſt ſecurity, and a life of faith the moſt prudent life; and that ſhifting for your ſelves in unbelieving ways, is the greateſt folly. It is the deſign of the Papiſts by the ſtrokes of <hi>Clements, Ravilliacks, Vauxes,</hi> and ſuch others, to terrifie Princes, that they may not dare to reſiſt them, but may ſee that they have no hold of their lives while they are under their diſpleaſure. But yet ſuch as have moſt diſpleaſed them have ſcaped beſt. It is recorded by one, that the great King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> being perſwaded to ſtand it out againſt the Jeſuites, anſwered, <hi>[Give me ſecurity for my Life then]</hi> And what a ſecurity did he find in his unbelieving way?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="363" facs="tcp:55445:209"/>
A thouſand pitties it is that Proteſtant Princes ſhould not be united among themſelves, that they might be ſtrengthened for their joynt Defenſe; But that the envious man ſhould be able ſo far to over-wit them, as to ſow among them the ſeeds of war, while they ſleep, or ſelfiſhly mind their own affairs and intereſts: And a greater pitty and ſhame it is, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel of peace ſhould be the cauſes of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, or ſhould not do their beſt to heal them: But it is the greateſt ſhame of all to us, that ſo many years experience of the calamitous effects of our Diviſions, and ſo much induſtry of many worthy peaceable men, ſhould do no more to a fuller Reconciliation then yet is done. The names, and pacifying La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of ſuch as <hi>Duraeus, Davenant, Hall, Morton, Uſher, Hayne,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morin, Amyraldus, Hottonus, Conradus, Bergius, Johannes Bergius, Georgius, Calixtus, Jerem: Burroughs,</hi> and many more that have laboured for peace, do live as Monuments of their honor and our diſhonor, and do reflect much ſhame upon the faces of thoſe Reformed Miniſters and Churches that after all this are ſo much unreconciled: yea, that are not by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt motives and perſwaſives, ſo much as excited to zealous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the healing of our ſad diviſion; no nor ſome of them reſtrained from the paſſionate proſecution of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                     <p>If yet any Papiſt, believing ſuch falſe Hiſtories as <hi>[the Image of both Churches]</hi> doth contain, or really finding any Proteſtants culpable, ſhall ſay, that we are as bad as they in wars or cruelty, and that <hi>Illiacos intra muros peccatur, &amp; extra.</hi> I again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, 1. That true Hiſtory and experience tells the world, that there is no compariſon between their exceſſive cruelties and ours. 2. Yet it is none of my deſire or intent, to defend any perſon or people that have been truly guilty in the leaſt degree. 3. Our doctrine is againſt that which theirs doth own. 4. If either our Doctrine or practiſe have been amiſs, we deſire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and information, and are willing to reform them. The Word of God being our only Rule, if it appear that we have in any point miſunderſtood it, we deſire nothing more then to be rectified, and then we ſhall confeſs our former faults before the world, and promiſe reformation. For our Principles fix us not in Sin or Error. But the Papiſts are fixed in their Errors,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:55445:210"/>
and think there is a neceſſity lyeth on them never to amend. Now the Pope and a General Council hath already decreed that the Pope may depoſe Princes, and Abſolve their ſubjects, and give their Lands to others; to amend this abominable error, is with them to give away all their cauſe, and to ceaſe to be Papiſts. So that all Princes and People muſt neceſſarily deſpair of their amendment.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. L. <hi>Some Propoſals for a (hopeleſs) Peace.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IT is A Defenſive conflict that I have been hitherto managing; This work is put upon us by our adverſaries. But in the concluſion I will add a few words of that whith enticeth by its amiable aſpect, and which we gladly follow, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity or conſtraint. And were our <hi>Power</hi> but anſwerable to our <hi>Deſires,</hi> we would ſoon put an end to theſe contentions of the Church, without the hurt of any of the Diſſenters: Yea did there appear but any conſiderable <hi>Hopes</hi> of ſucceſs, I ſhould venture to be more large in Propoſals to that end: But when wiſer men, of greater intereſt can do no good, and the caſe appeareth as next to deſperate, a few words may ſuffice to ſatisfie my own conſcience, and to pleaſe my mind with the mention of a Peace, and to help ſome others to right Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions and Deſires, though we have never ſo little expectation of ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>And in order to what follows, I muſt firſt deſire every Reader rightly to underſtand the meaning and deſign of all that I have hitherto ſaid. It is but to be a neceſſary help to the Diſcovery of the Truth, and the confutation of the contrary errors, and the juſt defence of the doctrine of Chriſt, and of his Churches, I ſolemnly proteſt that it is none of my deſign or deſire, 1. To make any believe that the Difference is wider between us and the Papiſts then indeed it is. Nay I am ſatisfied that in many doctrinall points it is not ſo great as commonly it is taken to be by many, if not moſt, on both ſides: as in the points of certainty
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55445:210"/>
of Salvation, of Pardon, of Juſtification, of Works, of Faith; and in almoſt all the controverſies about Predeſtination, Redemption, Free-will, the work of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Dominicans in ſence agree with the Calviniſt (as they call them) and the Jeſuites with the Lutherans and Arminians: and ſo in divers other points. The divers underſtanding of words among us, and the weakneſs and paſſions of Divines, and a baſe fear of the cenſures of a party, hath occaſioned may on both ſides to feign the differences to be much wider then indeed they are: ſo that when an <hi>Alvarez,</hi> a <hi>Bannes,</hi> a <hi>Gibieuf,</hi> have ſpoken the ſame things as the Proteſtants do, they are preſently fain to pour out abundance of unworthy ſlanders againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, for fear of being accounted Proteſtants themſelves. And to ſhew their party how much they differ from us, they muſt feign us to be monſters, and to hold that which commonly we abhor: And ſome Proteſtants are too blame alſo in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this kind. This unchriſtian dealing will gripe the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when once it is awakened. Let me be rather numbred with thoſe that are ambitious to ſeem as Like to all the Churches of Chriſt, and as much to agree with them, as honeſtly and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I may, what party ſoever diſtaſte that union and agreement. And let my ſoul abhor the deſire of appearing more diſtant and diſagreeing then we are, what cenſures ſo ever I may incur. Our ſtudents would not ſo ordinarily read <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Ariminenſts, Durandus, &amp;c.</hi> if there were not in them abundance of precious truth which they eſteem. How neer doth Dr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> come to us in the fundamental point of the Reſolution of our faith? How neer come to the Scotiſts to us in ſence, about the point of Merit? and <hi>Waldenſis</hi> and others yet neerer? How neer comes <hi>Contarenus</hi> to us (and many more) in the point of Juſtification? How neer comes Cardinall <hi>Cajetan</hi> to us in the Liberty of diſſenting from the Fathers in the Expoſition of the Scriptures? and ſo doth <hi>Waldonate</hi> and many another. How neer comes Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus (lib. de Concord.)</hi> to us, even in the Eſſential point of difference, about the Original and Title that <hi>Rome</hi> hath to its ſupremacy? How neer comes <hi>Gerſon</hi> to us in the point of Venial and Mortal ſin? perhaps as neer as we are to our ſelves. How neer come the Dominicans and Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenians to us in the points of Predeſtination, Grace and Free-
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55445:211"/>
will? For my own part, I ſcarce know a Proteſtant that my thoughts in theſe do more concur with, then they do with <hi>Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> (that is indeed, with <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf.) There are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few points of the Proteſtant doctrine, which I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Papiſt or other to atteſt (and eaſily thus be even with Mr. <hi>Brerely,</hi> upon fairer terms then he deals with us.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I do alſo proteſt that it is none of my deſire or deſign, to create any unjuſt Cenſures of the final ſtate of Papiſts in any Readers: nor to perſwade men that they are all damned, or that there are no honeſt godly men among them. When I read ſuch writers as <hi>Gerſon, Barbanſon, Ferus,</hi> and others, I am fully ſatisfied that there are many among them (how many God only knows) that truly fear God, and are ſanctified gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious people, with whom I hope to dwell for ever. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it my Duty not only to forbear unjuſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of them, but alſo to love them with that entire ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chriſtian Love by which Chriſt would have us known to be his Diſciples; and to perſwade all others to do the like. Though ſtill I am conſtrained to ſay, that in my ſmall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, I find no compariſon between the Engliſh Papiſts and our Churches in point of Holineſs. I would they were much better.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I do alſo proteſt that it is not my deſire or deſign to make any innocent Papiſt to be accounted guilty of the faults of others which he diſowns.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Nor is it any of my deſire or deſign to provoke the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to any cruelty or injuſtice towards them; nor to lay any penalty on them, but what is truly of neceſſity for the ſafety of himſelf and the Common-wealth, and a juſt reſtraint of them from perverting others, and doing miſchief to the ſouls of men, as I ſhall open more at large anon.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor is it any of my deſire or deſign to make the generality of them unjuſtly more odious with Rulers or People, then the meaſure of their corruptions do deſerve: Or to hide any of their vertues, or deprive them of any honour which is their due. This much my conſcience witneſſeth of my intents; though I know the partial will hardly believe it, when they feel themſelves ſmart by that Contradiction which they have made neceſſary for our own defence. And this I thought neceſſary to premiſe,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55445:211"/>
before I lay down the following Propoſals, that prejudice and paſſion do not turn away men eyes, or cauſe them to miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them. For it is prejudice, partiality, and faction, that hath hitherto fruſtrated all ſuch Propoſals and attempts.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. LI.</head>
                     <p>THere are five ſeveral Degrees of Peace which lye before us to be attempted between the Roman and Reformed Churches: We ſhall begin with the higheſt, and upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the failing of our Deſigns for that, come down to the next, and ſo to the Loweſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt Degree of Peace to be Intended and Deſired is, <hi>That we may ſo far Agree, as that we may hold perſonal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the ſame Aſſemblies, in the worſhip of God, and live under the ſame particular Paſtors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If that cannot be attained, the next Degree deſirable is, <hi>That we may hold a Catholick Chriſtian Communion in ſeveral Aſſemblies, under ſeveral Paſtors, acknowledging each other the true Churches of Chriſt and joining in Synods when there is need, or at leaſt, giving each other, as Chriſtian Brethren, the right hand of Fellowſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. If that may not be attained, the next Degree deſirable is, <hi>That we may take one another for Chriſtians and Churches of Chriſt, though under ſuch corruptions as we think we are bound to diſown by denying the preſent exerciſe of Communion: as we do with particular Offendors, whom we only ſuſpend, but not condemn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. If this much may not be had, but we will needs excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate each other abſolutely, the next degree of Peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable is, <hi>That we may at leaſt ſo far regard the common truths that we are agreed upon, and the ſouls of the people, as to conſult on certain terms on which we may moſt peacably mannage our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, with the leaſt hatred, and violence, and diſturbance of the Peace of Chriſtendom, and with the leaſt impediment to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſucceſs of thoſe common truths that we are all agreed in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. If this may not be attained, the loweſt Degree deſirable is, <hi>That at leaſt we may take each other for more tolerable adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55445:212"/>
then Mahometans and Infidels are, and therefore may make a common Agreement to ceaſe our wars and blood-ſhed, and turn all our Arms againſt the great and common enemy of the Chriſtian name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Were it not for the Devill, and wicked minds, all theſe might be attained: but if men be not themſelves incarnate Devils, we may expect the laſt. And underſtand that the terms of the loweſt Degrees are all implyed in the Higher.</p>
                     <p>And now for the Higheſt and moſt deſirable Degree of Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may meet in the ſame Aſſemblies, under the ſame Paſtors, there is ſo little probability that ever it ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and withall the various apprehenſions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doth make it ſo neceſſary to bear with one another in this, that I ſhall ſay but little of it, as knowing that I am like to loſe my labor. Only this much concerning the terms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If you will impoſe no more in point of Belief, as neceſſary to Salvation, but what is contained in the holy Scriptures, yea and in the three Creeds, and four firſt General Councils; and will leave the Paſtors of the particular Churches to worſhip God according to the Rule of the holy Scriptures, prudentially themſelves determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of meer Cireumſtances left to their determination; according to the general Rules, of Order, Decency and Edification, and bearing with a difference herein according to the different ſtate of the Churches or judgement of the Paſtors, this is the only probable way to bring us to this higheſt degree of Peace.</hi> Though accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this courſe, men ſhould be left to ſome liberty to joyn with what particular Congregation they ſee beſt, and ſo would moſt commonly joyn with thoſe that are neereſt to their own judgement; yet the minds of moſt would be ſo mollified by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance, and by being ſatisfied in the way that is thus commonly agreed on, that they would not ſcruple to joyn with one another in worſhip in the ſeveral Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall further add, that if theſe terms cannot be yielded to, yet all that will yield to the terms of the next De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Peace, may be admitted <hi>into our Aſſemblies,</hi> though we cannot joyn with them in theirs. For the Papiſts have much more in the <hi>manner</hi> of their worſhip to keep <hi>us</hi> back, then we have in <hi>ours</hi> to keep them back. For <hi>their</hi> errors lie in <hi>Exceſs,</hi> and they ſuppoſe <hi>ours</hi> to lie but in <hi>Defect.</hi> Now Conſcience
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:55445:212"/>
may well yield to perform one part of a duty when it cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the reſt: But it can never yield to commit one actual ſin, by doing what is forbidden by God. <hi>E. G.</hi> If the Papiſts think that we ſinfully omit the Sacrament of extream unction, they may nevertheleſs be preſent at the Sacrament of Baptiſm. If they think we preach not all the truth that we ought, they may nevertheleſs hear and receive that which we do preach. But in their Aſſemblies we muſt do thoſe poſitive actions which our Conſciences tell us are ſins againſt God. And therefore unleſs they will yield (as they will not) to the above mentioned terms, we cannot joyn in their Aſſemblies; but upon the terms in the next Chapter we can admit them into ours.</p>
                     <p>But if the Churches have not a neceſſary Liberty in this, they will never agree, but be ſtill breaking into pieces, or perſecuting one another, to force men to joyn with ſuch Aſſemblies as beſt pleaſe them that bear the Sword. Though we readily grant that to hear and learn the principles of Religion, and ſubmit to the ſtate and duty of Catechumens, men may with leſs inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience be forced, and ordinarily ſhould ſo be.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="52" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. LII.</head>
                     <p>THe ſecond Degree of Peace deſirable, below the former, is, <hi>That if we cannot live under the ſame particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and joyn in the ſame Aſſemblies, yet we may hold a diſtant Catholick Communion in ſeveral Aſſemblies, without condemning or perſecuting one another;</hi> and may <hi>afford the ſpecial Love of Chriſtians to each other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This will not be done as long as we take each other for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and therefore the cauſes of thoſe cenſures muſt be removed, partly by a neerer agreement in our Principles, and partly by a greater Moderation in our Cenſures of one another. And this a man would think among Chriſtians might be obtained. The terms on which it muſt be had are theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suffer us to confine our ſelves in Worſhip and Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Word of God; and the Determination of our particular Churches or Paſtors about meer Circumſtantials left to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:55445:213"/>
and do you confine your ſelves accordingly, or not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending your practiſe beyond the Canons of the four firſt General Councils, and the reſt called</hi> [Canones Eccleſiae Univerſalis] <hi>(publiſhed by</hi> Juſtellus, Tillius, <hi>or the</hi> Codex Dionyſii Exigui) <hi>and for matters of Faith, we will all profeſs to receive the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and what ever is contained in the ſaid Councils and the three Creeds, and to inſiſt upon no more as neceſſary.</hi> And on theſe terms we may live in Love as Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Here note, 1. That in matter of Faith we will not be bound to take more then is in the Scripture, and yet we will take all as aforeſaid that is in the Creeds, becauſe we are perſwaded that there is no more then is in the Scripture. 2. We will not tie each other to profeſs on what Grounds we receive the Doctrine of theſe Creeds and Councils. If you receive it as Tradition ſuperadded to Scripture, and if we receive it as being the ſame with Scripture Doctrine, or a meet Expoſition of it, we will leave each other in this without examination to their liberty, as long as it is the ſame things that we believe. 3. In matters of <hi>Worſhip and Government</hi> we may not be <hi>compelled</hi> to take in all that is in all theſe Councils; but only we will promiſe <hi>not to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them,</hi> and take in any more, and ſo ſhall you: ſo that if ſome of us confine our ſelves to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and others will go further, as far as all thoſe Canons do extend; we will yield to live as Brethren in Chriſtian Love, and forbear the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of one another. And herein you may well condeſcend to us, when in many things you have caſt off the Canons of thoſe Councils your ſelves; and abundance of them concern not our times or Countries, and ſo many of your own Writers confeſs that all things neceſſary to Salvation are in the Scriptures, and that Canons are mutable, and Churches may vary in theſe leſſer things.</p>

                  <div n="53" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. LIII.</head>
                     <p>COuld the former terms of Peace be yielded to, it would be happy for the Churches; and I am perſwaded were it not for the <hi>Italians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> would yield to them. And ſome Proteſtants will go further, and yield to <hi>Rome;</hi> that if Papiſts
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:55445:213"/>
will confine their Faith, and Government, and Worſhip but to thoſe limits as the <hi>Greeks, Armenians, Ethiopians,</hi> &amp;c. do, they will readily hold this Catholick Communion with them. But then we muſt ſtill remember, 1. That we will not be bound to approve of all that they do. 2. Nor ſhall they go about to force all others to riſe up to their pitch; nor do as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops would have done, to ſilence and caſt out all thoſe Miniſters that will not go beyond the Scriptures. You ſhall bear with all that will be Ruled by the Scripture, and we will bear with all that will not go beyond the ſaid General Councils, or <hi>Codex Canonum Eccleſiae univerſalis:</hi> Yea, and admit ſuch to our Society and Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>But now ſuppoſing that <hi>Rome</hi> will not yield to this (though me thinks <hi>France</hi> and other Nations may do it without them) the next Degree deſirable is, that <hi>[At leaſt we may take one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Chriſtians and Churches that have ſuch corruptions, as yet leave us good hopes of the ſalvation of multitudes, though we ſuppoſe ſalvation more rare and difficult where thoſe corruptions are, then where they are not, and though we are forced to ſuſpend that Communion with ſuch which with ſound members we ſhould hold.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed the obtaining of this much Peace, requireth no more but Chriſtian Charity conducted by a right underſtanding of each other. And for my part I have already this much peace with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo have many millions more of Proteſtants as well as I: and I think the generality of them: But <hi>Rome</hi> hath not ſo much Charity for us: But we ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer nor be condemned for other mens uncharitableneſs. I need not therefore propoſe any means for that peace which we have already attaired to, or may if we will. But then let this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed by the following forbearances.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="54" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. LIV.</head>
                     <p>THE fourth Degree of Peace deſirable, whether the laſt mentioned be attained or not, is, <hi>[That we may ſo far lay by our hatred, wrath, and ſtriving about the Controverted-points, as to conſult together of the terms on which we may manage our
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55445:214"/>
differences with the leaſt diſturbance to the Peace of Chriſtendom, and the leaſt diſadvantage to the Truths that we are agreed in, and to the peoples ſouls.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Religious Reaſon muſt needs confeſs the Reaſonableneſs of this propoſal in the General: But all the difficulty lyeth in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. If you ask me what the particular terms are on which we ſhould agree, I anſwer, There are many at hand, that Reaſon muſt needs approve of; but becauſe there is no likelyhood of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting them, I ſhall ſpare the labour of propoſing them. And the rather, becauſe we have much ado to agree on this much among our ſelves, or the Papiſts among themſelves: with what hope can we move that the Agreement ſhould be Univerſal? But this much I may propoſe, 1. <hi>That a Conſultation of the Agents of Chriſtian Princes and Divines might do much to further ſuch a thing. And till that can be had, ſome few of the more Peaceable Princes and Divines ſhould lead the way, and give the reſt a good example.</hi> 2. <hi>And that an Univerſal Liberty of Conſcience, with neceſſary reſtrictions, might be a probable way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where note, 1. That it is an <hi>Univerſal Liberty</hi> only that we move for, or at leaſt <hi>on equal terms.</hi> It is not that the Papiſts may have <hi>Liberty in England,</hi> and we have none in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>other Countries.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Image of both Churches</hi> maketh a long and ſubtile perſwaſive for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> But where would he have it? Let them take this equal motion, and yield to it if they dare. Let the Proteſtants have liberty in <hi>Italy, Spain, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Portugal, Auſtria, Bavaria,</hi> &amp;c. and we ſhall conſent that the Papiſts have as much Liberty in <hi>England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. But it muſt in reaſon be <hi>on equal terms.</hi> Yet this advantage we know they have, that their Agents and Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are incomparably more <hi>numerous</hi> then ours, by reaſon of the multitude of their Fryars, Jeſuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their doctrines are more ſuitable to corrupted nature, and carnal intereſt, and the people are more engaged by worldly obligations to their ways: And yet we are ſo confident of the Power of Truth, that I would this Propoſal were accepted. The Bible it ſelf without any Preachers, would ſhrewdly ſhake the Kingdom of the Pope, where men have liberty to uſe it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The limitations of this Liberty are, 1. That one party have no more of it then the other. 2. That it extend not to allow a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:55445:214"/>
diſturbance of Miniſters and Churches in Gods Worſhip, nor any unpeaceable tumultuary proceedings. 3. That no Party be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under this pretence, to teach any thing againſt the Eſſentials or Neceſſary points that we are agreed on, nor any thing that is againſt the peace of the Common-wealth, or lives, or dignities of the Governors thereof.</p>
                     <p>Two parties among our ſelves will diſlike this propoſal.</p>
                     <p>1. Some will ſay, <hi>If Liberty be deſirable, why may not we grant it in</hi> England, <hi>though</hi> Spain, Italy, <hi>&amp;c. will not?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Liberty is <hi>not Deſirable for it ſelf,</hi> but as a means to that end which is ſo Deſirable. And therefore it is no further deſirable then it tendeth to that end. And a partial Toleration of them, that tolerate not us, is ſo far from being ſuch a means, as that it is the next way to deſtroy the end that we deſire, it will but put our necks under their feet, and open our boſoms to their Swords, and ſo make our deſired Peace impoſſible. No friend of the Goſpel and Reformed Churches will proſecute that motion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others will ſay, <hi>It is unlawful to grant ſuch a Liberty to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, becauſe it is falſe doctrine which they will preach, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry which they will exerciſe; and we muſt not do evill that good may come by it.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may do no evill, but we may omit that which at another time is a duty, in a ſeaſon when it is no duty. To puniſh ſuch offenders is a poſitive duty, which at all times is not a duty, but unſeaſonably performed is a ſin. For a Magiſtrate therefore to puniſh ſuch offenders, when it apparently tendeth to hinder the progreſs of the Goſpel, and overthrow the peace and ſafety of the Chriſtian State, is not a Duty, but a ſin. Would any of theſe Objectors be againſt a Magiſtrates releaſing of a Jeſuite out of Priſon, in exchange for a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel, eſpecially of many; as priſoners are commonly exchanged in war? If not, why ſhould they be againſt the releaſing of ſuch a man to higher ends, even to ſave mens ſouls? To <hi>give Liberty</hi> is but to <hi>Permit,</hi> or <hi>not to Hinder,</hi> or <hi>not to Puniſh:</hi> and therefore is but the <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing</hi> of a work when it is unſeaſonable (as Sacrifice is when God requireth Mercy.) And he that may <hi>Permit,</hi> or <hi>forbear to puniſh,</hi> may on a juſt reaſon <hi>promiſe ſo to do.</hi> So that this is but forbearing the puniſhing of Papiſts, when we cannot puniſh them without the exceeding hurt of the Church, and wrong to many thouſand ſouls.</p>

                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:55445:215"/>
But I know I ſpeak all this in vain, for the Pope will never conſent that Proteſtants ſhall ſow their ſeed at <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unneaſt him. But in the mean time let the Papiſts here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs if they be reaſonable, that we have no reaſon to give Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, that will give none to us, or upon unequal terms. If they claim a ſpecial Title to it, as having the juſter cauſe, we deſire no more then a fair tryall of that, and let them that have the juſter cauſe take all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another particular that ſhould here be agreed on is this, (whether the former be conſented to or not;) <hi>That on both ſides where the Teachers have any Toleration or forbearance, they may be forced by the Magiſtrate to teach the Ignorant people that adhere to them, the great Articles of the Chriſtian faith (both words and ſenſe) which we are all agreed in.</hi> Which was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Uſhers</hi> motion to the Papiſt Prieſts in <hi>Ireland. For</hi> ſaith he, among the Papiſts <hi>the people are ſuffered to periſh for want of knowledge; the vulgar ſuperſtitions of Popery not doing them half that hurt, that the ignorance of thoſe common principles of faith doth, which all true Chriſtians are bound to learn] (Serm. at</hi> Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, page 33.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Another neceſſary particular to be agreed on is, that <hi>we uſe not bitter invectives againſt each other, nor uncharitable contendings, eſpecially in the ears of the ignorant people that have not yet learned the common truths which we agree in: but that our Debates be managed only in ſuch Aſſemblies as are capable of them, and in a ſober Chriſtian way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another is, <hi>that ſuch Magiſtrates that will not grant To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, may yet on both ſides avoid cruelties, and inflict no more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties for matters of meer Religious worſhip, then neceſſity ſhall require: and that herein they may agree upon ſome equality in the ſeveral Nations.</hi> And in this let <hi>Spain, Italy, Auſtria,</hi> and the reſt, for ſhame conſent, to be as moderate as the Turk, and to ſhut up the doors of their bloody Inquiſition.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Let us all agree to renounce all Treachery and unfaithfulneſs againſt the Soveraign Powers, and all ſeditious diſturbances of the Peace of Common-wealths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Let thoſe afford us the common Love of men, that think us not capable of the ſpecial Love of Chriſtians:</hi> and ſo let us Love our Neighbours as our ſelves, and ſtudy to do good, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55445:215"/>
not hurt to one another; and give over plotting to undermine one another, and deſtroy one anothers civil intereſt, and get our Neighbours under our feet. This much well practiced, would do ſomething to the peace of the Chriſtian world.</p>

                     <p>THE loweſt Degree, that none but incarnate Devils one would think ſhould reſiſt is this; that if we will needs live as enemies, <hi>yet we may remember that we have all greater enemies; and therefore let us give over our wars, and let every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be quietly governed by their own Laws and Soveraigns, and let us all join together againſt the common enemies of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot but know that much of Chriſts intereſt lyeth in our hands, and that if either party were devoured by the Turk, it would be a heavy blow to the Chriſtian cauſe: If God ſhould ſuffer that proud enemy to come and make a third among us, to end our quarrels, we muſt juſtifie him in his judgements; and muſt to our perpetual ſhame confeſs that by our proud and paſſionate contendings, and unpeacebleneſs, and ſelf-ſeeking, we did betray the Chriſtian cauſe. O wonderfull ſtupidity and impiety of great men, and Learned men, profeſſing ſo much zeal for God, that they can no more agree, nor bear in Love and Compaſſion with each other, nor ceaſe their wars, when a raging potent enemy ſtands over them, ready to devour them both. Let the <hi>Venetians</hi> take the honour, and we the ſhame: How ever their own Intereſt may engage them, yet materially their wars are more honourable then ours. The Pope is eager for a General Peace among his ſubjects, that they may be ſtrenghthened to devour us: But it were an honeſter deſign, that would give him more comfort at laſt, to mediate a Peace among all Chriſtians, that in this at leaſt they might be one, to oppoſe the Turk, and reſcue the Heritage of Chriſt which he hath oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>And O what a bleſſed thing it were, if the Jeſuites, Fryars and Proteſtants could but agree, to join together for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the poor Indians. And either preach in the ſame, or ſeveral Countries, without ſeeking the deſtruction there of one

I am not ſo weak, or ignorant of the inconſiderableneſs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, or of the ſelfiſhneſs and ungodlineſs of the world.

                        <p>And becauſe I have lately met with a Paper called <hi>[An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the Roman Catholick Belief,]</hi> &amp;c. which pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to much moderation, in divers points; I purpoſe next to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether it mean as it pretends, that if it do, we may give it welcome; if not, we may Detect its Fraud: For as I ſhould much rejoice to hear of ſo much amendment of the Roman Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which I thought had been ſuppoſed by themſelves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible; So I muſt confeſs that I am ſo much for plain and open dealing, that I think it my duty to help to bring their works into the Light, and try how they agree with the Truth and among themſelves; that men may judge of them as they are.</p>

Perron,</hi> that I need not, and therefore intend not to ſay much here upon that ſubject. But this Diſputation I principally intend, 1. For the ſubverting of the <hi>Foundation of Popery,</hi> which is the ſuppoſition, that the <hi>Viſible Catholick Church muſt needs be united in ſome Humane Viſible Head.</hi> 2. To confute the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the moderate ſort of French Papiſts and <hi>Grotians,</hi> that take a <hi>General Council</hi> to be the Legiſlative Head, and the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Head while they are in Being; and the Pope ruling by the Laws of Councils, to be the ordinary Judicial Head. 3. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſome perſons from a dangerous Temptation, that by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> or his followers here in <hi>England</hi> are drawn into a conceit that the Catholick Church is ſuch a Body as we here deny, and think that the unity that the Scripture ſo commendeth to us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained without an Univerſal Viſible Head: which Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theirs is much increaſed by obſerving the differences of Opinions in the world; which every good man doth lament, as we do all the ſins and frailties that on earth accompany us in the ſtate of imperfection. As I blame not thoſe that deſire perfect Knowledge, or Holineſs; but blame them that promiſe it to the Church on Earth, when it is the prerogative of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and much more ſhould blame him that would ſay we ſhall be perfectly Wiſe and Holy if we will but be of this Opinion, that the Church hath an Infallible Humame Head; even ſo I blame not them that deſire perfect Concord (the Conſequent of perfect Knowledge and Holineſs;) for this is to deſire Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But I blame them that promiſe us this Heaven on Earth; and them much more that tell us we ſhall have it if we will but believe that a Pope or Council is the Univerſal Head; and ſo will condemn the Church on Earth, becauſe it hath not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Celeſtial perfection, which they have once fancied that it may and ſhould attain.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Grotius</hi> his opinion, deſign and great endeavours to reduce the Churches to Popery, under the pretence of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, I have lately by the Invitation of Mr. <hi>Thomas Pierce</hi> given in my Evidence (I think beyond all further queſtion) out of his own writings, in his frequent and expreſs aſſertions. And <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Dialyſis</hi> and his <hi>Apologet.</hi> and other writings hath ſufficiently confuted him. The miſtakes of many in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Grotius,</hi> are cauſed by their ſuppoſition, that the man was
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:55445:218"/>
the ſame in his firſt Conciliatory enterpriſes, and in his laſt, which is not true. He oft profeſſeth his mutations himſelf, and how apt he was to diſlike that which he had but lately thought or ſaid: At firſt he thought out of Reconciling the Proteſtants among themſelves: But afterwards his deſign was to Reconcile them with the Papiſts, and that by drawing them all to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that is, to unite in the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> as the Univerſal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, ruling according to Canons and Decrees; and this he thought was the only way to the union of the Churches.</p>
                     <p>The Truth of this, and the Miſchiefs of the Enterpriſe, muſt be apprehended by him that will underſtand my endeavours in this diſpute, and eſcape the ſnare thats laid for their perverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for the Truth of it, I refer you to my foreſaid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Grotian</hi> Religion. Since which it pleaſed Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> to publiſh a ſheet containing (not any thing that hath the leaſt aptitude to perſwade a rational man that Grotianiſm is not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, but) ſome Reaſons why he doth not, at leaſt, as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the vindication, with a General profeſſion how eaſily he can do it, and make me a Winding ſheet, at leaſt as ſutable as that which I made for Popery (which when he hath confuted, I ſhall better know his mind and ſtrength) This with two or three frivolous Exceptions, and many ſwelling words of Vanity, with certain Squibs and empty jeers, according to the manner of the man, is the matter of his Advertiſement. Nothing could have been eaſier for him then to ſay <hi>[or almoſt to ſay,</hi> that <hi>I am very liable, in every line]</hi> and that his <hi>advantages are too many,</hi> and that I am <hi>an advocate for the crimſon ſins of others, and an enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miaſt of my own.</hi> Nothing more vain then his oſtentation of the mild diſcharge of his Cenſorſhip, and his ſenſleſs intimation that I take the <hi>Virtues</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal Divines,</hi> for <hi>glittering ſins,</hi> when he never had a word from me of ſuch a ſence or tendency. (But <hi>Grotians</hi> will now be but <hi>Epiſcopal Divines,</hi> and their <hi>glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſins,</hi> muſt be their <hi>Virtues.)</hi> Becauſe I had acknowledged how civilly he dealt with me (no doubt on a ſuppoſition that I was neerer his conceits then thoſe that he had ſo copiouſly reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) he takes it as an acknowledgement of his moderation, as if it were the proof of a mans moderation, that he can give a civil word to any, and a while refrain abuſing one, while he is abuſing many. I am thankfull to him that ſpits in moſt mens faces, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:55445:219"/>
he ſpeaks to, that he ſpitteth not in mine; when I give a civil man no ſuch thanks. When I commend a man for not belying me, reproaching me, or otherwiſe abuſing me, as he doth others, I ſhould ſuſpect he would take it for a diſpraiſe: For I uſe not to thank good men for doing me no miſchief. His valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecurity of his own eſtate above <hi>Davids</hi> or <hi>Peters</hi> (that had ſuch ſpecial Teſtimonies of their Holineſs, and Promiſes from God, before theirs falls,) and his defending his Malignant ſins as vertues, his venemous reproaches of Puritans and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians as Proteſtants frightned out of their wits, men of ſedition and violence, and a bloody Generation, with abundance of the like, and then telling us that he meant no Puritans but ſuch (as if one ſhould ſay, the Arminians are a perfidious bloody Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and then ſay, Its well known that he meant no Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans but ſuch,) theſe and ſuch like paſſages ſhew the quality of the man and his Advertiſement. He that durſt openly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently charge his adverſaries with ſlanders, and yet tell the world, that I <hi>[pretend that the difference between him and his Antagoniſts is meerly Verball]</hi> (becauſe I ſaid <hi>that Moſt of our contentions about thoſe points are more about words then mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that ſuch eager men as he and his Antagoniſt, do make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others believe that we differ much more about them then we do.]</hi> Is this equipollent to <hi>[a difference meerly verball?])</hi> this man its like dare do the ſame by others.</p>
                     <p>But it is the buſineſs of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon which I am to meddle with him. And firſt he ſaith <hi>[that on the ſame Reaſons as I conclude him a Papiſt, I muſt conclude him a Proteſtant, unleſs I think as hardly of the</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Confeſſion as of the Council of</hi> Trent.] <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall yield it, when you have proved <hi>[that a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is one that holdeth to the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and the New Creed by Pope</hi> Pius, <hi>made long after the</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Confeſſion, and that the Common Government in which all the Catholick Church muſt unite, is the Univerſal Headſhip of the Pope, governing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Canons and Decrees, and that the</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Confeſſion is ſo 'to be expounded (by fair means or foul) as ſhall be agreeable to, or conſiſtent with all this.]</hi> We uſe not to call ſuch men as theſe Proteſtants, but Papiſts, but if this be your meaning when you call your ſelf a Proteſtant, you ſhould have told us ſooner, if you deſire to be known.</p>

He ſaith (the proof of which we wait for) that I <hi>[miſtake at once the whole drift of</hi> Grotius <hi>his excellent</hi> Diſcuſſio Apol. <hi>and that I tranſlate not his Latine into Engliſh, or lamely, &amp;c.] Anſw.</hi> 1. Nothing more eaſie, then to tell me I miſtake! Are not his words plain enough, and frequent enough to open to us ſo much of his mind as I have charged him with? Let the Readers of his words recited by me, be the Judges: (For him that will believe you, either to ſave him the labour of reading, or againſt his eye ſight, he is not one of them that I write for; but ſhall have Liberty for me to be deceived.) 2. That I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated not the words of <hi>Grotius,</hi> was purpoſely done, foredeeming that ſuch men as you would have ſaid they were miſtranſlated, and that they were not his own but mine: I am ſure now that I give you but his own: And if you think him wronged if the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Reader know him not, by a Tranſlation, I pray you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the words your ſelf; for I ſuppoſe you will leaſt quarrel with your own. But to pleaſure you, I will Tranſlate (as well as I can) the paſſage which you chooſe out to defend, and a few more. <hi>Diſcuſ. Apol. pag.</hi> 255. <hi>[Thoſe that knew</hi> Grotius, <hi>know that he alwayes wiſhed for the reſtitution of Chriſtians into One and the ſame body: But he ſometime thought, even after he was known to the moſt Illuſtrious</hi> Vairius, <hi>that it might be begun by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Proteſtants among themſelves: Afterwards he ſaw that this was altogether unfeaſible; becauſe, beſides that the</hi> genius <hi>of almoſt all the Calviniſts is moſt alien from all peace, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are not joyned among themſelves by any Common Government of the Church; which are the cauſes that the parties made cannot be gathered into one Body of Proteſtants; yea and that more and more parties are ready to riſe out of them. Wherefore</hi> Grotius <hi>now abſolutely judgeth, and many with him, that the Proteſtants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no be joined among themſelves, unleſs at once they be joined to them that cohere to the Sea of</hi> Rome: <hi>without which there can no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Government be hoped for in the Church. Therefore he wiſheth that the divulſion which fell out, and the cauſes of that divulſion may be taken away. The Primacy of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons is none of theſe, as</hi> Melanchton <hi>confeſſeth.]</hi> I think this is the Engliſh of <hi>Grotius</hi> words (be it ſpoken with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to the preheminence of Mr. <hi>Pierces</hi> Tranſlating faculty.) But here he hath a quarrel, and that ſo momentous, as to be
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:55445:220"/>
his grand, if not only inſtance of my miſdealing; and ſo he hath written enough <hi>againſt the Contagion of my Volume!</hi> A happy generation! that can make what they will true or falſe by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting it, and can give themſelves the victory at their pleaſure by triumphing, and by wiping their mouths, can make themſelves innocent! and by ſaying any thing, or ſuch a nothing as this, can prove Popery to be the Proteſtant Religion, and make many Worſhipful Gentlemen of their mind, that were of their mind before they knew it, implicitely believing in them, and in their Church. Well: but what is my miſcarriage? Why <hi>[the later part of theſe words, which are the chief,</hi> Mr. Baxter <hi>takes no notice of in the Engliſh account which he renders of them.] Anſw.</hi> 1. He ſuppoſed that you and all that he wrote this for underſtood La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, though in Anſwer to an Engliſh Cavill, he wrote his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Engliſh. And he that Tranſlated none of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, thought it no injury, to give account in Engliſh but of part. 2.

That to the true and ancient doctrine, many quirks of the Schoolmen that were better skli'd in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> then the Scriptures, were introduced, out of a liberty of diſputing, not out of the Authority of Univerſal Councils. And the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſtabliſht in the Church were leſs fitly explicated. 2. That Pride and Covetouſneſs, and manners of ill example prevailed among the Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And really did you think that he is no Papiſt that is but againſt the Schoolmens Opinions, and the Prelates Pride, Covetouſneſs, and Idleneſs? and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that they call the Decrees of General Councils? Hath not the Council at <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> decreed that the Pope is above a General Council? and the Council at <hi>Lateran</hi> decreed that Princes are to be depoſed, and their Subjects abſolved from their fidelity, if they exterminate not Hereticks (ſuch as Proteſtants) out of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Is he no Papiſt that holds all that is in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> if he be againſt ſome School-points not determined, and againſt the Prelates Pride? Well Sir, I underſtand you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I did: And though you thought meet (that your words might be conform to one another, and not to truth) to ſay that I called you Arminian and Pelagian, I purpoſe (if I had done ſo) to call you an Arminian no more: But I beſeech you cry not out of perſecution till the men of your mind will give us leave to be Rectors of Churches in their Dominions, as you and others of your mind are allowed to be in theſe.

                     <p>But I promiſed you ſome more of <hi>Grotius</hi> in Engliſh to ſtop your mouth, (or open it whether you ſee cauſe:) and you ſhall have it. <hi>Diſcuſ. pag.</hi> 14.

If words do ſignifie any thing, it here appears, that <hi>Grotius</hi> his Religion is that which is contained in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> with all the reſt, and the reformation which will content him is only againſt undetermined School-Opinions, and ill manners that Croſs the doctrines of the Councils.

And when perſons thus diſpoſed by humanity and grace, ſhall be quite miſtaken in the very thing they ſeek, even in the Nature of the Churches unity and peace, they will think themſelves bound with all their zeal and diligence, to endeavour the doing of an evill work, and to accompliſh a work neither poſſible nor deſirable.

of Churches and Common-wealths, and abuſing and endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſouls, is like to be the fruit of ſuch miſtakes about the Churches Unity and Peace. And as the School uſeth to ſay (from <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Anſelm) Malum non eſt niſi à bono &amp; prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bonum,</hi> ſo it will be like by experience to be made a proverb, that <hi>Bellum &amp; diſcordia non ſunt niſi à pacificis &amp; propter pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem:</hi> The greateſt diſcords and wars will be from the Love and Endeavour of Unity and Concord, and for the obtaining of them by impoſſible means. Theſe following evills may eaſily be foreſeen.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If men miſtake about the Nature of the viſible form of the Catholick Church, and its unity, it is like to pervert their judgements in many other weighty points of Religion. For when they have received this Error as a Truth, then they will be exceedingly inclined to bend the reſt of their opinions to it, and contrive them into a Conſiſtent Form. For Truth would to Truth, as Fire would to Fire, and Water to Water. Yea all that is flexible within them ſhall be bended to the intereſt of this conceit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As ſoon as ever any man hath received this opinion of the neceſſity of an Univerſal Viſible Head, or common Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Chruch, he is either a Papiſt, or of an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion equivalent in folly, tyrannie, and impiety, to Popery. For if ſuch a Viſible Head muſt be, there is no other that can pretend to it with Reaſon or Honeſty any more then the Pope: Nor is it our quarrel againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>their Biſhop</hi> rather then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be this uſurping Head, but that they would have ſuch a one at all! It is not who ſhall be the man, or power, but whether there ſhall be any ſuch man or power that we diſpute. This Error about the Neceſſity of an Univerſal Viſible Head, is the very thing that turneth moſt to Popery, and this is the common argument that is mannaged by deceivers to that end, as their writings commonly declare.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And then when men are drawn over to be Papiſts for the avoiding of Schiſm, and the obtaining of Unity, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares involved in the moſt deſperate Schiſm; which I have proved that party to be guilty of: (and with it drink in the dregs of all the <hi>Roman</hi> abominations.) When men have ſet up a new Church-form, by ſetting up a new Head and Center of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:55445:224"/>
Unity, and then judge of all particular Churches and Members by this ſtandard, it leadeth them unavoidably to ſeparate from all the Churches and Chriſtians upon earth, that conſpire not, and center not with them in their new deviſed Head.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And by this means Charity is much deſtroyed in mens ſouls, (and he that hath leaſt of Love, hath leaſt of God) and the Preachers and Paſtors turn all their ſtudies into matter of Controverſie, and their labors into wranglings, and all under pretence of Catholick Unity: And having not charity, they prove not only ſounding braſs, and tinkling Cymbals in their moſt learned labors, but too often burning braſs (like <hi>Perillus</hi> Bull,) and military Trumpets, and all this under pretenſe of Charity, when they have deſtroyed it. Hence is it that uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable cenſures are ſo common, and the Lambs of Chriſt ſo often cloathed in the skins of Wolves, by the Wolves that have by exchange put on the skin of the Lamb. Scarſe a man that croſſeth or diſpleaſeth (that is, diſſenteth from, or diſobeyeth) the uncharitable Clergy, but he is ſtigmatized for an Heretick, and charged with almoſt as much wickedneſs, as their mouths are wide enough to utter, and the ears of other men to hear. What horrid things have they ſpoken of the poor <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians?</hi> Of <hi>Luther, Oecolampadius, Calvin,</hi> and who not? Though I have had applauding flattering Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from ſome of them that tryed whether I were flexible and ductile, yet I doubt not but I ſhall have my ſhare my ſelf before they have done with me: &amp; I wonder I hear not of it before now. Hence among other reaſons its like that Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> became ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Charity, as to diſgorge his ſould of ſo many bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and calumnies againſt the Puritans and Presbyterians, whom if he know not, he ſinneth but as <hi>Paul</hi> did, but if he know, he terrifieth us from his principles by the fruits: that which ſhews the want of Charity, ſhews the want of ſaving Grace: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the want of right to Glory. Hence it is that the greateſt Schiſmaticks are the commoneſt accuſers of their Brethren with ſchiſm, Phariſaically ſaying, I thank thee Lord that I am not as other men, nor as theſe Schiſmaticks. Hence alſo it is that ſo many learned well-meaning Papiſts do ſo pervert their ſtudies and endeavors, and abuſe and loſe (and worſe then loſe) their wits and parts to draw men to their way; compaſſing Sea and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:55445:225"/>
Land to make a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Proſelite, eſpecially of a Prince, or man of power, intereſt, or ability to ſerve them. What pains take they to draw Nations to their minds, and to embroil the world in contentions and confuſions to attain their ends? What horrid perſecutions, Maſſacres, and barbarous inhumane cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties have multitudes of men of learning and good parts and natures been ingaged in, by the very Principle that I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, and for the promoting of their kind of Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in wicked and impoſsible ways?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Beſides this, it takes men off from ſeeking the true Peace of the hurch, while they miſtakingly purſue a falſe peace. The Devil, the cunning Enemy of Concord, hath not a more effectual way to take men off from the ways and means of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, then by ſtarting them a falſe game, and cauſing them to lay out all their labor to build a <hi>Babel,</hi> when they ſhould be building <hi>Zion.</hi> Oh what a bleſſed ſtate might the Church be in if all the Jeſuites, Fryers, Prelates, Prieſts and others, had laid out that labor for a righteous poſſible Unity and Peace, in Gods appointed way, which they have vainly and impiouſly laid out to unite the world in a Vice-chriſt or Vice-god?</p>
                     <p>Fore ſeeing, and at preſent feeling many of theſe calamitous conſequences to the Church, I think it of exceeding moment, that mens judgements ſhould be rectified that are miſled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the unity of the Church: Still profeſſing that to me they are the deareſt Chriſtians, and neareſt to my heart, that are moſt for Unity and Concord, ſo it be in Chriſt, and upon righteous poſſible conditions.</p>

part, I ſhall think no more here neceſſary, then to tell you in certain Propoſitions, How much we Grant, and How far we are Agreed, and then to tell you what it is that we deny, and wherein we differ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. We are Agreed that Chriſt hath a true Catholick Church on earth, and ever hath had ſince firſt he planted it, and ever will have to the end of the world, and that the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, or hath it ever had an Interci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a day or an hour: and that this Church is ſo far Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that it never was, nor ever will be ignorant of, or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous againſt any Article of faith, or part of obedience that is of abſolute Neceſſity to ſalvation (otherwiſe by that error it ſhould have ceaſed to be the Church of Chriſt.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. We are agreed that this Catholick Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Internal faith and charity of the Members, and their Communion with Chriſt by the quickening Spirit on his part, and holy ſincere returns of devotion on theirs, may be called, <hi>Myſtical,</hi> or <hi>Inviſible.</hi> The thing is utterly undenyable, though ſome Papiſts in the perverſneſs of contentious Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſeem to deny it. And doubtleſs when they aſſert that Chriſt hath no Inviſible Church, they muſt mean it ſimply, and not <hi>quoad haeo interiora,</hi> or elſe they ſpeak againſt all ſenſe and Reaſon. No <hi>man</hi> is ſimply Inviſible: but every man <hi>as to his ſoul</hi> is Inviſible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. We are Agreed that this Catholick Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>outward Profeſſion</hi> of this Inward Faith and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in regard of the diſcernable numbers of perſons making this Profeſsion, hath ever been viſible, ſince firſt it began to be viſible: And that the viſibility hath never had any interciſion. If ſome Proteſtanss ſay otherwiſe, it's clear that this is all that by the common judgement of Proteſtants is maintained, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtians, and the Catholick Church containing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing Chriſtians through the world, have ever ſince their firſt planting had a viſible being; but yet 1. That the Viſibility was not ſuch but that Hereticks (as the <hi>Arrians</hi> did) might make a controverſie of it, whether they, or the true Chriſtians were the Church indeed, and by their greater numbers or Power might blind men, that they ſhould not ſee which was the true Church. 2. And that in the Catholick Church ſome parts may
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55445:226"/>
be much more corrupt, and others much more pure; and the Purer part be ſo much the leſſer, and oppreſſed and vilified by the more corrupt, that the moſt part ſhould not diſcern their Purity, but take them (as they did the <hi>Waldenſes)</hi> for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. 3. And that two parts or more of this Catholick Church may ſo fall out among themſelves, as that one of them ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the other to be part of the Catholick Church, when yet they really for all that cenſure remain parts of it, as much as they: And hereupon may grow a conteſt between them, which of the two is the true Catholick Church, and one part may ſay, It is we and not you; and the other may ſay, It is we and not you: and no man ſhall be able to diſcern which of the two is the Catholick Church, becauſe it is neither of them, but each are a part. 4. And though the Bodies of the members are viſible, and their Worſhipping actions Viſible, and their Profeſſion audible, yet the faith Profeſſed is not Viſible; nor the Truth of their Profeſſion, or of their Chriſtianity, or Church; Truth being the object of the Intellect, and not of ſence. 5. And though the true members of the Church do know the true Church, and ſo it is apparent unto them, yet moſt that are not members of it, do not know it. Arrians and Mahometans know us to be men profeſſing ſuch and ſuch Articles of faith: but they know not that to be the true faith, nor us to be the true Church, but judge the contrary. In this ſence (contained in theſe Propoſitions) it is that Proteſtants deny the Church to have been alwayes Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and not as the Papiſts commonly miſtake them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. We are agreed that this Catholick Church is but <hi>One:</hi> There are not two Viſible, nor two Myſtical Catholick Churches: Nor are the Myſticall and Viſible, two: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> might have ſpared all his labour that he hath beſtowed in vain upon this point, to prove that the Viſible and Inviſible are not two Catholick Churches. The Proteſtants are further from that Opinion then the Papiſts: and it is more ſuitable to the Popiſh Intereſt and Cauſe to be of that Opinion, then to the Proteſtants. If it were not that they are paſt learning, by the advantage of their Infallibility, and eſpecially of one man, and one ſo mean, condemned by them, and that it is unlawfull to be a Teacher of Error, I could tell them of a new device by the advantage of this diſtinction of Catholick Churches, for the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:55445:226"/>
modelling their miſtakes into a more ſpecious plauſible form, then now it appeareth in to the reſt of the Churches. But we are glad of their company in any Truth, and therefore will not diſagree from them in that which makes againſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>One Objection I once heard a Learned Anabaptiſt caſt in our way, <hi>viz. There may be a Viſible Church of hypocrites: therefore the Myſtical and Viſible may be two. Anſw.</hi> But the Queſtion was of the Catholick Church, and not of a particular Church. We confeſs that ſome members of the Catholick Church are My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Viſible in the ſeveral reſpects before mentioned: and that ſome are Viſible and not Myſtical, or as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> well calls them, <hi>Dead Members, and not Living;</hi> and that the <hi>Church as Viſible,</hi> is more comprehenſive then the <hi>Church as Regenerate, or Inviſible,</hi> and yet all but <hi>One Church,</hi> though it have more members in it in one reſpect then in another: And we confeſs that its poſſible for twenty or an hundred of theſe Dead members to conſtitute a <hi>particular Church</hi> by themſelves (though it is not uſual for Viſible Churches to be without Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members:) and ſo there may be a <hi>particular Viſible Dead Member</hi> (Analogically called a Member,) or a <hi>particular Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church that is thus Dead;</hi> and theſe be parts of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church <hi>as Viſible.</hi> But yet there is not two Catholick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, One Viſible, and the other Inviſible, one <hi>alive</hi> and the other <hi>Dead.</hi> In a Corn field there are, 1. Good Corn. 2. Stricken, blaſted Corn, that hath a name and ſhew, but in deed no Corn. 3. Tares, darnell, cockle, and ſuch weeds. It is called, <hi>A Field</hi> as it conteineth them all: It is called <hi>[a Corn field]</hi> only from the <hi>Corn.</hi> The Univocal proper parts of a <hi>Corn field,</hi> is the Corn only: The Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Analogical parts are alſo the blaſted ears: The darnel and cockle are no parts, but noxious accidents. There are not two fields of Corn, one of true Corn, and the of other blaſted ears: And yet the Corn field, taken largely and Analogically, hath more parties in it then true Corn: and you may perhaps have ſome particular ſheavs that are wholly of that which is blaſted: which you will call a ſheaf of Corn Analogically only: but a ſheaf of weeds you will not at all call a ſheaf of Corn. Even ſo in the Catholick Church, there are ſincere Chriſtians which are true and living members; and there are Hypocrites which are Analogically members; and there are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally mixed many that by denying eſſential points of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:55445:227"/>
faith, or by notorious Impiety, do declare themſelves to be weeds, and no members of the Church at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. We are alſo Agreed that this One Viſible Catholick Church, is One Political Holy Society, as united in Jeſus Chriſt the Head, who teacheth and ruleth it by his Miniſters and other Officers, in the ſeveral parts, according to the neceſſity of each. We call it One Political Society, 1. Principally becauſe that all the Church is united in this One Soveraign, or Head, the Lord Jeſus: and therefore it is called his body. 2. They have all the ſame holy doctrine of faith, and Law to live by, and be judged by. 3. They have all Church Officers of the ſame ſort under Chriſt to teach and govern them. 4. They have all the ſame kind of Holy Ordinances, as Reading, Preaching, Praying, Praiſe, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appointed them by the Lord. 5. They are all engaged in One and the ſame Holy Covenant to the Lord: More might be mentioned (and ſhall be God willing, in a peculiar Treatiſe of Catholiciſm, or the Catholick Church) And though Chriſt himſelf be not now ſeen among us, yet may he truly be called a Viſible Head. For 1. He ſometime lived viſibly on earth. 2. And is now the Viſible King of all the Church, as he is in the Heavens. Though we ſee him not, the Celeſtiall Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants do. It is but little of the world that ſeeth the Pope, any more then they ſee Chriſt: If one unſeen to us may be a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Viſible Head, the other may be truly ſo. So that the Body, Head, Laws, Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being Viſible, ſo is the Policy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. We are agreed alſo, that all theſe Chriſtians, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, are obliged by Chriſt, even by the very Law of Nature, and the ends of their calling, and the General Laws of the Goſpell, to live in as much Love, and Unity, and Peace as they can; and to hold as full and extenſive communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they can: that is, as far as their work requireth, and their Capacity will permit and enable them; thoſe that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitans and members of one Congregation, muſt hold local communion in that Congregation, unleſs Neceſſity prohibite. Thoſe that through diſtance are uncapable of joining in the ſame Aſſemblies, ſhould yet be conjoined, 1. In the ſame Lord, Faith, Baptiſm, Covenant, Profeſſion. 2. In the ſame bond of Chriſtian ſpecial Love. 3. In the uſe of the ſame ſort of holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as to the Subſtance, though they differ in circumſtances,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:55445:227"/>
as in the Word, Prayer, Praiſes, Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. And in one ſort of Church Officers and Government. And as far as we have to do with each other, all this ſhould be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and we ſhould readily own one another as Brethren and true Churches, notwithſtanding leſſer differences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. To theſe ends it is meet that the Biſhops or Paſtors of the Churches ſhould hold in way of Aſſociation, as frequent Aſſemblies as is needfull, for the maintaining of mutual Love and Correſpondency, and right underſtanding of each other, and to manifeſt their unity, and aſſiſt each other in the work of God, that it may be the more ſucceſsfully carried on by united ſtrength againſt all oppoſitions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Theſe Aſſociations ſhould ſo far know the members Aſſociated, as is neceſſary to the holding of a Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, and therefore ſhould not admit all into their Aſſociation, but ſuch as either produce the Evidences of ſound faith and Holy life, or <hi>literas communicatorias,</hi> certificates from credible members of their communion, that the perſons are fit for their Communion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. Theſe Aſſociations are principally for the Union and Communion of Churches, and therefore muſt apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the maintaining and promoting of Unity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. Such Aſſociations ſhould therefore have their ſet times of frequent meeting in Synods, for Ordinary help of one another, beſides extraordinary meetings on extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which none ſhould neglect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. We agree that ſuch Aſſociated Paſtors may have their Moderators either <hi>pro tempore,</hi> or ſtated at the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. And that it is no great matter whether he be called a Preſident, Biſhop, Moderator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which all ſhould have liberty, ſo far as that the peace of the Church be not caſt away for ſuch names.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. We are alſo agreed that whatſoever ſhall be concluded in order to the Union and Communion of Churches, in any of theſe Synods, the particular Aſſociated Members muſt obſerve, they being thereto obliged, by Vertue of thoſe General pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts thet require us to do all in Unity and Concord, and with one mind and mouth to glorifie God, and to avoid diviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Except they be ſuch things as cannot be obeyed, unleſs we
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:55445:228"/>
violate the Law of God. Thus far the Canons, that is, Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of leſſer Synods or greater are obligatory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. We are alſo Agreed, that when ever the good of the Church requireth it, there may be Greater Aſſemblies alſo held, conſiſting of many of theſe conjunct, or ſpeciall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers delegate by the reſt: And that this courſe ſhould extend as far as our capacity will allow in needfull caſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 14. Laſtly we ſhall grant, that where Paſtors cannot through diſtance or other Impediments, hold Synods, or any particular Churches cannot ſend any competent members to ſuch Synods, yet may they, when its needfull, by meſſengers certifie each other of their faith, profeſſions, practiſes, and particular doubts and caſes, and ſo hold communion, in ſome degree; owning each other as Brethren in one Lord, and by ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Meſſengers and Letters as we are capable of, aſſiſting, and ſeeking aſſiſtance from each other: As <hi>Baſil</hi> and the reſt of the Eaſtern Biſhops did to the Weſtern in their diſtreſs while they had hope. And the faith of all the Churches that are neer enough for any externall communion, being thus known, their <hi>Literae Communicatoriae</hi> may be valid and ſatisfactory, when any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber paſſeth into other parts.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I hope we are Agreed: This much I am ſure we hold our ſelves: But now the difference followeth.</p>
                     <p>We hold that this Univerſal Church (which is one in Chriſt their Head, as the world is one Kingdom in God the abſolute Soveraign King) is by Chriſt diſtributed into many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, diſperſed over the face of the Earth, and that theſe as ſeveral Corporations in one Kingdom, have all their particular Governours and Order. All forcible Government we aſcribe to the Magiſtrate, and deny it to the Paſtors of the Church. And that teaching and Guidance which is called Eccleſiaſtick Government, we ſuppoſe is the work of every Paſtor in his flock, and the Ordering of the communion of Churches, by Canons, Agreements (and their execution in part) is the work of Synods. And as in this Kingdom, all the Free-ſchools are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Schoolmaſters, who are all under the Prince and Laws, without any General Schoolmaſters to Teach, or Overſee, and Rule the reſt, (and without Synods too, though they may
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55445:228"/>
meet when their mutual Edification requires it,) and yet all the Schools in <hi>England</hi> are in Peace, becauſe no Archſcoolmaſters preſume to rob the Magiſtrate of his power: Even ſo we judge, that if Paſtors do but Teach and Guide their ſeverall flocks, and the Magiſtrate keep and uſe his power of forcible Government, that is, in ſeeing that they do their Offices faithfully, and no Archpaſtors preſume to take the power of the Magiſtrates out of their hands, the Churches may have quietneſs and peace: (ſtill allowing a greater Neceſſity of Communion, and ſo of Synods, among Churches then among Schools, and reſerving the rod to the ſecular power.) And we concieve, that moſt of the ſtir that Popes and Popiſh Prelates have made about Church Government, hath been but to rob the Magiſtrate of his due, and to become themſelves the Church-Magiſtrates through the world.</p>
                     <p>But that the Church hath any Politicall Univerſal Head but Chriſt alone, either a Vice god, or Vice-Chriſt, either Pope or Council; that any one is as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>[in the place of God, the maker of all things and Laws,]</hi> this we deny; That the whole Church on Earth, is ſo one Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Society, as to be under any one terreſtial numericall Head, whether perſonal or collective, Pope, Council, or Patriarks, having power of Legiſlation, or judgement over the whole, and by whom each member is to be Governed, this we deny: and think it as abſurd (and much more ſinfull) as to affirm that all the world muſt needs have one Viſible Monarch under God to repreſent him; and that he is no ſubject to the God of Heaven, that acknowledgeth not this Viſible Univerſall Monarch. We deny that the Church is ſuch a Society: We deny that it hath ſuch an Head: We deny that it hath any ſuch univerſal Humane Laws: We deny that the parts of it are to be conjoyned by the ſubordinate Officers (Cardinals, Patriarks, Archbiſhops, or what ever) of ſuch an uſurping Soveraign. We affirm that no Chriſtian ſhould fancy or aſſert that any ſuch Head and Order for unity is appointed by Chriſt; or that it is Deſirable, or <hi>Rome</hi> to be the better liked of becauſe it pleadeth for ſuch an Order, or vainly boaſteth of ſuch of an unity; or that any ſhould dare to contrive the promoting of it. Yea we maintain that ſuch fancies and contrivances are the moſt notable means of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:55445:229"/>
the diviſion, or deſolation of the Churches; And that it is the notable hinderance of the unity of all the Chriſtian Churches, that ſuch a falſe Head and Center of unity is ſet up, and an Impoſſible Impious unity pleaded for, and furiouſly ſought by fire and ſword, inſtead of the true deſirable unity: And that the Churches will never have true unity and peace if theſe principles of theirs be not diſgraced and diſowned, and the true principles better underſtood.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the management of the Arguments for the Negative, I ſhall principally deal with them that would Head the Church with a Council, that is, would make the Church to be autono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall, and be the Soveraign, or chief Governour of it ſelf, or the Church Repreſentative of the Church reall (as they uſe to call them.) As to them that Head it with the Pope, I have ſaid enough already, and others much more, eſpecially <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> unanſwerably. Yet I ſhall partly take them alſo in my way, though I deal principally with the other.</p>
                     <p>And theſe brief Arguments may ſerve to confute the Vice-chriſtſhip or Soveraignty of the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is no ſuch Head Inſtituted by Chriſt. The Scripture pretenſes for it I have before confuted, and they are ſo poor, that they vaniſh of themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Popes Soveraignty is againſt the Judgement of the Ancient Fathers, and practiſe of the Primitive Church, as I have proved in this and a former Book.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is againſt Tradition, as brought down to us by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Church on earth by far, as is before proved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is againſt the Judgement of the far greateſt part of the preſent Catholick Church, as is proved.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is the the meer effect of pride and tyranny: a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:55445:229"/>
to ſet up one man over all the world for his greatneſs, and their hurt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The pretenſe of this Soveraignty is the conſequent only of <hi>Romes</hi> greatneſs, and the will of Emperours, that to conform the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate to the civil, did give a Primacy to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> within the Empire.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It is a meer impoſſibility for one man to be the Soveraign of all the Churches in the world, and do the work of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign for them. He had need of many millions and millions of Treaſure to defray the charge (which <hi>Peter</hi> had not.) While he pretends to govern all the world, he doth but leave them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed, or not by him. How can he govern all thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Dominions of Infidels, that will not endure his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? There are more then all the Papiſts in the world now from under his Government voluntarily, that could not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him if they would.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. There are yet viſible many great Churches that were planted by the Apoſtles, or in their dayes, and never were under <hi>Romes</hi> Soveraignty to this day, as the <hi>Aetheopians, Perſians, Indians,</hi> and moſt that were without the verge of the Roman Empire.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. There is no uſe for ſuch an Head, as I ſhall ſhew anon, of Councils.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. There is not ſo much Reaſon for it, or poſſibility of it, as that One man muſt be King or Monarch of all the world. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that ſpiritual Government requireth reſidency, and can leſs be done by Deputies then temporal: And that Princes are truly Church-Governours alſo in their kind and way.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is an intolerable uſurpation of the Power of all Chriſtian Princes and Paſtors, who conjunctly in their ſeveral wayes are intruſted by God with the Government of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches under them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. To make ſuch a Soveraign, is to make a new Catholick Church, that Chriſt never made.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. And its the moſt notorious ſchiſm, dividing themſelves from all the Catholick Church, that are not their ſubjects.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And inhumane cruelty to damn all (as much as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens at leaſt) that believe not in the Pope, be they never ſo holy.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:55445:230"/>
15. To ſet up a Vice-god (as Pope <hi>Julius</hi> paraphraſtically cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf) and a Vice chriſt on earth over all the Church (as the Papiſt commonly do, maintaining that the Pope is the Vicar of Chriſt) is to ſet up an Idoll, and a name of Blaſphemy, againſt Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe prerogative it is to be the ſole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Head; And therefore he muſt needs be an Antichriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be The Antichriſt or not. This much to the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Theſ. <hi>The Catholick Church of Chriſt is not one Viſible Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>

                        <hi>body, as joyned to one Univerſal Viſible Head or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, (ſave only Chriſt:) And conſequently it is not the way to heal the Churches diviſions, to draw all into ſuch a body, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſuch an Union.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I make good by theſe following Arguments, which reach both the Italian Papiſts, that would have the Pope to be the Head or Soveraign; and the French and Caſſandrian, who would have a General Council to be the Head, and the Pope only to be the chief Patriarch, and the <hi>Principium Unitatis:</hi> For if I prove that the Body is not one, as Headed by any except Chriſt, I ſhall ſay enough againſt both theſe opinions: But yet as is ſaid, it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally againſt the later (who are for the Headſhip of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) that I ſhall direct my Arguments; becauſe they are the buſie Reconcilers, and becauſe the reſt are ſo largely confuted already on both ſides.</p>
                     <p>Argument 1. <hi>That which is the true form of the Catholick Church of Chriſt, it retaineth</hi> de facto <hi>at this day: But it retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a Political Union under a Viſible Terreſtrial Univerſal Head: therefore this is not the true form of the Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, what the Catholick Church is <hi>quoad eſſentiam,</hi> that it is alſo <hi>quoad exiſtentiam:</hi> But it is not ſuch a Body <hi>quoad exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam;</hi> therefore not <hi>quoad eſſentiam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any will grant the concluſion, <hi>quoad eſſentiam vel formam,</hi>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:55445:230"/>
and ſay that this Policy, Head and Union are not eſſential to the Church, but ſeparable accidents tending only <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> he will give away his cauſe: For the <hi>Pars Imperans</hi> and <hi>pars ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> are the two eſſential parts of a body Politick, or Republick, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, as a ſoul and body are the parts of man: and if it want either part, the eſſence is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It hath loſt its Political form. But I need not ſtand on this, becauſe the caſe is paſt controverſie, and I know not of any that make the objection, or will go on ſuch terms: I am ſure thoſe do not that I have now to deal with. Another thing there may be that is called a Church, without this Form or Head, but not this ſame thing or body that now we ſpeak of.</p>
                     <p>The Major propoſition I prove thus: The Church of Chriſt is a true Church at this day, or retaineth its eſſential parts: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it retaineth its form. If its eſſentials were not in exiſtence, the Church were extinct, or did not exiſt: But that the Church is not extinct or nulled, the opponents will eaſily grant, and the promiſe of Chriſt will eaſily prove; The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The Minor I prove thus; If the Catholick Church be now Headed with one Viſible Head (beſide Chriſt,) then it is either the Pope or a General Council. But it is neither of theſe. That it is not the Pope, the French will grant. And 1. Its prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large by many a volume of Proteſtant writers; and 2. By the preſent viſible ſtate of the Church; The greateſt part of the Church on Earth (and all thoſe in Heaven) diſown the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Soveraignty or Headſhip of the Pope; The Greeks, Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, Armenians, Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is not a General Council appeareth, in that there is no ſuch thing in <hi>Natural or Moral Exiſtence.</hi> Not in <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exiſtence;</hi> For where is it? when called? how long have they ſate? But this none will affirm.</p>
                     <p>Not in <hi>Moral exiſtence;</hi> For there is no ſuch thing pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor poſſible. I confeſs the Common wealth is not diſſolved at the death of the Prince; becauſe a Succeſſor being determined of by Law (as in hereditary Government,) there is one hath preſently right to the place, though he want ſolemn admittance; or if elective, yet <hi>Rex non moritur,</hi> both becauſe the ſucceſſor hath an Intentional <hi>Moral being</hi> in the Fundamental Law, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55445:231"/>
the Intention of the Electors conjunctly, and they preſently make an actual choice, or elſe the power ſo far as is neceſſary for execution, falls in the mean time into the hands of ſome Truſtees of the Republick, while they are electing, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign is <hi>in fieri:</hi> Or if it be in ſome diſſolvable body, whoſe actual Seſſion is intermitted, yet they are ſtill in Moral being, and ready to aſſemble, and the Soveraignty for ſo much as is of ordinary exerciſe, even over the Univerſal body, is in the mean time in the hands of ſome other Aſſembly, who therefore may be ſaid to partake of the Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>But none of this is ſo in the preſent caſe. Here is no Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council <hi>ordinarily</hi> in natural being; and therefore in the vacancy not in Moral being: There is none that pretendeth to be in Moral being: For the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was the laſt pretended General Council, is diſſolved; and the Pope would not take it well if any ſhall call another without him: and no time is appointed for it: The Decennial Council determined of at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> is an empty name: and that Decree did but ſerve to prove, that really General Councils are not the Supream Governors of the Church: For no one obeyeth them in that. And whether ever the Pope, or any one elſe will call a General Council again, we cannot tell. So that now there is none; nor we know not whether there ever will be. But further.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 2. <hi>That which is the Head, or form of the Catholick Church (or any way Neceſſary to its Being or Unity) hath ever been found in it, or at leaſt within this thouſand years, or at leaſt in the primitive purer ages, or ſometime at leaſt: But a true General Council is not always in being, nor ever was within this thouſand years, no nor in the purer ages, nor ever at all: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no Head of the Church, nor neceſſary to its unity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major will not be denyed. The proof of any branch of the Minor may ſerve turn: much more of all. 1. That a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council hath not been this forty years in being, all men will confeſs. If the Church have been Headleſs forty years, or wanted any thing Neceſſary to its Being or Unity, then was it ſo long no Church, or many Catholick Churches, which are known untruths.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Church have had any General Council within this thouſand years, it was either that of <hi>Trent,</hi> that of <hi>Canſtance,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55445:231"/>
Baſil, Florence,</hi> the <hi>Laterane,</hi> &amp;c. But none of theſe were ſuch. For 1. there were no Biſhops from the moſt of the Chriſtian world. I have told you before how few at <hi>Trent</hi> did the moſt egregious parts of their work (few more then forty:) The Churches of <hi>Syria, Armenia, Ethiopia,</hi> and the moſt of the Chriſtian world, were never ſo much as fairly invited to be there. If at <hi>Florence</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and two or three <hi>Greeks</hi> more were preſent, what's that to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Greek</hi> Profeſſion through the world? beſides all others. The ancient Councils called General, contained All the Biſhops that could and would come. For all were to be there, and not one Biſhop choſen by two hundred, or by a Prince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of two hundred. But at theſe later Councils were neither all, nor ſo much as any Delegates (though but choſen by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to repreſent them) from moſt of the Churches of the world. Beſides the packing and fore-reſolutions of the Popes, that ruled all, and many other Arguments that nullifie theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended General Councils. I ſay not that all of them were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but none of them were any more like to Oecumenical or Univerſal, then <hi>Italy</hi> and its few ſervants are like to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world.</p>
                     <p>And that the Ancient Councils were not General, I mean, the four firſt, or any like them, I eaſily prove. 1. From the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of them, and the Mandates, and the Preſidents, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and Executions. It was the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors that called them, and that ſent their Mandates to the Lieutenants and other ſecular Officers to ſee to the execution, and to the Biſhops to be there: It was the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors that by themſelves or their Lieutenants, were preſent to Rule them all according to the proportion of ſecular intereſt. It was the ſame Powers that Ratified them, and what they ratified went for currant, and their Ratification was ſought by the Biſhops to that end. It was the ſame Power that baniſhed them that obeyed not, and compelled men to ſubmit to them. Now let any man of Reaſon tell me, what Power <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Martian,</hi> or any <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor had to ſummon the Biſhops that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Dominions of all other Princes through the world? What Authority had they out of their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="408" facs="tcp:55445:232"/>
2. Yea <hi>de facto,</hi> the caſe is known, 1. That they did not ſummon the Biſhops of other Princes Dominions. 2. That thoſe Biſhops (at leaſt no conſiderable number were there.) What Mandates or Invitations were ſent to all the Churches of <hi>India, Ethiopia, Perſia,</hi> or the parts of <hi>Parthia, Armenia, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. that were out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoſe one or two were that <hi>Euſebius</hi> calls Biſhops of <hi>Perſis, Parthia, Armenia,</hi> it's a plain caſe, that there were no due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of all or any of theſe Churches there, that were without the verge of the Empire. No <hi>Brittiſh, Iriſh,</hi> (that is, then <hi>Scottiſh)</hi> Biſhops were there, nor any from abundance other Churches. And the other Councils after that at <hi>Nice,</hi> make leſs pretenſe to ſuch a thing. So that it is moſt evident that General Councils then were but of the Biſhops of the Empire, or the <hi>Roman</hi> world, unleſs a Biſhop or two ſometime might drop in that lived next them. And was the Church no wider then the Empire? Let <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf be judge, that tells you of the Churches planted by the primitive Preachers, in <hi>India, Perſia,</hi> and many other parts of the world. Let <hi>Godignus</hi> be judge, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had the Goſpel ſince the Apoſtles days (and I pray in what age were they Papiſts?) Let <hi>Raynerius</hi> be judge, that ſaith the Churches of <hi>Armenia</hi> and others planted by the Apoſtles were not ſubject to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Let the Antiquities of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be evidence. But the caſe is undenyable. All this noyſe then of General Councils comes but from a ſuppoſition that the <hi>Roman</hi> world was the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world. A ſmall miſtake! We home-bred Ruſticks may ſhortly be as well able to prove that a <hi>London</hi> Convocation was a General Council! <hi>Pighius</hi> pleading for the Pope, ſaith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that General Councils were the deviſe of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And the Popes themſelves do fetch the moſt ſpecious Evidences for their primacy from the Decrees or Edicts of Emperors, <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian, Gratian</hi> and others. And what power had thoſe Emperors at the other ſide of the world?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And then before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, what General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were there ſince the Apoſtle days? None doubtleſs that the world now knows of. It's ſenſeleſs enough to think that 350 <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops at the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or the 150 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the third Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or the 165 Biſhops
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:55445:232"/>
at the ſecond Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or the 150 Biſhops at the firſt there, were the Univerſal Church of Chriſt? But it will be more ridiculous to ſay, that the new-found <hi>Concilium Sinueſſanum,</hi> imagined without proof to meet in a certain Cave, for the depoſition of an Idolatrous Pope, were a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council. Where then was the Head, the unity, the form of the Church for 300 years? Was it governed all that time, think you, by a General Council? yea or ever one day ſince the Apoſtles?</p>
                     <p>Well, but was there ever ſuch a thing at all? Indeed men have a fairer pretence when the Church was contained in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or a City, or a narrow ſpace, to call the meetings of the Apoſtles or other Chriſtians then, by the name of a General Council, but they are hard put to it, if this be all. The great Inſtance inſiſted on is the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. But were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of all the Churches there? or ſummoned to appear? <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. they had ordained them Elders in every Church; but few of them were there, <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> abundance were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It's plain, that it was to the Apoſtles and Church at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> as the Fountain, and beſt informers that they ſent. Not becauſe theſe were the Univerſal Church, but becauſe they were of greateſt knowledge and authority. If it could be proved that all the Apoſtles were there, it would no more prove them a General Council, then that the Deacons of one Church were ordained by a General Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. And <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> and <hi>Juſtus</hi> put to the Lot by a General Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. and that Chriſt appeared to a General Council after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and gave the Sacrament of his Supper to a General Council before his death. So that it is moſt evident from the event, that Chriſt never made a General Council the Head or Governor of his Church; and that there never was ſuch a thing the world, much leſs continually.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 3. <hi>The form or unity (no nor the well-being) of the Catholick Church, dependeth not on that which is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, unjuſt, or naturally or morally impoſſible: But a true General Council is none ſuch: It cannot be: or if it were it would be unneceſſary and unjuſt. Therefore it is not the Head or Soveraign Governor of the Church, on which its being, unity, (or well being) doth depend.</hi>

I have nothing here to prove but the Minor. And 1. I ſhall prove the Impoſſibility. 2. The non-neceſſity. 3. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of a General Council: and ſo that no ſuch thing is to be expected.</p>
                     <p>A true General Council conſiſteth of all the Paſtors or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the whole world; or ſo many as Morally may be called All. A General Council of Delegates from all the Churches, muſt conſiſt of ſo many proportionably choſen, as may ſignifie the ſenſe and conſent of all, or elſe it is a meer name and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Both theſe are Morally, if not Naturally Impoſſible: as I prove.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the diſtance of their habitations, ſome dwell in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> ſome in <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſome in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſome in <hi>Mexico,</hi> the <hi>Philippines,</hi> or other parts of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> ſome at St. <hi>Thome's,</hi> ſome diſperſed through moſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions. Now how long muſt it be, before all theſe have tidings of a Council, and ſummons to appear, or ſend their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates? Who will be at the coſt of ſending meſſengers to all theſe? Will the Pope? Not if he be no richer then <hi>Peter</hi> was. How many hundred thouſand pound will it coſt before that all can have a lawful ſummons? And when that is done, it will be long before they can all in their ſeveral Nations meet, and agree upon their Delegates, and their inſtructions. And when that is done, who ſhall bear their charges in the journey? Alas, the beſt of the Churches Paſtors have had ſo little gold and ſilver, that they are unable themſelves to defray it. A few Biſhops out of each of theſe diſtant Countries, will conſume in their journey a great deal of money and proviſion. To provide them ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by Sea, and Horſes, and all other neceſſaries by land, for ſo many thouſand miles, will require no ſmall allowance.</p>
                     <p>And then conſider, that it muſt be voluntary contribution that muſt maintain them. And moſt love their money ſo well, and know ſo little of the need of ſuch journeys and Councils, that doubtleſs they will not be very forward to ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution.</p>
                     <p>And it is not to be expected that Infidel Princes will give way to the tranſporting of ſo much money from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries on the Churches occaſions, which they hate.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſe them furniſhed with all neceſſaries, and ſetting
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:55445:233"/>
forward; How long will they be in their journey? Shipping cannot always be had: Many of them muſt go by land: It cannot be expected that ſome of them ſhould come in leſs than three, or four, if not ſeven years time to the Council. And will ever a General Council be held upon theſe terms?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Moreover the perſons for the moſt part are not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch journeys. Biſhops are Elders: Moſt of them are aged perſons. The wiſeſt are they that are fit to be truſted in ſo great a buſineſs by all the reſt: And few attain that maturity but the aged: Eſpecially in the moſt of the Eaſtern &amp; Southern Churches that want the helps of Learning which we have. And will the Churches be ſo barbarous as to turn out their aged faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors upon the jaws of death? Some of them are not like to live out ſo long time as the journey, if they were at home. They muſt paſs through raging and tempeſtuous Seas, through De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts and enemies, and many thouſand miles where they muſt daily conflict with diſtreſs. It were a fond conceit, to think that (without unuſual providences) ten Biſhops of a thouſand <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ould come alive to the Council, through all theſe labors and difficulties.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, it's known how few bodies will bear the Seas, and ſo great change of air: How many of our Souldiers in the <hi>Indies</hi> are dead, for one that doth ſurvive? And can ancient Biſhops, ſpent with ſtudies and labors, endure all this? Moſt ſtudious painful Preachers here with us are very ſickly, and ſcarſe able to endure the ſmall incommodities of their habitations: And could they endure this?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover abundance of the Paſtors of the Churches live under Mahometans and other Infidels, that will not give them leave to travail ſo far into the Countries of Chriſtian Princes on ſuch occaſions. They hate us and our Religion. They are oft at war with us, and then would hang thoſe Biſhops as Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that ſhould offer to come among us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And they muſt many of them paſs through the Countries of other Princes, that are Infidels, and oft in war with the parts which they come from or go to. And it cannot be expected that in ſuch caſes they ſhould allow them paſſage through their Countries. If one do, all will not: When poor <hi>Lithgow</hi> had travailed nineteen years, he was tortured, ſtrappado'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:55445:234"/>
and made a cripple at <hi>Malaga</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thanked God and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſador that he ſped ſo well.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Even at home in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Princes are ſo commonly in Wars (as are <hi>France, Spain, Venice, Sweden, Denmark, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Brandenburgh, Holland, Portugal, England, Tranſylvania,</hi> &amp;c. at this very day) that there is not the leaſt probability that they ſhould all or half conſent to have ſo many of their ſubjects paſs into their enemies Countries to reſide ſo long. Jealouſies raiſed by particular Intereſts would make it Treaſon.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Moreover many Princes underſtand that the Pope hath no power to call ſuch Councils, nor any man elſe: and they know the deſign of the Pope to ſubject the world to himſelf. And therefore they will abhor that their ſubjects ſhould travail ſo far at his call, that hath ſuch deſigns, (or at another mans that hath no authority to call them.) This hath made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Habaſſia</hi> ſo reſolutely reſiſt the Popes pretenſions (as <hi>Godignus, Maffaeus,</hi> and others do declare) Few Princes will endure to have their ſubjects brought under a forreign Power.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And if you ſuppoſe all the Biſhops come to the Council, the very number out of all the Chriſtian world, (to make any thing like a General Council) would be ſo great, as would be unfit for one, or two, or ten, or twenty Council houſes or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And they would be uncapable of conferring, through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of languages. Few of the <hi>Abaſſines, Egyptians, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Armenians,</hi> or of moſt of the world, underſtand and ſpeak any language that would commonly be underſtood and uſed in a Council. Nor is it poſſible to do it by Interpreters. For ſo many Interpreters cannot be uſed to tell all that underſtand not, what every man ſaith, and to expound their minds to others. This would waſte an age in a Council; ſo that ſuch a Council would be a very <hi>Babel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. And Councils uſe to be ſo long, that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that after ſo many years journey, old men ſhould live to ſee the iſſue, or do any great matters there. Eighteen years at <hi>Trent</hi> would conſume a great many of the Biſhops: How
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:55445:234"/>
many even of the Popes own Legates dyed before that Council could be finiſhed?</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And if they ſhould live to ſee the end, can you dream that they ſhould live to perform the like tedious dangerous journeys and voyages to bring back the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill to their Churches? Judge now whether ſuch Councils are not Naturally Impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>I will add but this. No men can be compelled. And to make all the world at once agree to ſo difficult a task, and agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the time and place, muſt be a Miracle. One will be for it, and another againſt it. One for one time and place, and another for another, through moſt of the world. We ſee how hardly any two Princes can agree upon times, places, and all circumſtances in their Treaties.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Let us next enquire, of what Neceſſity ſuch a Council is. If it be Neceſſary for Church government, it is either to make Laws, or to execute them. But for neither of theſe: therefore they are not Neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſt hath made us Laws already ſufficient for ſalvation. And I hope he hath not conſtituted ſo looſe a Society, and left his Body to ſuch mutations, as that they muſt ſo frequently have new Laws. And if it muſt, ſure it muſt be from their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who hath reſerved the Legiſlative Power to himſelf as his Prerogative. Legiſlation is the higheſt act of Supremacy, and chief flower in the Crown of Soveraignty. The Church is Chriſts ſubjects, and ſhall ſubjects make their own Laws? Scripture is ſufficient. If this be all that we need General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils for, to make Univerſal Laws to the Church, we can ſpare them as well as Traytors in a Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>And for Execution of Laws, it is either Magiſterial, by force of the Sword; and this they have nothing to do with, it being the Princes right. Or it is for the Excommunicating Church offenders: And to caſt them out of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is the work of the Paſtors of thoſe Churches. Others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the perſons, and hear the cauſe. If all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſes ſhould come to a General Council, Millions of men muſt be attending them at once.</p>
                     <p>And if it be to judge who ſhall be caſt out of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Churches, and what Churches themſelves are to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:55445:235"/>
be excommunicated, the Synods of neighbour Paſtors are to do as much of that as is to be done. Where then is the Neceſſity of ſuch Councils at ſuch rates? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his time was grown ſo ſtrong, that there muſt be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to ſuppreſs it. Could they do ſuch feats as to cure Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Whoredom, Covetouſneſs, Pride, I would be for them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If a General Council were called, it muſt be a moſt <hi>unjuſt</hi> Aſſembly. For, 1. It would be guilty of cruelty and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of Chriſt, by killing ſo many of the Paſtors as aforeſaid.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It would be guilty of cruelty and Church deſtoying by the ſtarving and deſertion of the flocks at home. What will become of the poor peoples ſouls, when they are left to the Wolves, to Hereticks, and Deceivers, and to the temptations of their own fleſh, and the world, being for ten or twenty years, or for ever deprived of their Paſtors under pretenſe of a General Council? <hi>Baſil</hi> in his ſeventieth Epiſtle tells the Weſtern Biſhops, that they of the Eaſt could not come to ſolicite their own cauſe with them. For, ſaith he, If any one of us <hi>(N. B.)</hi> do for the leaſt moment leave his Church, he preſently leaveth his people to deceivers. And on this ground he ſhews that they could not ſo much as ſpare Biſhops to be meer Meſſengers to them. Much leſs could they have ſpared a ſufficient number to ſtay ſeven or ten years together. If any think that ſuch Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities are unuſuall, he knows not the world. And Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are moſt uſefull if ever, when neceſſities are greateſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In Councils things are carried by Votes: and ſo <hi>Abaſſia, Armenia, Mexico,</hi> and places ſo remote that they can ſend but one or two, would be out-voted by that corner of the world where the Council is called, that can ſend in proportionably an hundred for one; and ſo under the name of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, a faction might promote any hereſie or carnal intereſt, and no Churches would be ſo enſlaved as thoſe that ſend at the deareſt rates. <hi>Italy</hi> and a few more parts, at <hi>Trent,</hi> would over-vote all the Churches of Eaſt and South, and ſet up what intereſt or opinion they pleaſe: And ſo if one corner of the Church can err, all may err, for all the Council: Where there is an equal intereſt, there ſhould be an equal power in Councils: which will certainly be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="415" facs="tcp:55445:235"/>
4. If the Pope be he that muſt call General Councils, we ſhall have none, till it will ſtand with his intereſt. And if he have not the power of calling them, no one elſe hath, for none pretendeth to it. And if they muſt be called by univerſal conſent, three hundred years is little enough for all the world to treat of the time, place, and other circumſtances, and conſent.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And if the Pope muſt call them, he will eaſily by the very choice of the place, procure the accompliſhment of his own deſigns.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe that think it the Popes prerogative to call a Council, do alſo affirm (as I before ſhewed in the expreſs words of <hi>Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and others) that a Council hath no more power then the Pope will give them, and that when they are convened by him, and have done their work, it is all of no Validity, if he allow it not: If he approve one half, that half is valid, and his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation will make their Decrees the Articles of our faith; when as the other half which he diſapproveth ſhall not be worth a ſtraw. And is it not a moſt fooliſh thing for all the world to put themſelves to ſo much charge to defray the expenſes of their Biſhops, and hazzard their lives, and loſe their labours at home for ſo many years, and hazzard the Churches by their abſence, when for ought they know the Biſhops of the whole Chriſtian world do but loſe all their labour, and nothing ſhall be valid if they pleaſe not the Pope of <hi>Rome?</hi> And is it not moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable juſtice in him thus to put all the world to trouble, and coſt, and hazzard the Churches and the Paſtors lives, for nothing, when if the infallible ſpirit be only in himſelf, he might have done the work himſelf, and ſaved all this coſt and labour.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. By what Juſtice ſhall all the Catholick Church be obliged by the Decrees of ſuch a General Council? Is it by Law, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract? If by Law, it is by Divine Law, or by Humane. If by Divine, let it be ſhewed that ever God made ſuch a Government for the Catholick Church, and then take all. If by Humane Laws, it is impoſſible, and therefore not to be affirmed. For no Humane Soveraign hath power to make Laws for all the world. If you ſay is it by contract, then 1. All thoſe Nations that thought not meet to ſend any Biſhops to the Council, will be free. 2. And ſo will all thoſe be that ſent Biſhops who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the reſt. For contract or Conſent bindeth none
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:55445:236"/>
but Contracters or Conſenters. And ſo <hi>England</hi> is not bound by the Council of <hi>Nice, Epheſus, Calcedon, Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. By what Juſtice ſhall any people be required to ſend Dele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gates, on ſuch terms as theſe to Councils, or to ſtand to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions when they have done? When our faith and ſouls are preciouſer things then ſo boldly to caſt upon the truſt of a few Delegates ſo to be choſen and employed? What Biſhops other Countries will chooſe, we know not. And for our own, 1. In almoſt all Countries it is the Princes that chooſe, or none muſt be choſen but who they will, which is all one. 2. If the Biſhops chooſe, its thoſe that are higheſt with the ſecular power that will have the choice, who perhaps may chooſe ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgement of moſt of that Church that is thought to chooſe them. Moſt Nations have a Clergy much at difference. The Remonſtrants and Contramonſtrants in <hi>Holland</hi> would not have choſen like members for the Synod. In the Biſhops days men of one mind were choſen here in <hi>England</hi> to Convocations: The next year we had a Learned Aſſembly that put down the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, for which a Convocation had formed an Oath to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all Miniſters but a little before. And why ſhould the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prelates be taken for the judgement of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> any more then the other, when for number, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piety (to ſay the leaſt) they had no advantage (laying aſide ignorant, ungodly men, in point of number.) Till the Spaniſh match began to be treated on, the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> were ten, if not twenty to one Auguſtinians, Calviniſts, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarminians: Now the Arminians would be thought the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and their doctrine, agreeable to the doctrine of that Church. Would they not accordingly have differed, if they had been ſent to a General Council? How bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly are the Articles of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> decryed by the Arminian Biſhops ſince ſprung up both in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England?</hi> ſo that if Delegates be ſent to any Council, they may ſpeak the minds of thoſe that ſent them, (which perhaps is the King, or a ſmall prevailing party,) but not of the reſt: (which perhaps may the beſt and moſt.) If <hi>Jeremiah</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> be of a Council, he will go one way. If <hi>Cyril</hi> be of a Council, he will go another way: And his counterfeit Succeſſor undo what he did.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="417" facs="tcp:55445:236"/>
9. No Church that ſendeth three or four Biſhops to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a thouſand or two thouſand Paſtors, can be ſure how thoſe Biſhops will carry it when they come thither. For ought we know they may betray our cauſe, and croſs their inſtructions: They may be perverted by the reaſonings of erroneous men, or bribed by the powerfull: And to caſt our faith on ſo ſlender an aſſurance, is little wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If conſent only bind us to the Decrees of Councils (to ſubmit to them as our Rule,) then is Poſterity bound that did not conſent as their Fathers did, or are they not? If not, we are free? If yea, by what bond? And then why do not the <hi>Grotians</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> obey the Antiarminian Decrees of the Churches in both? Did not the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſend Biſhop <hi>Carlton,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> (afterward a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) Dr. <hi>Ward.</hi> Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> and <hi>Balcanquall</hi> Epiſcopal Divines to the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and ſo <hi>England</hi> was a part of that Synod? And yet the <hi>Grotians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> think not themſelves bound to receive the Doctrine of that Synod, nor to forbear reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. It is unjuſt that any (eſpecially moſt) of the Churches ſhould be obliged by the votes of others, and oppreſſed by Majority, meerly becauſe their diſtance, or poverty, or the age, or weakneſs of their Paſtors diſableth them to ſend any, or an equal number, or to defray the charge of their abode, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ah if good Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> or Archbiſhop <hi>Boniface</hi> had conſidered that the eſſence or unity of the Church did conſiſt in a General Council, that muſt be fetched partly from the Antipodes, they would have thought better on it before they had excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>Virgilius,</hi> for ſaying that there were Antipodes, or <hi>quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us mundus, &amp; alii homines ſunt ſub terras.</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> tels us in his <hi>Geography, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 25. that <hi>Bede (de ratione temporum, cap.</hi> 32.) calleth it a fable that there are Antipodes, and not to be believed: and adds that <hi>Auguſtine, Lactantius,</hi> and ſome other of the Learned of thoſe better times condemned it as a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous incredible fable, whoſe words (ſaith he) I could put down at large, did I think it neceſſary.] And did that age dream that the Being or Unity of the Church, or the ſalvation of the Believers ſoul depended on this Article, that a General Council, partly called from the Antipodes muſt be the Churches
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:55445:237"/>
Head or Governours? or that the Pope at leaſt muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and obeyed by every Chriſtian ſoul that will be ſaved at the Antipodes? And Sir <hi>Fradcis Drake</hi> and <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> would not have been ſo famous for compaſſing the world, if men had underſtood, that when the Goſpel is ſpread through the earth, ſo many poor old Biſhops muſt ordinarily take half ſuch Journies or voyages to do their buſineſs. If the Decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had been executed, to have had a General Council evry ten years, many would ſcarce have had time to go and come. But the charitable Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath found out a Remedy, not only by the rarity of their Councils (let them decree what they will to the contrary) but alſo by condemning the moſt of the Churches, and the remoteſt, as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and ſending them to Hell, to ſave them a journey to the General Council.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Moreover ſuch Councils are unjuſt, becauſe of the multi tude of Biſhops that muſt there meet and cannot be heard ſpeak. As the caſe ſtandeth already, there are many more Biſhops in the world then can meet, and ſpeak, and hear in one, or two, or three Aſſemblies: And many thouſand more may be made. If I ſhould ſay that all the Rectors of particular Churches, whom they call Pariſh Presbyters, are Biſhops, and have votes in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, they would eaſilyer deny it then diſprove it, or invalidate the proofs already brought: But (to proceed on their own grounds) me thinks they that make him a Biſhop who hath Presbyters and Deacons under him, ſhould admit all thoſe Paſtors of particular Churches that have Presbyters under them, as their Curates, which are many. Or if they ſay that only Cities muſt have Biſhops, yet muſt they on their own grounds admit a Biſhop for each City: And if every City in a few Kingdoms in <hi>Europe</hi> had a Biſhop in the Council, there would be no room for all the reſt of the world. But how prove they that Countrey Pariſhes may not have Biſhops? Why may not (on their own grounds) every four or ſix pariſhes have one? Hath God forbid it? where? and when? ſure they will not ſay it is of Divine inſtitution that a Biſhop have juſt ſo many Pariſhes and Presbyters under him, and neither more nor leſs. The number is confeſt to be left undetermined. And what if Chriſtian Princes, Biſhops and people agree to ſettle Biſhops in
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:55445:237"/>
every ſuch ſmall number of Pariſhes, by what Law can they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from a General Council? If they ſay, by the Canons of former Councils; I anſwer 1. Thoſe Canons are contrary to Scripture. 2. They contradict one another. 3. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not obey the Canons of many ſuch Councils. 4. Thoſe Councils have no power to make Laws; much leſs Laws that ſhall reach to this time and place. But they will ſay <hi>Pauls</hi> command to <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 3, 5. and the example <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. is only of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elders or Biſhops in every City: therefore they may not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them any where but in Cities. But I deny the conſequence. Moſt ancient interpreters by Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. Underſtand meer Presbyters: And then it would as much follow that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters muſt be ordained no where but in Cities: What if I can prove that the Apoſtles never gathered a ſolemn Aſſembly of Chriſtians for Divine Worſhip any where but in Cities; or that they never adminiſtred the Lords Supper any where but in Cities? will it follow that therefore we ought not to Aſſemble or adminiſter the Sacrament any where but in Cities? But what if this were granted? they cannot deny but every corporation, ſuch as moſt of our Burroughs and Market Towns in <hi>England</hi> are, may truly be called Cities in that Scripture ſence. And if every ſuch City had a Biſhop, Even <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> a little ſpot of the world, would make Biſhops enough for two or three Councils; and more then could Aſſemble and do the work.</p>
                     <p>Two ſhifts they have againſt the over-greatneſs of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. One is the courſe now taken: to have but one Biſhop over many Cities, and a very large Circuit of the Countrey.</p>
                     <p>The other is, to depute one out of many from every Countrey to repreſent the reſt; and ſo it ſhall be a Repreſentative General Council, though not a Real. But for the firſt, 1. Who hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make ſuch diminutions? 2. What if thoſe that are ſuppoſed to have that authority, ſhall be otherwiſe minded? 3. Its apparently againſt the word of God, and tendeth to the fruſtrating of the Office that true Biſhops ſhould be ſo rare. By their own Rule, each City ſhould have one. And let <hi>Brerewoods</hi> Enquiries, or any ſuch writers help you to conjecture how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that would be.</p>
                     <p>And for the other way, 1. A Repreſentative General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is another thing, quite different from a Real. 2. What word
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:55445:238"/>
of God have they to prove ſuch a Repreſentative Council? Doubtleſs none: And will they give us a Church form, and center of Unity, meerly of their own brains, upon ſuppoſition that it is prudential? 3. Men are of exceeding different degrees of underſtanding, and of different judgements actually: ſo that if <hi>e. g. England</hi> ſhould ſend one, or two, or ten men to repreſent the reſt to a General Council, its more then poſſible that they may give their judgements in many points ſo far contrary to the minds of thoſe that ſent them, that twenty or an hundred to one at home may be againſt them. For we cannot ſend our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and all our reaſons with them to the Council when we ſend them. And ſo no man can ſay that any ſuch Council doth expreſs the mind of the greater part of the Church. 4. By this rule you may reduce a General Council to a dozen men, or to the four or five Patriarks: For all the reſt may chooſe them as their repreſentatives. 5. But its not to be expected that all the Churches ſhould be ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs or fitneſs of ſuch ſubſtitutions and repreſentations: And therefore they will not conſent or elect men for ſuch a power and work: And who may juſtly force them?</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Moreover ſuch Councils are unjuſt, becauſe there can be no juſt ſatisfaction given by men that live at ſo vaſt a diſtance, that this great number that come thither are truly Biſhops: yea or Presbyters either. Its not poſſible under many years time, ſo much as to take any ſatisfactory account of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and abiding in that office, and the truth of their depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or elections. And when (in their elected Repreſentative Councils) there will be perpetual controverſies between ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parties (as there is in Parliaments) whether it be this man or that which is truly elected, in how many years will all theſe be decided, before they begin their work? So that I may well conclude, laying all theſe ſeven conſiderations together, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of places, the age and ſtate of the Biſhops, the ſtate of the Civil Governments which they live under, their neceſſary labours at home, and the ruine that will befall their Churches by ſo much abſence, the diverſity of their languages, the multitude of the Biſhops, and the difficulty of knowing the Ordination and Qualifications of perſons ſo remote to prove their capacity, I ſay all theſe together do plainly ſhew that ſuch
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:55445:238"/>
General Councils are impoſſible and unjuſt: and therefore not the ſtanding Government or form of the Church, or the center of its Unity.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 4. <hi>As the Synod it ſelf is impoſſible, needleſs, and unjuſt; ſo it is Impoſſible that they ſhould do the work of a Head or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, if they could Aſſemble: therefore they are not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Antecedent is partly manifeſt by what is ſaid from their different languages and other conſiderations. Moreover 1. The perſons that will have appeals to them, and cauſes to be judged (if really they will do the work of a Soveraign Power and Judge) will be ſo many millions, that there will be no room for them about their doors, nor any leiſure in many years to hear their <note place="margin">It was one of the Reaſons of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>P. Celeſtine</hi> to prove the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Papal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments up on appeals from other Countries, becauſe the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to a juſt deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not go far.</note> cauſes. If you ſay, It was not ſo in former Councils, I anſwer, that is becauſe they were not truly General, or were called in ſuch times when the Church did lie in a narrow compaſs, and not in ſuch remote parts of the world; and becauſe they were aſſembled indeed but occaſionally, to adviſe upon and determine ſome one particular mans caſe, or few, and never took upon them to be the Soveraign power or head of the Church, or its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential form or Center of Unity. 2. Theſe millions of perſons that have ſo many cauſes, will have ſo far to travail, that it will put them to great coſt and labour to come and attend and bring all their witneſſes. And if they be not ſounder bodyed then our Engliſh Souldiers, the poor people of <hi>Mexico</hi> and other parts of thoſe Indies (to look no further) will be a great part of them dead by the way before they can reach the General Council. <hi>e. g.</hi> if it ſhould be in the midſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> 3. And the Council will not be competent Judges of ſo many cauſes which by diſtance muſt needs be much unknown in many weighty Circumſtances, whoſe cogniſance is neceſſary. 4. And laſtly, ſuch Councils will ſit ſo ſeldom, that the work will be undone.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 5. <hi>If God had intended that ſuch a Council ſhould have been the form of his Church, or the neceſſary Governour of it, he would have acquainted us with his will concerning ſome certain Power to ſummon them, (or would have authorized ſome or other to call ſuch a Council) But he hath not acquainted us with his will herein, nor authorized any to call ſuch a Council: therefore it
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:55445:239"/>
was not his intent that it ſhould be the form or neceſſary Governour of his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Either this Council muſt meet by an <hi>Authoritative call,</hi> or by <hi>conſent.</hi> If by <hi>ſuch a call, who</hi> muſt call them? The <hi>Popes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe to this Authority is voluminouſly and unanſweràbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed long ago; and its well known, what ever <hi>Baronius</hi> ſay, that the ancient Councils were called by the Emperors; and many ſince have been called by Emperours and Cardinals. And if you ſay that it belongs to the Emperour, I anſwer, what hath he to do to ſummon the ſubjects of the <hi>French, Spaniards, Turks, Aethiopian, &amp;c?</hi> And by this it appears that we never had true Univerſal Councils: They were but General as to the Roman world, or Empire. For (who ever precided) it is certain that the Emperours called them. And what had <hi>Conſtantine, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Theodoſius,</hi> or any Roman Emperour to do, to call the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in <hi>India, Aethiopia, Perſia, &amp;c.</hi> to a Council? Nor <hi>de facto,</hi> was there any ſuch thing done. Is it not a wonderfull thing that the Pope and all his followers ſhould be, or ſeem ſo blinded to this day, as to take the Empire for the whole earth, or the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man world for all the Chriſtian world! yet this is their all. If you ſay that it muſt be done by the <hi>conſent</hi> of Princes, then either of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes or of <hi>all.</hi> If of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> only, you muſt exclude the Biſhops that are under <hi>Mahometan and Heathen Princes,</hi> and then it will be no <hi>General Council;</hi> eſpecially if it be now as it was in the time of <hi>Jacob à Vitriaco</hi> the Popes Legate in the Eaſt, who ſaith that the Chriſtians of the Eaſterly parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> alone, exceeded in number the Chriſtians both of the Greek and Latine Churches. And whether it be all Princes, or only Chriſtian Princes that ſhould conſent, who can tell whether ever it will be? God hath not promiſed to lead them to ſuch a conſent: And they are unlikely of themſelves, as being many and diſtant, and of different intereſts and apprehenſions, and uſually in wars with one another, ſo that if an age ſhould be ſpent in treating of a General Council among them, its ten to one that the treaty will be in vain, and its next to an impoſſibility that all ſhould conſent. Beſides; no man can ſhew a Commiſſion from God to enable them, and only them to ſuch a work.</p>
                     <p>But if you ſay that it muſt be done by the <hi>conſent of the Biſhops</hi> themſelves, the Impoſſibility (moral) is apparent, who will
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:55445:239"/>
be found that will be at the coſt and pains to agitate the buſineſs among them? No one can appoint the time and place but by conſent of the reſt. Who doth it belong to, to travail to the <hi>Indies, Aethiopia, Aegypt, Paleſtine,</hi> and all the reſt of the world, to treate with the Biſhops about the time and place of a Council? And how many lives muſt he have that ſhall do it? And when he findeth them of a hundred minds, what courſe ſhall he take, and how many more journies about the world muſt he make, to bring them to an agreement? But I am aſhamed to beſtow more words on ſo evident a caſe.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 6. <hi>The Head or Soveraign of the Church (as of every body Politick) hath the Legiſlative Power over the whole. The Pope or a General Council have not the Legiſlative Power over the whole. Therefore the Pope or General Council are not the head or Soveraigns of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is of unqueſtionable verity in Politicks. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation is the firſt and chief work of Soveraignty.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is proved, 1. <hi>Ad hominem</hi> by the confeſſion of the <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that Pope and Council cannot make new Articles of faith, <hi>in ſe,</hi> but <hi>quoad nos</hi> only. And they ſay they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which they teach,</note> chief Opponents, <hi>Grotius de Imperio ſummar. poteſt.</hi> doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely maintain it: and ſo do others: (See of this <hi>Lud. Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> new Book ſuppoſed againſt the Presbyterians: his <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.)</hi> 2. It is the high Prerogative of Chriſt the true King and Soveraign of the Church, which none muſt arrogate. He was faithfull in all his houſe as was <hi>Moſes.</hi> His Law is perfect: It is ſufficient to make the man of God perfect: even a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule of faith and life: No man muſt <hi>add thereto, nor take ought therefrom, but do whatſoever he hath commanded,</hi> Deut. 12. 32. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeak not according to theſe, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But men may make By-laws under Chriſt and his Laws. Anſw.</hi> True: but as thoſe are in this caſe no proper Laws, ſo no man or men may make them for the Unverſal Church. For the buſineſs of thoſe Laws is only to determine of circumſtances which God hath made neceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and left to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of men <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> And we may well know that there was ſome ſpecial reaſon why Chriſt did not determine of theſe himſelf. And the reaſon is plain; even becauſe that they depend ſo much on the ſeveral ſtates, capacities, cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of men,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:55445:240"/>
that they are to be varied accordingly in ſeveral times and places. If one ſtanding Law would have fitted all the world, or all ages in theſe matters, Chriſt would have made it himſelf. For if you ſay he makes ſome Laws, and neglect others that are of the like kind, and might as well have been done by himſelf, you make him imperfect and inſufficient to his work. And if it be not fit that one Univerſal Law be made for the world, then a Council muſt not make it.</p>
                     <p>And as the ſufficiency of Chriſts law, ſo the nature of the things declare it, that theſe matters muſt not be determined of by an univerſal Law. Should there be an univerſal Law to determine what day of the week, or what hour of the day every Lecture or occaſional Sermon ſhall be on? Or what place every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhall meet in? Or where the Miniſter ſhall ſtand to preach? Or what Chapters he ſhould read each day? Or what Text he ſhould preach on? or how long? Whether by an hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs or without? in what habit of apparrel particularly (when many a poor man muſt wear ſuch as he can get) yea or what ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures or poſtures of body to uſe (when that geſture in one Countrey ſignifieth reverence, which in another rather ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth neglect) with abundance the like.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame is plain from the nature of the Paſtoral office. Every Biſhop or Paſtor is made by Chriſt the Ruler of the flock in ſuch caſes, and they are bound to obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And therefore a General Council muſt leave them their work to do which Chriſt hath put upon them, and not take it out of their hands: eſpecially when being in the place, and ſeeing the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of circumſtances, they are more competent judges then a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council at ſuch diſtance.</p>
                     <p>The plain truth is, Chriſt hath left them none of that work to do which belongeth to a Head or Soveraign, but they make work for themſelves, that there may ſeem to be a Neceſſity of a power to do it. The Church needeth none of their Laws. Let us have but the Holy Scriptures, and the Law of Nature, and the civil Laws of men, and the guidance of particular Paſtors <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and the fraternal Conſultations and Agreements of Councils, not to make any more work, but to do this foreſaid work unanimouſly, and the Church can bear no more; there is nothing left for Legiſlators Eccleſiaſtical to do. We can ſpare
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:55445:240"/>
their Laws, and therefore their power and work. Their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is but to make ſnares and burdens for us; and therefore we can live without them, and cannot believe that the felicity, or unity, or eſſence of the Church conſiſteth in them.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 7. <hi>All the inferior officers do derive their power from the ſupream. All the other officers of the Catholick Church do not derive their power from the Pope or a General Council: therefore a Pope or General Council are not the ſupream.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is an unqueſtioned Maxime in Politicks. Its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Sovereaign to be the fountain of power to all under him. Yea if it be but a deputed derived Soveraignty, <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> ſo called, as the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Mexico, Naples, &amp;c.</hi> yet ſo far he muſt be the fountain of all inferiour power.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is maintained by moſt Chriſtians in the world. Every Biſhop or Presbyter hath his power immediately from Jeſus Chriſt as the Efficient cauſe, though man muſt be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> or <hi>per accidens.</hi> The Italian Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could not carry it againſt the Spaniards, that the Pope only as Head was immediately <hi>jure divino,</hi> and the reſt but <hi>mediante Papa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover it is eaſie to prove out of Scripture that God never ſet up any Soveraign power in his Church (perſonal or colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive) to be the fountain of all other Church power, nor ſendeth us to have recourſe to any ſuch for it. Nor can they prove ſuch a power, on whom it is incumbent.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly its moſt eaſie to prove <hi>de facto,</hi> that the Biſhops or Presbyters now in the ſeveral Churches in the world, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and do not hold their power from any ſuch viſible Head, whether Pope or Council. Though the Popelings do, yet ſo do not all the reſt of the Chriſtian world. Who are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Miniſters or no Church of Chriſt, whatever theſe bare affirmers and pretenders may imagine: Nor are all the Miniſterial actions in the world null, which are not done by a power from him. And even the Papiſts themſelves will few of them pretend to receive their ſeveral powers of Prieſthood from a General Council. This therefore is not the Soveraign power, or head of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 8. <hi>The Head or Soveraign Power hath the finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Judgement, and in great cauſes all muſt, or may appeal to
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:55445:241"/>
them. A General Council hath not the finally deciſive judgement, nor may all men in great cauſes appeal to them. Therefore a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council is not the Head or Soveraign power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is undenyable. The Minor is proved, 1. In that it is not known, nor hath the world any rule or way to know in what caſes we muſt appeal to a General Council, and what not; and what is their proper work. 2. In that an appeal to them is an abſolute evaſion of the guilty, and in vain to the innocent, becauſe of the rarity of ſuch Councils, or rather the nullity. 3. Becauſe the proſecuting of ſuch an Appeal is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to moſt of the world (as is before ſhewed) and were it poſſible, it would be ſo tedious and laborious a courſe, that its ridiculous in moſt to mention ſuch Appeals.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 9. <hi>The Soveraign or Head of the Church (as of every Body Politick,) hath power to deprive and denude any other of their power. The Pope or General Council hath not power to do ſo: therefore they are not of the Head or Soveraigns of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is a known principle in polity: He that giveth power, can take it away: And it's confeſſed by the Opponents in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Minor I prove, 1. Becauſe elſe it would be in the power of the Pope or Council, whether Chriſt ſhall have any Miniſtry and Church or not. They may at leaſt make havock of it at pleaſure. But that's falſe. 2. As is before ſaid, we receive not our power from them: therefore they cannot take it from us. 3. The Holy Ghoſt doth make us Over-ſeers of the flock, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and lay a Neceſſity on us, and denounce a woe againſt us, if we preach not the Goſpel: and hath no where given us leave to give over his work, if the Pope or a Council ſhall forbid us. 4. And they can ſhew no Commiſſion from Chriſt that giveth them ſuch a power.</p>
                     <p>Arg. 10. <hi>If it were the form or Eſſence of the Church to have a humane viſible Head, then our Relation to ſuch a head would be eſſential to our Memberſhip or Chriſtianity. But the Conſequence is falſe: therefore ſo is the Antecedent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The falſeneſs of the conſequent is apparent, 1. In that it cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly and ungroundedly unchriſteneth all that do not believe in ſuch a viſible Head: That is, the greateſt part by far of the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:55445:241"/>
Chriſtians in the world; And 2. By the enſuing argument: And the neceſſity of the conſequence is evident of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 11. <hi>If ſuch a viſible Head were eſſential to the Church, and ſo to our Chriſtianity, then ſhould we all be Baptized into the Pope or a General Council, as truly and neceſſarily as we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Church. But we neither are nor ought to be ſo baptized into the Pope or a General Council; therefore they are not eſſential to the Church or our Chriſtianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major <hi>(viz.</hi> the Conſequence) is clear, and not denyed by the Papiſts, who affirm that Baptiſm engageth the baptized to the Pope. He that is united to the body, is united to the head: he that is liſted into the Army, is liſted to and under the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He that is entred into the Common-wealth, is engaged to the Soveraign thereof.</p>
                     <p>But that we are not baptized to the Pope or a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is proved, 1. Becauſe neither the form of Baptiſm, nor any word in Scripture doth affirm ſuch a thing. 2. No perſons in Scripture times were ſo baptized: Men were baptized before there was a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> or a General Council. And afterward none were baptized to them, at leaſt for many hundred years: otherwiſe then as they were entred into the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were <hi>Inhabitants there.</hi> 3. Never any was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Apoſtles ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. was <hi>Paul</hi> crucified for you, or were ye baptized in the name of <hi>Paul?</hi> They muſt be baptized into the name of no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Head, but him that was crucified for them. 4. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle fully reſolveth all the doubt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. deſcribing the body into which we are baptized, ver. 13. And he entitleth it from the head, Chriſt, verſ. 12. but acknowledgeth no other head, either co-equal with Chriſt, or ſubordinate: The higheſt of the other members are called by <hi>Paul</hi> but eyes and hands, and thus Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, Miracles, gifts of healing, helps, Governments, are only ſaid to be ſet <hi>in the Church,</hi> as eyes and hands in the body; but not <hi>over the Church</hi> as the Head or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power: ver. 17, 18, 19, 28, 29. ſo that though he that is baptized into the Church, is baptized into an Organical body, and related to the Paſtors, as to hands and eyes, yet not as to a head, nor as to a repreſentative body neither. And me thinks neither Pope nor Council ſhould pretend to be more then
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:55445:242"/>
Apoſtles, Prophets, and Teachers, and Governments. If the form of baptiſm had but delivered down the authority of the Pope or a Council, as it did the authority and name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, Tradition would have been a tolerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, though Scripture had been ſilent. But when the Baptiſmal Tradition it ſelf is ſilent, and it is a doctrine ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruouſly ſtrange to the Primitive Church, that all the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are baptized to the Pope or a General Council, I know no remedy but they muſt both put up their pretenſes.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 12. <hi>The Eſſence of the Church into which they were baptized, was part of the doctrine which the</hi> Catechumeni <hi>were taught, (and all at age ſhould learn) before their baptiſm. The Soveraignty or Headſhip of Pope or Council was no part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which (by the Primitive Church) the</hi> Catechumeni <hi>were taught, and ought to learn, before their baptiſm. Therefore the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty or Headſhip of Pope or Council was not then taken to be of the Eſſence of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is evident, 1. In that the Catholick Church was in the Creed: and it's eſſentials there briefly expreſſed in thoſe terms <hi>[Holy Catholick Church, and Communion of Saints.]</hi> 2. In that Church Hiſtory fully acquainteth us that it was the practice of the Catethiſts and other Teachers to open the Creed to them before they baptized them, and therein the Article of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> and the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Minor is proved by an induction of all the Records of thoſe times, which in groſs may now ſuffice according to our preſent intended brevity to be mentioned. There is no one Writer of many hundred years, no not <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Irenaeus,</hi> or any other that purpoſely recite the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which the Catechumeni were taught, nor <hi>Cyril,</hi> (or <hi>John) Hieroſol.</hi> or any other who open thoſe Articles to the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, that ever once mention the Doctrine of the Headſhip of the Pope or Council, when they open the Article of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church;</hi> nor yet at any other time. If they affirm that they did, let them prove it if they can.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 13. <hi>As it is high Treaſon in a Republick to deny the Soveraign, and to be cut off from him, is to be cut off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; ſo it would be a damning unchriſtening ſin to deny the Headſhip of the Pope or General Council, if they were indeed
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:55445:242"/>
the Head of the Church. But it is no ſuch damning unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening ſin: Therefore they are not the Head of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is plain from the Nature of Soveraignty. The Minor is certainly proved, 1. Becauſe it is never mentioned in Scripture, nor any ancient Writer for many hundred years, as a ſtate of Apoſtaſie, nor as a damning ſin, nor as any ſin, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the ſaid Headſhip of the Pope or Council. 2. Becauſe elſe moſt of the Chriſtians of the world at this day are Apoſtates and unchriſtened: Or if that ſeem a tolerable concluſion to the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> Yet 3. Becauſe then Chriſt had no Church for ſome hundreds of years, which I know they will not think ſo tolerable a concluſion; For to dream that the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did know any Head of the Church but Chriſt, or were engaged in loyalty to the Pope or Council, is a diſeaſe that few are lyable to, except ſuch as are ſtrangers to the writings of thoſe times, or ſuch as read them with <hi>Roman</hi> ſpectacles, reſolved what to find in them before hand.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 14. <hi>All Chriſtians are bound to ſtudy or labor to be acquainted with the Laws of the Soveraign power of the Church: All Chriſtians are not bound to ſtudy or labor to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Laws of Popes and Councils: Therefore the laws of Popes and Councils are not the Laws of the Soveraign power of the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is proved, in that all ſubjects muſt obey the Laws of the Soveraign power: But they cannot obey them unleſs they know them. Therefore they are bound to endeavour to know them.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is proved, 1. In that they being written in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> which a very ſmall part of the Chriſtians of the world do underſtand, and their Teachers not ſufficiently expounding them, and they being more copious and voluminous, more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and uncertain (of which next) then for all private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to underſtand, the people cannot learn theſe, having enough to do to learn Gods Word. 2. The Papiſts that deny the uſe of the Holy Scriptures to the people in a known tongue, and deny the neceſſity of underſtanding them, will ſure ſay the ſame of their Decretals and Canons, unleſs they mean to ſet them up above the Scripture, as well as equal them thereto.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 15. <hi>The Soveraign Head of the viſible Church and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:55445:243"/>
Center of our unity, muſt be evident, that all the Chriſtian world may know it: The Pope and General Council are not ſuch. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither of them are the Head of the Viſible Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Major is confeſſed by the Opponents; and it's plain, becauſe men cannot obey an unknown power.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is known by common experience. For many a year together (by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion) learned and wiſe men could not tell which was the true Pope; yea their Councils could not tell. Moſt of the Chriſtian world to this day can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern his Commiſſion for that power which he pretendeth to. A true General Council now no man can know, becauſe it is a <hi>non ens.</hi> Their pretended General Councils are ſo ravelled in confuſion, that they are not agreed among themſelves which are indeed ſuch, and which not: but many are rejected, and many ſuſpected (of which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giveth us a liſt) and thoſe that one receiveth, another rejecteth; and the moſt by far are rejected by moſt of the Chriſtian world. And when ſome would take up with the four firſt, and ſome with ſix, and ſome with eight, the Papiſts deridingly ask them, whether the Church hath not as much authority now as it had then? And how ſhall the Chriſtian world know whether it were a true General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or not? Of which ſee the difficulties firſt to be reſolved, which I have recited in my Diſputations againſt Popery.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 16. <hi>The Laws of the Soveraign Power of the Church muſt be certain (or elſe how ſhall we know what to obey) The Laws of Popes and General Councils are not certain: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Minor is proved by experience. The Popes Decretals are many unknown, and many proved forgeries (by <hi>Blondell ubi ſup.</hi> and many others) beyond all queſtion: and none of them proved Laws to the Church. The Canons of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> are not agreed on among the Papiſts. Many others are proved forged: Many are flatly contrary to each other (as I have ſhewed <hi>ubi ſup.)</hi> and how then ſhall Chriſtians know what to obey? The ancient Canons condemned the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of kneeling on the Lords day (and conſequently then at the Lords Supper) the reading of the Heathens Books, and many ſuch things which are now taken for lawful: The later Councils that contradict the former, do ſeem to moſt of more queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:55445:243"/>
authority then they. And what Councils are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and what rejected, they are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor have any certain Rule to know by on which they are agreed: Nor will their Popes or Councils yet reſolve them this great queſtion. So that Chriſtians are at a loſs concerning theſe Laws, and know not which of them they are obliged by, and which not.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 17. <hi>If the Pope or Council be the Head of the Church, then muſt their Laws be preached to the people by their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But the Laws of Popes and Councils need not be preached to the people by their Teachers: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of the Major is, becauſe the Laws that they muſt obey in matters ſpiritual in order to ſalvation, the Miniſters muſt preach to them. But theſe are pretended to be ſuch: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Minor, 1. It would be but an unhanſome thing in their own hearing, for Preachers to take their Texts out of the Canons or Decretals, and preach theſe day after day to the people: which yet they have need to do many a year, if the obedience of them be our neceſſary duty. 2. Miniſters are commanded to preach only the Goſpel, and it is ſaid to be ſufficient or able to make us perfect, and build us up to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therefore we need not preach the Canons or Decretals.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 18. <hi>While a Viſible Head cannot be agreed on even by thoſe that would have the Church united in ſuoh a Head, it is all one to them as if there were no ſuch Head, and the union ſtill is unattainable by them. But even among the Papiſts themſelves a Viſible Head is not, cannot be agreed on: Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>What good will it do to ſay we muſt center ſome where, and know not where, and obey ſome body, and know not who? The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> make the Pope the Infallible Head, and ſay a General Council without him may err, and is but the body. The <hi>French</hi> make the Council the Head, and ſay the Pope may err; and that the infallibility (ſuch as they plead for) is in the Council. It is not <hi>a Head, but this Head in ſpecie,</hi> that is, the form of the Church, if any ſuch be: And therefore they muſt needs (according to their own principles) be of divers Churches, while they place the Soveraignty in ſeveral ſorts and perſons. Till they better
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:55445:244"/>
agree among themſelves in their Fundamentals and Eſſentials of the Church, we have ſmall encouragement to think of uniting on any of their grounds.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 19. <hi>The Soveraign Power or Headſhip over the Church is a thing undoubtedly revealeed in the Holy Scripture:</hi> (For we cannot imagine that the Scripture ſhould be ſilent in ſo weighty a point, without intolerable accuſation of it.) <hi>The Soveraign Power or Headſhip of Pope or Council is not revealed in the Holy Scripture. Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They have not yet produced a Text to prove either of them. Thoſe produced by the <hi>Italians</hi> for the Popes Headſhip, are diſclaimed by the <hi>French,</hi> as meaning no ſuch thing; and our Writers have largely manifeſted their abuſing of the Text. So have they done of thoſe that are brought for the Headſhip of Councils. Theſe texts are ſpoke to ſo fully by <hi>Chamier, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, Ameſius,</hi> and abundance more, that I think it in vain to do it here again. That of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. that the Church <hi>is the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> doth not ſpeak a word of a General Council, nor a word of Headſhip: The whole Church united in Chriſt, is the Pillar and Ground, that is, the certain Receptacle and retainer of the Truth, the Law of Chriſt being written in their hearts.</p>
                     <p>None ſeems more to favour their concecit then <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15, 16. which <hi>Grotius</hi> faſtens on: But even that is againſt them, and not for them. For 1. It is Chriſt and only Chriſt that is here ſaid to be the head, and all other parts contradiſtinguiſhed, and excluded from Headſhip, and the Body is not ſaid to be united in them. 2. And it is by aſſociation, and mutual communication of their ſeveral gifts, that the parts are compacted together, and edifie the whole; and not by meeting in any one, and deriving from it.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But were not the Apoſtles General Officers, and ſo the Church united in General officers? Anſw.</hi> This is little to the Queſtion. For 1. the Apoſtles had one among them to be the Soveraign or Head of the reſt, but were of equal power. 2. Nor did a major part of their whole number make ſuch a Head for the Church to unite in, nor do we read that ever a Major vote carryed it among them againſt a Minor; for they were all guided by the Spirit. Yet its true that they met ofter together then a General Council can. 2. The Apoſtles as extraordinarily
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:55445:244"/>
qualified, and as the Secretaries of the Spirit, have no ſucceſſors: But the Apoſtles as ambulatory unfixed Miniſters, had even then many companions: For <hi>Barnabas, Luke, Apollo,</hi> and abundance more, did then go up and down preaching, as well as the Apoſtles; yet had not any one of them a ſpecial charge of Governing all the Churches: nor yet all of them united in a body: For the Apoſtles called not the Evangeliſts and other fellow workers to conſult in Councils about the Government of the whole; But both they and their helpers, did ſeverally what they could to teach and ſettle the Churches. 3. Who be they now that are the Apoſtles ſucceſſors? If all the Biſhops in the world, the caſe is as we left it. If any ſmall number of Primates or Patriarcks, how ſhall we know which and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? If they be not twelve, why ſhould one Apoſtle have a ſucceſſor, and not others? But there are no twelve only that lay claim to the ſucceſſion. And if you go further, who can limit, and ſay who, and how many they be, and how far the number may be increaſed or decreaſed, and by whom? In <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> dayes he and his fellows in the Council at <hi>Carthage</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that all Biſhops were equal, and none had power over other. And ſo thought others in thoſe times. Nor was there then any number of Biſhops that claimed to be the ſole ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Apoſtles, to rule all the reſt. And if they had, when the Church increaſeth, the Rulers muſt increaſe. But this is not to the main point.</p>
                     <p>Argum. 20. <hi>The Scripture doth appropriate the Univerſal Headſhip to Chriſt only, and deny it to all others: therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope nor Council are the Univerſal Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. It is the peculiar Title of Chriſt to be Head of the Church, to whom it muſt be ſubject, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. The Apoſtle would have us know that the Head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the woman is the man, and the Head of Chriſt is God. So that there is a particular Head over ſome parcell of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy below Chriſt: but to be the Univerſal Head of every man, is the proper Title of Chriſt. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. the unity of the body and diverſity of the members is more largely expreſſed then any where elſe in Scripture; and there when the ſaid unity of the body had been ſo fully mentioned, the Apoſtle comes to name the Head of that Unity, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. which is only Chriſt. <hi>[Now
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:55445:245"/>
ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular]</hi> The Church is never called the body of the Pope, or of a Council, but the body of Chriſt: yea (as was even now ſaid) in the next words the <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, and Teachers</hi> are enumerated to the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members,</hi> contradiſtinct from the <hi>Head,</hi> ſo far are all, or any one of them from being the head themſelves. And in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10, 17, 19. it is Chriſt only that is called the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> and he only is mentioned as the Center of its Unity <hi>[And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints, and bands having nouriſhment miniſtred and knit together, increaſeth with the increaſe of God.]</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>And he is the Head of the body, the Church.]</hi> If any ſay that you cannot hence argue Negatively that therefore no one elſe is the Head, I anſwer, They may as well ſay, when it is affirmed that <hi>[the Lord he is God]</hi> you cannot thence conclude that <hi>Baal is not God.</hi> The Apoſtle plainly ſpeaks this of Chriſt as his peculiar honour: And he ſpoke to men that knew well enough that natural bodies have but one Head, unleſs they be Monſters: And he would not ſo oft inſiſt on this Metaphor, intending ſo great a diſparity in the ſimilitude, and never diſcover any ſuch intention; So in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>He gave him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.]</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle purpoſely exhorteth us to the obſervation of this unity; and purpoſely telleth us by a large enumeration wherein it doth conſiſt: but in all he never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth the Pope or a Council: yea he plainly excludeth them, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 4. &amp;c. <hi>[Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace: There is one body, and one ſpirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptiſm, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all: But unto every one of us is given Grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt—He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the Faith, &amp;c.—]</hi> ſo then you ſee there is but <hi>one Lord</hi> of the Church; therefore the Pope or Council is not Lord (in name or deed.) And <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi>
                        <pb n="435" facs="tcp:55445:245"/>
are the member contradiſting guiſhed from this <hi>One Lord,</hi> and whoſe diverſity is purpoſely mentioned, they being the matter or parcels that muſt have their unity in ſome other, but not the Church to be united in them. Here is then no mention among all theſe <hi>[Ones]</hi> of one earthly Head, whether Pope or Council, not of <hi>One Apoſtle</hi> that was the Head of the reſt. If ſuch a thing had ever come into the Apoſtles mind, he would ſure have mentioned it on ſuch occaſions as theſe, and not have quite forgotten it; yea and contradict it ſo evidently.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15, 17. <hi>Our bodies are the members of Chriſt,</hi> (not of the Pope) <hi>and he that is joined to the Lord is one ſpirit</hi> (not he that is joined to the Pope.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>We are all one in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (not in an earthly Head) Many and many times doth the Apoſtle exhort them to be of <hi>one mind, and acord, and take heed of ſchiſm, and maintain peace,</hi> and he reproveth their diviſions at large: yet doth he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mention ſuch a ſin as dividing from an earthly Head, nor ever once direct them to a Pope or General Council as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their unity, or the neceſſary means of curing diviſions. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf exhorteth them to be <hi>all of one mind,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. but never to be all united in him as their head. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is punctual in deſcribing the Officers of the Church, and the peoples duty to them: But he never deſcribeth a Pope, or any earthly Head of that Church: nor ever telleth the people of their duty to ſuch: And if ſuch a ſuppoſed fundamental ſhould be quite forgotten by men that belieived it, and taught others that which was neceſſary to be believed, it were incredibly ſtrange. That <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Romans ſhould never mind them of the honour of their Sea, or their duty to their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Prelate, was his forgetfulneſs or unbelief. And ſurely he would never have ſo ſharply reproved them of <hi>Corinth</hi> for contentions, in ſaying <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of Chriſt,</hi> if he had thought they muſt have been united <hi>in Cephas;</hi> without once telling them of ſuch a means of union and reconciliation. He ſaith <hi>[Is Chriſt divided?]</hi> as much as to ſay, you muſt be all united in him: but he ſaith not <hi>[Is Cephas divided?]</hi> but plainly makes the exalters of <hi>Cephas</hi> a <hi>party</hi> that was guilty of diviſion, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. tells them plainly that this ſhewed that <hi>they were carnal.</hi> And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:55445:246"/>
of all others in his own perſon and <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſaith <hi>[Who then is</hi> Paul, <hi>or who is</hi> Apollo, <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye believed?]</hi> They had not then learned to anſwer <hi>[Why</hi> Cephas <hi>is the Head of the Church.]</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 46. He ſpeaks as if it were purpoſely to a Papiſt <hi>[All theſe things, brethren, I have in a figure tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to my ſelf and to</hi> Apollo <hi>for your ſakes: that ye might learn in us not to think (of men) above that which is written: that no one of you be puffed up for one againſt another]</hi> What not for <hi>Peter?</hi> no not for <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf. And doubtleſs <hi>Paul</hi> did not believe his ſupremacy, when he ſo preſumed to reprove him to his face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. there is mention of our being <hi>all one bread, and one body:</hi> but thats becauſe we are all partakers of <hi>that one body of Chriſt,</hi> and not becauſe we are united in the Pope or any other.</p>
                     <p>Moreover when the Diſciples ſtrove who ſhould be greateſt, Chriſt expreſly rebuketh ſuch thoughts, and inſtead of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of them that deſire, he denyeth it to them all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 25, 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles rule over them, and are called gracious Lords, but with you it ſhall not be ſo.] Bellarmine</hi> indeed can merrily hence gather that there muſt be one appointed to be the greateſt, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that will be Greateſt, let him be the ſervant of all.]</hi> This is to make good their charge againſt the Scripture, that it is a noſe of Wax by their preſumptuons abuſe of it; as ſome men would prove the Apoſtacy of the Saints, by their own Apoſtatizing, when yet they prove it not, though they ruine themſelves. Did not Chriſt by theſe words reprehend their ſeeking of a Supremacy? And yet doth he grant it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Oh but it is only Tyranny that Chriſt forbiddeth them. Anſw.</hi> That which Chriſt acknowledgeth in the Kings of the Nations, without reprehenſion, that is it which he denyeth to his Diſciples. But it is not Tyranny but Dominion which Chriſt thus acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, and alloweth to the Kings of the Nations: therefore it is not Tyranny but Dominion which he forbiddeth to his Diſciples; That which Chriſt here ſpeaketh of the Kings of the Nations, is ſomewhat common to all Kings, and ſo as Kings. But Tyranny was not common to all Kings, nor to them as Kings: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not Tyranny that he ſpeaks of. Moreover its plain that it is a Greatneſs in Deſire and Affectation that is the ſubject of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:55445:246"/>
Chriſts ſpeech, and not an allowed ſupremacy, and that he forbids this Supremacy in the following words, <hi>[Let him be the ſervant of all]</hi> q. d. <hi>[I allow in my Kingdom to the Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel no other Greatneſs or ſuperiority above others, but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in holineſs, and humility, and doing good, and ſo in diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ruling Greatneſs.]</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> 9. there's mention of <hi>[him that was leaſt, &amp;c.]</hi> It follows not thence that one was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the loweſt. And if the will of Chriſt were known to them that one ſhould be the Supream, and this was <hi>Peter,</hi> what need they ſtrive any further about it; or why doth he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them for reſiſting their Supream?</p>
                     <p>Again I ſay, that I cannot ſee how it can ſtand with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or goodneſs of Chriſt the Law-giver of his Church, or the perfection of his Laws, or how it can be any way probable, that he ſhould be wholly ſilent of ſo great a point as the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Center of the Churches Unity; never giving us either the Name or Titles of ſuch a Head, nor the ſeat of his Empire, nor appointing him his work, nor directing him how to do it when he hath the greateſt work in the world to do (as theſe men ſuppoſe) and ſuch as ſurpaſſeth the ſtrength of man, yea of a thouſand men; never giving him any advice and direction for the determining of his very many occurrent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; nor once giving us any of his power, nor telling us of his prerogative, nor telling us what officers he ſhall appoint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and how; nor once telling any man of his duty to obey him; never telling us any thing of the ſucceſſion of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign in whom it ſhall reſide; nor once telling us hiſtorically of the exerciſe of any of his power: I ſay that not a word of this ſhould be mentioned by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, even when there was ſo great occaſion, when <hi>Peter</hi> was among them, when there was ſtriving for ſupremacy, when the Churches were lamentably contending about the preheminence of their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſome were for one, and ſome for another, and ſome for <hi>Cephas</hi> himſelf; and when ſo many hereſies aroſe, and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded the Churches, as among the <hi>Corinthians, Galathians,</hi> and others there did; This is a thing ſo hard to be believed by one that believeth the wiſdom and love of Chriſt, that I muſt ſay for my part, it ſurpaſſeth my belief. Eſpecially (as is ſaid) when alſo ſo much is ſaid againſt the Supremacy contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:55445:247"/>
for. All this I ſpeak of any earthly Head, whether Pope or Council.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſay the Papiſts) <hi>you can allow Princes to be the Heads of the Church: why then not a Pope? Anſw.</hi> We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Princes and Paſtors over parts of the Church, but not over the Church Univerſal. Every Corporation may call the Major or Bayliff a ſubordinate Head of that Corporation, but not of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>There may be a Prorex, a Viceking: and why not then a Vicarious Head of the Catholick Church? Anſw.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Kingdom is not ſo big as all the world, or all that is and may be Chriſtian. 2. Becauſe a King having Dominion, hath power of doing all that by others that he cannot do himſelf: But a Paſtor being a Miniſter, hath no ſuch power given him, but muſt do his work himſelf. 3. Becauſe the work of the Miniſtry requires far more labour and attendance. So that it is an utter Imopſſibility that any man ſhould be able to do the work of a ſupream Ruler of all the Chriſtian world, yea or the hundreth part of it, as it muſt be done. 4. And laſtly, becauſe Chriſt hath made no ſuch Prorex, or Vice-head: and none can have it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But the Civil power hath been exerciſed by an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour over more then all the Chriſtian world: And why then may not the Eccleſiaſtical? Anſw.</hi> 1. Its notoriouſly falſe that ever Emperour had ſo extenſive a Dominion. 2. The Goſpel muſt be preached over all the world; and therefore we muſt conſider the poſſible future extent of the Church, and not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exiſtent ſtate. 3. There are many millions of Chriſtians mixt in the Dominions of Infidel Princes among other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which makes the Government of them the more difficult. 4. I ſhewed before from the nature of the work many other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which make a difference.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Monarchy is the beſt Government; therefore the Church muſt have it. Anſw.</hi> The Monarchy of God is beſt: but among men it is according to the ſtate of the Rulers and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. One way is better in ſome caſes, and another in others. 2. For one man to be Monarch of all the Chriſtian world, is not beſt, when by taking a thouſand times more upon him then he can do, he will ruine inſtead of ruling well. 3. You may as
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:55445:247"/>
well ſay, An Univerſal Civil Monarch over all the world is beſt; therefore ſo it muſt be: but when will you prove that? But if I miſtake not in my conjecture, it is the thing that the Jeſuites have lately got into their heads, that the Pope muſt have the Univerſal Soveraignty Eccleſiaſtical and Civil; that ſo an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace may be in the world.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>There was but One High Prieſt before Chriſt. Anſw.</hi> 1. No more there was but one Temple; Will you therefore have no more? Nor but one civil Monarch in that Church: Would you have no more? I partly believe it. 2. It was eaſie for one to Rule ſo ſmall a Nation as <hi>Judaea</hi> in compariſon of all the world. 3. Prove you the Inſtitution of your Supremacy, as we can prove the Inſtitution of <hi>Aarons</hi> Prieſthood, and the taking of it down again, and we will yield all. 4. That Prieſthood was a Type of Chriſt the Eternal Prieſt, and is ended in him, as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſhews at large.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>There is a Monarchy among Angels and Devils. Anſw.</hi> 1. Its a hard ſhift when you muſt go to another world for your pattern: But for your Argument fetcht from Hell, I will leave it with you: but for that from Heaven, I ſay, theres no proof of it. And if there were, till you can prove that our work and fitneſs for it is the ſame as Angels, and that the Lord hath appointed the ſame form here, you have ſaid nothing.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Queſtion is largely handled by abundance of our Learned Writers, I ſhall ſay no more to it here, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that by this which is already ſaid in brief, it is manifeſt, that <hi>The Catholick Church of Chriſt is not one Viſible Political Body, as joined to any One Univerſal Viſible Head or Soveraign, beſides Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If any being driven from this hold, ſhall ſay, that yet there are ſeveral Patriarcks that Govern the ſeveral Provinces of the Chriſtian world, though there be no head but Chriſt. I anſwer. 1. If there be no earthly Head and Center of unity, then I have the main cauſe. Theſe Patriarcks may and do at this day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilably diſagree among themſelves. This therefore will not ſerve for a unity. 2. When (as is aforeſaid) you have well proved the Inſtitution of theſe Patriarcks, and how many they be, and who, and the power of Princes to make new ones,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:55445:248"/>
(and not to forbear it, and to pull down the old ones:) and when you have anſwered the foregoing Arguments, as many of them as extend to Patriarchal power alſo, as well as Unverſal Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then we ſhall take this further into conſideration. In the mean time, I ſuperſede, as having done that which I think neceſſary to take off men, from inclining to <hi>Rome,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of Churches, upon the erroneous Conceit of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unity of the Catholick Church; as if it were One, as under One Earthly Viſible Head.</p>

                        <hi>Queſt. BUT if this be not the way of the Churches Unity, which is? and what ſhould we deſire and endeavour for the attaining it? For the diſtractions of the Church are ſo great through our diviſions, that it makes us ſtill apt to ſuſpect that we are out of the way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though it be a great work to anſwer this queſtion right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a hundred, a thouſand times greater to anſwer it ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily (that is, to ſatisfie prejudiced incapable men with a right anſwer,) yet I ſhall attempt it by caſting in my thoughts; or to ſpeak more confidently, by declaring ſo much as I am certain is the will of God concerning this weighty thing.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall firſt lay down thoſe grounds upon which we muſt proceed, if we will do our duty for the union of the Church. 2. I ſhall tell you what muſt be done to reduce them into Practice.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <p n="1">1. THE firſt General Ground is this <hi>[Peace and Holineſs muſt be carried on together: Yea Peace muſt be ſought as a Means to Holineſs: and therefore Holineſs which is the End, muſt be preferred.]</hi> The wiſdom that is from above, is firſt
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:55445:248"/>
Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle, eaſie to be intreated, <hi>&amp;c. Jam.</hi> 3. A man may be ſaved that cannot attain Peace with men: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are commanded to ſeek it as an uncertain good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 18. If it be poſſible, as much as in you lyeth, live peacably with all men: But no man can be ſaved without Holineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee God. There is a kind of Unity among Devils. For if Satan were divided againſt Satan, how could his Kingdom ſtand? <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. There is a Peace in a ſtate of miſery and ſin, which hindereth mens recovery. For when the ſtrong man armed keeps his houſe, the things that he poſſeſſeth are in Peace. It is a ſtate of greateſt danger on earth to be United in evil, and to have Peace in a way of ſin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder if there be more lovers of Peace then of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and more that will cry out of our Diviſions then of our ungodlineſs, and more that cry out of ſo many Religions, then of irreligiouſneſs and ungodlineſs. For nature may make a man in love with Unity and Peace, but not with Holineſs; for with that it is at Enmity. Hence it is that we hear ſo many Worldlings, Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers cry up uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and cry down ſo many minds and wayes: And hence it is that ſo many, ſuch wicked livers do turn Papiſts on ſuppoſition that there is more unity with them. And ſo the Popiſh party among us are the ſink into which the filth and excrements of our Churches are emptyed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond General Ground. From hence it followeth that the firſt cloſure of the members of the Church muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principles of Faith and Holineſs: and therefore only between the Profeſſors of Faith and Holineſs. And therefore we ought not to be ſolicitous of obtaining a Unity with open ungodly men; For what Communion hath light with darkneſs? or what concord hath Chriſt with Belial? If men will not agree with us in the great Principles of Godlineſs, nor join with us in avoiding crying ſins, and living an Holy life; it is they that are the Separatiſts, and withdraw from our communion. If they will not come to us in Piety, we muſt not come to them in Impiety. And to attempt a union with them in Government and Ceremonies, when we cannot bring them to a Union with us in ſeeming Godlineſs, is as vain as to attempt to an Aſſociation
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55445:249"/>
with the dead, and to make a marriage with a ſtinking Corps. It is therefore but a carnal ſtir that Papiſts, and ſome Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilers make to have a Union ſo General, as ſhall take in the moſt impious rabble that ought to be excommunicated, and ſhould conjoin the living and the dead. And therefore in ſome caſes we are all called to ſeparate, by him that calleth us in other caſes to unity: And he tels us that he came not to ſend peace, (with ſuch) but diviſion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third General Ground. Unity and Peace are ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, and ſo much depend upon Love and Holineſs, and ſuppoſe alſo ſo much Illumination, that the perfection of them is reſerved for Heaven: and as it is but a ſmall meaſure of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Love and Holineſs that is here attainable, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that which we ſhall have in heaven; ſo it is but a ſmall meaſure of Peace and Concord: And therefore though our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and endeavours ſhould go as high as we can, yet our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations on earth muſt not fly too high. This hath been my own error. I have not ſufficiently conſidered, that perfect Peace, as well as perfect Holineſs is the prerogative of Heaven, and that true Peace will be imperfect while the Light and Vertue which is ſuppoſed to it is imperfect. And it is a blind abſurd conceit of them that wonder we have not perfect Unity, when yet they murmur at Piety, and think a little may ſerve the turn, and any ſin is tolerable thats directly againſt God, but not diſunion.</p>
                        <p>So much for the General Grounds: The Particular Grounds are theſe following.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Ground</hi> IT is the Prerogative of the Lord Jeſus to be the only Head and Soveraign of the Church. And his will revealed is our Law, and in him only muſt we center: and not in any Vicarious Univerſal Head: And from him muſt all receive their power: and all muſt worſhip God according to his praeſcript. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. 21, 22. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Gr.</hi> The Holy Scriptures with the Law of Nature, are the only Laws of Chriſt: unleſs as he may poſſibly by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55445:249"/>
Revelation, oblige ſome perſon to a particular duty, not contrary to that word, but left undetermined: which yet is ſo rare a thing that men muſt not raſhly preſume of ſuch a matter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 7, 8. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9, 11.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is the prerogative of Chriſt himſelf to be the ſupream, abſolute and final Judge of the ſence of his own Laws, and of the cauſes that are to be tried thereby.</p>
                        <p>And therefore it is treaſonable folly to attribute any of this to man: and to cry out for an Abſolute Judge of Controverſies here on earth: when one ſaith, This is the ſence of Scripture, and another ſaith that is the ſence: ſaith the Papiſt, [But who ſhall be Judge?] To which I anſwer, How far man is Judge, I ſhall tell you in the next: but the Abſolute Judge, and the final Judge is only Chriſt. He that made the Law is the proper Judge of the ſence of his own Laws: Do you not know that Chriſt will come to judgement, and that all ſecrets muſt then be opened by him, and he muſt decide what man cannot? Man is to Judge but <hi>in tantum; ad hoc; ſecundum quid;</hi> limitedly; ſo far as he muſt execute; but Chriſt only Judgeth entirely, finally and abſolutely, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9, 13.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All Councils whether General, or Provincial, or Claſſical, which conſiſt of the Biſhops or Paſtors of ſeveral Churches met together, are appointed and to be uſed directly, but <hi>gratiâ Unitatis, &amp; Communionis Chriſtianae,</hi> and not directly <hi>gratia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giminis</hi> for the Governing of Paſtors, in order to Unity and Communion, and not as a Regimental, as to the Paſtors. This Propoſition which is of exceeding conſequence, was voluntarily aſſerted to me, without my own asking his opinion, by that Learned, Judicious man Arch-Biſhop <hi>Uſher;</hi> a man well known to be acquainted with the Judgement and practice of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, if any other whoever. His words were theſe. [Councils are not for Government, but for Unity; not as being in order of Government over the ſeveral Biſhops; but that by conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they may know their duty more clearly, and by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maintain Unity; and to this end they were anciently ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated] Himſelf a Primate, recommended to others theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:55445:250"/>
Principles. And this middle way of Reverend <hi>Uſher</hi> is the true healing Mean, between them that would have properly Governing Councils, and them that would have none, or think them needleſs, or but indifferent things.</p>
                        <p>But yet (as is before mentioned in the tenth Propoſition) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially we are obliged to perform the Agreements of theſe Councils, if they be agreeable to the General Rules of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or if our performance be not forbidden by the Word of God; Becauſe we are under the General obligation to do all things in as much unity, concord and peace as we can, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>per totum.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. &amp; 4. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 4. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8, 9, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                        <p>And I grant that Paſtors are related to the Univerſal Church, as well as to a particular, and are to have a common care of the whole, though they have a ſpecial charge only of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular flocks. Therefore many Paſtors in a Synod are Paſtors as well as disjunct, and therefore their acts are authoritative Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Acts as to the flock. But 1. to the Paſtors themſelves, they are not properly Governors, no more in Synods then out. 2. And as to the flocks, they are not in a direct ſuperiour order above their particular Paſtors; but only from their concord are accidentally more to be regarded and obeyed then a ſingle Paſtor, as a Colledge of Phyſitians is more to be regarded then a ſingle Phyſitian, not as being of higher authority, but of greater credit, in caſes where men muſt be truſted.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A Council conſiſting of Biſhops or Paſtors that by diſtance are not uncapable of ordinary local Communion, whether it be a General Council (as they are commonly called, which are not ſuch properly) or National, or Provincial. 1. As they are Chriſtians ſingly, have a Judgement of Diſcerning, what is ſound Doctrine, and whom to judge Catholicks and fit for their Communion: And 2. As they are ſingle Paſtors, they have the <hi>Judgement</hi> of <hi>Direction,</hi> what Doctrine to recommend as found to their people (limited to the Superiour Direction of God by his Word,) and whom they muſt hold or not hold Communion with: And this is an Authoritative Direction, which may be accompanyed with a Commanding, as an Herald or Purſevant may command in the Princes name. 3. And as they are many Paſtors in Council aſſembled, they have a <hi>Judgement</hi> of <hi>Concord,</hi>
                           <pb n="445" facs="tcp:55445:250"/>
or Power to enter ſolemnly into Conſultations for mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and then into Agreements, for the right perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their duty, in recommending that which is ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to their people, and receiving the true members of the Catholick Church, and rejecting ſuch as are to be rejected.</p>
                        <p>So that the moſt General Councils of true Paſtors <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> are to be moſt reverenced by the Princes and people, and in caſes where they are ſure it is lawful to follow their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though they be not ſatisfied of the neceſſity of it <hi>à na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura rei,</hi> they ought to follow them on the account of unity; and alſo in caſes meerly doubtful to them in point of Doctrine, to be ballanced by their judgements rather then by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſingle Paſtors, and more then by any other humane judgement <hi>caeteris paribus:</hi> which exception I add, becauſe a ſmaller Aſſembly, yea a ſingle Paſtor or private man, ſpeaking according to the Word of God, is to be believed and regarded more then the greateſt Aſſembly contradicting the Word: yet we are not eaſily to think, without evident proof, that one man ſhould be rather in the right then ſo many; ſeeing it is eaſier for one to err then ſo many, and the promiſes are more to the publick, then any ſingle perſons, ſo far as they can be known to others: And yet an Aſſembly of an hundred, or twenty, or ten apparent humble, holy, Judicious men, is likelier to be in the right, and more to be regarded, then an Aſſembly of a thouſand ignorant unlearned wicked Biſhops. One clear eye may ſee further then ten thouſand purblind ones, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 34. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. &amp; 14. 33. &amp; 10. 32.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. As the propereſt matter for ſuch General Aſſemblies to Conſult and Agree upon, is General things; as, What Doctrine is ſound, and what unſound in General; what perſons in General fit for the Churches Communion, and what unfit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſmaller Aſſemblies that are capable of ordinary perſonal Communion, and know the perſons and circumſtances of the caſes, are fitteſt to conſult and agree whether ſuch or ſuch particular perſons are fit for their own Communion; yea and for their Churches Communion in difficult caſes: And alſo may conſult and agree what Doctrines and practiſes to recommend to their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as moſt agreeable to the Word of God: And thus far theſe two ſorts of Synods may be ſaid to have a power of Judging;
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:55445:251"/>
                           <hi>viz. ad hoc,</hi> in order to ſuch agreements and practice, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 5, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 26, 27. 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 8. 19.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Poſtors of particular Worſhipping Churches, are the Authorized Guides, Rulers or Teachers of thoſe Churches, and each Member thereof: and muſt firſt <hi>diſcern</hi> in their own minds, and next (if they be many over a Church) <hi>Agree</hi> among themſelves, and then teach the people, what is to be believed and practiſed, and with whom in General, and in Particular to hold Communion, and whom to avoid, and may charge the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Chriſts name to obey their juſt directions; and when they have done, muſt themſelves execute their own part herein (as by avoiding the Rejected, and not delivering them the Symbols or Sacrament of Communion, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And though they muſt conſult with neighbor Churches for carrying on the work of God in unity, and to the beſt advantage of the Common cauſe, yet are they not under the proper Government of them, or any Aſſemblies (Eccleſiaſtical,) though obliged in all juſt things to Agree with them. So that Canons as Canons, I mean the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of ſuch Aſſemblies, are but properly Agreements, and not Laws, though by conſequence they may be ſaid to oblige, or rather we by another Law obliged to accord and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The work of Councils how large ſo ever, is not to make new Scriptures to be the Rule of our Faith and Life, nor to make new Articles or Doctrines of Faith, nor to frame God a new Worſhip in whole or in part; But by Conſultations and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtrengthen each other, and Direct the people in the faith of Chriſt, and the maintaining and propagating the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Holy Scriptures, and doing thoſe duties in the Worſhip of God, and in Righteouſneſs and Mercy to men, which the Scriptures do impoſe, and in agreeing upon thoſe Modes and Circumſtances of Worſhip which God hath made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>in genere,</hi> and left to occaſional humane determination <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> Nor may they under this pretence, either contradict the juſt determination of the Magiſtrate concerning ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, or impoſe any enſnaring, needleſs Ceremonies upon the Church; but only order the ſervice of God according to the General Directions of the Scripture, and the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

which by the conſideration of the caſe may help to diſcern the fitteſt order. It is therefore a ſtrange aſſertion of ſome, that Governours have nothing to do if they may not appoint new Ordinances or Symbolical Ceremonies on the Church, and make new Laws, ſeeing God hath done the reſt already. As if it were nothing to ſee to the execution of Gods Laws? Or as if this were not the fitteſt work for ſuch kind of Rulers, whoſe Rule is only by Miniſterial Guidance? Or as if the determination of Neceſſary Circumſtances requiſite <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> were not enough for them to do, beſide what is written?

Thoſe neceſſary Circumſtances in Religious Worſhip which are of humane determination, and left undetermined by God, are unfit matter for General Councils or remote Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to make ſtanding General Laws of: For 1. the Nature of the things are ſuch as are mutable, and unfit to be fixt, but muſt be frequently varied as occaſions require. 2. The occurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances will be the fitteſt guide to determine them. 3. They may be meet in one Countrey, or Church, which are unmeet in another. 4. Upon ſuch reaſons God himſelf hath left them undetermined: Therefore he left them not to any fixed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral determination. 5. The Paſtors that are in the place are the fitteſt Judges of thoſe occaſions that muſt determine them. 6. And it is the office, and in the Commiſſion of thoſe Paſtors to be the Guides of their own actions and Congregations. 7. And Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are not their Lords. So that all this laid together, may tell us that it is rather the work of particular Paſtors or Biſhops, and of neereſt Aſſociations in thoſe caſes where Concord is requiſite, then of Provincial, or National, or General Councils to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of ſuch Circumſtances. For example: The command of preaching, reading, adminiſtring the Sacraments, ſinging Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do imply that I muſt have ſome time and place to do them in: I muſt uſe ſome geſture, veſture, neceſſary utenſils, but it tells not what in particular: I muſt read ſome particular Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Pſalm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or ſo much of it: Now common prudence will
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:55445:252"/>
tell me what to do in theſe caſes my ſelf, or elſe I am not fit to be a Paſtor, or entruſted with ſo great a work as Gods publick Worſhip, or the care of ſouls. Shall a Council now make Laws that all the Miniſters in the World, or in this Nation, ſhall preach only on ſuch a day, and only at ſuch an hour, and in this or that part of the Church, and only on ſuch Texts ſuch days, appointing them a Text for every day; or that they ſhall uſe only ſuch words in praying and preaching as is written for them; or ſhall pray or preach juſt ſo long; or ſhall ſing only ſuch a Pſalm, in ſuch a tune, uſing only ſuch cloaths, and ſuch geſtures, with an hundred the like? This is to make themſelves Maſters of the Church, and uſe their power to the deſtruction of Miniſtry, Worſhip and Church, and not to the Edification of it. The preſent ſtate of the flock, by ſin; or affliction, or the like, may make ſuch a Text fitteſt for me to preach on, and ſuch a Chapter to be read, or ſuch a Pſalm to be ſung, when by the Impoſitions of proud uſurpers I am commanded to uſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> Subjects of Joy, in a time of Humiliation, or of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation in the time of Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many the like inconveniencies might eaſily be manifeſt. Theſe unneceſſary Impoſitions are the Engines of Diviſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. throughout. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 4. &amp; 11. 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Where ſome Impoſitions by Magiſtrates or Agreements by Miniſters in ſuch Circumſtances are thought lawful or fit, yet muſt not the Churches Unity or Peace be laid upon them: So that if through the weakneſs of Chriſtians they could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the lawfulneſs of them, but did think they ſhould ſin againſt God if they uſed them, it is a cruel dividing courſe for Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates here by ſore penalties, or Paſtors Excommunications to ſeek to drive them upon that which they think is the way to hell, or the wrath of God, when in the Judgement of the Impoſer it is a thing indifferent: The peace of the Church and of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is more worth then a Ceremony, and better kept by gentle recommending ſuch things (if fit,) and a tender rebuke or check to the weak, then by forcing all to that which they neither can nor need to uſe. But ſome ſay, if all may uſe what way they will, what order ſhall we have? I anſwer; therefore make no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Laws: caſt not a foot-ball of contention before them:
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:55445:252"/>
Theſe preſumptuous Impoſitions are the fire brands of the Church. For example: we had here a Law that Miniſters ſhould read only ſuch a peece of a Chapter called an Epiſtle and Goſpel ſuch a day (which yet I would not diſobey:) here now aroſe contention about it: The ſame Miniſters were left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty what Text to preach on: and this liberty made no breach in the Church. Miniſters were commanded to wear a Surplice, and this raiſed contention: But what kind of hat, or cap, or ſhooes, or hoſe to wear, they were left at liberty, and this made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, nor occaſioned any undecency. The Lords Supper was to be taken only kneeling: and this raiſed contention: But they were left at liberty whether to kneel, or ſtand, or ſit at Sermon, or reading, or ſinging Pſalms, and this bred no unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency nor diviſion. They were enjoyned to bow at the name of Jeſus in the reading of the Goſpel only: And this raiſed diviſion. But they were left at liberty to bow or not to the Name of God; Chriſt, Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to the Name Jeſus in Sermon, or the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or the ſame Goſpel read in the whole Chapter: and this bred no diviſion, nor diſcontent: Lay the Churches peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no new humane Impoſitions, if you would have it hold. Peruſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and the other Text laſt cited, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The Churches Peace or Unity muſt not be laid on any bare words of mans deviſing. It's not a work for Councils or Prelates to form the Chriſtian doctrine in new methods and terms, and then to force others to ſubſcribe or uſe thoſe very terms: If the ſame men that refuſe this, be willing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the whole Scripture, or to a Confeſſion in Scripture terms, you may force him to no more.</p>
                        <p>

They muſt wreſt it then, or wreſt their Conſciences: And by either or both theſe ſhifts, they may alſo ſubſcribe to any of your Confeſſions. 2. If his Hereſie be latent in his mind, you know it not, nor can call him an Heretick, nor doth it hurt the Church: If it he publiſhed or preached to others, let civil Governors queſtion him for corporal puniſhment, and let the Aſſociate Paſtors queſtion him to his Reformation or Rejection. You will have a better ground to reject him for delivering falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in his own words, then for not ſubſcribing to Truth in your words, when he ſubſcribed the ſame Truth in Gods Words.</p>

                           <pb n="450" facs="tcp:55445:253"/>
There is no Unity to be expected, if you will ſo far depart from the Scripture ſufficiency, as to make any more for ſenſe or phraſe, of abſolute neceſſity to our peace. By <hi>phraſe</hi> or <hi>terms,</hi> I mean either the ſame numerically (as in the Original) or equipollent (as in tranſlations.) And I ſay not that it's neceſſary to the unity of the Church, that <hi>every word in Scripture</hi> (Original or Tranſlations) be ſubſcribed to; (for ſome may doubt of the corruption of a word or Book) But that <hi>no more</hi> is neceſſary.

                        <p n="12">12. The Churches Unity &amp; Peace muſt not be laid upon all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths: as not on leſſer darker points, which neither the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor well-being of Chriſtianity is concerned in ſo much as to reſt upon them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15, 17, 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. &amp; 6. 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. We ought to love and eſteem as Chriſtians and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church all thoſe that profeſs to believe the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and to be ſanctified by the Spirit of God, and lead a holy upright life; ſo they make a credible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not evidently contradicted by words or deeds: though theſe perſons may differ from us in many lower points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip or Government, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15, 16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2. &amp; 14. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</p>

Church, ſo be it we all hold the ſame eſſentials of Faith and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and walk accordingly, and eſpecially if we alſo hold thoſe weighty ſuperſtructures, that the welfare of the Church is moſt concerned in.</p>
                        <p>Though here were few or no inſtances of this caſe in the days of the Apoſtles, when diviſions were not ſo great as now, yet the general rules in the fore-cited Texts do prove it.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Eccleſiaſtical Miniſterial Government (by whomſoever exerciſed) muſt not degenerate into a ſecular coercive Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor may we uſe carnal weapons, nor meddle by force with mens bodies or eſtates; nor yet can we oblige the Magiſtrate to do it, meerly to execute our cenſures, or without ſufficient Evidence to prove it his duty; nor can we oblige the people againſt the Word of God, <hi>clave errante:</hi> ſo that neither Biſhop, nor Council hath any ſuch power as is properly deciſively Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial obliging to execution, be the ſentence right or wrong: But our people muſt know that though we be their Guides or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, yet are we but Miniſters, and that they have a higher power to regard, and muſt not obey us againſt the Lord, but in and for him. The Power of Paſtors therefore is not like Magiſtrates, or abſolute Judges (as is ſaid before, but like a Phyſitian in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, or in an infected City among his Patients, and like a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of any Science to voluntary Scholars, in his School: and as an Embaſſador to them to whom he is ſent. So that our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being but by the Word, and on the Conſcience, is of the ſame nature with our Directing. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25, 26. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Magiſtrates are Governors of the Church even as a Church, and of Chriſtians as Chriſtians, though not Abſolutely, nor in the ſame reſpects, by the ſame means, &amp; to the ſame neereſt Ends, as Paſtors. Magiſtrates muſt force us to our duty, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us if we be wicked or negligent, even as Paſtors, and caſt us out of our Benefices, and deny us encouragements, if we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient: ſo that <hi>ad hoc</hi> the Magiſtrate is the only Judge what is ſound doctrine, and what hereſie, what Miniſters are ſufficient or inſufficient, culpable or not; I ſay, <hi>ad hoc,</hi> ſo far as to Judge who ſhall have publick Liberty and Countenance, and who ſhall be puniſhed, reſtrained and diſcountenanced: Thus far the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is Judge in Religion; (beſides that Judgement of Choice
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:55445:254"/>
which every private man hath) And therefore the Princes of the Chriſtian world ſhould hold ſome correſpondencies like General Councils, among themſelves by their agents for carrying on the work of Chriſt, and much of the unity and proſperity of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans lyeth on their hands, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 27, 35. &amp; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4. &amp; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 8, 20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 3, 5. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1. 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Yet are the Paſtors of the Church in their places Rulers or Guides of Princes and Magiſtrates: that is, we Guide them by Doctrine and Church diſcipline, as they Rule us by force. The Paſtors are the Judges of Hereſie and Vice, <hi>ad hoc</hi> thus far, ſo as to judge who ſhall be Denounced by themſelves unmeet for the Churches Communion; and Judges of ſound Doctrine ſo far as to reſolve what is by themſelves to be taught to the people: and Judges of that Magiſtrate ſo far, as to determine whether he be a fit ſubject for their Adminiſtrations and Communion. For every man is to judge when he is to act and execute (in theſe caſes;) and therefore when the Queſtion is, Who is to be tolerated or forcibly reſtrained, the Magiſtrate is the only Judge, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter but a teacher: But the Queſtion is, whom ſhould I admit or not admit to my Communion, and whom ſhould I perſwade and require the Church to avoid or to receive? Here the Paſtors are the Judges: And when the Queſtion is, Whether the Paſtor go according to Gods Word or not, here the people have <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium Diſcretionis,</hi> and cannot be forced; though they ought to obey where they ſee not ſufficient reaſon to the contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 42, 44. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 14, 15, 16.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. The honor and power of the Paſtors is for their work: And ſo great is that work, that as to fleſhly accommodations, it layeth us under abundance more trouble, then the power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor affordeth us relief from. All true Paſtors therefore ſhould be ſo far from ſtriving for Power, &amp; Greatneſs, and Rule, and extent of their Dioceſs as matters of advantage, that they ſhould ſtill look on their Power but as Power to threſh, or plough, or ſow, or reap; a Power to give alms to all the poor in the Town, to viſit all the ſick, to cure mad men that will abuſe me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch a Power to labor and ſuffer in doing good. And thus he that will be the Greateſt, but think of no other kind of greatneſs, but a
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:55445:254"/>
power to become the ſervant of all: If men had theſe true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Epiſcopal office, they would be no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in contending for power and large Dioceſſes, then now they are in contending who ſhall Inſtruct moſt of the ignorant, or go to the poor ungodly families to further their reformation; or intreat, beſeech, exhort moſt of the obſtinate from man to man; or who ſhould relieve the moſt of the poor of all the Countrey about. And if this be it they contend for, they may Rule without a Commiſſion from the Prince: Who will hinder them, that hath any fear of God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 18. to the end. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 44. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. No man is called by God to more work then he can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do, nor ſhould deſire and undertake more. And therefore if Prelates, and Councils, and Popes would but conſcionably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think them of the work, what it is, and how to be done, &amp; of what weight, and how ſtrict will be the account, and then conſider how they can do it, our differences would quickly be at end: For though godly men would put off no ſervice they can do, yet when they lookt on the undertaking of theſe Impoſſibles, they would tremble to think on it. All conſcionable men are ſenſible of their weakneſs, and the weight of the work, and ſay who is ſufficient for theſe things; And I dare ſay the ſtrongeſt of them all would feel the weight of the burden of one Pariſh, and be readyer to beg and ſeek about for help, then to contend for a a larger Dioceſs, unleſs as the meer neceſſity of the Church for want of laborers might call them to labor in other parts.

But briefly I ſhall lay down theſe few Propoſitions, implyed in thoſe expreſt before.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Let every man profeſs his belief of the Holy Scriptures in General; and in particular of all that Scripture hath expreſt to be of Neceſſity to Salvation: by denouncing death to them that have it not; And let them alſo Profeſs to conſent that God be their God, and Chriſt their Saviour, and the Holy Ghoſt their Sanctifier, and that they renounce the fleſh, the world and Devil, reſolving to live a holy life. And let this be by a credible way of Profeſſing. And all that do thus, let us
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:55445:255"/>
eſteem, love, and uſe them as Chriſtians, till they ſome way plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown this Profeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let every ſuch Baptized Profeſſor, owning alſo the Miniſtry, Church and Worſhip Ordinances, plainly required in Scripture, be a member of ſome particular Church, where he may worſhip God in the Communion of Saints.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let thoſe that make not the foreſaid Chriſtian Profeſſion, be excluded the number of Chriſtians, and thoſe that own not the Fundamentals of communion, (the Church, Miniſtry, Word, Prayer, Praiſe, Sacrament of Communion) be taken as unmeet for actual communion with us, though yet we cenſure them not to be no Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let thoſe that are obſtinate and impenitent in any Errors, contrary to the ſaid Profeſſion and Ordinances, or in actual groſs ſin, or diſcovering an ungodly heart, be rejected by the Church, after due admonition and patience.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 Let all the Paſtors Aſſociate, and hold conſtant correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency according to their neerneſs and opportunity, for helping and ſtrengthening each other, and unanimous carrying on the work of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Let theſe Aſſociations have ſtanding Preſidents, where the peace of the Church requireth it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7 Let no particular Paſtors ſet up any thing in Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip which is not Neceſſary, and may tend to make diviſions by driving tender Conſciences from his communion.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Let Aſſociations forbear making Laws to others, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing as Governours, and let them make Agreements for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Duty, and not Laws that pretend to make new duties; and let them Agree on nothing unneceſſary.</p>

Let them ſtudy Holineſs as much as Peace, and keep clean themſelves and their ſocieties as far as they can, and look at la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſuffering, and not at any other honour and power, but what is for duty; and let them look abroad and help the dark parts within their reach, and lay out themſelves freely and induſtriouſly for God, and have the chief regard to the moſt publick good.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Let him that is juſtly caſt out of one Church, be received by none into communion till he be reconciled; and if they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that he is unjuſtly caſt out, let him not be received till

                        <p n="11">11. Let thoſe that cannot hold local communion, becauſe of ſome ſmaller practical difference (as geſtures, words, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and yet agree in the foreſaid Profeſſion, and Fundamentals of Communion: yet own each other profeſſedly as Brethren, and maintain Love and communion in other reſpects.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Let all differing Chriſtians conſult and agree how to hold their differences, ſo as may leaſt prejudice the common truths which all receive, and as may leaſt hinder the ſalvation of the ungodly, or offend the weak.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Let none judge or defame each other till they are heard, and ſee they have ſufficient cauſe by certain proof: And then admoniſh them, and bring the cauſe to the Aſſociation, before they proceed further.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Let the correſpondency of Paſtors extend as far as there is Capacity, Opportunity, and need. We cannot correſpond with the Antipodes, nor much with the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> nor ſuch remote parts: there is ſeldom opportunity, and ſeldom neceſſity of actual correſpondence with forreign Nations: But yet when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick occaſions require it, (the publickeſt caſes being the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) we ſhould by Delegates or Meſſengers from ſeveral Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, perform our duties in all ſuch correſpondencies, whether in Councils or otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. If any members of our Churches travail into other parts, they ſhould take Certificates or Communicatory Letters, that they may be admitted to the communion of the Churches where they travail or abide.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. The chief conſultations for General Peace and effectual promoting the healing of the Churches, and the propagation of the Goſpel into the unbelieving parts of the world, ſhould be done by Chriſtian Princes by their Agents: and though Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are fit to be (partly) their Agents in ſuch conſultations, yet not meerly as Paſtors, but as fit men employed by their Princes. He that lives to ſee but this much reduced to practiſe, will ſee a better unity and peace in the Church, then ever was or will be attained by an earthly Head and Judge of the Univerſal Church, whether Pope or Council, or then the Agreement of the five Patriarks, and the later Primates and Metropolitans will procure. Let us be content with one Head, and one Heart;
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:55445:256"/>
and center there: but though the fingers and toes be more, we can well bear it. Take up with the Holy Scriptures as the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Rule: Let the Profeſſion of that be the mark of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: and all ſuch believers be taken to be, as they are, the Catholick Church; and no faction Schiſmatically and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly confine it to themſelves; Let this Intellectual Unity of faith, be ſeconded with a cordial Unity of Holy Love, to Chriſt and his Members: (that ſo our Unity may begin at the Head and Heart, and not perverſly at the fingers and toes of ſmaller matters, or at the hair and nails of Ceremonies and indifferent Modes;) Let this be manifeſted in Profeſſions of Love, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ownings of the Catholick Brotherhood, and of Chriſtians as Chriſtians; and by publick diſclaiming all ſelfiſhneſs, and partiality, and private Intereſts, and all reproachfull words and writings, and by actual communion as far as we can. Let the Worſhip of God be performed in ſuch holy ſimplicity that none may be driven from the ſacred Aſſemblies; and let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſuffered to go the ſame way to heaven as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did go themſelves, and lead their hearers in; Let us not be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of Church Union or Communion with thoſe that ought to be caſt out of the Church, and whom we are in Scripture commanded to avoid; but let the three attributes of <hi>[Holy Catholick,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical]</hi> be ſtill affixed to the <hi>Church;</hi> and be practically conſidered; and thoſe conſiderations iſſued in <hi>[The Communion</hi> of <hi>Saints]</hi> And then we ſhall have ſo much Unity and Peace, as may honour the Chriſtian Religion, and ſtrengthen us in the way to our <hi>Perfect Peace,</hi> which is not to be expected in this dark, diſeaſed, imperfect world. This is the way, and none but this.</p>
                        <p>But is there any hope that while men are as they are, ſuch healing Truths ſhould be received and obeyed? Yes: by here and there a man; who ſhall have the Peace of their peaceable Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Endeavours; but not by the moſt either of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or the Paſtors; let the evidence of the truth be never ſo clear. Who can expect any great ſucceſs of ſuch Propoſals, that knows the world? (till the time come when Light ſhall go forth with an abſolute reſolution to prevail.) God is one; and all that Deny <hi>themſelves</hi> and center in him, muſt needs be One: But <hi>ſelf</hi> is as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and numerous as Perſons are. And this <hi>ſelf</hi> is the Heart of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:55445:257"/>
the Natural man, and the <hi>Center</hi> of all the unſanctified. And every <hi>ſelf</hi> is a grain of <hi>Sand,</hi> thats hardly made coherent with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The <hi>Darkeſt</hi> mind, is <hi>ſelf-conceited:</hi> and the pooreſt child or beggar is <hi>ſelf-affected;</hi> and high and low, Princes and people have <hi>ſelf-intereſts,</hi> which draw them ſeveral waves. And in the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>ſelf</hi> is mortified but in part, and is the firſt living, and ſtrongeſt, and laſt dying ſin, in all; and giveth ſtrength to all the reſt. What hope then of <hi>Unity,</hi> while every man hath a numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally different <hi>Center,</hi> Principle, &amp; End, and ſo few forſake it, and devote themſelves to God the common Center, and End of the Saints? and thoſe few ſo Imperfectly; permitting <hi>ſelf</hi> to live and do ſo much within them. And though the Papiſts have deviſed a way to make this ſand into a rope; or cement innumerable <hi>ſelves</hi> together, by finding out ſuch a <hi>Carnal Head</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> where every man may find his own <hi>Carnal Intereſt</hi> involved in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> of that <hi>Head</hi> and his body; and ſo may have a carnal unity of a multitude of carnal ones to glory in; Yet Chriſt is another kind of <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Center,</hi> condemning and deſtroying carnal <hi>ſelf,</hi> and commanding all his followers upon pain of damnation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, though to nature it be the deareſt thing in the world. No wonder therefore if the number of his Adherents be few, and the unity of thoſe that center in him, be leſs conſpicuous and glorious in the world. With ſtrong <hi>Deſires</hi> therefore, but <hi>Low Expectations</hi> I propound theſe terms of Unity to the Church; as knowing how many thouſand of the <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> will not only neglect them and reject them, but riſe up againſt them (if they come into their hands) with no ſmall ſelf-conceited confidence and ſcorn.</p>
                        <p>But the Church is the Lords, who hath purchaſed it by his blood; his Intereſt in it is more then mine; &amp; it is infinitely dearer to him then to me; &amp; his wiſdom is fitteſt to diſpoſe of the ſucceſs of our endeavours, &amp; to determine of the ſeaſon and meaſures of its cure: He is the Phyſitian, and hath undertaken the work, and in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt way and time will perfect it, and be the finiſher as well as the Author of our faith. The eye of the chief Shepheard is even now upon all his ſcattered flock, and of thoſe that are given him to be ſaved, he will loſe none; he is neither inſufficient for them, nor careleſs of them; but will gather into one the Elect that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; and preſent them all pure, unblamable, and ſpotleſs to his Father at the laſt; and as much as they ſeem now to us, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55445:257"/>
divided, we ſhall then ſee them perfectly healed and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made up One Glorified Body of our Head. For that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Marriage day of the Lamb, and the Glory of the <hi>New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> we therefore Pray, and Hope, and Wait, in our paſſage through this ſinful and diſtracted world.</p>

                        <p>I Am informed from <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral parts of the Land, that ſome of my Books having lately been ſold at exceſſive rates by the Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, it is ſomewhat commonly reported that it is cauſed by my exceſſive gain, which ſay they, is at leaſt three or four hundred pounds a year. I thank the Lord that doth not only employ me in his ſervice, but alſo vouchſafe me the honor and benefit of being evil-ſpoken of for doing him the beſt ſervice that I can, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16. Bleſſed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was put to vindicate himſelf by an oath, from the infamy of a covetous deſign, which was raiſed by one godly woman, upon a diſorderly action of other men, and to that end he wrote his 225. Epiſtle. I find no call to uſe his oath; but yet I judge it my duty to imitate him in patience, and in reſcuing the ſlanderers from their ſin, that they abuſe not their ſouls by uncharitable ſurmiſes, nor their tongues by falſe reports. To which end I give them this true information: The two firſt Books I printed, I left to the Bookſellers Will; for all the reſt, I agreed with them for the fifteenth Book, to give to ſome few of my friends, hearing that ſome others agreed for the tenth. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:55445:258"/>
my fifteenth Book coming not to an hundred, and ſometime but to few more, when of Practical Books I needed ſometime 800. to give away. Becauſe I was ſcarce rich enough to buy ſo many, I agreed with the Bookſeller, (my Neighbour,) to allow 18. d. a Ream (which is not a penny a quire,) out of his own gain towards the buying of Bibles, and ſome of the practical Books which he printed, for the poor: Covenanting with him, that he ſhould ſell my Controverſal Writings as cheap, and my Practical Writings ſomewhat cheaper then books are ordinarily ſold. To this hour I never received for my ſelf one penny of mony from them for any of my Writings, to the beſt of my remembrance: but if it fell out that my part came to more than I gave my friends, I exchanged them for other Books: My accounts and memory tell me not of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>li that ever was returned for me on theſe accounts, which was on literary occaſions: ſo that my many hundreds a year is come to never a penny in all, but as aboveſaid, in ſome exchange of Books. And the price I ſet on my Books which I exchanged for theirs at the deareſt rates, is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, [Treat. of Converſion, 2. s. Treat. of Crucifying the World, 2. s. Diſput. of Juſtificat. 2. s. 4. d. The Call to the Unconverted, 8. d. Diſput. of ſaving Faith, 5. d. Of the Grotian Religion, 6. d. Directions for ſound Converſion, 1. s. 8. d. Diſput of Right to Sacraments, <hi>Edit. ſecund.</hi> 2. s. 4. d.] Theſe are all my bargains and my gains. And I choſe the honeſteſt Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers that I could meet with, according to my ſmall meaſure of wit and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; who told me, they ſtill made good their Promiſes. And now cenſorious Slanderer, tell me, what thou wouldſt have had me to have done more? If I had got Food and Rayment out of my own hard labors, had it been unlawful or diſhonourable, when Bookſellers get ſo many hundred pounds by one Book, that never ſtudied nor ſpent their time and coſt for it, as I have done? And yet doſt thou reproach me that receive not a groat? But becauſe I will not oblige my ſelf to the ſame courſe for the future, and that thou mayſt know at what rates I ſerve thee, let me tell thee, that in theſe labors early and late my body is waſted, my precious time laid out, and ſomewhat of my Eſtate, and ſomewhat of the labor of my friends. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have twenty quire of my writing well tranſcribed, under fifty pounds. And who ſhall pay for this, or maintain me in thy ſervice? I have troubled a Neighbour-Miniſter in the tedious work of tranſcribing my Characters (for ſome books,) for which, neither he nor I had ever one penny. Theſe perſonal matters are unſavory to me, and I take it for a great injury that thou putteſt upon me a neceſſity of mentioning them. But I have yielded this once to thy unrighteous importunity, that thou mayeſt hereafter learn what to believe and utter, and make more conſcience of thy cenſures and reports. And that thou mayſt have the utmoſt relief that I can procure thee for the time to come, I ſhall agree with my Bookſellers, to ſell all that I publiſh at three farthings a ſheet, and to print the price of every book at the bottom of the Title page.</p>
