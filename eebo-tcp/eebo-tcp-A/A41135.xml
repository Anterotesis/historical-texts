         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Gods glory is the end for which man

he might be ſubſervient to this end, and
obtain this happineſse, he bestowed on him a reaſonable
ſoul, conſisting of an underſtanding and a will, that by

as the eye of the ſoul to diſcern truth, the will as the feet
of the ſoul to carry it to good. The underſtanding (though
furniſhed with excellent knowledge in things naturall)
was chiefly enriched with the knowledge of God the firſt
Truth; the will (though let out to the deſire of good natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall)
was eſpecially enamored with God the chiefeſt good;
and whileſt theſe faculties continued in thoſe poſtures, man
continued in the happy and holy condition of his <hi>primaeve</hi>
creation; the corruption and miſery of the ſoul is the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the understanding, the ignorance of God; the corruption

by his fall, but their integrity; he hath an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb facs="tcp:53869:3"/>
the reparation of the ſoul is the reſetling of theſe

required, My ſon, give me thy heart, give me thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

loving and fearing me, by delighting and hoping in me.
Theſe acts of loving, fearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commonly called by the
name of <hi>Affections</hi> (I ſpeak with ſubmiſsion to better
judgements) are only the motions of the will, by which it
goeth forth to the embracing of its object which is Good;
which conſidered in the general nature is loved, conſidered
as in the fruition is delighted in; conſidered in the future
as attainable, if with eaſe, is deſired; if with difficulty, is
hoped for. If the will or theſe Affections be fixed on their
proper object, there is no danger in the exceſse; God cannot
be loved, or feared, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> overmuch; the only danger in
them, is either in miſplacing upon a wrong object, or their
looſe adhering to the right; both theſe the Apoſtle recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
Be not drunk with Wine, in which is exceſſe, but be
filled with the Spirit, Covet the best gifts. Thus Christ
invites his Church, Drink ye, be drunk, O my beloved.
This drunkenneſse, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> makes men ſober:
And this the ſubject of this enſuing Diſcourſe publiſhed
for thy benefit. Reade, conſider, pray, and the Lord give
thee underſtanding to conceive of it, and a will to conform

the affections,</hi> ſhewing the right uſe and
ordering of them, which is a thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual

will never be idle, but ſtill running out
and bringing into the ſoul, either healing
or hurtful objects, and ſo authours either of our woe or
welfare: and certain ſigns either of our happineſſe, that

—And concerning theſe the Apoſtle</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53869:5"/>
Firſt, <hi>Implies a diſeaſe</hi> and <hi>diſtemper:</hi> that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
from God, and that <hi>deſperately.</hi>
               </p>

bring them back, and place them upon their firſt and right
object, <hi>God,</hi> and things above.</p>
               <p>The firſt he intimates to us in three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By calling them <hi>inordinate affections,</hi> and ſuch as
can never be ſet right without they be mortifyed. <hi>Mortifie
your earthly members, Fornication, Vncleanneſſe, Inordinate
affection,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. He terms them inordinate and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
affections, and he commands us to mortifie them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By ſhewing they are <hi>buried in the things of
the world,</hi> and never can be raiſed up again, but only by
the power of the reſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>If ye be riſen with
Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above,</hi> ver. 1. Ye can never
be able to make your affections ſeek upwards, unleſſe ye
be riſen with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By ſuppoſing they are naturally (as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſaies of a fools wrath) as heavy as a ſtone; the affections
are ſo naturally, as heavy as a ſtone, which fals down to
the earth, and cannot aſcend, except it be heaved up: <hi>Set
your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.</hi>
They naturally ſagge downwards on things that are earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but let them not doe ſo: no, heave them up, and ſet
them upon things that are heavenly, <hi>If you be riſen with
Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words are to be conſtrued with all the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth here give, <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt,</hi>
ſeek thoſe things that are above, <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt,</hi>
ſet your affections on things that are above, <hi>If ye be riſen
with Chriſt,</hi> mortifie your earthly members, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ye be not riſen with Chriſt, it
is but a folly for me to bid you do this, ye cannot morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your affections, nor raiſe up your affections to God,
ye cannot poſſibly do this, except ye be riſen with Chriſt.
The point then is this, which I will handle by way of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</p>

of the heart. <hi>The motions of ſinne,</hi> ſaies Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 5.
that is, the affections of ſin, for ſo it is in the original: ſo
that then are a mans affections ſet upon God, when the
heart hath its out-goings to God, and therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
call the affections <hi>the feet of the ſoul:</hi> for as the
body goes with its feet to that which it loves, ſo the ſoul
goes out with its affections to that which it loves. <hi>I thought
upon my waies, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies,</hi> Pſal.
119. 59. that is, I turned mine affections to thy Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
Look to thy feet when thou comeſt into the houſe
of the Lord. I have refrained my foot from every evil
way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 101. Their feet are ſwift to ſhed bloud,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 15. The Soul hath no other way to come at that
which it loves, but only by its affections: can the muck-worm
bring his bags and his coffers to his Soul? can the
voluptuous man bring his dogges, and his hounds, and
his bowls to his Soul? No, though his Soul loves ſuch
vanities as theſe, it cannot move to them but only by its
affections,<note place="margin">L. 6 <hi>de vero cultu cap.</hi> 17. By faith Noah warned of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

draw her as it were in a Coach to the thing that ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
a man is moved by his affections. By <hi>Anger</hi> he
moves out to revenge: by <hi>Deſire</hi> he moves out to obtain:
by <hi>Love</hi> he moves out to enjoy: by <hi>Pity</hi> he moves out to
relieve: the affections are the motions of the Soul. When
the unbeleeving Jews had an affection of envy at Saint
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53869:6"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> the Text ſaies, <hi>They were moved with Envy,</hi> Act. 17. 5.
ſo the Soul of the godly is moved with affection to God.
This is the firſt thing, the affections are motions.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are motions of the Will. <hi>Stoici vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi>

<hi>motions of the will.</hi> I know <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and moſt of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
too, doe place the affections in the ſenſitive part of
the Soul, and not in the will, becauſe they are to be ſeen
in the beaſts. But this cannot be ſo, for a mans affections
do moſt ſtirre at a ſhame or diſgrace; which could not
be, if the affections were in the unreaſonable ſenſitive part:
the unreaſonable ſenſitive part of a man is not ſenſible of
credit or eſteem: call the deſires of the appetite greedy and
gluttoniſh; the appetite is ſenſeleſſe of any diſgrace, and
therefore the affections muſt needs be in the heart: the
Scripture places the affections in the heart or the will.
<hi>Being affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing.</hi> 1 Theſ.
2 8. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> couples his affections and his will together
in one, and his affection that he had to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
he ſeats in his will. How could the Apoſtle command us to
ſet our affections on God, and the things that are above,
if the affections were in the ſenſitive and unreaſonable
part? can a man make his material ſtomack to hunger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God? or the thirſt of his ſentitive appetite to thirſt
after Chriſt? alas the ſentitive part is not capable of a
command or precept. No, if the affections were only in
the ſenſitive and material part of the ſoul, then how could
they be in the Angels? the good Angels have affections,
all the eſſential parts of the affections, and ſo have the bad.
The good Angels, <hi>Which things the Angels deſire to look into,</hi>
1 <hi>Pe.</hi> 1. 12. The evil Angels or Devils, <hi>The Devils beleeve and
tremble,</hi> Jam. 2. 19. I confeſſe there be certain animal and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogical
affections that are in the ſenſe: there's grief for
torment, and fear to touch a ſerpent or a toad; delight
in meats that are pleaſant, and hatred of them that are
noyſome. But the Lord doth not call for theſe ſenſitive
paſſions to be ſeated upon him and on heaven, they are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53869:6"/>
ſeated aright as they ſtand, ſo a moderation be kept they
have no need to change objects: <hi>The affections of the heart,</hi>
theſe are the affections the Lord doth call for; the out-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the heart: as the ſenſe is afraid of a Lyon, ſo is a
godly heart afraid to ſin againſt God; as the ſenſe is joyful
to have eaſe after trouble, ſo a godly heart is joyful with a
good conſcience in Chriſt; as the ſenſe loves that which
doth feed it, ſo a godly heart loves God that doth nouriſh
it: and therefore <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> and why ſay
I them? the Scriptures ſay, the affections are motions in the
heart, <hi>Mine Eye affecteth my heart,</hi> ſaith the poor Church,
<hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 51. that is, when ſhe beheld the lamentable diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the daughters of Sion,<note place="margin">3. <hi>They are forcible motions of the heart.</hi>

pity in her heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the affections are the motions of the heart,
ſo they are the <hi>forcible motions of the heart;</hi> every little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the heart is not an affection, but only the forcible
motions of the heart; a man is then ſaid to ſet his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon God, when his heart goes with force unto God;
for as God appoints every creature his task, and to ſeek out
its own good, ſo he gives it a force for to do it; the ſtone,
its nature is to fall downwards, and God gives it a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe
that it may fall downwards with force: the ſtomack,
its nature is to take food when it is empty, and God gives
it a hunger that it may take it with force: every creature
hath not only its motion to move it to its own good, but it
goes to it with force; ſo God hath given affections to the
heart, as weight to the ſtone, and hunger to the ſtomack;
ſo God I ſay hath given affections to the heart, that it may
ſeek out its good with a force, ſo that then does a man ſet
his affections upon God, when he ſets all his forces to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
When <hi>David</hi> had given 847 millions 382 thouſand
500 pound in ſilver and gold of his own charges to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods houſe, for ſo the learned may gather out of
two Chapters in the Chronicles, you may well think he
employed all his forces thereto; but what ſaies the Text,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53869:7"/>
                  <hi>I have ſet mine affection to the houſe of God.</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 3.
Thus ye ſee when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ht ſets his affections to Gods houſe, he
put to his forces: the affections are the forcible motions
of the heart; when a childe of God praies with affection
he prayeth with force; when he <hi>ſtands for God</hi> with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he ſtands for him with force.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. They are the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart.</note> As the affections are the motions, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
motions of the will, ſo they are <hi>the ſenſible motions too.</hi>
For the will ſtirs up the inferiour faculties of the Soul, and
they ſtirre up the humours and parts of the body, to make
the greater reſiſtance to that which it diſaffects, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
embracement of that which it affects.</p>
               <p>This is one reaſon why the affections are called paſſions,
for they make the ſoul to ſuffer, and the body to ſuffer. The
affection of Joy makes the ſpleen for to ſuffer, and anger
makes the gall for to ſuffer, and fear makes the heart for
to ſuffer; yea, the affections make humours, bloud, ſpirits,
members, even bones and all the body for to ſuffer. Hence
it is, when a man ſets his affections upon God, <hi>his fear</hi> the
fear of God makes him <hi>tremble; his Love,</hi> the love of God
makes him to <hi>weep for his ſins;</hi> the <hi>ſhame</hi> of it that he ſhould
diſhonour his God, makes him to <hi>bluſh</hi> before Chriſt; <hi>Grief</hi>
for his ſins many times <hi>dries up his moiſture;</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for
his glory <hi>conſumeth his fleſh:</hi> ſo was it with the Pſalmiſt,
when he was full of affections towards God, and ſaw how
men did diſobey his Commandments, ſee what ſenſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were in him, <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with rivers of waters,
becauſe men keep not thy Law,</hi> Pſalm. 119. 139. <hi>Ezra</hi> was ſo
affectionate for God, that knowing how the people tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed,
it made the colour to come in his face, and to bluſh
before heaven, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9. 6. as <hi>Demetrius</hi> bluſht for his father
<hi>Philips</hi> offences; the Orator that pleaded King <hi>Philips</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
did not doe him ſo much ſervice, as the bluſhing of
<hi>Demetrius</hi> his ſonne. This was the effect of his affection to
his Father, it ſhewed it ſelf in his bluſhing for the offences
of his Father: Thus the affections are the ſenſible motions
of the Will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53869:7"/>
Fifthly and laſtly,<note place="margin">5. They are ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of good or evil.</note> They are ſuch ſenſible motions as are
according to <hi>the apprehenſion of good or evil.</hi> For when there
is but ſmall apprehenſion of good or evil, the affections are
weak, and may hardly work on the body at all; but when
there is a great apprehenſion of either, not only the ſoul is
<hi>deeply</hi> affected, but alſo the body is mightily compatible.
Nay, if the apprehenſion be deep indeed, the affections break
out into raptures, <hi>as dancings and leapings of the heart,</hi> which
are the raptures of joy: <hi>raviſhments and enamorings,</hi> which
are the raptures of love; <hi>meltings and bleedings, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ſpirit,</hi> which are the raptures of grief; aſtoniſhments,
amazements, which are the raptures of fear; confuſion and
the like, which are the raptures of ſhame; the affections
burſt forth into ſuch raptures as theſe, when the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
is deep.<note place="margin">Iudith 16. 9. Gen. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Olofernes</hi> his eyes were raviſht with the

Senate were affrighted with the ſight of the Carthaginian
green figges, that <hi>Cato</hi> did ſhew them: ſuch raptures have
the Saints very often in their prayers to God, being helpt
<hi>with ſighs and groans that cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have a deep apprehenſion of the corruption that
is in them. Thus ye ſee what the affections be, <hi>they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

ſhepherds boy that had taken a bird, and tyed a ſtone to

that ſo it was with men, carnal men; though perhaps
they think to flie up to God by many good purpoſes, they
are ſtill born down with their ſinnes, their affections are
clog'd, ſecurity, deadneſſe of heart, ſelf-love, and love of
the things here below, like milſtones made faſt to their
heels, their affections cannot mount up to God. Haſt thou
more affection to a game then a Sermon? more affection to
ſit drinking in Ale-houſes, then to be reproved for thy ſins?
more affection to a good booty, then a good duty? alas!
how canſt thou ſet thine affections upon God? thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are earthly affections, and therefore they cannot be
placed upon God, <hi>Rom</hi> 1. 26. there reade of <hi>vile affections.</hi>
God gave up the Heathen to baſe and vile affections: ſo
theſe are baſe and vile, and carnal affections, that thou art
given unto: thine affections are malice, and envy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which cannot be ſet upon God: they are worldly
fears, and worldly ſorrows, and worldly joys, and worldly
pleaſures, and worldly delights, theſe are thine affections,
theſe can never be placed upon God. They are vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
too baſe and diſhonourable to God. Thine affections
are lime-twig'd by Satan, they cannot ſore up unto God.
This is the firſt reaſon, why a carnal man cannot ſet his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

wings of his ſoul, are glued to the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Affectus ſunt inclinationes animae, The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are the inclinations of the Soul:</hi> as a man is affected ſo he
is inclined; and therefore the affections in Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the bent of the ſoul, <hi>My people are bent to backsliding
from me,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 7. that is, their affections to me are unſtable,
unconſtant and fickle. How ſtands ſuch a one bent? as we
ſay; that is, how ſtands he affected? A man is bent to that
which his affections are on; now then is it poſſible that a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53869:8"/>
carnal man ſhould ſet his affections on God, when his
heart does not ſtand bent unto God? the muck-worm, his
heart ſtands bent to the world, the voluptuous his heart
ſtands bent to his pleaſures; the proud man, his heart
ſtands bent to get credit and be well thought on; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man ſtands bent to be carnal and earthy, and how
can ſuch men ſet their affections on God, when their hearts
ſtand that way bent? are thy affections bent? that way
that thy bent goes, that way do thine affections go: Thou
art merry and jocond, and joyful to day, tell me what is
it for? is it becauſe God is glorified by thee? No, No, thy
mirth and thy joy ſtand otherwiſe bent. Thou haſt been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and revengeful, what was it for? was it becauſe God
is diſhonoured, and thy luſts have been violent? Alas
no, thy anger and thy wrath ſtand otherwiſe bent: thine
affections are the bent and inclinations of thy heart, and
therefore if thou be inclined to things that are earthy, thou
canſt not place thine affections upon God; nothing can go
againſt its own bent and inclination, unleſſe by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
power of the Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> knew this well
enough, that his affections could never be to God and his
righteouſneſſe, if his heart did not that way ſtand bent;
and therefore he praies God, <hi>Incline not my heart to any

the ſecond reaſon why a carnal men cannot ſet his affections
upon God, becauſe the affections of the heart are the bent
of the heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Affectus ſunt paſſiones animae,</hi> ſaies <hi>Damaſcen,
The affections are the paſſions of the Soul.</hi> When the heart is
affected with a thing, it lets in that thing, and it ſuffers
a change by that thing; when a man is affected with anger
at a wrong or an injury, we ſay he is in a paſſion; that is,
he lets in the wrong, and there does his heart bite upon the
wrong, and chafe at it; thus he is paſſionate: When a man
is affected with love to a pleaſure, he lets in the pleaſure,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53869:9"/>
and ſuffers it to prevail on the heart: now then a carnal
man cannot ſet his affections upon God nor his Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot let it in to prevail over his Soul, he will
not ſuffer it to enter; can he be in a good paſſion for God?
can he be angry and cholerick to ſee how Gods Spirit is
grieved? can he be grieved at the luſts of his heart, which
he joyes in? can he be zealous for Gods truth, and for the
beauty of holineſſe? Alas, alas! no, He cannot let in theſe
things into his heart, nor Chriſt, nor grace, nor holineſſe,
nor humility, nor ſelf-denyal, nor any ſaving grace that is
Chriſts, can get entrance into his heart; and therefore he
cannot ſet his affections upon God. When the Apoſtle had
exhorted the Hebrews, and now was concluding, that he
could exhort them no further, he concludes on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<hi>And I beſeech you brethren, ſuffer the word of exhort ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Heb. 13. 22. He labours to work on their affections, that
they would let in his exhortations into their hearts, he
does not ſay, Suffer me to exhort you, for he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them already, and had taken their leave, but ſuffer
it to enter into your hearts; now if you be carnal, thou
wilt never ſuffer Gods counſels to enter; you will never
ſuffer the word of reproof, neither will ye ſuffer a reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Suppoſe we ſhould pull down all the unneſſary Ale-houſes
in the Pariſh, would ye ſuffer it? Suppoſe we ſhould
root out all your game-houſes and the like, would ye ſuffer
it? Suppoſe we ſhould make every man pay his 12. pence
a day for every time he is abſent from Church, and have
all diſorders puniſht in the Town, would ye ſuffer it? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
we ſhould come to your houſes and exhort you, and
reprove you, and tell you of your ſins, and labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you and your families, alas! would ye ſuffer it? No,
your paſſions will riſe, ye would be ſo farre from affecting
theſe things, as that your affections would be againſt them,
nay, ye would be in paſſion againſt me; carnal hearts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſet their affections upon God, why? becauſe the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are paſſions, as I have proved already, and the ſoul
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53869:9"/>
doth ſuffer its affections. The affections do alter the heart,
but a carnal heart will not be altered by the word, nor by
Chriſt; nor ſuffer his graces to enter.</p>

ſunt perturbationes animae, The affections are the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Soul;</hi> if once they go wrong, and the reins be

to carry her whether ſhe would not; they are the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of judgement, and violent tyrants over the ſoul, they
make a man walk as they liſt; and therefore the Apoſtle
cals them, <hi>the luſts of concupiſcence, wherein a man walks,</hi>
1 Theſ. 4. 5. in the original it is <hi>the affections of concupiſcence,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note>
they are cruel and maſterleſſe miſleaders of a man; now a
carnal man, his affections are ſuch, they are diſturbances
and perturbations unto him, they will ſo trouble him, and
toſſe him up and down, from luſt unto luſt, from ſin unto
ſinne, that he ſhall never be able that is carnal, to ſet them
upon God. <hi>Iambiychus</hi> cals them the nayls of the ſoul,
whereby it's nayled to the things of the body; would a
carnal man repent? alas! his affections diſturb him; would
he pray and hold out in that duty? his affections are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
to be otherwiſe occupyed; would he exhort and
reprove, and be rebuking his neighbour for ſinning againſt
God? his affections they are againſt it, he is aſhamed for
to doe it, he is afraid he ſhall have a flout for his labour;
would he forſake his coveteouſneſſe and drunkenneſſe and
company? O his affections are ſo ſtrong to them, that he
is not able to draw his heart from them. The very Heathen
brings in all the world thus ſpeaking of themſelves, <hi>nitimur
in vetitum ſemper cupimuſquè negata,</hi> ſo headſtrong are the
affections when they are wrong: as <hi>Medea</hi> in the Poet, <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo
meliora proboque,</hi> ſhe ſaw the good and ſhe liked the
good, but her affections tranſported her quite to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
thus it was with <hi>Herod</hi> the king: when he heard
there was another king of the Jews born in the world, and
that Wiſe men from the Eaſt were come for to doe homage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53869:10"/>
to that new King; the Text ſayes, <hi>he was troubled,</hi> Matth.
2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. fear and ſhame, and grief, and vexation, and all his
affections, they were all up in arms, and would not let
him be quiet: they troubled him, ſaies S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew.</hi> Yea,
they made ſuch a diſturbance in <hi>Herod,</hi> they did ſo baffle
his judgement, and buſie his thoughts, and torture his
minde, that they drove him to murther God knows how
many ſcores of poor Infants: before they would be quiet,
they made him a mad man. Thus the affections are grievous
perturbations, when they are once come to be miſ-placed;
and if they be ſuch perturbations as they are, alas! how can
a carnal man ſet his affections upon God? they are maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
wilde horſes, and he cannot ſubdue them: they are
bedlams and frantick miſleaders, and he cannot overcome
them: they are deſperate things, his affections are ſo giddy
and unruly, that he can never be Chriſts, as long as his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are alive; unleſſe they be ſet upon the tenters, and
put upon the wreck, and tamed perforce, they will never
be right: and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Thoſe that are
Christs have crucifyed the fleſh, with the affections and lusts,</hi>
Gal. 5. 24. Thoſe that are Chriſts have done ſo, or elſe they
could never be Chriſts, becauſe the affections are perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and diſturbances, moſt woful perturbations they are.
And this is a fourth reaſon why a carnal man cannot ſet his
affections upon God, becauſe his affections are perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and like a company of wilde horſes, that will not be
ruled.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus I have ſhewn you Firſt, what the affections
be: Secondly, how a carnal man cannot ſet his
affections upon God. But here it may be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Cannot a carnal man have good affections
to God and to grace? The people were ſo affected with
<hi>Iohns</hi> preaching, and with his baptiſm, that they would
have been angry and zealouſly affected againſt that man,
whoever he was that ſhould have ſaid it was not of God;
they would have ſtoned ſuch an one to death, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 6.
the people moſt of them were carnal, yet they were thus
affected with his preaching. Certainly a carnal mans affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may be marvellouſly wrought on. For the clearing
of this doubt: Let me ſhew you nine degrees, wherein the
affections may be wrought on: in five of them, a carnal
man may have his affections to be wrought on, and in the
laſt four of them he cannot. Firſt, I will name you theſe
nine degrees of the affections of the heart.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">1. The heart is enticed and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them.</note> when they are ſo farre wrought on, that <hi>the
heart is enticed and allured much by them.</hi> Thus the eloquent
Miniſters in <hi>Corinth,</hi> it ſeems they wrought upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
affections exceedingly, their words were ſo drawing,
and their ſpeech was ſo inticing, that they came flocking
to them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth he would not preach ſo, <hi>with
the enticing words of mens wiſedom,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. what good
ſhould I do, if my preaching were ſuch? it's true I might
allure you and move you, and entice you, and ſtirre your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53869:11"/>
affections; but alas! this would never bring you to faith
and repentance with power: this might tickle your hearts
peradventure a little, but not ſoundly comfort you.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, when the affections are wrought on ſo far,
that <hi>the heart is ſomewhat touched therewith.</hi> As a man when
his affections are moved with any, at a diſgraceful word, he
ſaith, this toucheth me indeed. When God turned the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto <hi>Saul,</hi> indeed ſome of them had no
affection to <hi>Saul, How ſhall this man ſave us?</hi> ſay they, they
deſpiſed him in their hearts, but God turned the affections
of the reſt upon <hi>Saul,</hi> for to follow him: The Text ſaies
of them, <hi>The Lord hath touched their hearts,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 26.
That is, he ſet their affections upon <hi>Saul,</hi> that they might
follow <hi>Saul</hi> up and down. As when the Needle is touched
with the Loadſtone, then it will turn it ſelf preſently to the
North; their affections were touched, and therefore they
followed after <hi>Saul.</hi> So many men, their affections are
touched at a Sermon; their affections are not only allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but receive a touch from the Word: there is ſome
vertue goes out of the Word, as ſome went from Chriſt to
the Woman that had but a touch of his garment; ſo their
affections have but a touch from the Word, and ſome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
goes to them, for the affections are termed the touch
of the heart. <hi>It's good for a man not to touch a woman,</hi>
1 Cor. 7. 1. That is, not to ſet an amorous affection of the
heart upon a woman Thus farre a wicked mans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may be to the Word, they may be touched by the
Word.</p>
               <p>The third is,<note place="margin">3. The heart is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bowed by them.</note> When the affections are wrought on ſo far,
<hi>That the heart is ſomewhat bowed thereby;</hi> this is another
degree of working on the affections, to bow the affections,
as ye may reade; <hi>David bowed the heart of all the men of
Iudah, even as the heart of one man,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 14. that is,
by his kinde ſpeeches, and friendly meſſage he ſent, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
and bowed their affections unto him. So a wicked
man may have his affections bowed unto good, whereas
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53869:11"/>
his affections ſtood ſturdy before, or may be they were
bowed another way before, now they be bowed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
as wicked <hi>Ioabs</hi> affections were ſo bowed to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and for the good of his Church, that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to die in his defence. <hi>Be of good courage</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>let
us play the men, for our people and the cities of our God; and the
Lord doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> 2 Sam. 10. 12. See how he
rowzes up his valour, and his generous affections to fight
for his God, his affections were ſomewhat bowed unto
God, and yet he was a wicked man.</p>
               <p>The fourth is,<note place="margin">4. The heart is ſtolen away with them.</note> The affections may be wrought on ſo far,
that <hi>the heart may be ſtolen away with them:</hi> this you may
finde in the ſtory of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> who with his beauty and the
properneſſe of his perſon, and the flattery of his lips, and
his courteous complement with the people of the land, he
did ſo winne their affections, that the Text ſaies, <hi>He ſtole
the hearts of the men of Iſrael.</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 6. So grace is ſo
beautiful, and the Word of God hath ſuch kinde promiſes
and kinde ſpeeches with it, not complemental, as <hi>Abſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ms,</hi>
but real and truly amiable, that it may ſteal the affections
of a carnal man, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtole from the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
and they knew not how, ſo grace may ſteal thine affections
and take them with its beauty, and yet thou be a wicked
man for all that. As <hi>Paul</hi> with his preaching did ſo ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the affections and the hearts of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that
for a need they <hi>would have pluckt out their eyes and given
them to Paul,</hi> they were ſo ſtrongly affected with him, and
the Goſpel he taught them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 15. Nevertheleſſe Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſayes they were <hi>fooliſh and carnal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth is,<note place="margin">4. The heart is enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them.</note> The affections may be wrought on ſo farre,
that the heart may be hot and inflamed by them. That
this is another degree of the affections, you may gather
from the <hi>avenger of bloud;</hi> when any had unwittingly and
unwillingly killed his brother, the Lord commands him <hi>to
fly quickly to a City of refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt the avenger of bloud ſhould
kill him in fury and anger.</hi> The words go thus, <hi>leſt the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53869:12"/>
of bloud purſue the ſlayer, while his heart is hot,</hi> Deu. 16 6.
While his heart is hot, that is while he is in the heat of his
paſſion, while his anger and the affections of revenge are
hot: the affections may be raiſed ſo high, that they may
ſet the heart in a heat upon a thing which it affects, So a
carnal man may have his affections heated and inflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and towards grace. <hi>Saul</hi> had a great zeal to
Gods Church, 2 <hi>Sam. 21. 2. Iehu</hi> was zealous for God, <hi>Come
with me</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>and ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> 2 Kin 10. 16.
Zeal is the heat of all the affections, and therefore <hi>Iehu</hi> was
heated in all his affections for God; his affections were hot
to root out Idolaters, his affections were hot to cut off
Gods enemies, and to reform abundance of ſinful abuſes
in the Kingdom: he was zealous, his affections were heated
towards God, and yet <hi>Iehu</hi> was no better then a carnal man
for all that. Thus farre may a carnal mans affections be
wrought on for grace; and this is no argument that he hath
ſet his affections upon God as ſhall afterwards appear.
Therefore there be four further degrees which are only to
be found in the godly.</p>
               <p>The ſixth then is,<note place="margin">6. The heart is overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from what it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</note> The affections may be wrought on ſo
far, that the heart is <hi>quite overturned from that it was before;</hi>
I ſay the affections may be wrought on ſo far, that the heart
may be turned upſide down by them. So it was with the
godly; they were even overwhelmed in affections for God
with the fear of the Lord, and their hearts turned upſide
down with grief for their ſinnes, <hi>Behold O Lord, for I am in
diſtreſſe, my bowels are troubled, my heart is turned within me,
for I have grievouſly rebelled,</hi> Lam. 1. 20. Her ſoul was even
battered with affections of repentance and humiliation; her
ſoul was diſtreſſed with terrours; her bowels were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and contracted with fears, and her heart was turned
upſide down with ſorrows, and all for her ſins, for I have
grievouſly rebelled, ſaies ſhe. No wicked man under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had his affections ever ſo wrought on, that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
upon it. As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaies of his birth,<note place="margin">Job. 10. 10</note> 
                  <hi>He was curdled like
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53869:12"/>
Cheeſe:</hi> ſo here in the ſecond birth, her heart was curdled
like Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My heart is turned in me, ſaies ſhe. This
is a higher working on the affections, then any carnal man
hath.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh is,<note place="margin">7. The heart is engaged for God.</note> The affections may be wrought on ſo
far, <hi>that the heart be engaged for God.</hi> As a womans affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards a man may be ſo deep, as that ſhe engageth
her heart unto that man, and reſolves to have none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
husband but him. So when the affections are ſo deep
in love with grace and with Chriſt, that the heart is once
engaged for Chriſt, to be a widow for ever, unleſſe he will
be pleaſed to count her his Spouſe: the world ſhall never
have her heart more, the fleſh ſhall never have her heart
more, nor devil, nor luſt, nor any other ſin ſhall ever have
her heart more, ſhe is ſo farre in love and affection with
Chriſt, as her heart is engaged for Chriſt, this is a godly
ſoul. <hi>Who is this that engageth his heart to approach unto me?</hi>
ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 21. If pleaſure come, ſaying, ſet thine
affections on me; no, ſaies the heart, mine affections are
engaged already; if her old luſts, and her old lovers, and
her old acquaintance come, ſaying, ſet your affections on
us; no, ſaies the heart, I am engaged for another, even for
Chriſt and his graces: this is a deep working on the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
indeed, when they are engaged for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The eighth is,<note place="margin">8. The heart is glued to a thing by them. <hi>De vita Pythag.</hi>
                  </note> The affections may be wrought on ſo far,
<hi>that the heart may be glued to a thing by them. Iamblychus</hi> the
heathen hath a pretty phraſe to this purpoſe: a wicked man
he cals him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, bound in and nayled
in his affections, he is even nayled and glued to the things
of the world, his heart does even ſtick to them like pitch
and Tarr to the Ship. So it is with a godly ſoul, his heart
ſticks faſt unto Chriſt, and the commandments of Chriſt.
<hi>I have ſtuck unto thy Teſtimonies,</hi> ſaies <hi>David</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi>
119. 31. How came his heart to ſtick to Chriſts teſtimonies?
His holy affections were the glue, his affections clave to
Gods Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53869:13"/>
The ninth is,<note place="margin">The heart is quite given up to that which it affects.</note> The affections may be wrought on ſo far,
that the <hi>heart may be quite given up to the thing which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Solomon</hi> had ſuch affections to wiſedom that <hi>he gave
his heart to ſeek it,</hi> Eccl. 1. 13. As we uſe to ſay, he hath my
heart, what can he have more? all mine affections are ſet
on him, if he have my heart and all. So a godly heart is ſo
deeply affected with Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, as that
Chriſt hath his very heart and all. He gives up all that he
hath unto Chriſt. It's true, no wicked man in the earth
hath his affections thus farre wrought on: but it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to think how far a mans affections may be wrought on
for Chriſt,<note place="margin">The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be thus raiſed.</note> and yet be a carnal man. It's proved already, he
cannot ſet his affections on Chriſt, but he may raiſe up
his affections a good way towards Chriſt, and now I will
prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. By the ſparks of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that regulate the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>the ignicles and embers of right reaſon,</hi> that God hath
made natural to his heart, may regulate his affections to be
chaſt, and ſober, and kinde, and liberal, and juſt, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
humble, and patient, and merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to obſerve
the things contained in the Law. Natural reaſon directs
men to love their parents and their children, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
thus the very Heathen themſelves guided their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with Religion as it were, the vertues of morality
ſaies <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they doe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, They
finde out a <hi>Medium</hi> or a golden mean in the affections,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. Eth. cap 6.</note> and
hold them unto it. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> knoweth thus
much, and how that ſome of the Heathen were ſo wicked,
that they would put out the light of their own reaſon, and
be drunk and luſtful, and proud, and mercileſſe, and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to parents, he condemns them eſpecially for this,
that they were without underſtanding, and <hi>without natural
affection,</hi> Rom. 1 31. that is, becauſe they put out that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
reaſon, and that natural affection that were in them.
Becauſe their affections might have been naturally ſet upon
thoſe things. Their very natural reaſon might have ruled
their affections, and ſet them upon vertues of morality. So
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53869:13"/>
that thus farre thou maiſt go, and yet be a carnaliſt, thine
affections may run to be civil, and morally honeſt, and the
like natural reaſon may raiſe up thine affections from drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
and luſt, and from natural injuſtice, and from
ſwearing and lying, and filthineſſe of ſpeaking, and the like.
I ſay, natural reaſon may raiſe up thine affections from
theſe. Indeed it may be thine affections are violent and
greedy, and ſenſual to tempt thee to ſome of theſe ſinnes,
but natural reaſon may take them off from ſuch ſinnes as
theſe. Are thine affections ſo vile as to follow thy blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
and thy company-keeping? we need not quote Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to convince thee: thy material ſtomack cries out it
is a ſinne, for it grumbles at it. Thine eyes and thy legges,
and thy heels cry out, its a ſinne; for they doe betray it.
Look upon thy purſe, it cries againſt thee, for it thou haſt
emptied. Look upon thy Children, and thy Wife, they cry
againſt it, for them thou haſt beggard. Look upon thy
fields and thy land, and thy inheritance, they cry againſt it,
for them thou haſt morgaged and impaired. Look upon
the ſtinking dunghil, it bids thee hold thy noſtrils at the
ſtinkingneſſe of this ſinne, for there is thy ſpewing and thy
vomiting, and ſo of the reſt of theſe ſinnes: natural reaſon
may eaſily raiſe up thine affections from theſe. Which if
thou haſt done already, and art civil and moral, thou art
yet gone no further then a Naturian may go. Thou maiſt do
that, and yet be a Carnaliſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. By know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge out of the word that raiſeth up the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Becauſe thou haſt more means then the means
of bare nature, <hi>thy knowledge out of the Word, may raiſe up
thy affections exceedingly:</hi> knowledge may awe the heart,
and move it with the affection <hi>of fears,</hi> that it go not againſt
its own knowledge. <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>Iohn, knowing that he was
a juſt man.</hi> Mar. 6. 20. <hi>Herod</hi> his affection was ſtirred with
fear at the hearing of <hi>Iohn;</hi> why? he knew he was a good
man, and he knew it was juſt as he preached; he knew it
was God Word. And therefore he feared, not to obey him,
he was afraid to go againſt him. Nay, his affections were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53869:14"/>
more raiſed then ſo; <hi>he heard</hi> John <hi>gladly and did many
things.</hi> He was affected with joy at his Sermons, and his
affections were wrought on to break out into act, and to
doe many things. I do not reade he ſtruck at any thing but
only his darling corruption. His affections were ſo wrought
on, that it ſhould ſeem he reformed many ſins in his Court
and many of his Courtiers; he began to ſet up ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God in his Palace. All this was by reaſon of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
he knew <hi>Iohn</hi> was a good Preacher, he knew he
preached the truth, and the truth overpowred his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now he had no ſuch elbow-room for to ſinne, as he
had in his ignorance. Now he fears to do many ſinnes that
before he feared not, why? becauſe his knowledge was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned.
This is no argument that thou art a childe of
God, becauſe thou reformeſt many things: Alas thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is convinced thou muſt ſo: the very devil himſelf was
overpowred by his knowledge; when the devil knew Chriſt

feareſt to go flatly againſt the Sermons thou heareſt, thou
feareſt to live ſo bad as thou didſt; happily thou rejoyceſt
to hear the Bell ring to a Sermon, and art glad to hear the
preaching of a Miniſter; happily thine affections are ſo
wrought on, that thou art moved to do many things, not
to ſuffer ſuch potting and cupping in thy houſe as thou u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt,
not to endure ſuch diſorders in thy family as thou
wert wont; alas! alas! this is good yet; and O that others
were proficients thus farre, this is further then many doe
go, but this thou mayſt doe, and yet be a Carnaliſt. Thou
knoweſt this is the truth of God, and this ſtirres thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
a little.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. By know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience quickned.</note> God may be, he hath <hi>quickned thy knowledge</hi> a
little, and <hi>quickned thy conſcience,</hi> and made it tell thee the
horrour of thy ſins, and this may raiſe up thine affections
many ſteps higher; not only to mourn for thy ſinnes, and
be full of the affections of ſorrow, but alſo to goe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

down his looks, he went ſadly and ſoftly up and down as
he went. Thus farre too thou maiſt go in raiſing thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and yet be a Carnaliſt. Thou maiſt be ſmitten in
thy ſoul for thy ſins, as to go ſoftly and ſadly, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
up and down, to have little luſt to eat thy meat for
thinking of thy ſinnes, to go poorly and meanly, and have
little minde to go bravely: I ſay, thine affections may be
ſo quickned, as to go ſadly all along as thou goeſt, ſo that
all that knew thee before may wonder; good Lord, what
ails yonder man, how is he changed? he was a Ruffian, a
Royſter, and who but he the other day? what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <note place="margin">4. By a deep apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the horrour of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> this may winde up thine affections many ſteps high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
thou mayſt be afraid to be damned, and afraid of the
judgements of God, and this may fetch tears from thine
eyes, ſighs and groans from thy heart. This may even melt
thy affections into weepings, and abundance of weepings
for the ſinnes thou haſt done, and yet be a Carnaliſt. The
Prophet brings in the carnal <hi>Iews</hi> ſo doing, <hi>This have you

No natural affection can poſſibly be raiſed uphigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
then ſelf-love may. S. <hi>Paul</hi> being to reckon up all the
ſinne-ful affections of men in theſe laſt daies, he names ſelf-love
for the foremoſt. In the laſt daies <hi>perillous times ſhall

names eighteen more, but this he places in the front of the

cite this text only to ſhew how our affections may be raiſed
to God, namely, as high as ever ſelf-love can clamber.
Self-love will make a man be very affectionate. When a
man knows he cannot be ſaved, unleſſe he doe thus and
thus; O how affectionate may he be for to do it, when he
knows he ſhall periſh for ever, if he be not religious and
godly; if he do not bewail his iniquities and ſtrive againſt
ſin, and labour to do good unto others: how marvellous full
of affections may this make him to be, to doe abundance of
things!</p>

6. 23. Theſe ſubſequent circumſtances ſhew how unwilling
he was in the puniſhment of committing the ſin, if he could
have helpt it, and ſaved his honour with his Lords and

a wretched man for all that. Men imagine they have a good

thou repenteſt no more; thou mayſt be loth to commit an

commandment of God for a handful of Barley, yet he
though a Reprobate, durſt not go beyond the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

hearkned to carnal arguments, he might have found many.
The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are a people of another Nation. I am a <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi>
and they are of another generation: and what though
they be better people then they, yet I am a Subject to the
King of <hi>Moab,</hi> and I muſt be true to my Soveraign, and
count them mine enemies which are the enemies of my
Countrey, and are come to lick up the land. If I do obey
my King, I may have money by houſefuls, I may have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
as much and more then I can wiſh. Thus fleſh and
bloud might have reaſoned; but ſee how his affections
were better rectifyed then thus; he durſt not doe it upon
any terms, becauſe it was againſt the commandment of
God. Thou thinkeſt thy cauſe to be happy, O thou cauſt

certainly mine affections are to God and to grace. I
might get this, and I might get that, if I would but goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my conſcience a little, but I will not for money, nor

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53869:18"/>
ſet upon God. The Apoſtle does not ſay, let the things that
are above work on your affections, for ſo they may do, and
ye be carnal for all that; but he ſaies, <hi>Set your affections on
things which are above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be four reaſons to prove,<note place="margin">Reaſons 4.</note> though a carnal mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
be ſo wrought on as ye have heard, that they are
not rightly wrought on.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mans affections are not kindely wrought on.</note> Becauſe <hi>they are not kindely wrought on.</hi> They are
chafed and heated very much, but they are not kindely
wrought on. The affections muſt be kindely wrought on,
otherwiſe they are not wrought on aright; they may be
violently and paſſionately wrought on, there may be a great
deal of pudder wrought in the affections, but never are they
rightly wrought on, unleſſe they be wrought upon kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Be kindely affectioned one to another with brotherly love,</hi>
ſaies S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 12. 10. The <hi>Galatians</hi> that would have
pluckt out their eyes for Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they were ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but they were not kindely affected.
If they had been kindely affected with him or his Doctrine,
they would not have hearkned to falſe Apoſtles, as they did.
A carnal man, natural reaſon, and knowledge out of the
Word may work on his affections, his conſcience, and ſelf-love,
whereby he is loth to be damned, and glad to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when he dies, theſe may work on his affections, and
cauſe him to weep for his ſins, and give over many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to be ſtrongly affected, but alas he is not kindely
affected. It's only the love of God ſhed abroad in the heart
that kindely affects one. But it's ſelf-love, and not love
of the Lord Jeſus that affects him: he is not kindely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. They are not judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly wrought on.</note> A carnal mans affections are not <hi>judiciouſly
wrought on.</hi> They are wrought on in a fit at it, but they
are not wrought on with judgement, they have not the true
beginning of working, which is ſound judgement. S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
ſaies of the affections of Chriſt, <hi>reſpectu Chriſti ſemper
ſequuntur rationem,</hi> Chriſts affections had alwaies the right
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53869:18"/>
beginning, which was true reaſon and judgement. And
therefore S. <hi>Matthew</hi> notes eſpecially the beginning of his
ſorrow, <hi>He began to be ſorrowful and very heavy,</hi> Mat. 26. 37.
He had a right beginning of it. The natural beginning of
the affections is this, when the judgement is firſt poyſed,
and the heart is firſt fired, this is the natural beginning of
the affections. So that the heart muſt firſt be wrought on,
and the ſpirit moved, before the affections can be judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
wronght on. And therefore ſaies S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chriſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſelf. <hi>He groaned in ſpirit, and he troubled himſelf,</hi>
Joh. 11. 33. He was exceedingly affected with ſorrow for
<hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, and his kinsfolks ſorrows and diſtruſts
they were in, and he troubled himſelf: we tranſlate it, he was
troubled, but in the original it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himſelf, his own judgement, and his ſpirit, and his heart
ſtirred up his affections to be troubled. His affections were
wrought on judiciouſly. A carnal mans affections though
they be much wrought on, yet they are not wrought on
judiciouſly. Now he is in the minde to be ſtrict and to be
godly, now he weeps and takes on, can ye wonder? his
conſcience now jerks him, and is quick: but when a few
tears and a few labours and endeavours that way have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
his conſcience, as his conſcience is apt to be ſatisfied,
the man is of another judgement then quickly. He is of the
judgement then, tuſh, what need I be ſo ſtrict and preciſe?
Thus he is affected, not upon ſound judgement. Affected
he is, and ſtrongly affected too for the while, but he is not
affected judiciouſly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. They are not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly wrought on.</note> A carnal mans affections are <hi>not wrought upon
regularly.</hi> His affections may be are wrought upon by Gods
juſtice and judgements, becauſe God is a conſuming fire
againſt ſin, becauſe God is ſevere againſt the works of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
becauſe he hath made heaven-gate to be ſtraight.
Theſe are the grounds of his work. His affections are
wrought upon this way; therefore he weeps, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he praies, and therefore he reforms, and therefore he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53869:19"/>
is affected. But this is not regular affection: he is affected
with fear, but it is not the fear of Gods goodneſſe, not
Gods mercy and goodneſſe, were there no other attribute
in God, he might look long enough, before he would fear
his mercy: that's a ground of preſumption to him, but he
fears Gods judgements and his juſtice; he doth not trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and quake to conſider that God is a merciful God, and
a good God whom he hath ſinned againſt. The true <hi>Iſrael</hi>
of God, <hi>They fear the Lord and his goodneſſe,</hi> Hoſ. 3. 5. their
affections are regular, they are affected with fear of Gods
goodneſſe. But a carnall man is not affected with the
fear of Gods goodneſſe. He is affected with the fear
of Gods juſtice, his affections are wrought on irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. They are not wrought on uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally.</note> A carnal mans affections are not <hi>wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
univerſally.</hi> Some affections are wrought on, and others
are not. No, he hath a contradiction of affections. He hath
ſome good affections to God and to grace, and he hath ſome
affections that are contradictory to theſe. Some ſinnes he
grieves under, ſome he is glad under; ſome commandments
he delights to be doing, and ſome he delights to be break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I do not mean part fleſh, and part ſpirit, for ſo the beſt
godly ſouls under Heaven have a contradiction of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
they have ſome affections of the ſpirit, and ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the fleſh, contradicting and oppoſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I do not mean this. But a carnal man hath ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of affections, as that his carnal affections give
the other the lye. He is affected with ſorrow for his ſinnes,
but he is not troubled for his uſury. He is affected with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to leave his ſins, but not to leave his ſinful dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
As <hi>Eſau,</hi> he was affected with weeping for his miſſing
of grace and the bleſſing, but not for his pleaſures and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
delight. Is not this a contradiction of affections! <hi>He
found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with
tears,</hi> Heb. 12. 17. He was affected with weeping after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſaies the Text.</note>
but he could finde no place to beſtow it in. There
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53869:19"/>
was not elbow-room enough for repentance in his heart.
He made ſome room in ſome part of his heart for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but not in all. He found place for it in ſome of his
affections, but not in all. He is affected, but he is not
affected univerſally. He hath a contradiction of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his ſoul; ſo that a carnal mans affections, though
they be wrought on, they are not wrought upon univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally.</p>

therefore thou liveſt in heaven, if thou beeſt truly affected
with heavenly things: he that is truly affected with grace,
is moſt affected with the fountain of grace, which is God.
God is the fountain of all grace, and if thou beeſt affected
with it, thou art chiefly affected with God. Alas! thou
mayſt have a good memory, a good wit, and good parts,
and be affected with them, and rejoyce that thou haſt them.
But all the queſtion is this, art thou affected with God the
fountain of grace? a wicked man may be affected with grace

it affects him well enough to have ſome, but he does

<hi>Philo,</hi> The affections are the womanhood of the ſoul, he
will never marry her, if ſhe be nor a woman for him, much
leſſe will he marry her, if ſhe be not a woman at all, he will
not have a man for his wife, ſhe ſhall be a woman certainly,
if he ever mean for to marry her; ſhe is not marriageable,
but only for her affection; what a miſerable ſoul then is
thy ſoul, if thy affections be not right? thou art not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riageable
to Chriſt. This is the rule of all wives and of all
Spouſes, <hi>thy deſire ſhall be to thy huſband,</hi> Gen. 3. 16. Thine

is a monſter in nature that will have a wife, whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that thy ſoul ſhould be married to him, when thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is foreſtalled? If thine affections be to the world,
and to the ſtrumpet-like things of the world, Chriſt cannot
abide thee. <hi>Knoweſt thou not that the love of the world is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with God?</hi> Out thou filthy ſtrumpet-like ſoul, betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
thou thine affections to the world, and yet hopeſt to
be married to Chriſt? thou art not marriageable to him: if
gains and pleaſures and vanities, and ſuch like baſe para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
be welcomed to thy heart, thou canſt not be married
unto Chriſt, thou art the worlds Spouſe and the devils
Spouſe, when thine affections be inordinate. Uncleanneſſe
and inordinate affection, the Apoſtle puts them together,
<hi>Mortifie your members which are on the earth, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
inordinate affection,</hi> Col. 3. 5. So that thy ſoul is a
filthy and an unclean ſoul, that haſt theſe inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
unmortified in thee, thy ſoul is a fit Spouſe for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean

you to have your affections ſet right,<note place="margin">2. Hereby only doth the ſoul ſet favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites in the heart.</note> becauſe thereby
only are ye marriageable to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby only doth the ſoul ſet up favourites in her
heart:</hi> thoſe are the hearts favourites whom the heart moſt
affects. Now if Chriſt be not thy hearts favourite, what a
woful condition art thou in? It hath been the undoing of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53869:22"/>
many a Prince, the having of ill favourites; and that ſoul
muſt needs be for ever undone, that hath ill favorites in her
heart. As ſoon as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in favour with the Keeper of
the priſon, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> preſently had all at command, nothing
was done but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was the doer of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21. He
was no ſooner in favour but he was <hi>Dominus fac totum,</hi> as
we ſay; he ruled all then. Look what thy heart does af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that is in favour with thy heart; that is <hi>dominus fac
totum.</hi> If thy pleaſures and thy vanities be once in favour
with thy heart, Chriſt can have no command of thy heart,
no further then thy luſts will give leave: thou canſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any thing that is amiſs, no further then thy luſts will
give leave: wouldſt thou repent, or ſtand for Gods glory?
thou canſt not unleſs thy luſts do give leave: wouldſt thou
be reproved, or well counſelled? thou canſt not unleſs thy
luſts will give leave: as long as thy luſts are in favour with
thy heart, they govern all, they command all, thy minde goes
as they tend, thy thoughts come as they call, thy courſes are
as they will. <hi>I will give this people favour in the ſight of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
and they ſhall ſpoil the Egyptians,</hi> Exo. 3. 21, 22. When
they were once in favour with them, they might ſpoil them,
and rob them, and borrow Jewels of them, and never
pay them again; they might do any thing, when they were
in favour with them. O the miſery of the ſoul, when the
world, or pleaſure, or ſinne, or the like are in favour with
it, they ſpoil it, and rob it, and bereave it of all the jewels
it hath; Chriſt can doe nothing to any purpoſe with that
ſoul, that favours other things beſides Chriſt. Now if thine
affections be not ſet right, thy favour is not right ſet: this
is the reaſon why thou art wedded to the world, and wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to thy luſts, that thine affections cannot be unto Chriſt.
When <hi>Hadad</hi> had great favour with <hi>Pharoah, Pharaoh</hi> even
married his own wives ſiſter unto <hi>Hadad,</hi> 1 Kin. 11. 19. He
made him his brother, he brought him into the neareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

if thou favoureſt the things of this life, thou weddeſt thy

affections are they whereby a man is mutable. For though
it be a weakneſſe to be mutable, yet when a man is evil and
wicked, it's a bleſſed weakneſs that he is mutable from that
wickedneſſe. Now if a man be grievouſly ſet upon miſchief,
though he be an enemy of all grace and of goodneſſe, yet
as long as there be any affections left in him, he is not an
implacable enemy: no, his affections are a poſſible ſubject to
be wrought on, the Word and the Spirit may perſwade him;
and therefore what a care ſhould we have of our affections,
becauſe thereby we are placable and reconcilable to God?
The Apoſtle yokes theſe two together, <hi>without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
implacable,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. for a man as long as he hath
any natural affection left, he is never implacable: ſtill he
may be perſwaded, unleſſe he degenerate in his affections,
and prove to be unnatural: if the affections depend on this
faſhion, he is not only wicked and an enemy to grace, but
he is an implacable enemy: think then what wrong ye do
to your own ſouls, ſo unnaturally to ſet your affections, to
let them degenerate as you do, and wander after vanity.
Beware how ye doe ſo, ye goe about to divert all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility

Sonne.</p>

Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the hands of the ſoul.</note> It may appear how infinitely it ſtands you in
hand to ſet your affections aright, <hi>becauſe the affections are
the hands of your ſouls.</hi> Ye cannot take hold of any thing in
the world to doe you any good, but by your affections. For
as hands are to the body, ſo the affections are to the ſoul.
Will a man be ſo mad as to put his hand and his fingers out
of joynt? alas! he cannot take hold of ſo much as his meat
for to eat it. So the affections are the hands of the ſoul. <hi>He
that hath clean hands &amp; a pure heart,</hi> Pſ. 24. 4 that is, he whoſe
affections are clean, and heart pure. <hi>I will waſh my hands in
innocency, and ſo will I compaſſe thine Altar,</hi> Pſal. 26. 6. that
is, I will purge mine affections, and ſo I will pray. I will
that men pray every where, <hi>lifting up holy hands without
wrath,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 8. that is, lifting up holy affections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the diſtempered affections of wrath or anger or the
like: the affections are the hands of the heart, whereby it
takes the word or the Commandment, or any thing to it,
Now what a horrible thing is it that theſe hands of thine
ſhould be put out of joynt? as long as thine affections are
to the things here on earth, they are all out of joynt; thou
canſt never take grace. Ye cannot take hold of a promiſe,
nor of the word, unleſſe your affections be right. I know
that Faith is the right hand of the ſoul, whereby it takes
hold of that which is good. But alas! the hand of Faith is
clumbſie without the affections. Such a one had a croſſe,
how did he take it? ſay we: that is, how is he affected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it? ye take it ill to be reproved of your ſins: ye take
it ill to be warned and admoniſhed either in publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
Ye take it ill to be told of the judgements of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
your luſts. Alas! how can ye do otherwiſe? ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take it well, when your affections that ſhould take it
well are ſet upon vanity? wilt thou binde up and hamper
thine affections in the things of the Earth? alas! thy hands
are quite bound, thou canſt not take hold of Chriſt or of
Heaven. Thou doſt even pinion <hi>thine own ſoul</hi> and ſhackle
it for Hell. What does the Devil when he ſhackles a man

to ſet them upon Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of our hearts.</note> It may appear how infinitely it ſtands you in

the hands, but the <hi>handles of your hearts,</hi> as your hearts
can catch hold of nothing that is good, unleſſe your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
take hold, ſo nothing can take hold of your hearts,
but by your affections. If ever the word do convert you, it
muſt catch hold of you. Jeſus ſaid unto <hi>Simon, henceforth
thou ſhalt catch men,</hi> Luk. 5. 10. that is, the preaching of the
Word, it ſhall catch men, when thou preacheſt. Now one
of the firſt holds that it catcheth, is by the affections. Men
are affected with the Word, and ſo it comes to convert
men; now beloved, had you not need to have a care of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
ſeeing they are the handles of your hearts? were
it not for them, the word could never catch hold on you.
There is no hold to be had of ſuch a man, as we ſay; that
is, his affections are ſlippery. Beloved, here you come to
Gods houſe, miſerable wretched ſouls, in your ſinnes, alas!
how is it poſſible that ever Gods Miniſters ſhould catch
hold of your hearts? your affections are the main hold that
we can catch of you. If your affections be not here, but run
after the things of this life, we can have no hold of you,
you have nothing that we ſhould take hold by. Indeed we
may catch <hi>hold of your underſtandings:</hi> that's nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we take hold of your affections, they are as ſlippery
Eels, we can ſcarce ever hold them. O could we take hold
of them, it were well: they are fair handles for us to take
hold by. O if we could but truly affect your hearts with the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53869:24"/>
truth, then we might have ſome hope to convert you. As
<hi>Epictetus</hi> ſaies of wrongs, and of injuries, and all things in

handles,</hi> O ſaies he, if a man could take hold of every wrong
at the right handle, then he would bear it patiently: ſo I
may ſay of your haarts. Your hearts have two handles. I
pray God the Word may take hold at the right handle
of your hearts. The true affections of the heart, if ever the
Word take hold of them, it hath taken hold of the right
handle; Is it not then a lamentable thing that mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are miſplaced? alas! they are the hold of the heart,
and the heart can never be taken, unleſſe they be ſet

ſtomack:</hi> that which the ſoul doth affect, that reedeth and
filleth the ſoul, as meat doth the ſtomack. Is it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be careful what meat we doe eat? if we eat traſh it
will kill us, if we feed upon poyſon, it will poyſon and
infect us. Now that is the food of thy ſoul, which thy ſoul
does affect, and thine affection is thy ſouls ſtomack to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

they are the appetite of the ſoul. Such then as your
affections are, ſuch is your food. Should you ſee a man feed
upon dirt, and upon Bricks, and upon carrion, certainly you
would ſay, unleſſe he be broken therefrom, it will kill him.
No remedy but it will kill him without doubt. And wilt
thou feed thy ſoul with vanities, and with traſh, and with
poyſon? <hi>Every thing is traſh beſides Chriſt,</hi> every thing is
poyſon beſides Chriſt and his graces; if thou feedeſt upon
any thing beſides Chriſt and his ſpirit, thou feedeſt upon
traſh and upon poyſon. Now, if thou ſet thine affections
here below, thou feedeſt upon traſh. Thou murdereſt thy
ſoul with ſuch food, its rank poyſon, and yet thou feedeſt
upon it. That which thou affecteſt, that's thy ſouls food.
<hi>As new born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that

grace turns them into ſpiritual; this I ſay brethren, that
ye may ſee how that grace runs along in the affections, as
water in the pipe. The affections are the matter of grace.
As the ſoul is in the body; the body is the matter; and the
ſoul is in it, and ſo makes up a living creature. A man had
need look to his body, for it is the due matter of his ſoul;
ſo it is with the affections, thou haſt need to be careful of
them, for they are the matter of grace: and therefore the
Apoſtle cals the affections the members; <hi>yeeld your members
ſervants unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6. 19. that is, as expoſitors
expound it, yeeld your affections thereto.</p>
               <p>For they are your ſouls members, and the <hi>materials of

what ye be.</hi> According as your affections are, ſo are your
ſouls: if I could ſee what your affections run on, I could
ſee what ye all be; whether Saints or wicked, whether of
God or the Devil. The affections are the arguments that a
man is a man. When the people of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> took <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> for gods, and would have ſacrificed to them, Sirs,
ſaies <hi>Paul, Why do ye thus,</hi> whereas we are <hi>men of like paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with you?</hi> Act. 14. 15. that is, affections: we have fear,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53869:26"/>
and joy, and grief, and love, and the like paſſions with you.
Now if the bare having of affections be the arguments that
a man is a man, then ſurely the goodneſſe or vaineſſe of
theſe affections are the arguments that a man is a Chriſtian
man, or an ungodly man. I beſeech you conſider what a
woful diſtreſſed condition ye are in, if your affections be
vain and earthly, ye carry a brand in your hearts that ye
are not of God, that ye are yet the ſlaves of Satan and the
ſervants of unrighteouſneſs, and your end is no better then
eternal death and deſtruction. <hi>Affectus virum indicat.</hi> Your

Now for the words,<note place="margin">It is a Chriſtians duty to ſet his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon God.</note> they contain a ſpecial duty, that a
Chriſtian is bound to, namely, to ſet his affections upon God.
The Apoſtle preſſes it ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>it is an infallible mark of our being or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Chriſt.</hi> If ye be riſen with Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above.<note place="margin">1 Reaſon. Becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our being or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt.</note> As if he ſhould ſay; Ye ſay ye are
riſen with Chriſt, come then and demonſtrate it now that
ye are riſen with Chriſt. If ye be riſen with Chriſt, this
will infallibly follow. Ye will ſet your affections above;
it cannot be otherwiſe. If your affections be not ſet above,
doubtleſſe you are not riſen with Chriſt. <hi>Thoſe that are
Chriſts,</hi> ſaies S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, have crucified the fleſh with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and luſts,</hi> Galat. 5. 24. He takes it for granted,
that if they be Chriſts, they have crucified the fleſh and
the affections to the World-ward, and ſet them upon
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">1 Reaſon Becauſe it is a matter of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> He preſſeth it <hi>as a matter of reaſonable equity;</hi>
the competition ſtands but between two, <hi>Either things in
heaven, or things on earth.</hi> One of them ye muſt ſet your
affections upon, ye cannot ſet your affections upon both;
if ye ſet your affections any where, ye muſt needs ſet them
upon one of theſe two. Mark the competition. Set your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
on things that are above, not on the things on the
Earth; now there is a neceſſity of reaſon, that election
ſhould be made of the beſt, that we ſhould ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the better of the twain; to wit, the things that are
in Heaven, which are infinitely better then the things
here on Earth. <hi>Set your affections on things that are above,
and not on the things on Earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Yea of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</note> So that hence ye may ſee
the neceſſity of this duty. We muſt ſet our affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or which is all one, upon God. The ſtrength of this
neceſſity will the better appear,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe God is the principal object of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> if we conſider theſe four
things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That <hi>God is the principal object of our affections:</hi> as
the eye is made to be ſet upon colours, and the ear is made
to be ſet upon ſounds, and the ſmell is made to be ſet upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53869:27"/>
odours; ſo the <hi>affections are made to be principally ſet upon
God.</hi> The affections are ſo naturally due unto God, that
if it be not God the ſouls affections are ſet on, it makes it a
God or an Idol. And therefore the Apoſtle bids us <hi>mortifie
our inordinate affections, evil concupiſcence, and coveteouſneſs,
which is Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3. 5. when our affections are ſet upon
gains, and upon profits, and the things of this life, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
cals this coveteouſneſſe, and this coveteouſneſſe he
ſaies it is Idolatry; becauſe the ſoul makes Gold a god, and
ſilver a god, and profit a god, by ſetting its affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
As the eye doth either ſee colours, or elſe it ſees a
thing under the likeneſſe of a colour: colour is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
object of the ſight, and therefore if it be not a colour
which it ſees (as the eye may ſee light, as the light of the
fire, the light of the Sun, but it ſees it under the likeneſſe
of redneſſe or whiteneſſe, or ſome other colour.) It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by a colour, or elſe it cannot ſee it: So beloved, it is
either God our affections are on, or we idolize it as a God.
Indeed we may affect other things as mediums and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, but look where we ſet our affections, that is
our God. <hi>Only fear the Lord, and ſerve him with all your
heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 24. We muſt ſet our affection of fear only
upon God. The affections are the ſouls attendants. Doth
not a ſervant wait only upon his own Maſter? whom he
gives his attendance unto him he maketh his Maſter, and
whom ſhould the ſoul wait on but only upon God? the
affections are the ſouls attendances; upon whomſoever ſhe
beſtows them, ſhe waits upon it as true God. <hi>My ſoul,</hi>
ſaies <hi>David, my ſoul wait thou only upon God,</hi> Pſa 62. 5. Give
thine attendance to none but to him. Thine affections of
love, and of joy, and of hope and deſire, theſe muſt wait
upon God for to worſhip him. Thine affections of fear and
of care, theſe muſt wait upon God to provide what ever
may pleaſe him. Thine affections of hatred, and of grief,
and ſorrow, and the like, theſe muſt wait as a guard to keep
off what ever may offend him; thine affections are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53869:27"/>
for God; this is the firſt ground, the affections were
made for God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Nothing but God hath that which the affections look for: Becauſe nothing is good but God. <hi>Chryſoft.</hi>
                  </note> As the affections were principally made for
this purpoſe, to be ſet upon God, <hi>ſo nothing but God hath that
which the affections look for.</hi> It is God which the affections
look for, and where can the affections finde it but only in
God? <hi>there is none good but one, that is God,</hi> Mat. 19. 17. The
young man would have thought he ſought for good in a
right place, when he ſought for it in Chriſt. But as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
obſerves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when he lookt upon
Chriſt as a meer man, Chriſt tels him he was miſtaken in
calling him good, there is none good but one, that is God.
Chriſt himſelf, as near as he was unto good, as he came
nearer to it then any creature in heaven or in earth, yet
if he had been a creature, and men had ſet their affections
on him as their good, being a creature, they had ſet their
affections amiſſe: why calleſt thou me good? ſaies he; ſo
much more doth every creature anſwer, Thou thinkeſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
honors and pleaſures are good. Why call ye me good?
may they all ſay, there's none good but one, that is God.
<hi>Will a man ſeek for the Sun in a pale of water?</hi> Indeed, if
the Sunne ſhine on the water, there may you ſee it. But if
the Sun do not look on it, you may look over all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the world, and never finde the Sunne in them all. So
will you ſet your affections on the things of the world? it
is good your affections look for, can ye finde any good in
theſe things? alas! alas! thou mayſt have all the things of
this world, yet if God do not ſhew thee his face, and his
grace in the ſame, <hi>ſtultus ad cribrum,</hi> thou runneſt to them
<hi>as a fool to a ſive.</hi> The ſive ſeems to hold a great deal of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but by pulling the ſive from the water, the fool loſt all
the water. So riches, and wealth, and pleaſures, as long as
thou haſt them in grace and in God, they are like ſives in
the water, full of water as long as they are in. So theſe are
full of good, as long as they are in God and in grace; But
if thou doſt not ſet thine affections upon God, thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53869:28"/>
are befooled, and therefore thou muſt ſet thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon God, becauſe nothing but God hath that which
thine affections look for. It is Good which the affections
look for, and thine affections can finde it no where but in
God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe nothing is my good but only God.</note> As nothing but God hath that which the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
look for, nothing is good but he, <hi>ſo nothing is my good
but only he,</hi> for if it be good, and not my good, this diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
mine affections; mine affections look at my good. I
know compaſſion, and mercy, and love may look at the
good of another; but then they conſider ſome kinde of
propriety in that other, either as my brother, or friend, or
my neighbour, ſtill the affections have an eye unto my
good, thine affections to thy good Now nothing in the
world can ſo truly be ſaid thy good, as thy God. Other
goods are <hi>called this worlds goods,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 17. They are the
goods of this World rather then thy goods: But God is
thy goodneſſe: Thou art my goodneſſe, O Lord, ſaies the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 2. Thou canſt not ſay of thy pleaſures,
this is my goodneſſe, nor of wealth, this is my goodneſſe;
nor of any thing in the world, this is my goodneſſe: the
good that is in it, is the goodneſſe of the thing, not thy
goodneſſe; if I ſhould ſay, this is thy goodneſſe, it's all
one as if I ſhould ſay, thou haſt no goodneſſe, for that is
none of thine, but only by poſſeſſion, it is not thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And therefore how canſt thou ſet thine affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it?</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. The good of the creature not thy good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe but the good of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> It is only <hi>the good of thy body,</hi> it is not thy good, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima
hominis est homo,</hi> ſaies <hi>Plato. The ſoul is the man rather
then the body.</hi> If the things of this life be the goods of the
body, then how canſt thou ſet thine affections upon them?
Thine affections are the affections of thy ſoul. Meat is good,
let thy body hunger after it, and thou ſinneſt not: drink is
good? let thy body thirſt after it, thou erreſt not; but wilt
thou ſet thine affections upon it? when it is not thy good,
but only the good of thy body, it is not thy good: means
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53869:28"/>
and maintenance is the good of thy body, houſe, and
lands, and livings, theſe are the good of thy body, let the
deſires of thy body be to them, this is well yet; but if the
deſires of thy ſoul be thereto, if thou ſet thine affections
upon them, thou art a beaſt, becauſe they are not thy
good. As <hi>Theophylact</hi> well obſerves upon the rich man in
the Goſpel, <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years,</hi>
Luk. 12. 19. take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry; ſee
the baſeneſſe of this fools affections, ſaies <hi>Theophylact:</hi> to
eat, to drink, and to be merry: theſe were the goods of his
unreaſonable part; to rejoyce in Gods Law, to rejoyce in
holy thoughts and meditations, theſe are the goods of the
ſoul, of the reaſonable ſoul of a man. Now the fool he had
none of theſe goods laid up; and yet he ſaies, Soul, thou
haſt much good laid up for many years, whereas that very
night he died and was damned for ever; the things of this
life then are not thy good, and therefore thou muſt not ſet
thine affections upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe not ſo long as thou art.</note> It is not thy good, <hi>becauſe it is not as long as
thou art.</hi> Thou muſt live for ever in heaven or in hel. Now
all the goods of this life laſt but this life, and when thou
dieſt, thou muſt leave them to others, and therefore they
are not thy goods. Were they thy goods, thou mighteſt
carry them away with thee when thou dieſt; but this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be. Canſt thou carry thy barns and thy houſes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or to hell with thee? canſt thou carry thy dogs and
thy hounds, and thy pleaſures, and thy preferments to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world with thee? No, no, and why then doſt thou
ſet thine affections upon them, when they are not thy
goods for to carry with thee where ever thou goeſt? if
thou wouldeſt ſet thine affections upon grace and upon
God, thou ſhouldeſt ſet thine affections upon thy goods;
theſe are thy goods as long as thou liveſt, and theſe
are thy goods when thou dyeſt, and theſe thou mayſt
carry with thee whitherſoever thou goeſt. <hi>Wilt thou
ſet thine eyes upon that which is not?</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon;</hi> for ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53869:29"/>
certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away as an
Eagle, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 5. wilt thou ſet thine affections upon that
which is not? Wealth is not, and pleaſure is not, and all the
things of this world are not, <hi>they make themſelves wings:</hi>
now may be they are a bird in the hand, but by and by
they are gone, there's a wing of prodigality, a wing of
change, and of miſhaps and of caſualties, wings of loſſes
and other occurrences, and though thou couldeſt clip all
theſe wings with thy wiſedom, yet the wing of death and
mortality will carry them all away in a moment, and then
whoſe ſhall they be? thy pleaſures, then whoſe ſhall they
be? thy gains and thy comings in, whoſe ſhall they be?
ſure it is, they ſhall be none of thine, and therefore ſet thine
affections elſewhere, thou muſt ſet them upon God.</p>
               <p>3. They are not thy good,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe they will not take thy part.</note> becauſe <hi>they will not take thy
part.</hi> Will any man ſet his affections on him that will not
take his part? how can I affect him that will not affect me?
if he will leave me in the lurch, I can never affect him as
my friend. Alas! all the things of this life will leave thee
in the lurch, thou mayſt periſh and be damned for all
them. They will never deliver thee from the hand of hell;
when thom comeſt before the tribunal of Chriſt, doſt
thou think it will profit thee to ſay, Lord, I have hunted
and hawked, and gamed and ſported, and I have been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
will it benefit thee to ſay, Lord, I have builded and
purchaſed, and encreaſed my livings and my rents, I have
a good houſe, and a good farm, and good friends, Will this
advantage thee? No, miſerable comforters are they all;
canſt thou ſay, Lord, I have built up thy Church and thy
worſhip, I have purchaſed zeal and holineſſe, and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and glory to thy name, I have been perſecuted and
hated of all men for thy Name ſake, and I am in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
If thou canſt ſay thus, this would be thy good indeed; but
if thou canſt not ſay thus,<note place="margin">Iuv. Sat. 13.</note> though thou beeſt <hi>Gallinae filius
albae,</hi> thou mayſt periſh with the devils and curſed fiends
for evermore for all the bleſſings of this life. Set thine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53869:29"/>
affections then upon God: <hi>truly God is good to Iſrael,</hi> ſaies
the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 1. He is good, and he truly is good;
thou canſt not ſay ſo of all the things under Heaven;
thou canſt not ſay, truly riches are good to me. Pleaſure
truly is good to me; peace and plenty and liberty truly is
good to thee; they are good, but they will never be good
to thee; when thou haſt moſt need of good, then they
will leave thee in the lurch, theſe do thee no good then.
This is the third; as nothing but God is good, ſo nothing is
thy good, but God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Nothing can reſt the ſoul but only God.</note> As nothing is thy good but God, ſo nothing
can reſt thine affections but God. When thou affecteſt any
thing, wherefore doſt thou affect it, but only to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
therewith when thou haſt it? and therefore thou
muſt ſet thine affections upon God, becauſe <hi>nothing can reſt
thy ſoul, but only thy God. Reſt in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 37. 7. <hi>Return
unto thy reſt O my ſoul,</hi> Pſa. 116. 7. God is the reſt of the
ſoul; if the ſoul ever get him, it reſteth content; the
affections are in a maze, if they be not ſet upon God, like
a man in a quagmire, he ſinks deeper and deeper, ſo a man
ſinks deeper and deeper in deſires and in wiſhes, that hath
not his affections upon God; there is nothing can give the
ſoul reſt, if the ſoul reſt not in God. Will meat in a dream,
and drink in a dream give ſatisfaction to our hunger, &amp; our
thirſt? So are all the good things in this world, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 29 8. Go
to all the wicked men in the earth, let them deſire and have
their deſires, ſtill they deſire and further their deſire, and
yet they deſire after millions of deſires, their affections are
as far for to ſeek for reſt, as if never they had ſought. All
the things in the world are like ſome Ale-houſe-beer, which
will never quench the poor <hi>Travellers</hi> thirſt, like the eating
of ſalt neats-tongues; the more they do eat, the more they
are athirſt: hungry meat, <hi>He that deſireth ſilver, ſhall never be
ſatisfied with ſilver,</hi> he that affects pleaſure and vanity, ſhall
never be contented nor ſatisfied therewith; give him ones,
he affects tens, give him tens, he affecteth hundreds; give him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53869:30"/>
hundreds, he affects thouſands; give him them, he affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
millions; thou canſt never get reſt, till thine affections
are pitcht upon God. <hi>Quo plus ſunt potae, plus ſitiuntur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae.
It's God only that reſteth the affections.</hi> Now if theſe be
ſo, is it not our beſt way to ſet our affections on God, where
we may have reſt for our ſouls? nothing beſides can give us
any reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe nothing but God is all good.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe nothing but God is all good.</hi> Every good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
God hath but one or two goodneſſes in it. None but
God hath all goodneſſes in him; what is <hi>meat</hi> good for,
but only to feed one? when thou haſt it thou muſt deſire
again to have rayment, for meat will not cloth thee; what
is <hi>rayment</hi> good for, but only to cover one? when thou
haſt it, thou muſt deſire again to be fed, for rayment will
not feed thee; what is <hi>money</hi> good for, but only to buy
with? when thou haſt it, thou muſt deſire again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
of thy ſickneſſe, for money will not cure thee of
the Feaver: thus no good thing in the world can give thine
affections a reſt, becauſe they have but one or two good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
a piece in them, but the Lords goodneſſe is infinite,
he is all good; if thou haſt him, thou wanteſt no manner of
thing that is good. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want
any good thing,</hi> Pſa. 34. 10. for every good thing is in him.
He is bread to the hungry, and drink to the thirſty, and
health to the ſick, and liberty to the captive, all in all to
them that ſet their affections on him. <hi>Fruſtra fit per plura
quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi> If thine affections go to any
creature, thou fetcheſt but a little good at once, thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
will be fain to go a thouſand and a thouſand times
over and over, thou getteſt ſo little at once, that thou ſhalt
be tempted to be affecting the oftner; but if thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
go to God, thou goeſt to the fountain, there thou haſt
it by drops,<note place="margin">2. Nothing but God is the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate good</note> never enough, here thou mayſt have it at once.
Who would be ſo mad to fetch water at a Cock that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by drops, when the Fountain is by?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe nothing but God is the ultimate good.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53869:30"/>
Thou affecteſt the things of this life, alas! they will never
givereſt, for ſtill there is ſomething beyond them, but God
is the utmoſt of all goods, when the ſoul is once ſetled on
him, it hath no further to go, like a ſtone when it's come to
the centre, it hath no further to go. I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi>
the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt, ſaies Chriſt,
if the ſoul be in Chriſt, Chriſt is his laſt, the ſoul is at reſt;
why? it hath no where to goe: whether ſhould we goe?
ſaies <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Chriſt, thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> Joh. 6.
Chriſt firſt, and Chriſt next, and Chriſt laſt; Chriſt is the
utmoſt and ultimate good of the ſoul; the ſoul hath no
further to go: and therefore here thou muſt fix thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
fix them upon Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Nothing is it ſelf without God.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe nothing is it ſelf without God,</hi> the things
of this life, they are good I confeſs, but they are not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
without God; if God be not in them, the very good
that they have is not in them. When thou affecteſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and delight, anſwer me, why doſt thou affect it? is it
not for the good that is in it? when thou affecteſt profit,
or health, or peace, or friends, or credit, or whatever thou
affecteſt, tell me in thy conſcience, why doſt thou affect
them? is it not for the good that is in them? they are good,
therefore thou affecteſt them: but if thou haſt not Chriſt,
and God, and his Spirit, and his grace, if thou haſt not the
Lord in theſe things, they are not themſelves, neither have
they the good that is in them. Riches is no riches without
grace, but a <hi>ſnare:</hi> health is no health without Chriſt, but

creature: I ſay, if Chriſt be not in them, the bleſſings are not
themſelves: they have not the good that is in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> had a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and a <hi>Buckler,</hi> and a <hi>Horn,</hi>
but they were not themſelves without God. <hi>Lord, thou art
my Caſtle, and my Buckler, and the Horn of my ſalvation.
David</hi> had a ſervant to make his bed in his ſickneſſe, but
to let us know that this bleſſing was not it ſelf without
God, he puts the phraſe upon God, <hi>who made his bed in his
ſickneſſe;</hi> no bleſſing is it ſelf without Chriſt, or without
God. He hath all the goodneſſe that is in it. The Heathens
have a pretty phraſe, whereby they ſet out a happy man,
<hi>Vndecunque Deus, When God is every where about him;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him in his means and his riches, about him in his
houſe and in his goods, about him in his friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
about him in his pleaſure and mirth: he is not
happy unleſſe God be in every thing that is about him;
they are but the carcaſſes of good, if God be not in them.
Thus you ſee we muſt ſet our affections on God.</p>
               <p>Here then we are taught,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> It is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God that we have affections. <hi>Apud Cic Tuſcul.</hi> 4. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not in themſelvs ſinful.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is the bleſſing of God that
we have affections implanted in our hearts.</hi> For how could
they be ſet upon God, if it were not a bleſſing that we have
them? There is a main controverſie between the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
the Stoicks, and the Peripatetiques, concerning the
affections: the Stoicks do ſtifly maintain, that it is an evil
to have any affections at all: and therefore <hi>Zeno</hi> defines
the affections to be unnatural ſtirrings of the heart, averſe
from right reaſon, which is falſe; for this is the definition
of affections, as they are corrupt, and not as they are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
the affections in themſelves are not ſinful.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe Adam and Eve had affections in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe Adam and Eve had affections in innocency,</hi>
If the affections were all ſinful in themſelves, <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> in their innocency could not have had them, for they
were created without ſin: but they were created with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as love, and joy, and delight, and hope, and fear,
and the like. Before <hi>Eve</hi> ever ſinned, we ſee plainly ſhe was
afraid to eat of the forbidden fruit; indeed when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53869:31"/>
had-ripened his temptation, then ſhe went fearleſly on
for to eat it; but when the devil aſſaulted her at the firſt,
O ſaies ſhe, <hi>We may not eat of it, leſt we die,</hi> Gen. 3. 3. Lo, ſhe
was afraid for to eat it at firſt. I confeſſe before the fall,
may be they had not all the affections in act, becauſe
there were no objects for all the affections to work on;
they had nothing to grieve for, nothing to be angry at, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to deſpair of; but for my part, I think they had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
objects to work on, though not in themſelves, for
they had not ſinned as yet, yet they had diſtinct objects in
the world for all their affections to work on, for ſhould
they not grieve to ſee God diſhonoured by the fall of the
Angels? ſhould they not hate and abhor backſliding from
God? though there were none in themſelves, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the affections of fear and hatred were given them
to keep away ſin and apoſtaſie from God. Now if the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were in <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, they could not be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe Chriſt took our affections upon him.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe Chriſt took our affections upon him.</hi> If
the affections were ſinful in themſelves, he could not take
our affections upon him; for he was made like unto us,
ſin only excepted: and therefore if the affections were ſins,
he could not have taken our affections; but he did take
them, as the Goſpel doth abundantly ſhew. He had our
affection of joy, <hi>Ieſus reioyced in Spirit,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I thank

<hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 5. He had our affection of deſire, <hi>with deſire</hi> I have
deſired to eat this Paſſeover with you before I ſuffer, <hi>Luk.</hi>
22. 15. And ſo of the reſt. If Chriſt took our affections
upon him, our affections are not ſinful in themſelves. Nay,
he did not only as the Son of man take our primitive affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as we are men, but he was <hi>Ben En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53869:32"/>
our affections of infirmity upon him; I do not mean
the affections of ſinful infirmity, for he knew no ſin: but I
mean the affections of our frailty and infirmity, as fear, and
fellow-feeling, and the like. We have not a High-Prieſt,
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. This then is an undeniable argument, that
the affections are not ſinful in themſelves, becauſe Chriſt
did aſſume them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe God doth command the uſe of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe the Lord doth command us to be angry.</hi>
Be angry and ſin not, ſaies he, he commands us to grieve

He commands us to be aſhamed of our evil doings, and is

our affections on this wiſe; it's true, they are ſinfully uſed,
and corruptly perverted among men, the more is the pity,
but they are not ſo in themſelves. Neither do I deny but

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe without affections we ſhould be like ſtocks.</note> Becauſe if we had no affections at all, we ſhould
be like ſtocks and like ſenſeleſſe ſtones. The Philoſopher
was in a doubt, whether <hi>Brutus</hi> were not a block or a brute,
becauſe he had no affection at all to his own children,
whom he could ſee murthered before him with dry eyes.
The Lord himſelf counts that man a very block that hath
no affection in his heart. Have ye no regard, all ye that

And therefore it's reckoned among the ſymptomes of a
heart that is deſperately hardned, not to be affected with
any thing: to hear the Word, and not to be affected
therewith, to pray unto God, and not to be affected with
Gods preſence; to be in affliction, and not to be affected
with remorſe. I ſay, this is a ſymptome of a hard heart.
And therefore it is a bleſſing of God that a man hath affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
within him.<note place="margin">2. Becauſe without affections we ſhould be lazie and idle. <hi>l, de vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, in fine</hi>

Like a Pilot at ſea <hi>without winde:</hi> alas! the ſhip
would goe ſlowly, were there no windes ſtirring to drive
it. So the affections, ſaies he, are to the ſoul, as the winde
to the ſails of the ſhip; as the ſhip could not ſail apace
without windes, ſo the ſoul would go ſlowly about any
thing, if the affections did not carry it. When <hi>Davids</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
were hampered about with worldly fears, fears of
his enemies, and griefs at his perſecutions which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he went ſlowly on in obedience, but as ſoon as his ſails
were up, then he ran like a ſhip in the ſea with a great

help him to ſpread the ſails of his heart, and enlarge his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
then he would run like a Fleet pinnace in the Seas.
<hi>I will then run the way of thy Commandments,</hi> ſaies he; this
is an infinite mercy of God, who ſeeing how dull we are

                  </gap>, ſaies
the ſame Philoſopher. The affections are like wheels, and
like Chariots unto reaſon. If a mans reaſon be never ſo
good, he knows he is bound to repent, and be godly, and
obey; yet if he have no affections thereto, he goes <hi>like a
chariot without wheels;</hi> he goes without force, he cannot
go at all; but if he have affections thereto, the affections
are like wheels, and like horſes to carry him amain. <hi>Draw
me,</hi> ſaies the Chriſtian ſoul unto Chriſt, <hi>draw me, and I will
run after thee,</hi> Can. 1. 4. She praies that Chriſt would draw
her by the affections of love, for ſhe ſpeaks of love; the
<hi>virgins love thee,</hi> ſaies ſhe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Draw me with thy love
too, and then I ſhall run after thee, like the Chariots of
<hi>Aminadab,</hi> that is, drawn by quick Horſes: ſhe would
run as with wheels unto Chriſt, if her affections did once
carry her. As <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaies of the affections of anger, it is
<hi>cos fortitudinis,</hi> it is the whetſtone to valour; ſo I may ſay
of all the affections, they are all <hi>whetſtones to good,</hi> if a man
have any grace. Haſt thou <hi>love?</hi> It is a whetſtone to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
haſt thou <hi>grief?</hi> It is a whetſtone to repentance;
haſt thou <hi>anger?</hi> it is a whetſtone to zeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is the
reaſon men come ſo ſlowly on unto good? the reaſon is
this, becauſe their affections ſtand another way. Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
but ſlowly, and amend their lives but ſlowly, encreaſe
in grace but ſlowly; why? this is the cauſe, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to the world; they run on in their pleaſures and
their vanities, they run on in their earthly employments
and buſineſſes; why? their affections are thereto. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
it is an infinite mercy of God, that we have affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
given us of God, for theſe may quicken our dulneſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53869:33"/>
unto grace.<note place="margin">3. Becauſe affections are the channels of grace.</note> Thirdly, Becauſe <hi>the affections are good chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels
for grace to run downin:</hi> Be there never ſo full a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of good water, yet if it have not a channel to run all

it ſelf for want of a channel. So though God ſhould
put never ſo much grace into thy heart, yet if it ſhould
have no channel to run down in, it would ſmother it ſelf.
Now God hath given thee affections like channels, for
grace to run down in. Art thou <hi>covetous</hi> and full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires?
what a fine channel is that for grace to run down
in? it is the eaſier for thee to covet the beſt things: art
thou of a <hi>cholerick</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> conſtitution? what a fine
channel is that for zeal to Gods glory to run down in? it
is the eaſier for thee to be zealous in Gods worſhip: art
thou <hi>melancholy</hi> and of a ſad diſpoſition? what a fine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
is that for repentance to run down in? it is the eaſier
for thee to deſpiſe the vain pleaſures of the world, and to
ſorrow for ſin: art thou merry and of a cheerful nature?
what a fine channel is this for delight in the Lord to runne
down in? it is the eaſier for thee to joy in the holy Ghoſt;
art thou <hi>fearful</hi> and of a timorous ſpirit? what a fine chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
is that for fear of Gods judgements and truth to runne
down in? it is the eaſier for thee to tremble before God,
and fear to offend him. <hi>Solomon</hi> was full of the affections
of <hi>love,</hi> it is true, he let luſt after women, and uncleanneſſe
a while run down in that channel, but when grace and
repentance recovered his ſoul, what an excellent chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
was it for love unto Chriſt to run down in? Never
was there ſuch a loveſong to Chriſt, as the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſince
the creation of the world to this day; and therefore it is
called <hi>Canticum Canticorum, The Song of Songs,</hi> Cant. 1. 1.
Certainly <hi>Ieremy</hi> was a man of a <hi>ſad constitution,</hi> but ſee
what an advantage this bent of affection was to him, it was
a channel for ſpiritual ſadneſſe to run down in. <hi>Oh that my

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53869:34"/>
9. 1. The woman in the Goſpel which was a ſinner, a whore
in plain terms, one bewitched with the affections of love
to her lovers; as ſoon as ever any grace did look into her
heart, ſee how theſe affections of love did advantage her.
She loved our Saviour more affectionately then Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
himſelf, <hi>She loved much,</hi> ſaies the Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. Before
no queſtion but ſhe was full of her whoriſh and ſtrumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
tears; now the channel was turned, ſhe waſht Chriſts
feet with her tears, and wipt them with the hair of her
head: and ſhe loved much, ſaies the Text. It is ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
advantage to be full of affections, that the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi>

He thought it was eaſie for him to make him aſhamed of
all filthineſſe, and delighted in goodneſſe, and fearful to
do evil, I am not of his minde, but this I am though, he
hath an exceeding good advantage to do it. If a man have
ſpent his affections upon ſin, and eaten out the heart of his
affections upon vanity; or if a man have no affections at
all, as ſome have but few, <hi>a man ſhall as ſoon work on a beaſt
as ſuch a man.</hi> Nay, if grace ſhould come in into ſuch a
man, alas! he ſhall never be able to come to much good;
if beſt come to the beſt, he ſhall have infinite adoe to
doe any duty without wofull dulneſſe and ſenſeleſſeneſſe;
it is an admirable bleſſing that God gives unto men, to give
them affections, and therefore the Stoicks are infinitely
too blame to cry out of the affections as if they were evil
in themſelves. To ſpeak truly and rightly of the Stoicks,
I do not think the Stoicks were ever ſo ſottiſh as to mean
ſo; but their intent as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaies of them was, to pare
off the affections that are evil, and to rule the affections
that are natural: and therefore it was that they declaim'd

the affections are deep ſet with or againſt, they prove to be
ſympathies and antipathies, which are infinitely hard to
be changed. The Philoſophers call them <hi>occultae qualitates,

with the things of the world, it muſt needs have an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
at grace; the <hi>proud man</hi> hath an antipathy at the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53869:35"/>
parting with that which he prides in; the <hi>revengeful man</hi>
hath an antipathy at the putting up of an injury. <hi>The ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
man</hi> hath an antipathy at a ſound reproof, he cannot
endure to be ſharply rebuk't for his ſinnes. As ſome men
(ſuffer a homely ſimilitude) I ſay, have an antipathy with
Cheeſe, they will goe out of the room where it is. As the
mullet hath an antipathy with the Pike; the Coleworts
have an antipathy with the Vine; they will die rather
then grow together. So men are vext to be curbed of their
luſts. The affections are the ſympathies and the antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
of the heart, and therefore it's very hard to remove
them, it will coſt thee a mighty deal of labour to pull off
thine affections from all the things in the world, and
to ſet them upon God.<note place="margin">2. The 2. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. Becauſe affections are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings of the heart.</note> Secondly, it is a hard thing to work
on the heart, when the heart is bewitcht. The affections
are <hi>the bewitchings of the heart,</hi> when the heart hath once
ſet its affections on the things of the World, it is even
quite bewitched therewith. Fooliſh people talk much of
bewitchings; Brethren let me tell you, here's a bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ye little conſider. Your affections bewitch you. <hi>O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the truth?</hi> Gal. 3. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaies S. <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi>
this is the bewitching of the devil; the falſe Apoſtles had
wrought upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> affections, and drawn them
from the truth, and now when their affections were ſet on
it, the Apoſtle ſaies they were bewitcht. The affections
when once they are up about a thing that is earthly or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
they are like a company of devils in hell to bewitch
one: there be abundance of bewitchings in nature. The
bird <hi>Galgalus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch, ſympoſ. l. 5 c. 7. Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. lib. 3. Hiſt. 2. Del-Rio Diſq. mag. lib. 2. c 3.</note> if ſhe ſee a man that is ſick of the Jaundies,
the man recovers, and ſhe is ſo bewitched therewith that
ſhe dieth. If a Toad be ſeen by the Weſil to gape, the
Weſil is ſo bewitched, that ſhe gives up her ſelf to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured:
but of all the bewitchings in the world, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
of the affections are the moſt dangerous. <hi>Euci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides</hi>
was in ſo deep an affection to his own beauty, that he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53869:36"/>
was bewitcht with it: were not <hi>Sampſons</hi> affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with <hi>Delilah?</hi> were not <hi>Herods</hi> affections bewitcht
with <hi>Herodias?</hi> were not Judas his affections bewitcht
with the gain of thirty pence, that for it he ſhould deny
his own Maſter? S. <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Galatians</hi> their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were bewitcht. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> thinks verily the devil was
in them. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> is bewitcht with his cups: the
<hi>Adulterer</hi> with his whore, the angry man with his choler,
the <hi>vain man</hi> with his vanities, the <hi>carnal man</hi> with his
fleſh; that they will damn their own ſouls, rather then be
new creatures. Beloved, are not ye bewitched in your ſins,
when all the preaching and teaching and warning ye have
had, cannot yet turn you from your ſins unto God, to ſet
your affections above? this is a grievous let that ſends mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
to hell, their affections bewitch them. Ye need no
Devils to tempt you to ſinne: if your affections be once ſet
on it, they will bewitch you as bad as any devil can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch
you. Nay, the devil cannot bewitch you to ſin, but
only by your affections. If ever thou ſave thy ſoul, thou
ſhalt finde it a great task to unbewitch thine affections, to
ſet them upon grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. The 3. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment. Becauſe affections are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart.</note> Another let is, that as the affections are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings
of the heart, ſo they are the <hi>eſtimations of the
heart,</hi> If the thing be not good enough to be affected,
which the affections are ſet on, they eſteem it worthy to
be affected. <hi>Quiſquis amat ranam, ranam putat eſſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi>
Many of you know the old Proverb, If a man ſhould
ſet his affections on a frog, there's little goodneſſe in a
Frog, why it ſhould be affected; but if a man ſhould ſet
his affections on a Frog, he would eſteem it as comely, as
another would <hi>Diana.</hi> The affections if they be ſet upon
vanity, they do utterly besot one. Look upon the <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi>
he thinks it's a fine life to be potting and piping in
the Ale-houſe: which a man in his wits knows to be baſe
and brutiſh, and helliſh. Look upon the <hi>vain Gentleman,</hi>
he thinks it a fine life to be hunting and gamballing and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53869:36"/>
bragging and flanting, and challenging, and to be ſird
and to be worſhipt at every word. Which a wiſe man
knows to be foppiſh, and fooliſh, and devilliſh. The <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
blinde the judgement,</hi> and befool the underſtanding,
and make a man to defend himſelf in a courſe which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deed will leade him to hell. When the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
had ſet their affections on their luſts; <hi>Moſes</hi> thus
ſpeaks to them. Do ye thus requite the Lord, ye <hi>fooliſh
people and unwiſe?</hi> Is not he thy Father? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Deut. 32 6.
Natural affection would leade a childe to be obedient to
his father, and ſeeing their affections were croſſe ſet, the
Lord cals them a fooliſh people. Their ſinful affections did
beſot them and befool them.<note place="margin">Chryſ. hom. 7. in Iob.</note> 
                  <hi>Samoſatenus</hi> was ſo beſotted
with the love of a certain woman, that he forſook his faith
and religion for her. I reade of a pretty parable to this
purpoſe. When <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> had left his men with <hi>Circe</hi> the
witch, ſhe changed them all into diverſe ſorts of beaſts,
Dogs, Swine, Lyons, Tygers, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> complained ſhe had
done him great wrong for changing his men into beaſts
on that faſhion: wrong? ſaies ſhe: I have not done thee
nor them any wrong. Doe but ask them now whether
they doe not like the condition they are in. So <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
firſt of the Hogge, whether he would be a man
again or not. He anſwered no, by no means; For now he
could fill his belly, and lie down on the dunghil and ſleep.
And ſo he demanded of the reſt, and they all ſave only
the Elephant, they all replyed they had rather be beaſts
as now they were. This parable is made to ſhew how the
carnal affections beſot one, to eſteem the pleaſures of ſin,
the gains and profits and beggerly things of the World,
and prefer them before holineſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and
pureneſſe, and ſtrictneſſe of living. One, his affections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot
him in a <hi>love-lock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or long hair, that he cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to ſhave it off: another, his affections beſot him
in a Tobacco-pipe, another in a filthy gotten cuſtome,
another in ſome other baſe haunt of the heart, all the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53869:37"/>
preaching under Heaven cannot diſſwade them, therefore
they do ſo eſteem them and prize them, and think they
are ſo pleaſing: a noble minded Chriſtian would wonder
how it is poſſible they can ſo.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the moſt natural tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the heart.</note> Another let is, that as the affections are the
eſtimations of the heart, ſo they are the <hi>moſt natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments
of the heart.</hi> Spiritual and heavenly affections
are the good temper of the heart, and carnal or earthly
affections are the evil temper of the heart, and therefore
it's hard to change ones affections, becauſe the heart it
ſelf muſt be taken a peeces as it were, if one would alter
his affections. An earthly heart is not a right ſoyl for the
ſpiritual plants to grow in. Gardners have daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
what a coil they have to keep an herb from dying in
their gardens, when the garden is not a right ſoyl for it:
they are fain for to dig it, and dreſſe it, and water it, and
tend it, yet ſcarce will it grow there when it is not a right
ſoyl for it. Men muſt get themſelves new hearts and new
mindes, if ever they would have their affections renewed.
Faſhion not your ſelves to the world, ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>but
be ye tranſformed by the renewing of your minde,</hi> Rom. 12. 2.
Unleſſe your minde be renewed, ye can never ſpy a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
faſhion of the world, but O your affections will be to
it. When <hi>David</hi> had miſplaced his affections on <hi>Bathſheba</hi>
another mans wife, and his affections had been mad upon
adultery, and on murther, what does he doe? He goes
to God in praier for a new heart, he could never have new
affections elſe; <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew
a right ſpirit within me,</hi> Pſa. 51. 10. He could not get new
affections, till he had gotten a new heart. This is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
impediment that lets multitudes of men and women
from ſetting their affections upon God; becauſe their
hearts are not a right for ſuch affections as theſe. May be
they trim their affections, as the very heathens have done,
with morality; as a Barbor trims and ſhaves a mans head,
but the hair grows again, becauſe the head is the hairs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53869:37"/>
ſoyl. So the carnal affections will grow again: ſpiritual
and heavenly affections will not grow there, for the heart
is not a right ſoyl: and this is a ſhrewdlet, and you muſt
labour continually to remove it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, before I help you with means how
to ſet your affections on God, let me give you theſe two
grounds.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Ground We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet our affections on God, unleſſe we have a new heart.</note> You muſt have this ſame new heart, otherwiſe
ye cannot ſet your affections on God. For there is a heart
that will ſet its affections on God, and there is a heart that
will not. The Lord wiſhes his people to have the former
kinde of heart, the heart that will ſet its affections on
God. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them, that they would
fear me, and keep my Commandments alwaies,</hi> Deut. 5. 29.
There is ſuch a heart beloved, O that we had it; I ſay,
there is ſuch a heart that will fear God, and ſet all its affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on God; and ſuch a heart ye muſt get, or elſe it
is in vain to command you this duty: all the Sermons (ye
ſee) are in vain that ye have heard to this day; all the
exhortations and admonitions ye have had ſince ye were,
ye ſee plainly they are in vain to many of you: as your
affections were earthly twenty years ago, ſo they are ſtill;
as they were carnal and worldly heretofore, ſo they are
ſtill; your hearts are the ſame hearts, your hearts are ſtark
naught, and therefore your affections cannot ſore up unto
God. Ye can have no quick affections in praier, no melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
affections at the word: The Sabbath comes, but your
affections are not on it: a Sacrament comes, but what poor
affections you have to it, your conſciences may witneſſe.
Ye ſit in your ſhops, or ye follow your callings, or ye go
about your earthly employments, and your affections are
below; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaies <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
foot is bound with a cord, ſhe cannot fly up unto
God. Your hearts are not ſpiritual, and this is the cauſe
your affections are ſo carnal. Peradventure ye lop off now
and then ſome part of your carnal affections, as <hi>Tarquinius</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53869:38"/>
lopt off the heads of his poppies, but ye do not <hi>cut up the
roots.</hi>

                     </gap>, de irâ, ſed paulo ſecus applisat.</note> It may be ye go about to heave up your affections
in good duties ſometimes, as the key lifts up the ſpring in
the lock, but the key is no ſooner turned but down goes
the ſpring, ſo down go your affections preſently again.
And therefore I premiſe this as a firſt ground, ye can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſet your affections on God, till ye have gotten new
hearts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is this,<note place="margin">2. Ground Nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we feed on Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye can never ſet your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon God, unleſſe you feed upon Chriſt by faith.</hi> If ever
the ſoul feed upon Chriſt by faith, it cannot but ſet its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon God. I remember an invention of Queen
<hi>Artemeſia,</hi> who when her husband <hi>Mauſolus</hi> was dead,
not knowing how to keep him freſh in her affections as
long as ſhe lived, ſhe cauſed her husband <hi>Mauſolus</hi> his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be turned into aſhes, and mingled them in her drink;
ſo ſhe buried her husband in her bowels, and this way
ſhe took to keep her affections freſh unto him. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was unnatural in her, to eat and drink her own hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
but faith teacheth us to <hi>feed upon the Lord Ieſus
Chriſt:</hi> this will take off our affections from the world,
we ſhall never hunger after the world more, nor thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the things of this life more, if ever we feed upon him I
am the bread of life, ſaies Chriſt, <hi>he that cometh to me ſhall
never hunger, and he that beleeveth on me ſhall never thirſt,</hi>
Joh. 6. 35. If ever we beleeve the ſweetneſſe of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Chriſt, the pleaſantneſſe of the commandments of
Chriſt, the preciouſneſſe of the graces of Chriſt, and the
love of Chriſt, and the benefit of Chriſt, our affections
will be to him. Nothing can take off thy affections from
the world but faith in Chriſt. He that beleeveth in Chriſt
cannot ſet his affections upon the world. Can a man ſet
his affections upon the world, when he verily beleeves it
to be droſſe and dung in compariſon of Chriſt? Can he ſet
his affections upon earthly pleaſure, that beleeves it is
madneſſe? It is certain, men never beleeved in Chriſt ſince
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53869:38"/>
they were born, that ſet their affections upon the things
of the world; they have not one dram of Chriſt. Chriſt
is altogether lovely, <hi>Cant. 5. 16. He is all love,</hi> one that
commands the affections. Thou beleeveſt in the world
and not in Chriſt, if thou ſet thine affections upon any
other but Chriſt. Thou beleeveſt thou canſt have pleaſure
and delight in ſomething beſide Chriſt, profits and gains in
ſomething beſide Chriſt; eaſe, and content, and comfort
in ſomething beſide Chriſt; if thou ſet thine affections
upon any thing beſide Chriſt. Alas! thou canſt never ſet
thine affections upon Chriſt, as long as thou beleeveſt
not only in Chriſt. If thine earthly affections tranſport
thee to be earthly, fly under the wing of Chriſt, as Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
under the wing of the Hen, leſt the Kite devour
them. Theſe are the two Grounds that I give you. Firſt,
ye muſt have new hearts: and ſecondly, ye muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
in Chriſt, or elſe ye cannot ſet your affections upon
God.</p>
               <p>The foundation being layd,<note place="margin">Means to ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on God.</note> let me now help you
with ſome means to ſet your affections on God. I could
help you to abundance of means, but I deſire to help
you to ſuch means as are eaſier to uſe, then to ſet your
affections on God. For if they be not eaſier then this
duty, they cannot properly be ſaid to be helps to this
duty.</p>
               <p>The firſt then is this,<note place="margin">1. Pray to God to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the things of the world.</note> 
                  <hi>Often pray to God that he would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up our affections from the things of the world, and unite
them unto him.</hi> Our hearts are divided and ſcattered up
and down among the things of the world. Carnal friends
have ſome of your affections; our gains, and our livings,
and our maintenance, have other-ſome: our pleaſures and
delights, and fleſhly refreſhments, have other-ſome: our
earthly buſineſſes, and cares, and employments, our credit,
and the like: theſe have abundance of our affections. Thus
our hearts and affections are ſcattered up and down among
the things of the world; if ever we would have them ſet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53869:39"/>
upon God, we muſt be frequent in praier; that God
would unite together our ſcattered hearts, to ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
upon God. This was the practice of <hi>David,</hi> O
Lord, ſaies he, <hi>unite my heart to fear thy name,</hi> Pſa. 86. 11.
His heart was ſcattered up and down in a thouſand peeces.
Some peeces of his affections run after one thing, ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another. And therefore he praies God to unite his
heart together, to fear his Name. If God would once ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up his heart from all its vain haunts, and unite it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
then he could ſet his affections, his fear, and his
love, and his delight, and the reſt, upon Gods Name: <hi>Ieju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio
paſſiones corporis, oratione peſtes ſanandae ſunt mentis,</hi> ſaies
<hi>Hierom;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierom in Marcum.</note> as the affections of the body are to be healed by
faſting, ſo the affections of the ſoul are to be healed by
praier: as long as they are carnal, they are the plague and
peſtilence of the ſoul, and praier muſt heal them. As Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid to good <hi>Ridley,</hi> pray, pray, O pray, pray;
ſo may I ſay, Pray, pray, I beſeech you, pray unto God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,
again, I ſay, pray. I have not time to pray ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
I do pray in the morning and evening, but my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
are ſo many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may be thou objecteſt. Not
time enough, ſayſt thou? Finde out ſome odde times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
morning and evening: ſteal into ſome corner or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
belabour thy heart before God. O ſayſt thou, I
finde it a hard thing to ſtir up mine affections, I am a very
Stoick, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I have no affection, I cannot compel
mine affections to God. Canſt thou not? but thou canſt
compel thy heart for to pray; thou canſt tug and pull at
thy heart in thy praiers, and this will fetch up thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Praier is not only a mouth to beg Phyſick, but alſo
it is Phyſick it ſelf, whereby Chriſt cures the affections of
the heart. The poor beggar, the more he is driven to beg,
the more affectionate he is in deſcribing his miſeries: you
ſhall ſee ſome beggars to ſet forth their miſery, and cry ſo
lamentably, as it would burſt a mans heart with pity and
compaſſion, ones bowels would even yearn but to hear
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53869:39"/>
them. I doe not mean your lazie canting beggars, but
diſtreſſed <hi>Lazars</hi> indeed. So beloved, pray; if ever thou
be uſed to it, it <hi>will ſcrue up thy heart,</hi> and raiſe up thine
affections exceedingly. I doe not mean that lazie-hearted
and canting kinde of praying of moſt wretches, that hath
no more affection in it, then there is ſavour in the white
of an Egge. But ſet thy ſelf to prayer indeed, and by it
Chriſt will quicken thine affections. Alas! thy heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and ſcattered up and down among the things of the
world, and therefore ſtrive with God that he would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up all the peeces into one; thou muſt have all thine
affections and all the peeces of thy heart gathered up into
one, if thou wouldſt ſet them upon God. <hi>I will give them
one heart that they may fear me for ever,</hi> ſaies God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 39
your heart and the affections of your heart are divided
and ſcattered up and down into a thouſand peeces, one
upon one thing, another upon another; and God hath
promiſed that he will gather up your hearts into one, and
give you this ſame one heart, that ye may fear him and ſet
all your affections upon him; will ye miſſe ſuch a gracious
promiſe as this for want of asking it, and begging it, and
praying for it? this is the reaſon why men have ſuch
earthly affections as they have, becauſe they are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in praier to God to be helped! Prayer is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
help to winde up your affections to God. This is the
firſt, Often prayer to God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this,<note place="margin">2. Light up 2 Candle in thy heart.</note> 
                  <hi>Light up a candle in thy heart,</hi> that it
may ſee what to ſet thine affections on in God. Get know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God: <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> unknown unaffected;
thine affections are unruly, and thou canſt not rule them
to Godward, yea, but thou canſt get knowledge. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
will help thee exceedingly. The affections we ſee
plainly that come <hi>neareſt to reaſon,</hi> are ſooneſt of all ruled.
And the affections that are <hi>remoteſt from reaſon,</hi> are more
hard to be ruled. A man commonly will ſooner rule his
affections aright, then a woman or a childe, becauſe a man
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53869:40"/>
hath more reaſon. The Philoſophers ſhew this by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a Horſe or a Bul. A Horſe is ſooner tamed then
a Fiſh, becauſe a Horſe is more capable of knowledge and
of reaſon; as natural reaſon and knowledge can naturally
rule the affections, ſo ſpiritual reaſon and knowledge can
ſpiritually rule the affections. And therefore if thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rule thine affections aright to ſet them on God, labour
to know God, <hi>every one that loveth God knoweth God,</hi> 1 Joh.
47. He muſt muſt needs know God that loveth God, for
how can he ſet his affections of love upon God, if he doe
not know God? <hi>knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord,
we perſwade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. S. <hi>Paul</hi> perſwades the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the people, why? becauſe he knew the terrour
of the Lord, and he was able to make them to know it
too; and therefore hereby he endeavoured to perſwade
their affections to fear God and to ſerve him. <hi>They that
know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee,</hi> for thou never
forſakeſt them that ſeek thee, <hi>Pſal 9. 10. David</hi> ſpeaks pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,
they that know thy Name, they will place
their hope, and their truſt, and their confidence and all
their affections on thee. They will ſo certainly, if they
know thee, if once they know what a good God thou art,
how true of thy promiſe, how gracious to thy children,
how ſure a friend thou art, never forſaking them that ſeek
thee. He concludes it poſitively, they that know God will
ſet their affections on God. Can a coverous man know a

<hi>they give their hearts occaſions</hi> to be ſo; they are not choice

Rom. 14. 13. Occaſions to evil are all dangerous, as the

he preaches, he comes on Chriſts errand to wooe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53869:42"/>
thine affections to Chriſt. Chriſt does as a great Prince,
that minding to marry a wife out of a far Countrey, ſends
over his paranymphs to wooe for him, to get her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if it be poſſible. So beloved, we that are Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
we are Chriſts paranymphs, we preach to wooe your
affections to Chriſt. And therefore never miſſe the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, it's the wooing of your affections to
Chriſt; they ſay, women love to be much wooed. Love
then the preaching of the Word, that wooes thee and
wooes thee again and again. O what infinite need haſt
thou of coming continually to the Word; thine affections
are infinitely coy; this they muſt have, and that they muſt
have. Like a vain Damoſel, ſhe muſt have her geegaws,
and her faſhions, ſhe muſt have her pleaſure and her will,
and her eaſe, and thus it muſt be, and ſo it ſhall be, if ſhe
marry him, ſhe will not have the man elſe, He hath ſuch
adoe to get her affections, either he is too homely, or too
baſe, or too ſtrict, or too ill-favoured, or too poor, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
Now may be he hath her, and then her thoughts
change, then again ſhe is inclined, and then her affections
are off. My brethren, ſo it is with our ſouls; our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to this and that and I know not what. If Chriſt
will not let them have their pleaſures, and their eaſe, and
their profits, and their vanities, Chriſt is not for them. They
muſt have the credit in the world, they'l not be mockt at
for puritans and for hypocrites, they'l not deny father
nor mother, nor ſelf, nor any of theſe things, they are
loth to be held in ſo ſtrictly, as Chriſt doth indent. But
Chriſt will not marry us, unleſſe our affections be wholly
upon him. <hi>Bleſſed is he that is not offended in me.</hi> Many are
offended at the preciſeneſſe of his word, many at the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe
of the Croſſe, many at the ſhame of the world,
they are offended in Chriſt, their affections are quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe things. They are unwilling to be alwaies a talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sermons and of Heaven, to be alwaies a wracking

at when thou mayſt, thy conſcience tels thee thou mayſt
be at it, and wilt not, if there be any one Sermon, I ſay,
that thou wilt not be at, thou rejecteſt Chriſts paranymphs.
Like a croſſe mayd, that when her ſuiter comes to her, he
ſhall have no ſpeech with her, She will not be ſpoken with.
O what a provoking is this unto Chriſt? if thou wilt not
be ſpoken with, take heed leaſt the Lord Jeſus abhorre for
to own thee. Nay, if ſhe be ſo ſtrange forſooth, let her
keep her affections for who's will, I ſcorn to wooe her any
more. How long hath Chriſt wooed your affections! belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and yet he's pleaſed to wooe you. Bring hither your
affections, that here they may be wrought. Frequent the
Lords houſe, for here be Chriſts paranymphs: if ever your
affections can be gotten, here they may be won ſome time
or other. Many other means may be uſed to help you in
this task, namely, to ſet your affections on God. But theſe
may ſuffice for the preſent. <hi>Set your affections on things that

               <p>The ſeventh is this,<note place="margin">7. To be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of godlineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>to be abundant in the exerciſes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi>
We muſt be abundant in prayer, and in all other
exerciſes of godlineſſe. When <hi>Paul</hi> had exhorted good
<hi>Timothy</hi> to be exerciſed in godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. in the next
verſe, he gives him a reaſon why he ſo exhorts him. Becauſe
ſaies he, <hi>godlineſſe is profitable unto all things,</hi> If godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
be profitable for all things, then certainly its profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for this, to ſet our affections upon God. Abound then
in good duties, abound in good conference, abound in good
and gracious acquaintance, abound in godly meditations.
This was <hi>Davids</hi> means whereby his affections came to be
earneſt upon God. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my meditation
continually!</hi> Pſal. 119. 97. his affections were even wrapt
up in his God, O how love I thy Law! he was not able to
expreſſe how his affections were wrapt. O how love I thy
Law! How came they to be ſo? the reaſon was this, He
was abundant in godly meditations; It is my meditation
continually, <hi>Abundance in any thing, cauſes the affections to
abound.</hi> The voluptuous man is abundant in his pleaſures,
he abounds with his hunting, and hawking, and gaming,
and merriments, and therefore his affections are abundantly
ſet hereupon. The covetous man his minde abounds in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53869:45"/>
thinking of the world, his memory abounds with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the things of the world, his tongue abounds in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch matters, his labours and his cares abound in
this kinde, and therefore his affections are abundantly
ſet upon theſe things. There is nothing makes the affections
ſo exceſſive as abundance, Abound then in the exerciſes of
Gods worſhip, if thou wouldeſt have thine affections to
be abundant that way. Never think thou canſt <hi>pray enough;
hear enough, ſpeak holily enough,</hi> examine thy ſoul enough,
nor ſanctifie the Sabbath enough, never think thou canſt
reform enough, or do any duty enough. Men ſerve God
as little as they dare, they pray and hold out in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as little as they dare, they ſhew themſelves for God as
little as they dare, theſe mens affections can never be upon
God, becauſe they love not to be abundant in good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
thy heart is a great deep, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 64. 6. It is not a little
winding, or a little turning will fetch up a Bucket out of a
deep Well. So the heart I ſay is a great deep, a little pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and a little hearing, and a little amending will not
fetch up the affections from this great deep unto God, no,
Thou muſt be abundant in goodneſſe and in the duties of
goodneſſe, if thou wouldſt have thine affections ſet upon
God; provided alwaies that thy heart be renewed and
quickned, otherwiſe abundance will cloy thee. The more
thou prayeſt, the leſſe affections thou wilt have: the more
thou heareſt, and the more thou ſpeakeſt of Religion or
of grace, the more formall thou wilt be, thine affections
will be leſſe ſet hereupon. O my brethren, this is a curſed
craſis and diſpoſition of ſoul, <hi>to be ſpiritually cloyed</hi> in this
manner; abound and abound right, elſe its to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
if thou abound in good duties, and abound right,
this will ſet their affections upon God. Abound in a thing,
and be the thing never ſo bad, it will ſoon command thine
affections. Let a man be abundant in playing, drinking, or
abundant though it be but in the taking of hot waters, I
have known ſome their affections were ſo to it, that it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53869:46"/>
them. Beloved, abound then in good duties, this will
take off thine affections from the world, and ſet them on
God. This is the ſeventh means, to ſet our affections on God,
to be abundant in the duties of holineſſe.</p>
               <p>The eighth is this,<note place="margin">8. Dive down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> 
                  <hi>Labour to dive down to the bottom of
thine affections:</hi> the ſweeteſt is at bottom as we ſay. So the
affections that are ſweeteſt to the heart are at bottom. And
therefore dive down to the bottom and get up the bottom
of thine affections, and ſet them upon God; thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are never ſet upon God, till them at the bottom are ſet
upon God. A man may ſet the ſhallow of his affections
upon God, when the bottom is ſet upon the things of the
world. There is many a cloſe hypocrite, he thinks his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to the world are now dead; but they are not dead;
the Fox ſeems often to be dead, to ſeize the more cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on his prey. So the affections will ſeem to be dead to the
world, that ſo they may be the more cunning to feed upon
the things of the world; they ſeem to be dead, that is, the
ſhallow of them ſeems ſo, but the bottom ſtill is alive to
the world, that is not ſet upon God. Beloved, a man may
ſet the ſhallow of his affections upon a thing, which the
bottom of his affections doth hate. See this in <hi>Ammon,</hi> his
affections were to <hi>Thamar,</hi> and he loved her. O he would
ſeem to be ſick for her. I, the ſhallow of his affections were
to her, but anon, out comes the bottom: when the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of his affections once did come out, then he did hate
her. He hated her worſe then he loved her, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13 15.
dive down then to the bottom of thine affections, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with all might to get up the bottom, and ſet them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God. Here's a man, he hath good affections to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and amendment, good affections to be godly and
have grace; he reforms much, and he profeſſes much; you
would wonder to ſee this man a year hence to perſecute
the Miniſter, and to oppoſe Gods people and make a
mock of the power of Religion: but this you may ſee, if
the bottom of his affections be not got up and ſet upon God.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53869:46"/>
Get up the bottom, and ſet that upon God, or it is nothing.</p>
               <p>There be three means to get up the bottom of thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,<note place="margin">Means to get up the bottom of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
and ſet them upon God.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>Be humbled after all thy turning unto God,</hi> this will
get up the bottom of thine affections to God. A wicked
man before he is turned unto God may be humbled;<note place="margin">1. Be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled after thy turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God.</note> as
<hi>Ahab</hi> was humbled, and <hi>Iudas</hi> was humbled, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
too, and many other ſinners they are humbled before ever
they have turned from their ſins. When once they have
turned from their prophaneneſſe, and their impieties, then
they begin to think well of themſelves, now they are well,
think they: indeed before ever they are turned, they may
be humbled. Thus a drunkard and a whoremonger may be
humbled, thus a mocker and a prophane perſon may be
humbled, their conſciences may pull them by the throat as
long as they live in theſe ſins, and then their affections are
ſtirred exceedingly: they may weep, and ſigh, and groan,
and tremble, and be aſhamed of their doings; they may be
humbled thus before they are turned: but when they are
once turned from theſe ſinnes, then they begin to be quiet
and ſecure, and to hope well, Alas! alas! the bottom is not
up yet. But if thou wouldſt get up the bottom of thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
be humbled after all thy turnings to God. So it
was with good <hi>Ephraim: Surely after that I was turned, I
repented: and after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my
thigh, I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded,</hi> Jer. 31. 19. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
was humbled after that he was turned. It was not
before he was turned, but after he was turned, he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and was humbled. This got up the very bottom of his
affections and all unto God. See how full of affections he
was. <hi>He ſmote upon his thigh,</hi> he was in a holy rage at his own
ſoul, he bluſhed, he was aſhamed, yea, he was even ſmitten
with confuſion of face before God. All the bottom of his
affections was up, <hi>his zeal his ſorrow, his ſhame,</hi> and the whole
bottom of all came up then, becauſe he was thus humbled.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Keep no cloſe luſt unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> 
                  <hi>Keep no cloſe luſt, no corruption in ſecret unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53869:47"/>
As this is a means to get up all the bottom of our
affections, and ſet them upon God, ſo it is a ſign too whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we do ſo or no. For when a man is willing to be ſearcht,
who may be was ſuſpected of ſtealing, if he be willing to
be ſearcht, to have his pockets, and his houſe ſearcht, and
his coffers ſearcht, and all his haunts ſearcht; Search me,
ſayes he, I have it not: he that is willing thus to be ſearcht,
it is a ſign he hath not ſtoln it. So it was with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt:</hi>
for having ſayd that his affections were ſet upon God,
and againſt them that were againſt God: he bids God
ſearch him, and ſee if he could finde that it was contrary.
<hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart,</hi> or as ſome tranſlations
have it, and <hi>try the ground or the bottom of my heart,</hi> ſee if
there be any way of wickedneſſe in me,<note place="margin">Vid. v. 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23, 24. As
if he had ſaid: If I have any ſecret corruption that I favour
my ſelf in, I confeſſe the bottom of mine affections is rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
but I am willing to be ſearcht; Search me, O God,
and try the ground, or the bottom of my heart, and ſee if
it be not ſo as I profeſſe it to be; I ſay, as this is a means,
ſo it is a ſign too. A means it is to get up the bottom of
the affections, and ſet them upon God. For as long as a man
hath any ſecret luſt, any bottom corruption which he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
himſelf in, he can never ſet the bottom of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly conſider,<note place="margin">3. Conſider God will ſhame thee one day, if the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom be not ſound.</note> 
                  <hi>God will ſhame thee one day, if the bottom
be not ſound;</hi> thou mayeſt have good affections for the
while, and be held for a very good Chriſtian, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profeſſour: but if thine affections be not ſolid and
ſound at the bottom, God will ſhame thee. Though the
Apple look never ſo well, yet if it be not ſound at the core,
at laſt it will be manifeſt. Though the Egge look never ſo
lovely, yet if it be addle within, at laſt it ſhall appear. God
will unmask thee one day, and make it appear thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were never right at the bottom. This <hi>David</hi> uſed as a
means to provoke him to get a ſound heart at the bottom.
<hi>Let my heart be ſound in thy ſtatutes, that I be not aſhamed,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53869:47"/>
Pſal. 119 80. The affection of ſhame a man would be loth
to be put to, and he knew he ſhould be put to it one time
or other, if he were not ſound at the bottom: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he labours with God, that his heart might be ſound
in his ſtatutes, he was not content to have good affections
that way, but he labours to have ſound and ſolid affections
that might be ſound at the bottom. That I be not aſhamed,
ſayes he, What a ſhame will it be to ſee thee a damned Goat
at Chriſts left hand, that now art eſteemed a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?
If thou beeſt not right at the bottom, ſo it will be. <hi>Give
me leave to tell you one thing that occurred in an experience of
mine own.</hi> I was once a ſaying to a Gentleman who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
affected at the Word, and profeſſed great love
to my Miniſtry, and that he would defend it, and make
much of the Word: O (ſaid I) there be many that yet
ſeem very forward to approve of the Word, and to defend
it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that when the Word comes to meet with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſins, and gives them no reſt in their conſciences, I fear
me will ſet againſt Miniſter, and Word, and all ere it be
long. O no, God forbid (ſayes he) I were unworthy to
live, if I ſhould do ſo: Well, well (ſaid I) I pray God it
may not be ſo as I ſay: but mark it, and peradventure you
ſhall ſee it with your eyes. Within one fortnight, this
Gentleman that ſeemed to be ſuch a friend at my firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Pariſh, being met with in a Sermon, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſin (a ſin I little imagined he was guilty of) to be
reproved and condemned in the Pulpit, he never would be
known to me more, but oppoſed me as long as I ſtayed
there: he was affected, but his affections were not ſound
at the bottom, and therefore he came to this ſhame; God
grant it have humbled him by this time, if now he be alive.
It is a good rule in morality,<note place="margin">Regula moralis.</note> 
                  <hi>Affectus mendaciter ſe ſubjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt
rationi:</hi> The affections will fain a ſubmiſſion to right
reaſon. It is true in Divinity, the affections will ſeem to
ſubmit unto grace, when they do not. For as long as the
bottom is not ſound, they cannot be ſet truly upon God:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53869:48"/>
they are nothing but flaſhes, like pluſhes of water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſhowr, that are dried up quickly. This is the eighth
means to ſet our affections on God, to get up the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of our affections, and ſet them on God.</p>
               <p>Beloved,<note place="margin">It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to uſe all theſe means.</note> theſe are the means whereby ye may ſet your
affections on God: now ſee how nearly it concerns you to
uſe all theſe means, and to make conſcience of this duty:
and this will appear, if ye conſider theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the bonds of the ſoul.</note> 
                  <hi>The affections are the bonds of the ſoul,</hi> that is, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
whereby it is faſt bound unto ſin: thou canſt never
repent nor be ſaved, as long as thine affections are not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Can a priſoner go that is faſt bound in the ſtocks?
Thine earthly and carnal affections faſt binde thee in ſinne,
if theſe bonds be not broken, thou canſt never go to God.
When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw a carnal affection in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,
preſently he tels him, <hi>I perceive thou art in the gall of
bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity,</hi> Act. 8. 23. He does not
ſay only, in iniquity, but alſo in the bond of iniquity: for
his carnal affection was a bond, and he was faſt bound in
his ſins. The Prophet preaches hell and damnation againſt
ſuch men, and ſuch women: for alas! how can they get
out, when they are bound and corded to their pleaſures,
and the things of the world? <hi>Wo unto them that draw ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
with cords of vanity, and ſin as it were with a cart-rope,</hi>
Iſa. 2. 18. Great carts are drawn by the cart-ropes; ſo all
a mans ſins are drawn to him by theſe cords.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
expounds theſe words, both of their ſinnes and their woes;
they draw both them. The cords of our affections are the
hearts tyers to ſin, they do even tye the ſoul unto ſin, that
it cannot get looſe. Wo is to them, ſayes the Lord. Be the
affections all like unto bonds, and cords, and cart-ropes, to
tye the heart to ſin? What a woful caſe are ye in, till your
affections are ſet right! look what ye tie them unto, that do
ye draw after you; if you faſten them on the things of this
life, them ye draw after you; if ye faſten them on Grace, and
on Chriſt and his Word, them ye pull after you. Never was
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53869:48"/>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſo faſt bound with <hi>Delilahs</hi> withs, as he was with
his affections to <hi>Delilah,</hi> ſayes <hi>Gregory.</hi> Ah poor ſlaviſh
ſoul, thou art in the Devils ſtocks: as long as thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not faſtened aright, thou art heart-bound, and ſoul-bound,
and conſcience-bound, thou art faſt bound in his
cage. How neerly then concerneth it you all, to get your
affections to be ſet upon? Ye are even the ſlaves and bond-ſlaves
of hell: and therefore as ever ye deſire to flie from
the vengeance to come, uſe all theſe means with all conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that ye may ſet your affections on God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe earthly affections are the fore-ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the heart.</note> 
                  <hi>Earthly affections are the fore-ſtallings of the
heart,</hi> the heart is prepoſſeſt already with the things of this
life, and is prejudicate againſt the things that are above,
and therefore there is no hope to perſwade you, as long as
your affections are ſet upon the things of this life. When
our Saviour Chriſt perceived how the Phariſees affections
hawkt after credit and honour from men, being prepoſſeſt
with deſire of humane applauſe, he tels them plainly they
could never beleeve, nor ſeek the honour of God. Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
beleeve, ſayes he: how can ye beleeve which receive
honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from God only? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 44. It is a grievous thing to be
prejudicate and prepoſſeſt with another good beſide God.
It is a miſerable task to be to reaſon with a prejudicate
man, he will not yield, no, by no means will he yield, when
once he is prejudicate. As long as our affections are ſet on
the world, our hearts are prejudicate: and therefore go
we about the means preſcribed, whereby our affections
may be ſet at rights; never till then can we hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
you, or to work any good on your ſouls.</p>

ſo? the Exangeliſt makes anſwer in the next verſe, for <hi>he

what ſhall we do?</hi> the Souldiers alſo, whoſe affections are as
hard to be moved as any, yet they cried out too, and <hi>what
ſhall we do?</hi> Luk. 3. 14. This uſe is plainly grounded on my
Text. Gods Miniſters ye know are Gods Inſtruments to
bring men to faith and repentance, and reconcile them
to God: and therefore if this be your duty, to ſet your
affections on God, we muſt labour to work on your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to provoke you to doe it. The reaſons of it are
theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> Becauſe <hi>the Word is full of affections;</hi> full of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of love to wooe a man to God,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe the Word is full of affections.</note> full of affections of pity
to yern upon men in their miſery, full of affections of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
to terrifie the wicked; and therefore that Miniſter that
preaches not affectionately, preaches but one half of the
Word, he preaches but the dead corps of the Truth, as I
may call it: he does not preach the life and the ſoul of the
truth. The affections of a ſpeech are the ſoul of a ſpeech,
both make up the whole of the Word. Is not my Word
like unto fire, and like a hammer that breaketh the rocks in
peeces? <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 29. If the Word be a fire, he that delivers it
coldly, delivers the Word otherwiſe then it is. Would you
not ſay that a man were ridiculous, who when his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
houſe is on fire, ſhould go and coldly adviſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in this manner; O my dear neighbours, you ſhould do
well to look to your houſes, leſt fire fall upon them, as
now of late I underſtood it hath done; I pray let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you to provide water, otherwiſe all your goods and
mine too will be conſumed to aſhes: it is true that this man
ſayes; but would not men deem him a fool? the truth, is
the truth of affection, and he leaves out the affection of
the truth. Nature hath taught us another courſe in ſuch a
caſe, He would run crying into the ſtreet, fire, fire, help,
help, for the Lords ſake; water, water, in all haſte, alas!
alas! we are undone, quickly, ſpeedily, run for ladders;
pull down this rafter here, cut down that beam there, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile

of the truth: the like muſt a Miniſter do, who knowing
his people wallow in ſin, in the ſtate of hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as many as go on in their courſes, he ought not with
filed phraſes and mellow-mouthed words, nor with cold
exhortations admoniſh his hearers, but he muſt put in the
affection of the Word in his Sermons: he muſt cry fire, fire,
the fire of hell is among you, the fire is kindled, ſin is entred
into the ſoul: O the water of tears, tears, repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
help your ſelves for Gods ſake: the devil ſtands
ready to devour you, death watches unawares to ſtrike
you, hell-mouth gapeth to ſwallow you; look about you,
ſtirre your ſelves and conſider, or ye periſh in a moment.
Leave off your ryots, down with your pleaſures, away
with your vanities, put on Chriſt quickly, work out your
ſalvation with fear and trembling. See ye not men die dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before you on a ſudden, falling to hell, haſte, haſte,
flatter not your ſouls, time is uncertain, the danger is too
certain, the puniſhment eternal, damnation is intolerable.
Thus muſt a Miniſter preach this truth, It is a truth full of
affection, the affection muſt be delivered as well as the body
of the truth. All the imaginations of the thoughts of mans
heart are only evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gen 6. 5. As this is a truth, ſo there
is a great deal of affection in this truth, the affection of
loathing. Do we think when the Lord ſaid it, he ſaid it
coldly and nakedly; all the imaginations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, he ſaid
it with a great deal of affection, of loathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
Jeruſalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O that thou hadſt known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As
this is a truth, ſo there is a great deal of affection in this
truth, affection of pity. There is a great deal of affection
in every threatning, a great deal of affection in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
a great deal of affection in every promiſe, in every
truth. Chriſt does not bid us preach the letters, and ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables,
and propoſitions of his Word, but his Word. Now
my Word is like fire, ſayes God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fire is the ſtirringeſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53869:50"/>
of all elements, and therefore if there be any feeling
at all in you, the Word is able to ſtir you, even as if ye
had a fire in your bowels. Beloved, either we that are Gods
Miniſters are unskilful to handle the Word, or elſe ye are
ſenſeleſſe and ſtupid, if ye do not ſit upon hot coals for to
hear it: it will make the drunkards heart ake to hear what
this Word ſayes to him: it will make the worldlings heart
ake, and the ſecure Chriſtians heart ake. The Word is fire,
<hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he opened to us the
Scriptures?</hi> Luk. 24. 32. The Word did ſo inflame their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
that their hearts burned to hear it. Does not
the godly heart burn to hear the ſweetneſſe of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?
and burn when the Scriptures are opened to direct
thee? And ſo on the other ſide, does not the Uſurers heart
burn, when the Scriptures are opened that rip up his ſins?
Does not the carnal profeſſors heart burn now and then
as he ſits, when the Scriptures are opened to ſhew him his
rottenneſſe? there be ſuch ſcorching texts in the Word;
texts of death, texts of judgement, texts of hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
they may well make a wicked heart burn for to hear
them; and therefore the Word being ſo full of affection, a
Miniſter that preaches it, muſt needs be an affectionate
preacher, if he be a true preacher, otherwiſe he doth not
preach the whole Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">3. The word looks to be obeyed with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> As the Word is full of affection it ſelf, <hi>ſo it
looks that a man ſhould be full of affection that obeys it.</hi> God
loves no other obedience, but obedience with affection; <hi>he
loves a cheerful giver.</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 7. So God loves a cheerful
obeyer, a cheerful repenter, a cheerful beleever; whatever
we do in his ſervice, he loves we ſhould do it with affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Should a Miniſter preach without any affection, happily
he may reaſon men out of many of their ſins, and prevail
with them to take up the duties of religion, but all would
be <hi>formality, without any affection.</hi> It is a good ſaying of
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> the godly muſt have affections in obedience, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they are not obedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53869:51"/>
There be two things in every Commandment of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The duty commanded to be done, Fear God and
keep his Commandments. This is the whole duty, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
12. 13. That is, there is never a duty that a man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him, but it is within the compaſs of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God. So that in every Commandment there is a
duty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſtrength of affection wherein the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
commands it, and therefore the Commander com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it, and therefore the Commandment is called <hi>Gods
will.</hi> Teach me to do thy will, O God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 143. 10. It is
called <hi>Gods pleaſure, Bleſſe the Lord ye Miniſters of his that
do his pleaſure,</hi> Pſa. 103. 21. It is called Gods <hi>deſire, Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiredſt
truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſ. 51. 6. Becauſe the ſtrength
of Gods will and deſire, and pleaſure, and affection lies in
it. Theſe two things being in every Commandment of God,
it follows of neceſſity, that a man muſt have his affections
in obedience, otherwiſe he is not obedient. As God doth
not only command me, but alſo with affection he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
me: ſo I muſt not only do the thing he commands,
but with all affection I muſt do it, or elſe I never obey him.
<hi>Virtuti immitte furorem,</hi> ſayes <hi>Homer, Adde affections to thy
vertue,</hi> Vertue is no vertue without the affections, prayer
is no prayer without thine affections be in it, repentance is
no repentance without thine affections be in it. Whatſoever
duty thou doſt, if thou doſt it not with all thine affections,
it is abomination to God: and therefore the Miniſter that
preaches muſt ſtir up affections: if he do not ſtir up affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the religion he begets in the hearts of his hearers, is
likely to be little better then wretched formality.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Men are very dull in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Word.</note> As the Word is full of affection it ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
affection in them that obey it, <hi>ſo men are very dull in
affection to embrace it;</hi> they are <hi>dull of hearing,</hi> Heb. 5. 11.
They have dull ears, and dull hearts, and dull affections:
tell them they ſhall periſh becauſe they doe not repent;
they will be damned becauſe they will not obey: they ſhall
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53869:51"/>
be ſaved that will; they are like <hi>Gallio,</hi> they care for none
of theſe things; and therefore now we that are Miniſters,
muſt ſtrive to make them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are whether they will or no. <hi>Cry
aloud,</hi> ſayes God, <hi>ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet,
ſhew my people their tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſa. 58. 1. Do not only ſay
a Sermon to them, but <hi>cry it:</hi> nor only ſo, but <hi>cry aloud,</hi>
they are deaf: ſpare not, thou wilt never ſtir them if thou
ſpareſt. Spare not, ſpare neither rich nor poor, neither
great nor ſmall, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, that is,
preach ſo, that if it be poſſible, thou mayſt move their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
It is a ſimilitude taken from the Trumpet in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
though the Souldier be faint-hearted, it will ſtir him
up with affection to fight. Great <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo ſtirred
up at the trumpetting of one <hi>Antigenida</hi> an admirable trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petter,
that all his couragious affections were up, and his
fingers did itch to be fighting. So lift up thy voice like a
Trumpet, ſtirre them up, if by any means thou canſt. O
they are very dull and ſenſeleſſe, and hard to be affected,
and therefore we muſt ſtudy how to work on their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>If ye ask me how muſt the Miniſter ſtir up affections? I
anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt not ſtir up affections by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words of mans wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> Negatively, not with the enticing words of mans
wiſedom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. Some men indeed out of theſe words
do gather, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemned all eloquence and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
preaching. But this cannot be, that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
that which he moſt ſhewed himſelf, moſt of all the
Apoſtles of Chriſt. He was ſuch an eloquent golden mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, that the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> thought he had been another
<hi>Mercury,</hi> he was ſuch a ſweet ſpeaker, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 12. He was
ſuch an <hi>affectionate Orator,</hi> that he made <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s bowels
even earn to be a Chriſtian, and <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
conceived him to be gifted with ſuch an admirable power
this way of Almighty God, that it was one of his three
wiſhes, if he might have it for wiſhing; namely, to hear
S. <hi>Paul to preach in a Pulpit;</hi> and therefore he does not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53869:52"/>
condemn all affectionate and eloquent preaching; but he
condemns that flattering kinde of affected Rhetorick,
whereby men that preached themſelves, tickled mens ears,
and delighted them with luſcious phraſes of Oratory;
handling ſuch points as might pleaſe the phantaſies of their
hearts, rather then to convince them of their ſins: thinking
it too preciſe, too baſe to preach of mens damnable eſtate
and condition in ſin, the curſe of the Law that all men are
under till they be new creatures in Chriſt; the taking up
of Chriſts Croſſe: to be hated, and mocked, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all men, for Chriſts ſake and his Goſpel. Theſe
points, they either thought to be too ruſtick, and burly,
and auſtere, or they ſugred them over with their comments,
and tickled the people with more <hi>velvet-like</hi> paſſages of
mercy. I ſay, this kinde of eloquence, and this kinde of
preaching, with the enticing words of mans wiſedom, does
the Apoſtle condemn, and therefore I doe not mean this.
How then muſt a Miniſter ſtirre up affections? I anſwer,
he muſt ſtir up affections five waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. A Miniſter muſt ſtirre up affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by preaching to the life.</note> 
                  <hi>By preaching to the life,</hi> As a Painter then paints a
man well, when he paints him to the life; he paints it ſo
to the life, as if it were a living man indeed So then does
a Preacher preach affectionately, when he preaches to the
life; when he preaches of hell, he preaches to the life, as
if hell were before mens eyes; when he preaches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as if the people did ſee it with their eyes as it were.
As King <hi>Iames</hi> ſaid of a good preacher in this Kingdom;<note place="margin">A ſaying of K. <hi>Iames</hi>
                  </note>
this Preacher, ſaies he, preaches <hi>as if death were at my back:</hi>
ſo a good Preacher preaches to the wicked, as if vengeance
were at their backs, as if hell were at their backs; he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to the godly as if Chriſt were at their backs, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at their backs. If this kinde of preaching will not work
on mens affections, their affections are bewitcht, <hi>O fooliſh
Galatians, who hath bewitcht you, that ye ſhould not obey the
truth, before whoſe eyes Ieſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet
forth, crucified among you?</hi> Gal. 3. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> among them had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53869:52"/>
preached Chriſt to the life; ſo evidently, and ſo plainly,
had he preached Chriſt crucified, as if they had ſeen him
crucified before their eyes. Certainly thought he, theſe
peoples affections are bewitched, that are no better wrought
on. When <hi>Galba</hi> would perſwade the Spaniards againſt
<hi>Nero</hi> for his cruelty, he ſet out ſo viſibly his cruelty, that
they might even ſee it with their eyes. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the difference of good education and of bad, that the
people might even ſee it with their eyes. Not as though
preachers ſhould do as they did, or as ſome that I have
read of, have done; who brought a dead skull into the
pulpit, that the people might ſee death even with their
eyes. We have no ſuch warrant in Scripture; but they muſt
do it with the lively teaching of the truth. And therefore
the Apoſtle ſayes, that true preaching is in the <hi>demonſtration
of the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 4. When the truth is demonſtrated
with evidence.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. By being full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections himſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>By being full of affections himſelf:</hi> Affection in the

be otherwiſe, ſaies <hi>Cicero. Cicero</hi> being an excellent ſpokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whenever he pleaded before the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

<hi>Act.</hi> 21. 13. it burſt his very heart to ſee others ſtand weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about him. There be many clamorous Preachers, ſayes
<hi>Calvin,</hi> who declaim againſt the ſins of the people, and
thunder againſt the iniquities of their Pariſh, and make as
though they had a great deal of zeal, that never move a jot;
the affections of the people are not ſtirred up a whit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the people ſee plainly, through all their actings and
vehement enforcements, that ſuch Miniſters are not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves, but only exerciſe their ſides and their throat,
as if they would act it on a ſtage. But O, ſayes he, labour
to mourn for their ſins in thine heart, before thou labour
to move them. Be thou more affected thy ſelf, then thou
undertakeſt to affect them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo move the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and <hi>Damaris,</hi> and others at <hi>Athens,</hi> that
the Text ſayes, they clave to S, <hi>Paul.</hi> Certain <hi>men clave to
him, and beleeved,</hi> Act. 17. 34. He preached ſo movingly,
that their affections did even cleave to him as he preached.
How came it about that he ſtirred up affections in them?
look into the 16. verſe, and there you ſhall ſee he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected himſelf. His ſpirit was ſtirred in him, ſayes S.
<hi>Luke,</hi> when he ſaw the city wholly given to idolatry. He
could not have ſtirred up affections in them, if he had not
been filled with affections himſelf. O beloved, our hearts

was not then in vain, that the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Titus</hi> to look
to his own life.<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>In all things ſhew thy ſelf a pattern,</hi> ſayes
he, a patern of good works. For if the Miniſter that preaches
be not a good pattern to his people, his Sermons will not
be ſo able to ſtir up affections in their hearts. <hi>Paſce verbo,
paſce exemplo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gregory.</note> ſayes <hi>Gregory:</hi> we muſt feed them by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and feed by our example: this is the way to ſtir up
affections in our hearers. It is true, the people ought to be
ſtirred up by the Word, in whoſe mouth ſoever it be, and
it is their fault that they be not, but yet it will never be ſo:
the Miniſters contrary life in any particular, as it is curſed
of God, ſo likewiſe it is a ſcandalous thing unto others,
and an infinite occaſion of offence, and takes off the edge
of the Word. Yea, commonly it does more hurt then all
the preaching can do good. For thus men will argue, If it
be neceſſary to live as he ſayes, then why does not he live
ſo himſelf? He hath more learning then I, and the like:
nay, they call the Word into queſtion, and hoodwink their
ſouls with preſumptuous pretences. Thus millions of ſouls
are gone to hell with their Miniſter for company: <hi>Malus
Miniſter eſt niſus Diaboli,</hi> It is a true ſaying of a Father,
An evil Miniſter is the devils Goſ-Hawk or Sparrow-Hawk.
He goes a birding for hell. But why ſpeak I of theſe things
among you whom it concerneth not? Yea, it concerns you
much every way. For as it is a curſe to a Pariſh that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53869:55"/>
is wicked, ſo is the Pariſh tied as ever they love their
own ſouls, to pray unto God that he would ſanctifie their
Miniſter more and more, that the Word may runne and
be glorified, for the life of the Miniſter hath a great
hand in moving the affections. The holieſt Miniſters move
moſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. A Miniſter may ſtirre up affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by his voice.</note> 
                  <hi>By the due carriage of their voices,</hi> when the
Miniſter is affected himſelf: I do not ſay it is alwaies ſo,
for ſome have not the ſame command of themſelves
through accidental reaſons: but commonly when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
is affected himſelf, the inward affections of his own
breaſt diſpoſe the voice into ſome gracious manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the ſame. As <hi>Paul</hi> that was full of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for the peoples ſinnes, he for the moſt part preached
with a weeping voice, <hi>Many walk,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>of whom I have
told you often, and now again tell I you even weeping, they are
enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19. and truly if we conſider the iniquities of the
times, and the ſinnes of moſt men, how lamentable their
conditions be, no other affection better ſuits then this. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
flebiliter,</hi> ſayes <hi>Bucolcerus</hi> to a preather, ſpeak mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and ſorrowfully, the very voice it ſelf will ſomewhat
mollifie the affections of the people. Certainly it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, and very moving, to ſpeak according to
the point in hand. To ſpeak compaſſionately in points of
pity, to ſpeak rejoycingly in points of comfort, to ſpeak
moſt terribly in points of terror. As <hi>Cato</hi> adviſed that ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
ſhould terrifie their enemies with terrible voices. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it amiſs, that when the Miniſter threatens the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God againſt rebellious ſinners, he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his voice accordingly. I know not what hidden occult
influence the voice hath into the affections, ſaith S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
but a great influence it hath. When a Miniſter goes
dreamingly on, the people ſit careleſly and regard it not,
and let him ſay never ſo good matter, they heed it not; let
him threaten, or comfort, or command, or reprove, they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53869:55"/>
reſpect all alike, for they ſee no difference in the Miniſter,
I know the people ſhould not do thus, but ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of men, thus they will doe; now God hath given
many of his meſſengers more wakening voices, as petty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
to provoke mens affections ſomewhat the more.
And truly we are bound to make conſcience thereof, that
our very voice may be a comment upon our matter; 'twas
a pretty ſtory of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch. in Demoſt.</note> when one told him that he
was beaten and miſuſed exceedingly by ſuch a companion.
It ſeems he told it ſo by rote as we ſay, ſhewing no affection
at all in his telling: Why? ſayes <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi> hath he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thee? I do not beleeve he hath beaten hee. No? ſayes
the man: he was much troubled to hear him deny it, and
ſo he ſpake eagerly and in a chafe, I am ſure he beat me,
thus he did, and thus he did, and do you not call this beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
now I beleeve, ſayes <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> I beleeve now he
hath beaten thee indeed, now I hear the voice of a man
that was beaten. So if we ſhould dreamingly utter our
voice, and reprove our hearers, they ſcarce beleeve they are
reproved, becauſe they do not hear the voice of a reprover.
Let us deliver uſes of terror to them, they hardly beleeve
any terrour in it, becauſe they do not hear the voice of
terrour. But when the Miniſter is affected aright, and his
affections direct the carriage of the voice along, the voice
it ſelf does more ſignificantly expreſſe the matter; and this
no queſtion is very moving.</p>
               <p>But then let me tell you, if this be it ye look for, and if ye
can be carping at a Miniſter for the want of this, what the
Lord accounts of you. He ſets it as a brand upon the wicked
Jews that they were affected with the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi>
pleaſant voice, when they were affected with little elſe, <hi>Ez.</hi>
33 32. even a rare and a worthy <hi>Moſes</hi> may be defective in
this caſe, and wo is the people that findeth fault. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
be the voice of a godly Miniſter never ſo mean, yet
there will be ever ſome hidden grace in it, whereby
more or leſſe, it appears unto the conſciences of them
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53869:56"/>
that have ears to hear. This is the fourth thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a Miniſter may ſtir up affections, by the due carriage of
his voice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. By a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I might adde <hi>by a decent action.</hi> For my part, I
have little reaſon to name it, but verily, it is a bleſſing of
Chriſt to them that have it, for they have a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over the affections of their hearers. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayes, ſome
were eſteemed <hi>viri diſerti,</hi> eloquent and moving men, but
for want of action they could not put their gifts in practiſe,
<hi>habiti ſunt infantes,</hi> they were eſteemed infants in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
ſayes he. Action we ſee is much employed in the
preaching of the Prophets and the holy men of God. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi>
was commanded to <hi>ſtamp with the feet, Iſaiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to go naked, <hi>Ieremy</hi> commanded to put a yoke on
his neck. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was <hi>tota vox,</hi> he was all-voice; <hi>the
voice of a cryer in the wilderneſſe,</hi> Mat. 3. 3. his eyes ſpake,
and his face ſpake, his hands ſpake, and his body ſpake,
yea, his life, and dyet, and all ſpake, he was all-voice. The
Prophets ſtreched <hi>forth their hands</hi> to the people in fulneſſe
of affection. <hi>I have ſpread forth my hands all the day unto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
people,</hi> Iſa. 65. 2. S. <hi>Paul ſet his eyes upon Elymas the
ſorcerer,</hi> Act. 13. 9. <hi>O full of ſubtlety, and all miſchief, thou
childe of the devil, thou enemy of all righteouſneſſe, wilt thou
not ceaſe to pervert the right waies of the Lord? the Lords hand
is upon thee, and thou ſhalt be blinde,</hi> &amp;c. It is counted a grand
ſin in old <hi>Eli,</hi> that he did not frown on his ſonnes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
3. 13. why does the Text expreſs <hi>Elies</hi> not ſeverely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his ſons, by this action of frowning? but only becauſe
they that do ſeverely threaten, do uſe to frown, Thus ye
ſee how that Gods Miniſters have uſed action to move affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

they are very many in number.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or the Checker-wiſe order
of the affections. As they are many, ſo they are complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and platted one within another, that look what they
are ſet on, they knit the heart to it.</p>
               <p>The third is, the degree the affections are in, in regard of
other acts of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, the extremity of the affections, which
is zeal. From all theſe four heads I will ſhew you the
wofull aggravation of this ſin, not to ſet our affections on
God.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. If a man ſets his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on the earth, he ſets all his affections on it.</note> From the multitude and multiplicity of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
a man cannot ſet his affections upon earth, but he
muſt ſet them all upon earth: the affections they all go
together, and are many. Not only four, as <hi>Boethius</hi> doth
count them: nor only five, as <hi>Galen</hi> does reckon them: nor

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53869:57"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſayes they are innumerable, without queſtion
they are many. Now, what a wofull aggravation is this of
this ſin, to ſet thine affections on the earth! Thou ſetteſt
all thine affections thereon, if thou ſetteſt one thou ſetteſt
all; for they all go together. Like the Angels that ſinned,
they all fell together, So when the affections fell off from
God, they all fell together. Like the two eyes of the body,
they both look one way; like the two ears, one doth not
hear one ſound, and another another. If thou loveſt thoſe
things that are carnal, it is certain thy deſires are all carnal,
thy joys, and delights, and thy hopes are all carnal, thy
fears, and thy griefs, and thy ſorrows are all carnall; if one
of them be ſet on the things here on earth, all are: were
there but one affection that way, it were the leſſe; but if
thine affections be ſet upon theſe things, not one, nor two,
nor ten, but numberleſſe multitudes, whole ſwarms of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are all earthly. Thou art altogether brutiſh and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,

are toſt up and down all the day long, <hi>tanquam pila diaboli,</hi>
as the devils tennis-bals, as <hi>Odo</hi> ſpeaks: from worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
unto wordly deſires, from deſires unto fears, from
fears unto melancholies, from melancholies to angers and
vexations, from them again unto carnal comforts? theſe
are all like a legion of devils that hurry thee up and down
till thou art hurried to hell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If thine affections be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
they are a legion of devils to drive thee. It is a merry
devil that makes thee ſo greedy of pleaſure and of mirth;
a ſurly devil, that makes thee ſo cholerick and touchy; a
giddy devil, that makes thee ſo fearful and timorous; an
unclean devil, that makes thee ſo deſirous of drinking and
company-keeping. Anger and wrath is a devil; <hi>Let not the
ſoul go down upon thy wrath, neither give place to the devil,</hi>
Eph. 4. 26, 27. That is, do not give way to thy wrath, when
thou giveſt way to thy earthly deſires, thou giveſt way to
the devil. When thou giveſt way to thine earthly delights,
and thy ſorrow, and thy melancholy, thou giveſt way to
the devil. Look how many earthly affections thou haſt
that thou giveſt the way to, ſo many devils are in thee. Doſt
thou think thou art a childe of God, when thy conſcience
tels thee, that ſuch and ſuch earthly affections have way
in thy heart? alas! thou haſt a devil. Be ſober, for your
adverſary the devil, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. mark, every giddy affection
is a devil, our adverſary the devil comes with it. Yea, ſo
many earthly affections, ſo many devils, and wilt thou ſet
thine affections upon things that are earthly? if thou doſt,
thou haſt a legion of devils within, This is the firſt head,
the multitude and the multiplicity of the affections, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are many.</p>
               <p>The ſecond head is taken from the <gap reason="foreign">

order of the affections.</hi> As the affections are many, ſo
look where they are ſet, there they are platted, and woven,
and hampered together. God that firſt created man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and good, he gave him affections ſo to twiſt and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53869:58"/>
his heart upon good, that it might be the harder to loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
it. He gave him the affection of love to embrace
good. If the good were wanting, he gave him the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of deſire, to hunger after it. If the good were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to get, he gave him the affection of hope to expect it:
if the good were once gotten, he gave him the affection
of joy to delight in it. If there were any danger to loſe it,
he gave him the affection of fear to be afraid of it. If the
good were once loſt indeed, he gave him the affection of
grief and of ſorrow to lament it. If he ſhould meet with
any thing that would hinder him in the proſecution of
good, he gave him the affection of hatred to oppoſe
it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus God embroydered the affections, and wove
them together, that ſtill mans heart might be knit by
the affections to good and to God. And wilt thou now
ſet thine affections on the things of this life? thou little
thinkeſt how thou twiſteſt and hampereſt thy ſoul about
theſe things, thine affections will make thee live and die a
carnal wretch.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>He was in love with his</hi> Nover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. L. de ludo parvae ſphaerae</note> Had not <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> cured <hi>Antiochus</hi> of
his carnal affection, it had coſt him his life, for he was ſick
of it unto death. <hi>Galen</hi> ſayes, he met with many ſick pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
if he had not cured their affections, he had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
them. The affections hamper the ſoul unto death.
So if thou ſet thine affections on the things here on earth,
they will ſo hamper thy heart, that unleſſe thine affections
be cured, thy ſoul is deſperately incurable; they entangle
thy ſoul, thou canſt not get free. And therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi>
cals falling into earthly affections, he cals it, entangling. If
after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the fleſh they are
again entangled, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. That is, if after they have once
gotten out, they fall in again; becauſe they cannot fall in
again, but their luſts and affections will not entangle them
again. Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage,
<hi>Gal. 5. 1. Paul</hi> knew if the <hi>Galatians</hi> were addicted to the
Ceremonies of the Law, they would affect them more then
the Commandments of Chriſt. And therefore he gives them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53869:58"/>
advice no further to uſe them, becauſe their hearts would
be intangled if they did; No man that warreth, intangleth
himſelf with the affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. A ſouldier
had not need to have a new married wife, or a new-born
childe, or a new-purchaſed ground, a new-planted vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
a new ſuit at Law in the Chancery: Alas! then his
affections would be a gadding, when he ſhould be fighting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
O my wife at home, and O my childe at home, and I would
I might taſte of my vineyard at home, and O that I could
follow my cauſe in the Court, this were to intangle him
in war, he could not fight valiantly. Thus the affections
do intangle a man. So if thine affections be earthy, they
will entangle thee, thou canſt not be free for the ſeeking
of heaven, or of Chriſt; thine affections are ſo complicated
and hampered, thou canſt be in no place, in no eſtate nor
condition, but ſome affections or other will entangle thee.
Thou loveſt thy land and thy living, and thy things in
the world; O how are thine affections intangled, what
caſe ſoever thou art in? thine affections lie checker-wiſe
and will have thee. If thou beeſt rich, the affections
of pleaſure or delight, or ſecurity, there they will have
thee. If thou beeſt poor, the affections of deſire and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content;
this thou deſireſt, and that thou wouldeſt fain
have, there thy wiſhings, and wouldings and carkings will
have thee. If thou beeſt croſſed, or troubled, or afflicted,
the affections of grief and of ſorrow, and of melancholy,
theſe there will have thee. If thou beeſt injured, abuſed, or
provoked, which fals out very often, the affections of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and revenge, theſe then will have thee. If thou beeſt
in danger of ſickneſſe or diſtreſſe, or loſſe of this or that,
the affections of fear and the like, they lie in ambuſh to
catch thee. If thou comeſt to the Word, and there thou
art told thou art a damned man as long as thou liveſt as
thou doſt, the affections of vain hopings and truſtings, they
lie in ſcout for to take thee: thus thou art intangled when
thine affections are earthy, in what caſe ſoever thou art in,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53869:59"/>
they intangle thee. Sometimes thou art merry and jocond
for a pang, anon thou art melancholy and ſad for a fit.
Sometimes thou art angry with a ſervant, or a childe, or a
wife, or a neighbour, anon thou art pleaſed. Sometime
a danger comes, and fears thee, anon it is gone, and thou
art ſecure. Sometimes one affection, ſometimes another,
Sometimes a hating, and ſometimes a loving, ſometimes
deſiring, and ſometimes hoping. Thus thou liveſt, and
thus thou dieſt, and periſheſt for ever through the intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements.</p>
               <p>The third head is taken from <hi>the degrees the affections are
in,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are in a high degree in regard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the acts of the ſoul.</note> 
                  <hi>in regard of other acts of the ſoul.</hi> And here is a ſubdiviſion
of heads.</p>
               <p>1. The affections provoke thoughts, and therefore if
the affections be earthy, the thoughts are all earthy.</p>
               <p>2. The affections encreaſe luſts, and therefore if the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be carnal, the luſts are all carnal.</p>
               <p>3. The affections inferre purpoſes and reſolutions, and
therefore if the affections be to the things of this life, the
purpoſes and reſolutions of the heart are ſo too.</p>
               <p>4. The affections inferre deviſings and contrivings, and
therefore if the affections be vain, ſo are the devices. From
all which thou mayſt ſee the infinite miſery thou art in, if
the affections be ſet here below. Firſt, Becauſe if thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be ſet here below, ſo are thy thoughts. When <hi>Saul</hi>
had a treacherous affection unto <hi>David,</hi> he made as though
he did affect him ſo well, as to make him his ſonne in law;
it was a treacherous affection: but the Text ſayes, <hi>ſo were
his thoughts. Saul</hi> thought to make <hi>David</hi> fall by the hand
of the <hi>Philiſtims, 1 Sam.</hi> 18. 25. As his affections were trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous,
ſo his thoughts were in like manner treacherous.
The affections are the feet of the ſoul, as I told you; now
when theſe feet run to evil, ſo do the thoughts. <hi>Their feet
run to evil, their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 59. 7.
So that look what thine affections are to, to that are thy
thoughts. You may remember what was proved to you of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53869:59"/>
the thoughts: if thou doſt habitually ſet thy thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

carnal, and thou canſt not think ſeriouſly of the good of

to think ſeriouſly of your ſouls. Haſt thou ever thought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
whether thou beeſt a new creature or no? whether

to be drawn away from thinking ſeriouſly of our

This is the firſt: if thine affections be carnal, ſo are thy

luſts.</hi> It's true, a godly man hath carnal luſtings, for he is
partly fleſh; but then he hath good luſtings too, for he is
partly ſpirit; the fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit
againſt the fleſh, and theſe two are contrary the one to the
other, ſo that he cannot do ſo well as he would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.
he hath ſinful luſtings, but he hath ſpiritual luſtings to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
them; but if thine affections be earthy, thy luſts be
all earthy, nay, thy luſts they are ripened and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The carnal luſts properly and eſpecially are the firſt
offer of the heart unto carnal affections. So that when they
are come to be carnal affections, they are ripened. And
therefore the Apoſtle does uſually call the carnal affections
by the name of luſts. The Gentiles walked in luſts, exceſſe
of wine, revellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 3. that is, they walked in
their carnal affections; becauſe the luſts are then ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
when they come to be affections. Now beloved conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a hideous condition it is, to ſet our affections on
the earth, it ſtrengthens our luſts. We give a knife to a
cut-throat to ſtab us, cheriſh a company of vipers in our
boſome to poyſon us. We encourage fierce enemies to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
againſt our ſouls. So S. <hi>Peter</hi> can tell us. <hi>Dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, abſtain from filthy
luſts which warre againſt the ſoul,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. they warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſoul, they are the devils Infantry, yea, Chivalry
too, they are his Souldiers to murder the ſoul with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
death and eternal damnation. If ever thou lovedſt thine
own ſoul, thou wouldeſt kill ſinne in the cradle, ſupplant it
and take it by the heel, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did <hi>Eſau</hi> in the womb,
thou wilt never overcome it elſe. Deny it the firſt entrance,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53869:61"/>
as the Angel ſhut the door upon the Sodomites, caſt out
the bond-woman with her brat too, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
and her little one,<note place="margin">Gregory.</note> as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks. Thou wilt never
be able to ſubdue it otherwiſe. Thou wouldeſt crucifie thy
luſts, and mark the firſt riſings thereof, thus thou wouldſt
do, if thou hadſt a care of thy ſoul. But wilt thou let thy
luſts grow, and get armour to kill thee? wilt thou let them
gather ſtrength and ripeneſſe to damn thee? there is not a
luſt of them, but it comes like an armed man to fight againſt
thy ſoul; now if thou ſet thine affections too on the things
of this life, thou doſt ſtrengthen it and weapon it yet more.
What a wretched miſery is this! thy luſts war againſt thy
ſoul to undo it, and yet thou doſt ſtrengthen them; yea,
thou doſt encreaſe them, helpeſt their forces. O fools,
when will ye underſtand? do we not ſee how we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
by our luſts? do they not every day conquer us
in the open field? There is not a prayer we make, but dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart gets the day like a Conquerour. Not a duty
we perform, but lukewarmneſſe proves victor. Nay, our
luſts do not only overcome us, but they leade us in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
Some of our luſts carry us up and down from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to fretting, from fretting to revenging, from reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to ſwearing, from ſwearing to lying, from one ſinne
to another, as they liſt. And our luſts are ſo ſtrong that war
againſt our ſouls, that we are not aſhamed to lay down our
bucklers and ſay, we cannot reſiſt. I was angry, alas! it is
my nature, and I cannot maſter it. I rap out an oath now
and then, alas! I was provoked, and I cannot help it: I
muſt ſay and doe as ſuch an one would have me, he is my
friend, I cannot deny him. Thus our luſts have given us
mortal wounds, and have murdered our ſouls, and all this
is,<note place="margin">3. If thine affections be carnal, ſo are thy purpoſes.</note> becauſe our affections are earthly, for they encreaſe all
our luſts, and make them more able to vanquiſh us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thine affections be carnal, ſo be thy purpoſes:</hi>
Men purpoſe according as they affect. He that affects ſuch
a good bargain, will purpoſe to make it: He that affects
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53869:61"/>
pleaſure, will purpoſe to take it: He that affects any thing,
will purpoſe to have it. Firſt, men conceive a thing to be
good, then they affect it, and then they ſpend thoughts of
it, and then they purpoſe to have it if they can. <hi>Barnabas</hi>
exhorted them all, <hi>that with purpoſe of heart they would
cleave unto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11. 23. He joyns theſe two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their purpoſe and their affection to God: becauſe
they could never cleave unto the Lord, but it muſt needs
be with the purpoſes of the heart. Well now, conſider
what enemies we are unto God, what enemies too to our
own ſouls, that ſet our affections here below, we can never
have reall purpoſes to amend or turn unto God. We may
purpoſe and purpoſe a thouſand times over, but ſtill
we are broken off from our purpoſes, they all come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as long as we affect the things of this life. Can the
fire have a purpoſe to freeze? can the ſtinking dunghil have
a purpoſe to ſmell well? can a Swine have a purpoſe not to
wallow in the mire? No, how can this be, when they are
affected with contrary qualities? there is no counſel in ſuch
purpoſes as theſe. <hi>Without counſel purpoſes are diſappointed,</hi>
Pro. 15. 22. If thou doſt purpoſe to do this or that, and not
conſult whether thou be able to doe it yea or no, no
wonder though thou beeſt diſappointed of thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Thou art carnal, and haſt a purpoſe to be ſpiritual:
thou art full of earthly deſires, and haſt a purpoſe to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
after Chriſt. Thou art a company-keeper, a worldly and
a proud fool, thou haſt a purpoſe to be otherwiſe: Alas!
ſuch purpoſes as theſe will ſurely be diſappointed, becauſe
they are purpoſes without counſel: thou ſhouldſt firſt take
counſel how to crucifie thy affections; if thus thou wouldſt
do, thy purpoſes would ſtand. What an egregious ſin is
this then, to ſet thine affections on things that are carnal!
thou art vain, and haſt no purpoſe to be otherwiſe; thou
ſecure, and haſt no purpoſe to ſhake off ſecuriry; no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to give over thy carnal appetites, and thy cuſtomes,
and the luſts that thy conſcience does know of: thy own
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53869:62"/>
conſcience can point thee out many luſts that thou liveſt in,
and thou haſt no purpoſe to leave them, O how does this
provoke the Lord Jeſus to wrath! Which of us does thus
purpoſe in his heart? I abſoſutely purpoſe henceforth to
uſe all the means under Heaven for the ſaving my ſoul, I
have gull'd it to this day, now I purpoſe to do ſo no more;
now I will every day examine my conſcience, every day
keep company with the godly; I will never ſort with my
old company more, I have uſed my body like an Idol, now
I purpoſe to mortifie it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas! our affections will not
let us. It is certain, thou never haſt a good purpoſe to God
for thy ſoul, as long as thine affections are earthly. All thy
purpoſes are <hi>inſtar paleae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Car. in Pro. 15. 22.</note> ſayes a Divine, they laſt for an
hour, or a day, or a health, like the chaffe which the winde
drives away.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. If thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be carnal, ſo are thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</note> Becauſe <hi>if thine affections be carnal, ſo are thy
devices and contrivings.</hi> When a man ſets his affections on
any thing, as he ſpends many thoughts thereupon, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
to have it if he can, ſo he deviſeth with himſelf where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to attain it. <hi>Davids</hi> enemies whoſe affections were ſet
againſt him, they deviſed how they might croſſe him. <hi>All
that hate me, againſt me do they deviſe my hurt,</hi> Pſ. 41. 7. What
a company of devices hath the glutton to ſatisfie his palate?
the revengeful perſon to ſatisfie his wrath? the covetous
perſon to ſcrape himſelf maintenance? it's endleſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
what innumerable devices men have to compaſſe
what their heart does affect. <hi>Phalaris</hi> deviſeth new tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<hi>Nero</hi> deviſeth new cruelties; <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
a reward by a cryer to him that could deviſe out
new pleaſure, the wicked Lawyer and troubleſome Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
deviſeth new quillets and put-caſes to fetch over his
poor neighbour: the proud minion deviſeth new paintings
of the face, new waſhings of the body, new curlings of the
hair, new deckings of their neck, new-fangled attires, and
the like; the covetous deceiver deviſeth new couſenages,
new conny-catchings, pollings, rackings, gullings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53869:62"/>
Uſurer new uſuries, new covenants and reaches. It were
long to rehearſe what devices are in men to fulfill their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
affections. Theſe wretches are abhorred of the Lord.

whoſe affections are carnal, thy devices are all carnal, thou

how thou mayſt beſt overcome ſinne, how thou mayſt beſt

day, how he may beſt pray, and beſt repent, and beſt hear,
and beſt do every good duty? alas! there is little ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing

If our affections were ſet upon God, we would be ſtudying
and contriving how to purge all our families, how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the glory of God in the Pariſh, how to exhort, and
reprove, and provoke one another to godlineſſe. A liberall
man <hi>deviſeth liberall things,</hi> Iſa. 32. 8. he deviſes how he
may releeve Gods poor Saints, how he may ſet the poor on
work, how he may help forward the Goſpel with his purſe,
if he can finde how: An humble man deviſeth humble
things, a peaceable man deviſeth peaceable things, a holy
man deviſeth holy things: if our affections were ſet right,
we would all lay our heads together how the Pariſh may
beſt be reformed, how our ſcandalous houſes may beſt be
removed, how the Word that we hear from Sabbath to
Sabbath, may beſt be put in practiſe among us; thus it
would be, if our affections were ſet upon God; but becauſe
our affections are not ſet ſo, hence it comes to paſſe our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices

it's good to be zealouſly affected with it: Deſire of

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53869:64"/>
nothing too much to beſtow upon him. A man may love
God in a lukewarm meaſure, hate ſin in a lukewarm mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
grieve for his corruptions, deſire faith and repentance,
delight in good duties, pity the miſeries of others, fear to
tranſgreſſe Gods Commandment, a man may have all theſe
affections thus in a lukewarm meaſure: as this is diſpleaſing
to God, ſo it is not zeal. Zeal is a high meaſure, the higheſt
ſtrain of all the affections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. With all the might of the ſoul.</note> As zeal is the higheſt meaſure of all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo it is with all the might of the ſoul. For, when a man
does zealouſly affect any thing, his affection is mighty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll thy ſoul, and with all thy might,</hi> Deut. 6. 5. that is,
thou ſhalt love him zealouſly. <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a <hi>mighty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Gen. 10 9. that is, he was zealous at his hunting. Woe
unto them <hi>that are mighty to drink wine,</hi> Iſa. 5. 22. that is,
that are greedy and zealous in the purſuit of their appetite
in that kinde. <hi>David</hi> danced before the Lord <hi>with all his
might,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 14. that is, he did it zealouſly. Zeal is when
the heart raiſeth up its affections with all its might on a
thing. And therefore lukewarmneſſe is called negligence
in the Scripture: <hi>Curſed is he that doth the work of the Lord
negligently.</hi> As he that fights negligently, ſhews not all
his might in his fighting, ſo he that goes about any duty of
the Lords ſervice negligently, his heart does not ſhew all
his might in it. It puts not forth all the might of its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon it. Lukewarmneſſe then is the negligence of the
affection, and curſed is the man <hi>that does the work of the Lord
negligently,</hi> ſayes the Text. But zeal is the might of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of all the affections.</note> As zeal is with all the might, ſo it is <hi>the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth of all the affections.</hi> When the heart affects a thing,
and puts forth all its affections upon it, reſerving no part of
its affections for any thing elſe, this we call zeal. <hi>Herod</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but he did not affect it zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,
he did not put forth all his affection upon it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53869:64"/>
a main part of his affection for his pleaſure. And
therefore he was not zealous in hearing. Hence it is that
the Scripture cals lukewarmneſſe <hi>deceit fulneſſe,</hi> as Divines
do obſerve; <hi>Curſed is the deceiver,</hi> Mal. 1. 14. that is, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is the lukewarm perſon that offers God leſſe then he
hath; offers ſomewhat, and reſerves back ſomewhat, that
puts not forth all his affection upon God and his Service.
Zeal is the putting forth of all the affection. As when the
heart affects God, and affects nothing in competition with
him, this is to be zealouſly affected towards God. When
the Jews had crucified Chriſt, and perſecuted <hi>Paul,</hi> and
forbidden him to preach, the Text ſayes, <hi>the wrath of God
was come upon them to the utmoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 16. That is, the
zeal of Gods fury, and anger and vengeance was on them.
He kept nothing back; he was not angry a little, nor
wroth a little, but he put forth the affection of his wrath
to the utmoſt upon them. So when the heart puts forth
the utmoſt of its love upon God, and the utmoſt of its
delights upon his Word, and the utmoſt of its fear on his
Name, and the utmoſt of its affection on his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then it is zealous; But if he keeps back ought
to beſtow it elſewhere, it's a deceiver and a lukewarm
heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Upon a thing that the heart doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> As zeal is the putting forth of all the affection,
ſo it is upon a thing which <hi>the heart does abſolutely affect.</hi> A
man may affect a thing, when he does not affect it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He affects ſuch or ſuch a thing, but he affects it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.
He affects it perhaps with a degree of affection,
as far as twelvepence will go, he places may be a groats
worth of affection upon a quire of paper. If he be askt five
pounds of ſilver for a quire of paper, he does not affect it
at that rate, and therefore he does not affect it abſolutely.
But if a man have a true zeal of affection to a thing, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
that thing with abſolute affection, let it coſt what
it can, he affects it, let it coſt him all charges, and all pains,
and all difficulties, yea, though it coſt him his life, he will
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53869:65"/>
have it, then he does abſolutely affect it. So that then is a
man zealous for God and for grace, when his affections
ſtand abſolutely that way. May be he will be glad ſo he
may get it at an eaſie rate; but if he cannot, alas, he muſt
have it, he concludes upon that, though it coſt him ſighs,
groans, every daies ſtrivings, every daies labour, praying,
meditating, repenting, parting with all his luſts, although
never ſo dear. O his ſoul does affect it on that manner, he
muſt and he will have it, rather then life. This man is zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
affected towards grace, and towards God, becauſe
he affects it abſolutely. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> was zealous in affecting
Gods Word, he eſteemed it above his neceſſary food, <hi>Iob.</hi>
23. 12. He does not ſay above his daily food, for ſo he might
do, and not be zealouſly affected therewith; but he affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gods Word above his neceſſary food, above all food
abſolutely, without which his life could not confiſt; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which a man dies: ſuch food as this comes neareſt of all
outward things to be abſolutely affected. A man affects it
above lands, and above livings, above his ſilver and his gold,
above all his pleaſures and his gamings, a man will part with
them all, rather then part with his neceſſary food. Yet <hi>Iob</hi>
affected Gods Word above it. And therefore he affected it
zealouſly. This is the laſt thing in zeal. It is upon that which
does abſolutely affect.</p>
               <p>Albeit,<note place="margin">Zeal is due only to God.</note> now it may partly appear by the very definition
of zeal, that it is due only to God, a man muſt not be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
about any thing, nor zealouſly affected with any thing,
but only with God and his worſhip. Nevertheleſſe we may
yet further prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe it is the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious part of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Becauſe <hi>Zeal is the religious part of the affections of
the ſoul.</hi> Now the religious part of them are due only to
God.</p>
               <p>I profited in the Jews Religion, being <hi>zealous of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of my Fathers,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1. 14. he makes zeal
the character of his Religion. Seeſt thou a man zealous then
after profits, and moſt earneſt to get means and maintenance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53869:65"/>
and the things of this life? that man makes gain his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Seeſt thou a man zealous after any thing? that's his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Zeal is the religious part of the affections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's due only unto God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe zeal is the moſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> As zeal is the religious part of our affections,
ſo alſo it is <hi>the moſt of every affection,</hi> and therefore only due
unto God. Zeal is the moſt of every act that a man does.
That which the minde mindes moſt and ſtudies moſt, that
it mindes zealouſly; that which the memory remembers
moſt, which the heart wils moſt, it wils zealouſly. That
which a man fears moſt, and loves moſt, and deſires moſt,
that it does zealouſly. Now if zeal be the moſt of every
act of the ſoul, it muſt needs be idolatry to place it any
where elſe but in the ſervice of God. Doſt thou meditate
moſt, and think moſt of the world? thy thoughts are idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous:
Doſt thou talk moſt, and confer moſt of the things
of the world? thy words are idolatrous. Doſt thou cark
moſt, and care moſt? doſt thou love moſt, and rejoyce moſt
in any thing of this life? thine affections are idolatrous.
Doſt thou ſorrow moſt for croſſes, and loſſes, and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the like, more then thou grieveſt for thy ſins? thy
grief is idolatry. That's the hearts Idol which it doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
moſt. How often is God in Scripture called the <hi>moſt
High?</hi> the moſt High, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 48. if he be the moſt high,
then the moſt high of every act and of every affection muſt
be for him. The very Heathen call God, <hi>Deus optimus max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus,</hi>
God the moſt good, and the moſt great: ſo likewiſe
he is the moſt terrible, and the moſt holy, and the moſt juſt;
and therefore the moſt of our affections muſt needs be due
unto him. Zeal is the moſt of every one of the affections,
and that only is ſutable to God. The affections muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the thing we affect;<note place="margin">3. Zeal is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pitch of every affection.</note> but nothing of all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is ſutable to God beſides zeal: for zeal is the moſt of
every one of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As zeal is the moſt of every affection, ſo it is the
<hi>peculiar pitch of every affection.</hi> There cannot be two moſts.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53869:66"/>
The ſuperlative degree cannot be two; <hi>Doctiſſimus</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a term peculiar to one body: the moſt learned man in
the world is a peculiar word peculiar to one There may be
ten learned, a thouſand learned, there may be many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but moſt learned is a peculiar title. So zeal being the
moſt of the affections, it muſt needs be peculiar to ſome one
thing, which cannot be any other but God. Chriſt gave
himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity,
and purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar people, <hi>zealous of good
works,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. Thoſe people that are zealous of good
works, ye ſee they are people peculiar to Chriſt. They can
be no other people but Chriſts people that are zealous of
good works. No people under heaven are truly zealous of
good works, but only his people. This is peculiar to Chriſt
to have ſuch people: becauſe zeal is peculiarly due unto
him. Thou canſt not poſſibly be one of Gods people, if
thou beeſt not zealous for God. A zealous beleever, and a
zealous repenter, and a zealous profeſſor, zealous in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and zealous in hearing the Word. Zealous people are
peculiar people to Chriſt. Under love, and under joy, and
under hope, and under fear, are not peculiarly due unto
God. For I may love my health too, and I may delight in
the bleſſings of this life, and I may fear a temporary evil.
I may lend mine under affections to ſome things elſe beſides
God; but my zeal being the moſt of my affections, muſt
be given to God, zeal is peculiar to him. Thou art a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
then, thou art none of Gods if thou beeſt not zealous
for him. Thou art of thy father the devil, thou art none
of Gods, unleſſe thou be zealous to him. Zeal is his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Zeal is the moſt ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> As zeal is the peculiar pitch of every affection,
<hi>ſo it is the most ſpending part of the affections:</hi> A man muſt
ſpend himſelf upon nothing but God; nothing elſe will
quit charges. Now zeal is the ſpendingeſt ſtrain of every
affection: It moſt ſpendeth the ſpirits, it moſt buſieth the
body: you may gather what a ſpending thing zeal is, by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53869:66"/>
the paſſage in the Pſalmiſt. <hi>David</hi> ſayes thus, <hi>My zeal hath
conſumed me, becauſe my enemies have forgotten thy words,</hi>
Pſa. 119. 139. <hi>David</hi> was ſo zealous for God, that he did
even ſpend himſelf to ſee how his enemies diſhonoured his
God. A childe of God is like a faithful ſervant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
he is willing to ſpend himſelf in his ſervice. So he is
content to ſpend himſelf in his employments for God. <hi>Paul</hi>
when God employed him for the ſouls of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
he ſayes thus, <hi>I will gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you,</hi> why?
what was the reaſon? <hi>I abundantly love you,</hi> ſayes he, 2 Cor.
12. 15. that is, he was zealous in his love to their ſouls,
God had employed him for the good of their ſouls, and
he was ſo zealous in this employment, that he could even
ſpend himſelf, and be ſpent for them. And indeed zeal it
ſelf is a very ſpending thing. Thou art the devils Martyr
that ſpendeſt thy ſelf upon the things of this life; thou art
ſo wedded thereto, that thou ſpendeſt thy parts and thy
wits hereabouts, thou ſpendeſt thy thoughts and thy time
hereupon, thou ſpendeſt thy ſelf and thy ſpirits this way.
The voluptuous man ſpends himſelf as much at his ſports,
as a Miniſter ſpends himſelf in a Pulpit, as a godly man
ſpends himſelf in good duties. As for Gods Service, thy
prayers are ſo cold and ſo negligent, that thou ſpendeſt
thy ſelf not at all in them. Thy repentance is ſo overly, it
ſpends thee never a jot to go thorow it: thou art ſo eager
after thy pleaſures, they ſpend thee; ſo earneſt after the
world, that ſpends thee, becauſe thou art zealous about
ſuch things. But it is otherwiſe with thee in the Service
of God. This is another ſtrong reaſon, why zeal is due
properly to God, becauſe a man muſt ſpend himſelf upon
nothing ſo much as upon pleaſing of God, and doing his
will, and ſeeking his glory. It is true, he may ſpend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his calling. But the greateſt part of the ſpending li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in this, that he may walk with God in his calling. He
ſpendeth himſelf in be labouring his heart to work in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to follow his buſineſſes with faith, to go about his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53869:67"/>
earthly employments as before God, to glorifie God in all
his waies. A man <hi>may ground himſelf upon nothing ſo much as
upon God.</hi> Zeal to God makes him a kinde of Martyr for
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Zeal is the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient part of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note> As zeal is the ſpending part of all the affections,
ſo likewiſe <hi>zeal is the impatient part of all the affections.</hi> It
is true, we may deſire a good report among men, but our
affections muſt not be impatient; if we cannot have it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bating an inch of a good conſcience, our deſire muſt
be patient without it. We may grieve for a loſſe or a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but our affection muſt not be impatient: if we ſee
Gods providence hath ſent it, our grief muſt be patient
under it. We may affect theſe outward bleſſings of God,
but our affections muſt be patient of a privation, but our
affections muſt be zealous to God; becauſe <hi>zealous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are impatient of the contrary.</hi> We muſt ſo hate ſinne
againſt God as to be impatient to endure it: ſo fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him, as to be impatient of any boldneſſe that way;
So love the glory of God as to be impatient of any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his Name: ſo zealous to reprove ſinne in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as not to ſuffer ſinne in him. Thou ſhalt rebuke thy
neighbour, and not ſuffer ſinne on him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 7. that is,
thou ſhalt be zealous in rebuking. A high look and a proud
heart I will not ſuffer, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 101. 5. that is, I will be zealous
againſt it. I have not ſuffered my mouth to ſin, <hi>Iob.</hi> 13. 30.
that is, I have been zealous in the ruling of my tongue.
Zeal is the impatient part of all the affections, look what
thine affections do zealouſly affect, they will not ſuffer the
contrary. And therefore the zeal of thine affections muſt
be unto God. Indeed if thine affections be lukewarm to
God, thou mayſt wiſh that God might be glorified; but
if he be not, thou canſt endure it: Thou mayſt pray to God
for grace to heal thee of thy deadneſſe; but though he do
not, thou canſt bear it. But if thine affections were ſo farre
hereto, as to be zealous, they would be impatient, thou
couldeſt never endure it. Zeal is the impatient degree of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53869:67"/>
the affections, whereby when the ſoul does affect a thing,
it is impatient without it. And therefore zeal is due only
to God. Thus ye diſcern the evidence of this truth, that
the zeal of our affection is due properly to God.</p>

ſorry for it, or elſe he doth not repent of it: if a man have
wronged a Noble-man, he muſt be more ſorry: for as the
wrong is the greater, the greater the party wronged is, ſo
the greater is the ſorrow that is required to repentance. If
a man have wronged the King, it muſt be greater ſorrow
yet, till the ſorrow be ſomewhat anſwerable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the King who is wronged. But if a man have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a God, this muſt be the greateſt ſorrow of all ſorrows,
otherwiſe thou doſt not repent. Repentance is the rending
or breaking of the heart, ſo ſayes the Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> it is
not a lukewarm, or a little grief that will break the heart.
Repentance is the humbling of the ſoul, ſayes <hi>David,</hi> it is
not a little bowing and a little bending will humble it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

it is not a little pricking and a little compunction will kill it

Thus we muſt doe, otherwiſe we are not in Chriſt. And
therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> confounds faith and zeal, as if they were
all one, and both in one. <hi>Phinehas</hi> was zealous for Gods
ſake, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 11. That is, he was zealous and faithful
both, for ſo the Pſalmiſt expounds it, that was counted to
him for righteouſneſſe, ſayes he, that was, ſpeaking of his
zeal in executing of judgement, that was counted to him
for righteouſneſſe. Now ye know nothing can be counted
to a man for righteouſneſſe, but only faith, and therefore
by zeal there is meant faith. This is an undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
If a man have faith, he is zealous, otherwiſe he hath
no faith. If he have no faith, he cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That man is in the ſtate of damnation that loves not God.</hi>
He that loves not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Maranatha,</hi> that is, let him be accurſed and accurſed,
for it is the greateſt curſe in the world, it is the curſe of the

loves not Chriſt. Now a man never loves God, if he be
not zealous: <hi>qui non zelat, non amat:</hi> He that is not zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in love does not love, love is termed zeal in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<hi>Iehu,</hi> indeed the truth was, he had no love to God,
he thought he had though; and therefore when he would
tell <hi>Iehonadab</hi> he had love to God, he tels it in theſe words,
Come and ſee my zeal I have to the Lord of Hoſts, 2 <hi>King.</hi>

of. If thou beeſt not zealous, it is moſt certain, thou haſt
not a jot of true love Zeal is more ſeen in that affection

               <p>Is it ſo, that the zeal of our affections is due only to

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Zeal is the fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Zeal is the fire of the ſoul.</hi> Look what thou art moſt
zealous upon, that ſets thy ſoul in a fire. Every man and
woman in the world is ſet on fire of hell or of heaven. Now
if heaven have not ſet thee on fire, hell hath ſet thee on fire,
thou art ſet on fire of one of theſe two. As it is the bleſſedeſt

thing that can be to be ſet on fire of heaven, to be zealous

                  </gap>; for ſuch, ſayes he,
are the ſinfull luſts and affections; they are all fiery, ſet
on fire of hell; this is one miſery, and this not a ſmall one;
zeal is the fire of the ſoul, and if it be not ſet upon God, it
is ſet on fire of hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Zeal is the running of the ſoul</note> 
                  <hi>Zeal is the running of the ſoul.</hi> If thou beeſt
not zealous for God, thou runneſt away after the things of
this world; thou doſt not only go after vanities, but thou
runneſt; not only go after thy pleaſures and thy profits,
but thou runneſt. As the affections are the feet of the ſoul,
ſo zeal is the ſwift running pace of theſe feet. I will run the
way of thy Commandments, ſayes <hi>David,</hi> that is, I will be
zealous in it. It is a long way to heaven, eſpecially now ſince
the fall, it is a very long way to heaven, and death will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
us before ever we can get there, unleſſe we run; and
therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commands us to run faſt enough, leſt
we never get there. So <hi>run that ye may obtain,</hi> 1 Cor 9. 24.
Now had we not need to ſet our zeal right? for that way
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53869:71"/>
we run, that way our zeal ſtands. If the zeal of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſtand to Godwards, we run onwards to heaven; but if
it ſtand to the things here below, we run onwards to hell.
I reade of <hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tiberius Nero.</note> who when his brother <hi>Druſus</hi>
lay ſick in <hi>Germany,</hi> he ran two hundred miles in twenty
four hours to viſit him. But we may finde tanker run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
then ſo in ſinne; ſome in drunkenneſſe and good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,
as they call it; others in ſecurity and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart; others in one ſin, and others in another;
and as they run themſelves, ſo if there be any that are ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
then themſelves, they wonder that they run not with
them to the ſame exceſſe of ryot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. Mark, run not
with them, where note, themſelves run into ryot. May be
ſometimes they have ſudden and violent affections to good,
as if they were all on a fire for the preſent, like the young
man in the Goſpel, he came running to Chriſt, and kneeled
down to him, ſayes the Text, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10 17. O he was all
upon the haſte, he does not goe to him, but he runs; as
many men and women have very good moods and violent
pangs of goodneſſe now and then, but alas! it was nothing
but a flaſh, for by and by he was as ready to be gone, as
ever he was haſty to come; and then he ran on in his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and coveteouſneſſe of minde. Do ye not ſee how faſt
many of you run on in arerages with God? If we could ſee
Gods debt-book, might we not there reade. <hi>Item,</hi> ten
thouſand oaths thou haſt ſworn. <hi>Item,</hi> millions of millions
of filthy words thou haſt ſpoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Item,</hi> a hundred millions
of millions of wicked thoughts thou haſt thought. <hi>Item,</hi>
a thouſand lazie prayers thou haſt made. <hi>Item,</hi> 20. hundred
Sabbaths thou haſt prophaned. <hi>Item,</hi> fourty Sacraments
thou haſt unworthily received: Thus ye have run on, as
if ye thought every day ſeven years till ye are in hell Thus
it is with you,<note place="margin">3. Zeal is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſoul.</note> when your zeal is ſet any where elſe then on
God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Zeal is the predominant element in the ſoul.</hi> Look
what the ſoul is zealous unto, that is the predominant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53869:71"/>
of the ſoul: if thou beeſt zealous for God, Chriſt is
predominant in thee: if thou beeſt zealous for the things
of this world, the world is predominant in thee, <hi>Non datur
temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> ſayes the Philoſopher, there is
no temper but ſomething is predominant. You never heard
of a ſoul that had as much of the world in him as of Chriſt,
and of Chriſt as of the world: No, as he is zealous to one
thing, ſo one thing or other is predominant in him. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
is predominant in one, pride predominant in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and pleaſure predominant in a third. Whatſoever a
man is zealous unto, that is his predominant element: Now
if thine affections, if the zeal of them be not ſet upon God,
then ſomething or other in the world is predominant in
thee O what a miſery then is it to be leſſe zealous for
God then for the world! the world is predominant in thee,
this is the character of one that yet is no better then a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate;
<hi>Lovers of pleaſure more then lovers of God,</hi> 2 Tim.
3. 4. when pleaſure is predominant and not God. He that
loveth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of
me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. when carnal relations
are predominant, and not ſpiritual, this I ſay is an evident
character of a wicked man: for what difference is there
between a godly man and wicked man? both have ſinne in
them; this is the difference: a godly man hath ſin in him,
but grace is predominant, and therefore he is called a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man: A wicked man hath many good graces in him,
but ſinne and wickedneſſe is predominant, and therefore
he is called a wicked man; the denomination is from
the part that is predominant. The beaſts of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the earth is predominant: the fiſhes of the Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the water is predominant; a brick-houſe, not as
though there were no wood in it, but becauſe brick is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
Mark all thy thoughts which is predominant in
thee, the world or Chriſt: mark all thy ſpeeches, which is
predominant, earth or heaven; mark all thy cares, which is
predominant to buſie thee moſt: O what a wofull eſtate art
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53869:72"/>
thou in, when ſin and corruption is predominant in thee:
If thou be more zealous after the things of this life, then
after grace and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the
Lord: Thou canſt never enter into Gods kingdom, becauſe
ſin is predominant in thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Zeal is the ſelf-cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſoul.</note> 
                  <hi>Zeal is the ſelf-cruelty of the ſoul:</hi> If thou beeſt
moſt zealous to God, thy zeal is a holy cruelty to thy ſelf.
Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf, ſayes <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
me Saran, ſayes Chriſt; he was zealous for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the world, and he would not ſpare his own
life. Zeal is a holy cruelty of the ſoul, it will ſpare nothing,
nor life, nor credit, nor living, nor any thing. M. <hi>Fox</hi> that
was zealous in his love to the poor, he was in a holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
cruell to himſelf, to give the very clothes off his back,
rather then the naked ſhould not be covered. Love is as
ſtrong as death, and as cruell as the grave, <hi>Cant. 8. 6. Durus
ſicut inferi zelus,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounds it: zeal is as hard as
the grave. A man that is zealous is a hard man to himſelf,
that he may be free unto God; not as though true zeal
were hard and cruell indeed unto his own ſoul, but I mean,
to his own fleſhly deſires and reſpects, he is the mercifulleſt
man to his own ſoul under heaven. Now then ſee what a
woful eſtate thou art in, if thou beeſt not zealous for God:
for if the zeal of thine affections gad any where elſe, thou
art the cruelleſt man to thine own ſoul in very deed, and in
truth, as poſſibly can be: Thou ſquandreſt away Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
thou treaſureſt up Gods wrath, thou liveſt in thoſe
ſins which thine own conſcience can tell thee are ſins, thou
beſtoweſt thine affections upon the things of this life,
which ſhould be given to God, thou damneſt thine own
ſoul. That time which God vouchſafes thee to get grace
in, thou waſteſt it away upon vanity; thou art more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
for the good of thy carkaſſe then for the everlaſting
weal or thy ſoul; thou parteſt with Chriſt, rather then with
thy luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O thou art <hi>durus ut inferi,</hi> thou art as cruell as,
hell to thine own ſoul. Thou knoweſt that whoſoever
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53869:72"/>
comes to the Sacrament unworthily, or unpreparedly, or
not a new creature, he eats and drinks his own damnation:
thou knoweſt this well enough, thou knoweſt that the Lord
ſayes ſo in his Word. Yet thou art ſo cruell to thy own
ſoul, that for all this thou wilt venture: thou knoweſt,
that he that comes to this ſupper without a wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſſe, where is weeping
and gnaſhing of teeth; thou knoweſt this full well, and
thou canſt not deny it. Yet thou art ſo cruell to thy own
ſoul, as to come hither without it: thine affections are ſo
eager after the things of this life, the very zeal of them all,
that thou art even cruell to thine own ſoul, <hi>Durus ut infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
as cruell as hell it ſelf to thy ſelf. O the cruelty of thine
earthly zeal; it makes thee fearleſſe and witleſſe to ſinne
againſt God, which the Angels of heaven durſt not doe
for a thouſand worlds. It makes thee ſinne againſt Chriſt,
and caſt off his yoke, without which thou canſt be never
ſaved; it makes thee choak the motions of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and ſtrangle thine own conſcience, <hi>Durus ut infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
zelus,</hi> may we well ſay; this zeal is as cruell as hell,
and yet it is in every one of us all, that is not zealous for
God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Zeal is the brand of the ſoul. <hi>Ambroſ.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Zeal is the brand of the ſoul:</hi> When a man is
zealous in any paſſion, whatever it be, we ſee it ſets a brand
upon a man; we call him a cholerick man, that is zealous
with anger; he is very touchy, ſay we. We call him a fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
envious man, that is zealouſly given thereunto. We
call him a melancholy man that is much in his ſadneſſe.
Zeal which is the Much of every affection, it ſets a brand
upon a man. So when a man is zealous for good, it ſets a
good brand upon a man, as <hi>Aemilius</hi> for his goodneſſe, was
called <hi>Aemilius</hi> the good. <hi>Antoninus</hi> for his piety was
called <hi>Antoninus</hi> the pious:<note place="margin">Act. 1. 23.</note> ſo in Scripture one <hi>Barſabas</hi>
was called <hi>Iuſtus</hi> the juſt. So it ſhould ſeem too, that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was a noted man for ſome paſſionate and affectionate
forwardneſſe, and therefore he was called <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53869:73"/>
that is, <hi>Simon</hi> the zealous, <hi>Luk</hi> 6. 15. And ſo we ſee though
it be counted a mockage by the ignorant world, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them which are without, that Gods people are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Look whatever a man is zealous in, that is able to brand
him. Now if thou beeſt zealous for the world, or zealous
after thy pleaſures or any thing elſe in the world, it brands
thee in the forehead for a carnal wretch: as <hi>Elymas</hi> the
ſorcerer, <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor: It ſtigmatizes thee for a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or a drunkard, or a company-keeper, or voluptuous,
or whatever it be thy zeal is moſt in. Every man is more
zealous for one thing then he is for another, either for
God, or ſomething elſe in the world; the. Queſtion is,
whether art thou moſt zealous for? if thou beeſt more
zealous for any thing elſe then thou art for God, it brands
thee for a wretch. Such an one a very worldling; ſuch
an one a very muck-worm; ſuch an one a very ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift;
ſuch an one a very gameſter and a royſter; ſuch
an one a very tatler; ſuch an one an <hi>Orlando Furioſo:</hi>
ſuch an one a hard man; Look where thy moſt is, that
does truly brand thee before God and good men that are
able to diſcern thee.</p>

he was at the command of his gracious zeal. It was well
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53869:74"/>
for him it was good: for now on the contrary, if a mans
affections be ſet upon the things of this life, he muſt have
pleaſures, and he muſt have his living and his maintenance,
and he muſt have this, his affections are ſet on it, he is zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
after them: this man is not his own man, he is a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his luſts. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am thine, Lord:</hi> ſo he
may ſay on the contrary, <hi>I am thine, World,</hi> I am thine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
I am thine <hi>Satan,</hi> I am at thy command and thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
As the Text ſayes, <hi>Paul</hi> a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iude</hi>
a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, for they were zealous for Chriſt,
and their zeal made them not their own men: ſo I may ſay
of a wicked man, <hi>Eſau</hi> a ſervant of ſinful pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
<hi>Demas</hi> a ſervant of this preſent world, <hi>Diotrephes</hi>
a ſervant of his own ambition; for they were zealous of
theſe things, and their zeal made them ſlaves thereto. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 34. ſayes
Chriſt to the Jews; ſervant? ſay they, we were never ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
we are free: ſervants, ſayes he, yea, ye are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of ſinne, ye go about to kill me, ſayes he. Are not ye
the ſlaves of ſinne, when ye will be obedient to your luſts,
to doe ſuch an ill office as to murther me? I know there be
two kindes of ſlaves and ſervants; ſome that are in <hi>arctâ
cuſtodiâ,</hi> cloſe priſoners; Such ſervants of ſinne are they,
that are kept ſo cloſe, that they cannot go one ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
prophaneſſe. Some in <hi>libera cuſtodia,</hi> are falſe priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
When a mans luſts hold him in a longer chain, like
birds in a larger Cage, which may be is free to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour,
and come to Church, and hear, and pray, and be
civill; and when he is once at the length of his chain, his
luſts pull him back: the former are affections <hi>Galliſlaves,</hi>
chained to their ſeats and their oars; the latter are their
ſluggiſh meſſengers, to go up and down of their errand.
And therefore the devil which takes all advantages of a
mans affections, is ſaid to hold him <hi>captive at his pleaſure,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 26. O ſayſt thou, I am not the devils captive at his

ſome will; alas, alas! it is not the devils pleaſure to have
thee a drunkard or a ſwearer, it is his pleaſure to uſe his

his pleaſure to employ thy tongue in ſwearing; No, he'l
employ thy tongue only in talking civilly of the things of
the world. It is not his pleaſure to uſe thee for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. Zeal is the ſtrength of the ſoul</note> 
                  <hi>Zeal is the ſtrength of the ſoul,</hi> zeal carries all
the ſtrength of the ſoul with it, leaves none behinde. And
therefore the Scripture puts theſe two things together,
ones zeal and his ſtrength. Lord, where is thy zeal and thy
ſtrength? ſayes the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 15. If he ask where
his zeal is, he asks where his ſtrengh is? for zeal is the
ſtrength of the ſoul. Ye know <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled with God for
a bleſſing, and his effectuall fervent prayer prevailed, but
how does God expreſſe it? he expreſſes his zeal thus. By
his ſtrength he had power with God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3. his prayer
was a zealous prayer, and therefore it was a prayer with
ſtrength, by his ſtrength he had power with God. He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and he prayed with ſtrength, he laid all his ſtrength
that he could on the duty, and by his ſtrength he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with God. Look what a man is zealous unto, all his
ſtrength goes to it, he leaves none behinde. O the miſery
of a carnal heart, that is not zealous for God, he hath no
ſtrength at all left for God, or the ſaving of his ſoul. Would
he pray? alas! he hath no ſtrength to pray with. His pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are as weak as bul-ruſhes. Would he reſiſt ſin? he hath
no ſtrength to reſiſt it with. His ſtriving to reſiſt it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
able. O how hardy is be to commit ſin! the charges
and the coſt that is in drinking does not terrifie the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
from his drunkenneſſe, the coſt that is in gariſh appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
does not terrifie the proud from their vanity in cloaths.
The diſgrace that is in ſinne does not terrifie the Adulterer
from his luſt. The fear of fathers and mothers diſpleaſure
does not terrifie the ſpend-thrift from his ryot. No, wicked
men are hardy that way, becauſe their zeal goes that way.
But to that which is good, <hi>how weak is thy heart?</hi> Ezek. 16.
30. <hi>nihil metuendum vidit, metuit tamen:</hi> the leaſt croſſe

point; take him at the plough, there he can be ſtrong to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
he'l toyl, he'l ſweat, he'l hold out. Take him at
prayer, he is as weak as water; take him at a Tale or a
Story, he'l remember it well, and repeat it after you, his
memory is ſtrong; take him at a Sermon, his memory fails
him; take him in a buſineſſe to manage, his wit is ſtrong,
his parts ſtrong, he hath an excellent reach; but take him
in mortification, he is as weak as a man without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
This is the miſery of thy ſoul, when thy zeal is
not ſet upon God. The devil is the ſtrong man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 29.
and thou haſt no ſtrength to encounter him; thy luſts are
ſtrong to inthrall thee, and thou haſt no ſtrength to be free,
and yet thou piſheſt at theſe things: Men think nothing of
the devil, as though he were nothing but a ſcare-crow, they
defie him every hour in the day, they jeſt at him, ſaying,
the devil is a fool, they'l paint him on their wals, and call
for him as though they would give him a challenge. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
a pretty Proverb, that I reade the <hi>Germans</hi> have,
<hi>Non pingendus eſt Diabolus in pariete, quia ſponte ſua venit.</hi>
Paint not the devil on the wall, he'l come ſoon enough of
his own accord. I am ſure, he comes too ſoon to beguile
men, too ſoon to bewitch and befool men, too ſoon to
diſarm men from all ſtrength to that which is good. If
he can once ſet thine affections on the things of this life,
he hath gotten the victory, and thou art not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8. Zeal is the confidence of the ſoul <hi>Sperant omnes quae cupiunt ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> ſayes Lucian.</note> 
                  <hi>Zeal is the full confidence of the ſoul:</hi> that does

that is zealous for the world he truſts to the world, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would not be zealous for it. He truſts to have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and he truſts to have goods, and he truſts to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
that is zealous about them. What, do you truſt
to bear all before you? as we uſe to ſay, when we ſee a
man hot and zealous upon any thing, the ſoul would not
be zealous but that it verily truſts to prevail. Thus ſhall

the Lord have ſpoken it in my zeal, <hi>Ezek</hi> 5. 13. God was
confident of the fullfilling of his wrath, why? becauſe he
had ſpoken in his zeal. Indeed God may well be ſo, were
he neverſo little angry: but the words do expreſſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of zeal. It's the full truſt of the ſoul to ſpeed. A wiſe
man will not be hot upon any thing, unleſſe he truſt to go
through ſtitch. If zeal then be the full truſt of the ſoul,
what a mad man art thou not to be zealous for God. Thou
truſteſt to the world, and truſteſt thy pleaſures, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
thy paſſions, thou doſt not truſt God. If thou truſtedſt
the Lord God, thou wouldeſt be zealous for God. Alas,
alas! thou canſt not truſt God, thou never laboureſt to
pleaſe him. He that depends on a man, and muſt be for to
truſt him for help and aſſiſtance, he will not offend him.
Alas! what truſt can he have to him, if he offend him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually?
when the <hi>Sydonians</hi> and the <hi>Tyrians</hi> had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
K. <hi>Herod,</hi> their countrey being nouriſhed by the Kings

if thou wouldeſt truſt Almighty God, thou wouldſt labour
to pleaſe him, and to be zealous for his Name; and not make
him thine enemy by thy ſinnes and iniquities, Thou which
blaſphemeſt his Name with thine oaths, and abuſeſt his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with thine intemperance, and prophaneſt his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with thy careleſſeneſſe and neglect, and diſpleaſeſt him
all the year long. Alas! how canſt thou truſt him? thou
makeſt him thine enemy; canſt thou truſt one that he'l be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
thee, that vows he will hang thee? canſt thou truſt
he'l help thee at all hands, that is provok't to undoe thee?
thou art a damned man, if God do not pardon thee. Thou

God give thee not grace. And canſt thou truſt God he will
be good to thee: what and diſpleaſe him day by day? of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
him every foot? No, no, thou mayſt truſt him, he will

Thou which hardeneſt thy neck againſt the reproofs

this he hath paſt his word he will do, and herein
thou mayſt truſt him: thou canſt never truſt him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or grace or any good thing; thou diſpleaſeſt him daily,
and makeſt him thine enemy. And how canſt thou truſt
him? what thinkeſt thou? does not he know how little
thou careſt for his Commandments? how little thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteſt
his Ordinances? how baſely thou uſeſt him in thy
waies? indeed if thou wert zealous for his glory, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to pleaſe him in holineſſe of life, and zealous to obey
him, and ſeek him, then thou mighteſt truſt him. Thou
canſt never truſt him otherwiſe. By this time thou mayſt ſee
what a woful condition thou art in, if the zeal of thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be not ſet upon God.</p>
               <p>But many poor ſouls may demand,<note place="margin">Signs whether the zeal of thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffections be ſet on God, 1. Sign. If thine affections be notable to God-ward.</note> how then ſhall I
know whether the zeal of mine affections be ſet upon God?
I anſwer thee: There are ſeven ſigns whereby thou mayſt
know it.</p>
               <p>The firſt, <hi>If thine affections be notable to God-ward:</hi> a man
may have a little hope, and a little grief, and a little joy,
and a little pity, and no body ſee it. But if it be zealous, it
will quickly be notable; every one, when once it is zealous,
every one will note it. When <hi>Epaphras</hi> was zealous to ſave
ſouls in <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> what ſayes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of him? I bear him
record, he hath a great zeal for you, ſayes he, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4. 13.
<hi>Paul</hi> could not but note it in him, he ſaw ſo many ſtrong
expreſſions of it.</p>
               <p>This holineſſe and forwardneſſe is very remarkable. But
if on the contrary there be no notable expreſſions of grace
in you, alas! there may be ſome goodneſſe, ſome pity, ſome
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53869:77"/>
grief, ſome motions; but this is no zeal, it is not remarkable.
If a man be zealous for the world, his ſcraping and ſparing
is notable, his toyling and ſtudying, and talking that way is
<hi>very notable.</hi> I will bear him record, he is a worldling; the
world is ſo much in his ſpeeches the world is ſo much in his
courſes, and ſo much in his face. Look upon his wayes, he is
ſo combred with thoughts of the world: Look into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
there be ſo few good duties of grace, and ſo many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of the world: Look upon his meetings, his diſcourſes
of edifying are ſo ſcarce, and of the world are ſo copious,
I will bear him in record, he is a worldling. Were we zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for God, there would be divers ſigns and expreſſions of
our zeal unto God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he would make it plain
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he was an Apoſtle to them, he tels
them, truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among
you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. If we were zealous for God, ye might
anſwer, Truly the ſigns of true zelots are wrought among
us: ye that profeſſe Chriſt, what ſigns of true zelots are
there in you? if your brethren be ſecure and grown-dull,
do ye labour to quicken them? If the Goſpel do not thrive,
do ye labour to further it? if grace be little ſtirring in the
Pariſh, does Heaven ring with your groans and your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
if zeal were exiſtent among you, it would be notable
and remarkable among you, we might ſay, I bear you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
it is ſo, nay, the wicked without would obſerve it, we
bear them record, they keep a great ſtir about heaven, our
lives would convince them. May be they would hate us and
reproach us the more: but this is certain, our lives would
convince them, as Chriſt's did the Centurion, doubtleſſe
this is a righteous man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 47. So your lives would
convince all their conſciences; doubtleſſe they are ſtrict
men, doubtleſſe they are humble, and meek, and religious.
Thus it would be, were we zealous. But if our religion be
not notable, hardly notable to our ſelves, we can hardly
tell whether we have true faith and repentance, and zeal
at all, yea or no: much leſſe notable to others, it is to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53869:77"/>
be feared ye are not zealous for God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſign of zeal towards God is,<note place="margin">2. If thou beeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of ſinne.</note> to be impatient
of ſinne. Zeal, as aforeſaid, is the impatient part of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
if a man do affect a thing but a little, he can be
patient without it; but if he affect it very deep and with
zeal, O his affections are ſet on it, and he is impatient if
he ſpeed not. So that if thou beeſt zealous againſt ſin, thou
art impatient of ſin, thou canſt not ſuffer it. Zeal is impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of whatever is contrary to it. That this is the nature
of zeal, you may ſee by the poor blinde zeal that was in
<hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion: he was zealous to God as he
thought, and thinking that the Church of Chriſt were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all men, enemies to God and man, therefore now
in the blindeneſſe of his zeal he perſecutes that way unto
death: Concerning zeal I perſecuted the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.
It was a woful kinde of zeal to perſecute the Church, but
yet there you may gather the nature of zeal, it cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
that which is contrary: and therefore if thou beeſt
zealous againſt ſin, thou canſt not abide ſinne; better jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
riding, ſtudies, prayers, exhortations, any courſe thou
wilt uſe, rather then abide it: thou canſt never abide any
thing that is diſpleaſing to God, but reſiſt it to the utmoſt,
and this reſiſting will be,</p>
               <p>Firſt Univerſal:<note place="margin">1. Zeal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide any ſinne.</note> If thou beeſt zealous, there is no ſinne
thou canſt poſſibly abide. Nothing is cold but the fire does
reſiſt it; ſo nothing is ſin but zeal does reſiſt it to the utmoſt.
I eſteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
<hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> Pſa. 119. 128. This is zeal indeed, there
is never a falſe way that a man can abide that is zealous. To
be zealous againſt one ſinne, and lukewarm againſt another,
this is not zeal.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In any perſon.</note> General, in all manner of perſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In a friend as well as in an enemy:</hi> If thou beeſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
thou wilt finde fault with thy friends when they ſin,
as well as obſerve a fault when thine enemy offendeth.<note place="margin">1. In friend.</note> Men
are apt to obſerve when their enemy ſinneth, O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53869:78"/>
is he! thus he hath done, and ſo he hath
done; but if thou beeſt zealous, when thy friend does
tranſgreſſe, thou wilt not abide it. Fire will not only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to conſume the water that comes to put it out, but
alſo the wood that comes to maintain it. So it is with
zeal, <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee?</hi> ſayes <hi>David</hi> to
God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139 21. He could not abide to count them his
friends that were not friends unto God, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they were very friends unto him, and may be ſaved
his life, and were patrons and benefactors unto him, he
could not wink at their ſins, becauſe they were his friends:
though thy friend be a ſwearer or a carnal wretch, yet if he
be thy friend, and thou dependeſt upon him, thou canſt ſee
it and not ſee it; but if thou beeſt zealous, all his ſins thou
wilt count diſcourteſies to thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In childe.</note> In ones <hi>childe</hi> as well as a ſervant, you ſhall
have many, they are angry at every ſin a ſervant commits;
but if their children do ſin, they connive; it was no ſuch
great fault, alas! he did it unwittingly, and what would ye
have a childe do? ſay they: they can excuſe it in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and leſſen it; but if thou beeſt zealous, thou canſt
not abide ſinne in thy ſon any more then a ſervant, thou
wilt correct him, and curb him, and threaten him, and
counſell him, and never endure he ſhould ſin, if thou canſt
poſſibly help it. What, my ſon, and be wicked? what doe I
love God, and ſhall I ſuffer my loins to diſhonour him?
Son, know thou the God of thy father, otherwiſe I count
thee a baſtard, and no ſon. This brake old <hi>Elies</hi> neck, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſuffered his ſons to be wicked, when he by godly
ſeverity might have remedied it. A zealous man when his
ſon hath committed things worthy of death, will not ſpare
him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. In wife or husband.</note> In ones own wife or husband, or father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as in a neighbour, zeal cannot abide it; hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
thou doſt not love me as long as thou liveſt thus;
wife, thy heart is not with me as long as thou doſt thus;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53869:78"/>
how canſt thou love me when thou doſt not love God nor
thine own ſoul? this is the meaning of our Saviour: <hi>If any
come to me, and hate not father and mother, and wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and brethren, and ſiſters, yea, and his own life, he cannot
be my Diſciple.</hi> Luk. 14. 26. A zealous man cannot abide to
yield to ſin, for the beſt of them all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. In a rich man.</note> 
                  <hi>In a rich man as well as in a poor man,</hi> if thou
beeſt zealous, thou canſt not abide ſin, neither in the rich,
nor in the poor: if poor men offend, and if beggars be idle
and ungodly, then thou wilt complain; Oh, the poor are
ſo wicked, they break down our hedges, who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
them? they will not be orderly, they lie drinking in
Ale-houſes, and ſpend it away on the pot, therefore who
would releeve them? But if the rich be keepers of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

their ſins, alas! this is no zeal: but let a wicked man
be as great as King <hi>Ahab, Micaiah</hi> will deal roundly with
him. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> will not ſpare Lords nor Nobles when they
ſin, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 17. For a Magiſtrate to puniſh poor Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and not the Gentry, when they do tranſgreſſe, is this
zeal? no it is curſed partiality.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. In ones ſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>In ones ſelf,</hi> rather then in any body elſe; true
zeal is more zealous againſt ſinne in ones ſelf then in all the
world beſides; otherwiſe, ſayes our Saviour, it is hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
and not zeal. <hi>Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of
thine own eye, and thou ſhalt ſee clearly to cast out the mote out
of thy brothers eye,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. Zeal I ſay, is like unto fire, it is
hot it ſelf firſt, before it heat others: may be the fire meets
with many other things that it is not able to heat it, as the
bottom of a kettle of water, the fire cannot heat it, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
the fire will be ſure to be hot of it ſelf. So it is with
thee: if thou beeſt zealous againſt ſinne, thou wilt be like
unto fire, rather ſuffer cold to be in any other, then ſuffer
it to be in it ſelf; ſo thou wilt rather ſuffer ſin in any body
elſe, then ſuffer it in thy ſelf: thou wilt not ſuffer ſin any
where elſe by thy good will, but above all things thou wilt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53869:79"/>
not ſuffer it in thy ſelf. This is the ſecond ſign of zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, it is impatient of ſin.</p>
               <p>The third ſign of zeal towards God is,<note place="margin">3. It cannot be quiet without aſſurance of Gods favour.</note> 
                  <hi>it cannot be quiet
till it be aſſured of Gods favour, and of Chriſt.</hi> Thou art never
earneſt for God, if thou canſt poſſibly be quiet without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of Chriſt and of Heaven: the reaſon is plain, I need
not expreſſe it. I know many a childe of God is not aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hereof, but there is never a childe of God under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but he is reſtleſſe till he be, Alas! he is never zealous
for God, if he be quiet without aſſurance of Gods love in
Chriſt Jeſus. Can I zealouſly love him, whoſe love to me I
am not aſſured of? for all that I know he will cut my
throat, he will turn the ſoreſt enemy I have, I cannot zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
love him. No more canſt thou zealouſly love God,
as long as thou art quiet without the aſſurance of his love.
For all that thou knoweſt God does not love thee, God he
may damn thee and caſt thee to hell for ever, and turn the
ſoreſt enemy in the world to thy ſoul, for all that thou
knoweſt, and therefore thou canſt not zealouſly love him;
if then thou be a zealous lover of God, either thou art aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of his love, or thou canſt never be quiet without it:
<hi>give diligence,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>to make your calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
ſure, for if ye do theſe things, ye ſhall never fall.</hi> 2 Pet.
1. 10. ye ſhall never fall, if ye make it ſure, but if ye can be
quiet without the aſſurance of election and Gods love, ye
may fall, and for all that I know, break your necks for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and periſh for evermore. Go to then, examine your
ſelves, what does your conſcience tell you, ye are not ſure
of Gods favour, nor your election to life? ye hope well
ye ſay, but ye are not aſſured of it, neither does it break
your ſleep a jot, nor hinder your ſports, and your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and your mirth, it is certain ye were never zealous
for God. What a wofull thing is this! haſt thou but one
ſoul, and art thou no more careful of it? art thou to live
either for ever in heaven or hell, when thou dieſt, in all
torture and torment world without end? and art thou no
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53869:79"/>
more diligent to make ſure before hand? <hi>perhaps thou mayſt
be ſaved,</hi> yea, but <hi>perhaps thou mayſt be damned.</hi> And haſt
thou no more love to thy ſoul, then to be quiet with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties?
O how many be there among us that have no
aſſurance from God, what he means to doe with them?
whether to ſave them, or to deſtroy and to damn them?
how many go blundring on in an uncertain opinion, and
conjecturall hope of Gods favour, and have no certainty
at all of the ſame? how many that are haunted with fears
and terrours, and doubts this way, and never labour to be
ſure? how many that have had pretty aſſurances a good
while ago, and now they have loſt them, and yet they ſit
idlely, and go dreaming on in the duties of religion, as if
they could ſhift well enough, though they never recover
again? this is no zeal: if thou beeſt zealous, thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
endure to be under uncertainties, never to be quiet till
thou haſt gotten the aſſurance of Gods love.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſign of zeal towards God is <hi>gladneſſe to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and to be furthered in the waies of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. Glaadneſs to further and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the waies of God.</note> If thou beeſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
thou art glad to be reproved, and told of thy ſinnes;
glad that the Miniſter ſhould meet with thy corruptions,
and rip them up in the Pulpit: as a Patient is glad that the
Phyſitian ſhould hit right on his diſeaſe. When <hi>Peter</hi> had
met with thoſe three thouſand in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and told them
plainly they were murderers of Chriſt, as ye may reade in
the Chapter, the Text ſayes, <hi>they gladly received the Word,</hi>
Act. 2. 41. <hi>Peter</hi> laid a greater ſin to their charge, then we
have unto yours. We have told you that ſome of you are
adulterers, and ſome of you drunkards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and ye are offended hereat; but <hi>Peter</hi> told them
they were murderers of Chriſt, and they gladly received the
Word; they were not angry with <hi>Peter</hi> but with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and were glad to be told of it, a ſign they were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
A zealous man is glad to further, and to be furthered
in all goodneſſe, he is glad to meet with the godly, that ſo
he may be quickned by conference; glad to hear news of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53869:80"/>
a Sermon, that ſo he may go to it and be edifyed; glad of
every opportunity both of doing and receiving good; glad
to go to a Sacrament which is Chriſts feaſt; ſo were the
good Iſraelites, glad at the Sacrament of the Paſſeover, they
kept that feaſt with great gladneſſe, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30. 21. Glad that
there was one, glad that they were at it, <hi>they were very glad,</hi>
ſayes the Text If thou beeſt zealous, thou wilt be glad of
a Communion, and glad to be at it. When thou haſt been
at a Sermon, thou wilt be glad that ever thou wert at it:
O the Word does thee ſuch good, that thou goeſt home
with all gladneſſe of heart, yea, though the Word did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much contradict thy corruptions. As the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when they had been reproved and rebuked
in the Congregation, and told of their ſins, and made to cry
out unto God, they went home and ate their meat with all
joy, glad that they underſtood the words that were told
them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 12. Thus thou wouldeſt to if thou wert zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
towards God; but if thou goeſt about the duties of
Gods worſhip, as ſorry peeces of buſineſſe, if thou doſt not
delight in prayer, and in hearing the Word, if thou canſt
ſit weariſomely, and when will the Miniſter have done? a
man may ſee it in thy countenance, thou art not joyfull to
hear, this is a ſign thou haſt not one ſcruple of zeal towards
God. The poor impotent man in the <hi>Acts,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was
a preaching, he lookt ſo merrily and ſo greedily upon him,
as if he would fain have it faſter then <hi>Paul</hi> could deliver, he
was a faithfull hearer: The ſame heard <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak, and
<hi>Paul</hi> ſtedfaſtly beheld him, and perceived he had faith to
be healed, <hi>Act.</hi> 149. He perceived he had faith, how did
he perceive it? he perceived it by his countenance, he could
give a ſhrewd gueſſe by his looks: while <hi>Paul</hi> was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">5. Rejoycing to ſee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he looked ſo cheerfully, and ſo greedily upon him, as
if he drunk in every point that he ſaid. The man without
doubt was zealous to hear.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſign of zeal towards God, is <hi>rejoycing to ſee the
forwardneſſe of others:</hi> I rejoyced greatly, ſayes <hi>Iohn</hi> to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53869:80"/>
elect Lady, I rejoyced greatly, that I found of thy children
walking in the truth, 2 <hi>Io.</hi> 4. Nay, if you be zealous, though
it may ſeem a diſparagement to thee, that others ſhould be
as gracious and famous as thy ſelf, yet thou wilt joy in it:
it ſeemed to be a diſparagement to <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Eldad</hi> and
<hi>Medad</hi> of low rank in the Church, that ſuch as they ſhould
propheſie in the Camp. Before <hi>Moſes</hi> was counted the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophet of the Lord, but now <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
as well as he: this I ſay might have ſeemed a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him, yet he was ſo farre from repining thereat, as
that he was glad for to hear it; would God that all the
Lords people were Prophets, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. 29. I confeſſe a good
man may be diſcontented hereby at the firſt, fleſh and blood
was ſtirring in good <hi>Ioſhua</hi> himſelf at that time, <hi>Moſes,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
them, ſayes he. But a godly ſoul will check himſelf,
and pull down his ſpirit, and force his heart to be glad, and
rejoyce in the goodneſſe of others, though it be a ſeeming
diſparagement to him. A good Miniſter rejoyceth to hear
of another Miniſters gifts, that out-ſtrips him. A good man
rejoyces to ſee others that are better and better beloved
then himſelf, though younger and inferiour, and meaner
otherwiſe. But if thou doſt not joy to ſee men zealous for
God, it is certain thou art a wretch: may be thou thinkeſt
much, thine eye is evil, becauſe they are ſo good and ſo
godly, and the like; this is an argument of a graceleſſe
heart: may be thou art apt to judge hardly of ſuch and
ſuch, becauſe they are holier and preciſer then thy ſelf, O
but if thou wert zealous, thou wouldeſt rejoyce for to ſee
it. Haſt thou a better gift then another? thou art bound to
help him: hath he a better gift then thou? he is bound to
be helpfull to thee.<note place="margin">Camment, in Iob.</note> It is a good ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, Tolle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidiam,
&amp; tuum eſt quod habeo: tollam invidiam, &amp; meum eſt
quod habes.</hi> Take away envy, and look wherein I excell thee
is thine: I will take away envy, and then look wherein
thou excelleſt me is mine. If thou be zealous, thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
howſoever. Be he a childe, thou wilt rejoyce that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53869:81"/>
he is better gifted then thy ſelf; nay, for that may a carnal
heart do, and be proud, he may rejoyce that his childe is
better-memoried, better-witted, better-gifted then himſelf.
O thinks he, this is my childe, this is my ſonne, this is my
daughter, never a father or mother hereabouts can ſay they
have ſuch a childe. This is nothing but pride. But be it a
ſervant, yea, be it a ſtranger, be it one whom thou counteſt
thine enemy, thou wilt rejoyce in his gifts; ſo God may
be glorified, no matter though I be diſgraced, yea, I count
it my honour, that my ſhame in the world may be the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
for Gods honour to get up: thus thou wilt reaſon, if
thou haſt a ſpirit of true zeal. It is greatly to be bewailed
how many ſymptomes of Atheiſm are amongſt us in this
regard: For men are ſo far from rejoycing in the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of others, that they grumble, and they thunder at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſo much, as that any ſhould be forward and zealous
for God; they had rather have an hundred boon-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
then one zealous man, rather be acquainted with
twenty that are carnal, then one that is holy in his wayes.
I thank God, ſayes one, we have never a Puritan in our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
I am glad we can ſay, we have none of theſe ſingular
fellows in our town, ſayes another. I ſpeak not of ſuch as
the Law doth count Puritans, enemies to the State and the
Church, it is a bleſſing indeed there be none ſuch: but of
the godly that are called Puritans by the impure tongues
of the wicked; the State hath no better friends under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Kingdom no better Subjects in the world, then are
they: for theſe are they that pray away Gods judgements
from the Land, that are earneſt with the Lord in prayer for
the King and Councell, and the Church, while the men of
the world by their drunkenneſſe, and whoredomes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſnes,
and ſecurity, and contempt of Gods Word, are
pulling down vengeance on the Nation, and provoke God
for to plague us. But theſe are they that moſt people have
little joy in. O my brethren, where we have ten or twenty
ſuch Puritans in our Pariſh, I would to God we had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53869:81"/>
I tell you, the day will come, that the worſt drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
in the Town would give a world, if he had it, he were
ſuch a Puritan. In this ſenſe the very Heathen man ſayes,
that every good man is a Puritan: <hi>Integer vitae ſceleriſque
purus,</hi> An entire man of life, and a pure man, pure from
the ſins that others do live in. Had ye any zeal towards
God, ye would be glad that all the Countrey were ſuch
Puritans.</p>
               <p>The ſixth ſign of zeal towards God is, <hi>zeal to Gods Church
and his people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6. Zeal to Gods Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion you may know his
zeal was not right, becauſe his zeal was againſt the Church.
Concerning zeal, ſayes he, <hi>I perſecuted the Church,</hi> Phil. 3. 6.
His zeal was againſt the Church, and therefore not right:
but after his converſion he had a zealous care of all the
Church, his zeal was then to the Church. If the Church
were not well, O how it troubled him! If the Church
were well, O how it comforted him! If the Church were
any where perſecuted or infected, with errour and doctrine
of devils, then he was frequent in prayer for it, often
would he labour, and ſigh, and mourn for it, and be wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the good of it. Now the Saints and the people of
God, theſe are the Church. Unto the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi>
Gal. 1. 2. that is, unto Gods people in <hi>Galatia.</hi> To feed the
Church of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. that is, the people of God.
Greet the Church that is in their houſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. that is,
the Saints that are in their houſe. In all Churches of the
Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. theſe are the Church of God. Now
if thou be zealous for God, thou wilt be zealous for Gods
Church Examine thy ſelf. Doſt thou mourn for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and diſquietments of Gods Church, that the Church
is ſo afflicted in all parts of the world? Does it prick thee
to the ſoul? Doſt thou go to God, and put him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?
Remember the <hi>Children of Edom,</hi> O Lord, how
they ſaid, down with it, down with it, even to the ground:
remember Lord the <hi>Tobiahs</hi> and <hi>Sanballats</hi> of theſe times,
remember Lord how they cry, down with thy people, down
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53869:82"/>
with them, root them out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an infallible ſign to
try thy heart by. If thou be zealous for God, thou wilt
zealouſly affect the Church of God. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> cannot ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his grief, but it would ſhew it ſelf in his face, even at
the Kings elbow, when <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> lay waſte. <hi>Vriah</hi> cannot
finde in his heart to eat and drink freely, or take the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his own houſe, as long as the Ark of God, and <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
and <hi>Iudah</hi> abode in tents. Thou muſt needs be affected
with the Church, if thou beeſt zealous for God. If thou
beeſt zealous for God, thou muſt needs love there where
God loves. <hi>God loves the very gates of Sion,</hi> he loves his
Church better then he loves all the world beſides. And ſo
wilt thou, if thou beeſt zealous for him. The Church is the
whole company of his Saints upon earth. One Saint is dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then a million of other men. It is a good ſaying of <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,</hi>

and ſo thou wilt love him, and affect him. Thou
wilt love him, if thou beeſt zealous to Godwards, I ſay,
thou wilt love a childe of God, albeit in a leathern-coat,
more then father and mother, wife and children, friend or
patron, ſo they be not Saints, I mean, with more ſpirituall

If ever men will buy any thing at the Fair, they'l buy when
they are all breaking up ſtandings, taking up their wares,
and packing away. If ever they'l be forward to buy, then
they will. God is now perchance <hi>ſhutting up ſhop-doors,</hi> is
now packing up his commodities, and his graces to be gone.
The doors of his Sanctuary have been open a long time, and
the Shop-windows of Heaven have ſtood broad ope this

to remove away his Candleſtick, to take away the power
of his Ordinances, and to withdraw his Spirit from ſtriving

ſpend it in Gods worſhip publike and private, or elſe God

not to meditate, thou canſt be content to hear the Word at

of heat.</hi> Be ever in <hi>action,</hi> if thou wouldeſt be zealous, be
alwaies ſtirring in the works of religion and godlineſſe:
you ſhall ſee men labour and toil naked in their ſhirts in
froſt and cold, and be hot for all that. Labour ſtirs up the
ſpirits, and heateth the bloud: labour will not ſuffer a man
to be cold; if <hi>Peter</hi> had been rowing in his boat, when he
ſtood ſtill in the High-Prieſts Hall by the chimney-corner,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53869:84"/>
he had had little need of that fire to have heated him; and
therefore if thou deſireſt to be zealous, labour in reading
of the Scriptures, labour in hearing and applying the Word
to thy heart, labour in examining thy conſcience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
of thy ſins, and labour in praying and calling upon
God, this will kindle the heat of zeal in thee, <hi>Ask, and ye
ſhall receive, that your ioy may be full,</hi> Joh. 16. 24. mark that,
your joy may be full, your comfort may be full, your love
may be full, and your hope may be full, that is, that it may
be zealous; <hi>for zeal is the fulneſſe of every affections in its
kinde.</hi> O, ſayes one, I am ſo dull, and ſo dead, I pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but my prayers are dead; and I hear, but my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is dead; I ſee my corruptions, abundance of vanity in
my heart, abundance of vanity in my thoughts, abundance
of vanity in every thing that I doe, and I am ſo dead, Lord
what ſhall I doe? Dead art thou? and doſt thou wonder
thou art dead? thou wilt not labour to be quickned, thou
art loth to be at the pains to be quickned, thou goeſt idlely

ſpeaks: Idleneſſe is death, idleneſſe is the burying of a
man alive. Thou art idle, and wilt not labour with God to
be quickned. When <hi>David</hi> was poring and blundring, and
looking upon the vanity of his minde, O he was as dead as
a timber-log, it deaded his ſoul quite and clean to ſee his
corruptions, but what does he do? he laboured with God
againſt it; he laboured with faſting and meditating, and
praying again and again, that the Lord would be pleaſed
to quicken him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> nine times in one Pſalm, <hi>Turn away mine

                  <note place="margin">Ver. 154.</note> 
                  <hi>and quicken thou me in thy way,</hi>
Pſal. 119. 37. <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, according to thy Word,</hi> in

verſe. He never would let his heart alone, till he had
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53869:84"/>
gotten life and ſpirit, and quickning again. As long as thou
art lazy in good duties, no wonder though thou be dead,
labouring and ſtriving in good exerciſes will heat a mans
ſoul, and make it more zealous.</p>
               <p>The third means is keeping good company, as <hi>Cleopas</hi>
was heated by being in Chriſts company, <hi>Did not our hearts
burn within us,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>while he talk twith us in the way?</hi>
Luk. 24. 32. As the bawdy Poet ſaid of his ſweet-heart, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
ad ignem hanc,</hi> Come to this fire: a whore inflames an
adulterer, one wicked man heats another unto luſt, and to
ſinne. So every childe of God is a fire for to heat thee.
Wouldeſt thou be zealous? ſort with Gods people, keep
company with the Saints, and ſuch as excell in grace and
vertue. Two are better then one, for if they fall, the one
will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when
he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. Again,
if two lie together, ſaies the Wiſe man, then they have heat,
but how can one be warm alone, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11. Doſt thou
complain, I have no zeal, I would be glad to be zealous,
but I am exceedingly lukewarm; do what I can, ſo I am,
and ſo I am likely to be: alas! doſt thou ever look to be
otherwiſe, as long as thou canſt company with vain perſons,
ſuch as may be will talk of heaven now and then, but there
is no heat nor warmth in their ſpeeches, they are dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
themſelves, and ſo are their ſpeeches, dead and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life. O but I live in a place that is wicked, and there's
ſcarce one godly man in the houſe where I dwell, and
I can finde none for to warm me. Doſt thou ſo? ſo did
<hi>Obadiah</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, there was never a good Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
to converſe with, and therefore what did he do?
he made uſe of Gods Prophets in private, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18. 4. and
though he might not be ſeen in their company for fear of
loſing their lives, he bid them in a cave, and there he would
have a bout with them in ſecret. Thou which neglecteſt the
ſociety of the Saints, never expect to be zealous. <hi>Thomas</hi>
was very faithleſſe, and full of his doubtings: One reaſon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53869:85"/>
was this, the Diſciples of Chriſt had meetings together,
and <hi>Thomas</hi> was not with them, ſayes the Text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 24.
The coals that lie together in the hearth, you ſee how they
glow and are fired, while the little coals that are fallen off,
and lie by, ſeparate from their company, are black without
fire. If ever thou deſireſt to be zealous, make much of the
fellowſhip of the Saints: thou canſt hardly come where two
or three Saints are met together, but thou ſhalt finde Chriſt
in the midſt of them.</p>
               <p>The fourth means is,<note place="margin">4. Shunning the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>Shunning the occaſions of ſin:</hi> Moſes
would not leave ſo much as a hoof behinde him in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
Exod. 10. 26. that there might be no occaſion for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to turn back into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> had he left but a hoof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
there, that were an occaſion to go thither to fetch it.
<hi>Abraham</hi> would not take ſo much as a thread or a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet
of the King of Sodom, when he offered him, leſt
there ſhould be any hint to the fleſh, to diſtruſt in God,
Thou canſt never be zealous,<note place="margin">Gen. 14 23</note> unleſſe thou <hi>ſhun the occaſions
of ſin:</hi> If the heart have but an occaſion once to be vain,
it's a thouſand to one, but ſo it will be, deadneſſe will ſteal
on't upon the leaſt occaſion. Give a theef but an occaſion
of having a booty, his fingers cannot hold. When <hi>David</hi>
had given <hi>occaſion</hi> to the enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme,<note place="margin">Nemo diu tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note>
the Lord told him he would puniſh him, 2 <hi>Sa.</hi> 12. 14. Why?
becauſe if they had but an occaſion they would be ſure for
to take it. Let no man put an occaſion to fall in his brothers
way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13. Alas! if the fleſh have no occaſion, it will
lay hold on it; it is not enough to keep out of a ſin, but
thou muſt go far from it, not only from ſin, but alſo from
all occaſions of ſin. Keep thee far from a falſe matter, <hi>Exo.</hi>
23. 7. One thinks I may go ſo farre and not ſinne. Thus far
I may do, and ſo far is this lawfull; but let me tell thee, if
thou goeſt ſo far, thine own heart will have occaſion to go
further, and then thou art undone: <hi>Nimiâ licentiâ ſumus
omnes deteriores,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Terent.</note> ſayes <hi>Terence.</hi> We are all the worſe for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
too much liberty: if once it be an occaſion to the fleſh,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53869:85"/>
thou art gone. Zeal cannot abide the occaſions of evil; the
leaſt occaſions will choak it.</p>
               <p>The fifth means is,<note place="margin">5. Means to eſchew the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ſinne.</note> 
                  <hi>to eſchew the beginnings of ſin; Peter</hi>
did but begin to rebuke Chriſt, Maſter, ſpare thy ſelf, he
began to rebuke him, ſayes the Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. but Chriſt
did ſo hate the very beginnings of that ſin, that he ſaid, <hi>Get
thee behinde me, Satan.</hi> The devil was in that beginning of
ſin. The Scribes and the Phariſees began to reaſon, ſaying,
<hi>Who is this that ſpeaks blaſphemies?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vigilandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. <hi>Greg.</hi>
                  </note> And Jeſus condemned
theſe beginnings of reaſonings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 21. Thoſe that were
invited to the Feaſt in the Goſpel, they came not, but fell
to excuſes, and were caſt into utter darkneſſe for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
But how came they to fall into that ſinne? the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſhews plainly, becauſe they did not eſchew the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the ſinne; they all with one conſent began to
make excuſe, <hi>Luk 14. 18 principiis obſta,</hi> ſet thy ſelf againſt
the beginning of ſinne; if thou ſuffer thy heart to begin
once, it will be ſure to go farther. The Spirit of God hath
a good phraſe, fall into ſinne. He that ſtands, let him take
heed leſt he fall: A man that ſtands upon a high rock, if
he do not look to the beginning of his fall, he cannot ſtop
himſelf till he is quite fallen down to the bottom, and if
not by meer hap he catch hold ſomewhere, which it's a
thouſand to one if ever he do, if he do not, I ſay, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if he break not his neck. Thou canſt never have the life
of grace in thee, unleſſe thou take heed of the beginnings
of ſin.</p>
               <p>Be exhorted all ye that fain would fear God,<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be zealous.</note> to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>Firſt conſider, <hi>Ye can never be revenged on your worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Elſe you can never be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on your worſt enemies.</note>
unleſſe ye be zealous; ye would be glad to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on your ſworn enemies. <hi>Sampſon</hi> begged hard of the
Lord, that he might be revenged on the Philiſtims for his
two eyes; but thou haſt worſe enemies then the Philiſtims
were to him. <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> theſe
are the worſt enemies that ever mortall man had, it is good
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53869:86"/>
to be revenged on them; thou canſt never be revenged on
them, except thou be zealous; there is no enemy beſides
that it is lawfull to be revenged on, but only upon theſe,
on theſe thou mayſt lawfully: theſe have done thee much
ſpight, they have brought thee into the eſtate of wrath and
damnation, they have made thee accurſed, and liable to
hell-torments for ever, they have pluckt out the two eyes
of thy ſoul; now if thou wouldeſt be zealous, thou mayſt
be revenged upon them. The Apoſtle puts zeal and revenge
together, yea, what zeal, yea, what <hi>revenge,</hi> 2 Cor 7. 11. If
thou beeſt zealous, thou mayſt be revenged upon ſin that
hath done thee ſo much miſchief: it hath troubled thy
peace, defiled thy conſcience, diſabled thee from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God, hindred many good things from thee. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hadſt thou any hurt, or any ſorrow, or any evil, but
thou mayſt thank ſinne for it: Juſt cauſe haſt thou to be
revenged upon ſinne, there is an imbred deſire of revenge
in a man upon thoſe that wrong him: the Heathen could
ſay,
<q>Eſt vindicta bonum vitâ jucundius ipſâ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Revenge is ſweeter then life it ſelf:<note place="margin">Iuvenal. Sat. 13.</note> Here it is true, and
no where elſe. All other revenge is a damnable premunire
againſt God, vengeance is mine, ſayes he, and who is he
that revengeth himſelf to intrench upon Gods right? but
here revenge is commanded, yea, it's ſweeter then life:
here revenge and ſpare not, and this is the way: get zeal,
and be as hot as a furnace in anger againſt ſinne, and beat it
as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Iſraelites calf, into duſt and powder;
hath thy filthy couſening heart deceived thee ſo often?
hereby thou mayſt be revenged on it, be zealous to ſearch
it, and curb it, and tame it; have thy luſts been greedy,
and proud, and ſenſual; this humour they muſt have, and
this faſhion they muſt follow, and this pleaſure they muſt
take, and this liberty they muſt uſe. O if thou wouldeſt
be zealous, thou mayſt eaſily be revenged on thy luſts, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
thou mayſt be revenged on the devil, and ſpight his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53869:86"/>
to advance Chriſts; hereby thou mayſt be revenged
on thy fleſh, that hath played the traytor ſo often with
thee, thou mayſt afflict it, and maſter it, and block it, and
ſubdue it; hereby thou mayſt tread upon the world, that
hath ſo often enſnared thee, thou mayſt ſcorn it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it, and all the glory of it, and count it as droſſe and
dung in compariſon of Chriſt: hereby thou mayſt trample
Satan under thy feet. It is a ſtrange thing how little men
ſtudy to be revenged on theſe enemies; let our own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give us but a croſſe-word, we are at daggers drawing
to be revenged; but the devil may baffle us, and the devil
may tempt us, and beguile us, we put it all up; Let a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
but anger us a little, and offend us but in a peece of
ſervice, or an errand, O we are ſo revengefull, and ready
to make them ſmart for it! but ſinne may croſſe us in our
ſouls, and rob us of Chriſt, and deprive us of grace, and
mercy, and peace, and all; yet we are good friends with it,
we take nothing amiſſe; alas! theſe men are monſters and
mad men, one day thou ſhalt ſee that ſinne, and thy luſt,
and Satan, whoſe temptations thou haſt been led by, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
they are the worſt enemies in the world; and if ever
thou deſireſt to be revenged upon them, O endeavour to
be zealous.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Zeal ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to doe good unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> Conſider thou wilt never be able to do good
unto others, unleſſe thou be zealous. When men go drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly
on in Religion, they can never do good upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
what do others think? they think baſely and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thereof, as if it were a matter of nothing; but when they
ſee a man zealous, this affects them indeed, if any thing will
do it. When a man is zealous at a game, he laugheth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
he is as merry as he can ſtand on his legs: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man that ſhall ſee it, will be apt to demand what fine
merry pleaſant game is that? ſo it is with ambitious men,
when a man is zealous for a living, he rides through thick
and thin, through froſt and ſnow all the night long, this
friend he ſeeks to, and that Noble man he flies to, to help
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53869:87"/>
him in his ſuit: what will folks ſay? certainly he is going
about ſome great living or other, he is ſo eager about it.
So if thou wouldeſt be zealous for God, and fervent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
men would be compelled to conceive better of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
and of Chriſt, then thou mighteſt provoke others
to godlineſſe. Zeal is a provoking grace. <hi>Your zeal hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
very many,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 2. As zeal in charity provokes, ſo
does zeal in every good work provoke Where <hi>Theodoret</hi>
obſerves the wiſedom of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theodoret in locum.</note> for he provokes the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
by the zeal of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
by the zeal of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> for zeal does mutually
provoke one another. O what a deal of good mighteſt thou
do in the houſe where thou dwelleſt, in the Pariſh where
thou liveſt, in the Countrey where thou art, if thou wouldſt
labour to be zealous! I knew an old man, whether he be
dead now or alive, I know not, that uſed conſtantly to go
to the labouring men in the field, and catechize them, and
poſe them in Religion, as they were reaping and working,
he would go to mens ſhops where he was acquainted, and
ſtir them up to have care of their ſouls, and by this means
brought above fourty men and women to ſeek out for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that before had no more care that way, then if they
had been like a company of beaſts. Wouldeſt thou not be
glad to do good? thou wilt never be able to do it, except
thou be zealous. <hi>Paul</hi> had women, and ſundry private
Chriſtians, that are ſaid to labour with him in the Goſpel.
This, this beloved, would cauſe Religion to thrive here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Peoples zeal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth Miniſters.</note> Conſider I pray you, thou wilt <hi>diſcourage us
that are Gods Miniſters,</hi> except thou be zealous. If men
would be zealous in hearing, and zealous proficients, it
would make us go cheerfully on in our callings. When <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
told <hi>Paul</hi> the fervent minde of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
the Apoſtle; when he told us your fervent minde
we rejoyced the more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo it is in
the Original, when he told us your zeal. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53869:87"/>
cheared to hear that. What greater diſcouragement to a
Schoolmaſter, then that his ſcholars ſhould be dull and not
profit? What greater diſheartning to a Captain, then that
his ſouldiers ſhould be fainthearted, and without life? and
what greater grief to a Miniſter, then that his people ſhould
be ſenſeleſſe and liveleſſe? It made <hi>Ieremy</hi> weary of his
life:<note place="margin">Mic. 7. 1.</note> It made the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> lament bitterly. Wo is
me, I am like the Grape gleaners: It made the Prophet
<hi>Iſay</hi> cry out, I have laboured in vain. On the contrary,
when the people are zealous and forward, and drink in the
words of eternal life with all greedineſſe, and bring forth
fruit with abundance, this makes a Miniſter go merrily on
in his function.<note place="margin">Ambroſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Zelo Eccleſia Dei congregatur,</hi> ſaith Saint
<hi>Ambroſe:</hi> It is zeal that does gather a Church, the zeal of
the Miniſter, and the zeal of the people; the Lord quicken
us in his mercy, that we may encourage one another daily.
Let us be encouraged by you, when ye are reproved be
not offended. You think the Miniſter ſpights you, alas!
we have no reaſon to wiſh any of your fingers to ake, much
leſſe to wiſh that your ſouls ſhould periſh. When S. <hi>Paul</hi>
commanded that the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to Satan did he wiſh him any hurt? No, Deliver him
unto Satan, ſayes he, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that
the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
5. 5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> ſayes <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome.</hi>
No mortal man loved that offender in <hi>Corinth</hi>
more then <hi>Paul</hi> did, ſayes he, when he would have him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
unto Satan. It was only that he might know he was
a damned wretch, unleſſe he amended, and that the devil
ſhould have him unleſſe he were humbled. What was his
reaſon? his reaſon was this, that his ſoul might be ſaved in
that day. O the Miniſter preaches damation ſo often, he
is unmercifull to our ſouls. O my brethren, we intend you
the greateſt mercies of heaven in ſo ſaying, it is that ye may
not run into damnation, but may repent and beleeve the
Goſpel. Do not thus diſcourage us whom God hath ſent
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53869:88"/>
to you as his Miniſters to labour in the word and doctrine
among you, but ſtir up your ſelves to be zealous in hearing
and obeying, that we may give up an account of your ſouls
unto God with all cheerfullneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly conſider,<note place="margin">4. Zeal makes a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. <hi>Proverb.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>You can never be excellent, if ye be not

Wouldeſt thou then be excellent? get this ſame zeal: zeal

1 Cor. 12. 31. The Word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
after the beſt things: Wouldeſt thou be excellent in
prayer, and excellent in the duties of religion? be zealous
therein. A Chriſtian is like fire: fire mounts up abſolutely
aloft, and aſcends above all. So does a Chriſtian: he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all the men of this world put them all together:
like <hi>Iob,</hi> there is none like him in all the earth. Every man

               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Zeal makes men like Angels.</note> Conſider I pray, who ye may be like if once ye
be zealous; ye may be like unto the Angels of heaven, they
are ſpirits and flaming fire, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. if
thou art zealous for God, thou art a bodily Seraphim;
though thou canſt never be without ſin as long as thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
in this world,<note place="margin">Gregor.</note> yet as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks, in the mouth of
zeal thou mayſt ſwallow up thy ſins; nothing will devour
and conſume ſin ſo well as true zeal. O get a coal of this
fire then from Gods Altar, and heat thy heart with it, and
while thou mayſt be like the bleſſed Angels of God, be not
like the brutiſh ſons of the old <hi>Adam.</hi> Zeal is it that maketh
an Angel to be an Angel. <hi>Angeli ſine zelo nihil ſunt,</hi> ſayes

Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. We have greatneed of zeal.</note> Conſider what infinite need thou haſt of true
zeal. Suppoſe a great froſt, and a tedious cold winter were
a coming, and then no firing were to be had, would not
men buy as much fewell as they could get, and ſtack it,
and ſtore it, that they might have it at their need? other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they were not able to live, nor to dreſſe their own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance,
they would certainly ſtarve if they ſhould have
no firing in ſuch a cold time. Beloved, I ſpeak to ſuch as
have ears to hear, there's a cold time of religion a coming,
and the wrath of God is ready to break forth, to plague
mens ſouls with key-coldneſſe this way, becauſe they have
deſpiſed the zeal of the Lord, and no firing to be had then,
God knows how ſoon the power of Gods Word may be
taken from us. You who love your own ſouls, look about,
lay up ſome firing, and be not ſlothfull in all this buſineſſe;
do all diligence to ſtore up grace for your ſelves, this will
help you to zeal, not <hi>ſlothful</hi> in buſineſſe, <hi>fervent in ſpirit.</hi>
Rom. 12. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo it is in the Originall, zealous in
ſpirit. If ye will not be ſlothfull in buſineſſe, ye ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be zealous in ſpirit. O get quickly the ſpirit of prayer,
to be zealous in prayer by faith, it will be the beſt ſtring
to your bow, it will be your only thing left, nothing left
you but prayer in ſecret unto God, had not ye need to be
diligent for that? When a poor cripple hath nothing to
truſt to but only his begging, he will ply that When a poor
day-labourer hath never a foot of ground, nor any thing,
but only his fingers end to maintain him and his family, he
he will be ſure to employ them; alas, if he ſhould have a
wound in his hands, or he ſhould loſe the uſe of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
what ſhall he do? when a mans houſe leans mainly
upon one pillar, he will look to that pillar. Thus it is with
thee. Thou ſhalt have little elſe beſides prayer, thou muſt
get it out of thy fingers ends. Now we that are Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
ſtudy all the week long to quicken you here when
ye come to Gods Houſe, while ye are thinking of other
matters; but if God ſhould once take away us from you,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53869:89"/>
all the work lies upon your backs, and ye have little elſe
beſides Prayer and Gods Word for to help you. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not ſlothfull in this buſineſſe, get a ſure hold in
Chriſt, that ye may be able to hold in the evil day. No
matter though the world do deride you; for if ye have true
zeal, ſayes <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ye will fear praiſe or diſpraſe no
more then if you were all alone in the world, and no man
beſides you. If no perſwaſions can prevail with thee to the
trading for this zeal that I ſpeak of, hear what the Lord
Jeſus doth peremptorily threaten: It ſhall come to paſſe
that I will ſpue thee out of my mouth.</p>

               <p>Firſt, by a ſtrong obteſtation, as a mother perſwades her
childe, as ever thou art my childe do this for me. <hi>If ye then

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:53869:89"/>
as ever ye be riſen with Chriſt, do it, as he beſeeches the
Philipians. If there be therefore any conſolation in Chriſt,
if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if
any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1, 2. q. d.
as ever ye acknowledge any comfort in Chriſt, as ever ye
beleeve any communion of the holy Ghoſt, any mercies
and bowels in God, fulfill this exhortation: this is a ſtrong
perſwaſion indeed, for if this cannot prevail with you, ye
deny all the comforts of Chriſt, ye deny all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Spirit, ye deny all the mercies of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is ſtrong; as a mother counts it a ſtrong entreaty to
her childe; as ever thou art my childe, as ever thou takeſt
me to be thy mother, obey me in this; for if her childe
will not yeeld, he muſt needs deny the womb that bare him,
and the paps that gave him ſuck. Wilt thou deny the Lord
Jeſus? wilt thou deny his reſurrection, and all intereſt in it?
if thou wilt not deny it, ſet thine affections on God, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou art riſen with Chriſt, be ſure for to do it. Wilt
thou ſet thine affections upon the things of this world, when
Chriſt entreats thee as ever thou art his, to ſet thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on him?</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Becauſe we are dead to the things of this world.</note> The Apoſtle here perſwades by a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
for ye are dead, ſayes he, verſ 3. <hi>Set your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things above, not on things on the earth,</hi> for ye are
dead, ye are dead to the things of this life; will ye ſet your
affections to thoſe things ye are dead to? ye are dead to
the things of this life, if ye be Chriſts, and therefore ſet
not your affections on them; <hi>mortui non mordent,</hi> as we
ſay, dead men bite not one another with ſlanders and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
did ye ever ſee a dead man go up and down drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and bowzing, whoring and gaming, and carking and
caring? I'le aſſoon beleeve that a dead man can do this,
as a true Chriſtian. I confeſſe that corruption may carry a
good Chriſtian into ſin, but he is dead to theſe courſes, he
cannot ſet his affections hereon, he is dead; and will ye
ſet your affections on the things of this world, now ye are
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53869:90"/>
dead? Bring a childe of God to your drinkings, and your
whiffings, his affections are dead, he hath no heart to them:
bring him to your ſportings, and your vain merriments, and
your fooleries, you ſhall ſee him ſo dead to them, that ye
ſhall have no delight in his company. S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this an
argument <hi>ab abſurdo.</hi> How ſhall we that are dead to ſinne,
live any longer therein? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2. How is this poſſible?
I ſhall as ſoon beleeve it, as that a dead man ſhould walk
along your ſtreets in a winding-ſheet: What? know you
not this, ſayes he, what a Chriſtian, and yet his affections
on ſuch courſes as theſe? this is impoſſible, how ſhall ye?
So that this is another ſtrong perſwaſion, becauſe ye are
dead, therefore ſet not your affections below.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Becauſe Chriſt is our life. <hi>Vt vitam redimas.</hi> Horat.</note> The Apoſtle here perſwades by a ſtrong reaſon,
Chriſt is your life, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Life is ſweet, it is true, and a mans
affections are ſtrong to his life, <hi>veſtes ac omnia vendes,</hi> thou
wilt part with cloaths, and part with moneys, and part
with lands, and part with all for thy life: thine affections
are ſtrong ſet to life. Now Chriſt is thy life, or elſe thou
art but a damned wretch: if thou beeſt a true Chriſtian,
Chriſt is thy life, and wilt not thou ſet thine affections on
thy life; his Commandments are thy life, his Word is thy life,
his ordinances are thy life, his promiſes, his favours, his bloud,
are thy life, and wilt thou not ſet thine affections on thy life?
If thou beeſt a true Chriſtian, thou wilt pray for life, and
repent for life, and ſanctifie the Sabbath for life, and
put up an injury, and be obedient to God for life, all thine
affections conſpire together for life: thou loveſt thy life
and thou deſireſt thy life, and thou rejoyceſt in thy life,
and thou feareſt that which is hurtfull to life, and hateſt
that which is contrary to life, all thine affections will be to
thy life;<note place="margin">4. Becauſe Chriſt will bring us to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> and therefore ſet thine affections on Chriſt, for he
is thy life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle here perſwades by a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
When Chriſt ſhall appear, then ye alſo ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with him in glory, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. this is an excellent motive
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53869:90"/>
to ſet thine affections on God, <hi>becauſe he will bring thee to
glory,</hi> every man affects glory. Now all the glory of this
world is a blaze, as our Proverb is, a good Proverb it is, it
is but a blaze, and not worthy thine affections, none but
baſe hearts will affect this; thou art the childe of wrath
and damnation from the cradle to the coffin, thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to hell and confuſion, if thou beeſt not a new creature
in Chriſt: and wilt thou affect to be a Gentleman, affect
to be a Knight or a Lord? wilt thou affect to get credit and
honour, and repute among men, to be praiſed by mens
mouths? this is even as if a thief ſhould affect credit as he
is going to the gallows. Set thine affections then upon God
and upon Chriſt, when he appears he will help thee to a
kingdom of glory. Chriſt is the King of glory; Who is
the King of glory? it is the Lord of hoſts, he is the
King of glory; ſet thine affections on him then. The
vulgar have a pretty ſaying, He that is in favour with
the King, is half a King. What may not ſuch an one doe,
what may not ſuch an one have, if he be in favour with a
King? <hi>potens potentum amicitia,</hi> Potent is the favour that a
man hath with him that is potent. And therefore ſet thine
affections upon Chriſt, let thine affections be in favour with
Chriſt; what is that then thou canſt not have? thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are potent, if they be in favour with him; all power
is given to me in heaven and earth, ſayes Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
18. Chriſt is very potent: if thine affections be not ſet on
him, he is potent enough to damn thee; if they be, he is
potent to ſave thee, and when he appears, then ſhalt thou
appear with him in glory.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. If our aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be not let on Chriſt, they are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> The Apoſtle here perſwades by a ſtrong illation
or inference. Mortifie therefore, ſayes he, mortifie your
earthly members, inordinate affection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> verſ. 5. mark,
he cals the affection, when it is not ſet aright upon God, he
cals it inordinate affection; if thine affections run more
after the things of this life, then after Chriſt and his Word,
and his Commandments, and his Ordinances, thine affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53869:91"/>
are diſorderly, they are all out of order. Order is to
be obſerved in all things, and wilt thou ſuffer diſorder
break in upon thy ſoul? diſorder turns all topſie turvie;
diſorder will undoe a whole Kingdom: if a Kingdom be
out of order, it muſt needs go to wrack. If a family be out
of order, it muſt needs be brought to nought; nothing can
ſtand without order, no art can conſiſt without order: and
certainly thy ſoul cunnot ſtand without order; if thine
affections be out of order, thy ſoul is in civill wars, and
cannot ſtand but muſt periſh. Now if thine affections be
not ſet upon God, they are all out of order. What's the
reaſon that men are ſo forgetfull of their ſouls? if their
bellies do hunger, they remember to fill them; if their
backs be naked, they remember to cloath them; if their
markets be not made, they remember to diſpatch them; but
their ſouls may periſh and be damned, they do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them: What's the reaſon of this? their affections are
out of order. <hi>Ordo eſt mater memoriae,</hi> Order is the mother
of memory; a man can never remember his buſineſſes, if
all be out of order. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced to behold their
order in <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> Col. 2. 5. he was glad to ſee that all their
affairs were in order, why? then he hop't all would go well
with them: <hi>David</hi> prays God to order his ſteps: <hi>Order my
steps in thy Word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over
me:</hi> Pſa. 119. 133. He knew that his luſts would be like
maſterleſſe hounds, he ſhould have no hoe with them, if
his ſoul were out of order. Order my ſteps in thy word,
ſayes he, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
If thine affections be out of order, alas, every luſt will do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer,
every corruption will be like a maſterleſſe hound,
as we ſay. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, that death is out of order, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 22.
And <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other Divines thence do obſerve, that
hell is out of order; and wilt thou ſuffer a diſorder to come
among thine affections? alas, they will be ſo buſie about
the things of this life, that thou ſhalt finde no while for
better employments, no while for repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53869:91"/>
no while for bethinking thy ſelf of thy waies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for thy ſoul. Diſordered perſons are buſie-bodies, ſaies
the Text. We hear there be ſome among you that walk <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly</hi>
among you, and are buſie-bodies, 2 <hi>Th.</hi> 3. 11. If thine
affections be diſorderly, they will be ſo buſie, that thou ſhalt
never finde leaſure to trafick for Heaven, or the ſalvation of
thy ſoul. Beloved, this muſt needs then be a ſtrong perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſet your affections above, becauſe otherwiſe thine
affections are all out of order. Thus far the Apoſtle here
helps us with motives expreſſed in the context.</p>
               <p>That which the Apoſtle begins,<note place="margin">Other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſet our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on God.</note> let the theme of my Text
go further in the ſame. Many and ſweet motives there are
that we may be ſtirred up to this duty by, to ſet our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on God.</p>
               <p>The firſt motive is taken from the <hi>eaſineſſe that our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put
us in to proſecute any thing we affect:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Becauſe it is eaſie to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that we affect.</note> if our affections
be ſet on a thing, they make it eaſie to proſecute; if thou
affect the things of the world, thine affections make it eaſie
to labour and to toyl, eaſie to riſe early, eaſie to ſit up late,
eaſie to travell, and go through any other difficulty: the
covetous man thinks his labour to be eaſie, ſo he may gain
and get profit; the voluptuous man thinks it eaſie to hunt
and to hawk, and ride himſelf out of breath, ſo he may
have pleaſure and delight. Take thine eaſe, ſayes the rich
man in the Goſpel, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 19. He thought it eaſie to pull down, and to
build up, eaſie to gather in his harveſts and his wealth, eaſie
to be an Epicure and a drunkard, and voluptuous, why?
becauſe his affections were ſet hereupon: is it ſo that thine
affections are able to make any buſineſſe eaſie, O ſet thine
affections upon God, repentance will be eaſie, mortification
will be eaſie, and ſelf-denial will be eaſie, and to ſuffer
all the reproaches of Chriſt will be eaſie, if once thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
were ſetled that way; knowledge is eaſie to
him that underſtandeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14 6. The ſcorner ſeeks
it, ſayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> and he cannot finde it; the worldling
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53869:92"/>
ſeeks it and he cannot finde it; it is hard, ſayes one, to know
how to pray and be holy, it is hard ſayes another, to know
how to repent and give over my ſinnes, and be ſtrict, and I
cannot do it. No? that is, <hi>becauſe thine affections are bent
another way?</hi> but if thine affections were ſet upon Heaven,
this knowledge were eaſie. Come unto me ye that labour,
ſayes the world, I will make it eaſie to travell, and cark,
and care; come unto me, ſayes pleaſure, I will make it eaſie
to be merry and to laugh: come unto me, ſayes the fleſh,
I will make it eaſie to be revenged on him that does wrong
thee; I will make it eaſie to obtain this and that. So ſayes
the Lord Jeſus, Come unto me ye that labour, and I will
give you reſt, my yoke is eaſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 30. Whatever
thou affecteſt, come to it, and thou ſhalt finde it to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.
A man would wonder how the labouring man will
ſweat and work till he is faint, to get a little maintenance,
the reaſon is this, he affects it. One would wonder what

ſo hard to depend upon God; what is the reaſon of this?
thine affections are earthly; if thine affections were ſet

ſuch a haunt, and I finde it ſo hard to break my ſelf of it;
I am cholerick, and I finde it ſo hard for to bridle it; I am
poor and afflicted, and I finde it ſo hard for to bear it; alas,
alas, it is the eaſieſt thing in the world, if thine affections
were to it. Wouldeſt thou not be glad to count it to be eaſie
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53869:92"/>

God better then thou doſt, O labour then to ſet thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

thee to part with thy geegaws, thou art ſo loth, it
is a hard task to perſwade thee, that is, becauſe thou wilt
be proud ſtill: ſhould we perſwade thee to diſcard wicked

thou art loth to thruſt them forth of thy houſe, that is,
becauſe thou wouldeſt fain have their cuſtome, thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are that way, and therefore it is not eaſie to perſwade
thee, but ſet thine affections aright, and every difficulty is
eaſie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond motive is taken from the <hi>ſhameleſſeneſſe of the
affections:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. A man is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of what he affects. <hi>Ageſilaus. Philopaem.</hi>
                  </note> If thou beeſt once deeply affected with any
thing, thou wilt never be aſhamed of it. See a proud phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
fool that affecteth his long locks, and his love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.
Every one that is ſober-minded and ſees him, is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſay, what a humerous fool is yonder man, what a
ruffian he is! how like a Maſtiffe or a Bedlam does he
look! yet the fool is not aſhamed thereof, becauſe he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it. See a light-headed wretch that is ever a fooling,
and ever a jeſting, and ever a toying, and playing, and this
ſport, and that ſport. Every grave man that beholds him
is apt for to ſay, what a vain man is this? I never ſaw ſuch
a light-headed ſot in my life; yet the wretch is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thereof, becauſe he affects it. The ſwearer ſwears, and
is not aſhamed: the worldling covets, and is not aſhamed;
the mocker mocks, and is not aſhamed; though every man
in his wits that does view them, marvels at their madneſſe,
and how deſperate they be: all cry ſhame on them, yet
they are not aſhamed becauſe they affect it. Thou haſt a
whores forehead, thou refuſeſt to be aſhamed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 3. The
whore whoſe affections are ſet on her lovers, and her adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
cannot be aſhamed, but ſhe dares go on for all the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53869:93"/>
ſhame of the earth; why? becauſe ſhe affects them. <hi>Nero</hi>
was not aſhamed of his villanies in the open market of <hi>Rome.
Veſpaſian</hi> was not aſhamed of his ſtinking coveteouſneſſe
by urine. If it be thus, O why doſt thou not ſet thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on God, and on Chriſt, and his laws? thou couldeſt
never be aſhamed hereof, if once thou didſt truly affect
them. When <hi>Davids</hi> affections were ſtirred to dance before
the Ark of God, and put off his garment to do it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fie upon thee, fie upon thee, ſayes <hi>Micol</hi> fie for ſhame,
what art thou not aſhamed to make thy ſelf vile on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion?
I will be more vile yet, ſayes he, if this be vileneſſe,
to rejoyce before God, if this be eſteemed a vileneſſe, I
will be more vile yet: he could not be aſhamed, becauſe
his affections were ſet upon Gods Ark. Out you Puritan,
you are a vile companion, to be ſo preciſe as you are; you
muſt be reproving and talking of the Scripture upon every
occaſion, out you hypocrite you, are you not aſhamed to
do thus? No, no, he is not aſhamed, he can never be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
if this be to be a Puritan, to be holy and ſtrict againſt
ſin, I will be more a Puritan yet; If this be to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
to be labouring to draw others from their luſts, I
will be a more hypocrite yet. If this be ſingularity, not to
do as the men of this world do, I will be more ſingular
yet; I will ſpeak of Gods teſtimonies and it were before
Kings; and <hi>I will not be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 119. 46. Impudence,
and not to be aſhamed, is a very great matter; if it be in
ſin, it is deſperate, it is a ſign a man is deſperately affected
towards ſinne; but if it be in good, it is admirable; it is a
holy kinde of impudence, it is a ſign a man is deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards good, ſo affected that nothing can make him
aſhamed. Never will a man be aſhamed of that which he
affects; fie for ſhame, will you be rich and take in ſuch
profits? will you be in ſuch credit? fie, will you be a Lord
and a Nobleman in ſuch honor? will you be learned and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo much knowledge? He conceives they are all fools
that ſay ſo, though peradventure they do not affect ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53869:93"/>
things, yet he does, and therefore he will not be aſhamed
of them. So if thine affections be ſet upon Chriſt, thou wilt
never be aſhamed of his croſſe, never aſhamed of his badge,
never aſhamed of his Word. The children of the devil are
not aſhamed of their abominations; they can drink and be
drunken, and vomit, and reel, and not be aſhamed; they
can be proud and carnal, and have no more religion in them
then the ſtock, and not be aſhamed. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> will not
be aſhamed of his halting, <hi>Philopaemenes</hi> will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of his deformedneſſe, when they hold it their
credit to be thus as they were. O therefore ſet thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on God, and thou ſhalt never be aſhamed of his
waies.</p>
               <p>The third motive is taken from the hankeringneſſe of the
affections.<note place="margin">3. What the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Look what thou ſettest thine affections upon, that
thou wilt hanker after.</hi> If thou ſet thine affections on the
things of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy heart will ſo hanker after them, that
they will haunt thee whatever thou goeſt about; they will
haunt thee at prayer time, and haunt thee at Church time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they will haunt thee in the Sabbath, and haunt thee at the
Sacrament; like the Fly in <hi>Albertus,</hi> that was ever hankring
after the bald head: though he flapt it off again and again,
yet ſtill it would be hankring, he could never be rid of it,
it would ſtill be a hankring. Who would be thus troubled
with his affections? he cannot go by an Alehouſe, but his
affections water to go in: he cannot ſee a pair of Tables,
but his affections hanker after a game: he cannot meet with
an injury, but his affections itch to revenge; he cannot
ſpeak well nor do any thing which is commendable, but
his affections muſt be ſwelling with pride. Who, I ſay, would
be thus troubled with his affections? Though God had
forbid <hi>Lots</hi> wife to look back upon pain of his heavy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
nevertheleſſe her affections did ſo hanker after
her houſe, and her countrey, and her ancient acquaintance,
that ſhe looked behinde her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 26. Her carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53869:94"/>
lind till that ſhe lookt back. They are greedy dogs, they
look to their own way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11. Thine affections if they
be not ſet right, they are like greedy dogs in the Kitchin,
that are ever looking to the platters, be the Miſtreſſe eye
never ſo little off, they are licking inſtantly. So thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are ever hankering after that which thou affecteſt:
and therefore thou art beſt to ſet thine affections on God:
for look where they are ſet, there they will be hankering.
If ever thy heart be turned to God, and thine affections
converted to him, they will ever be hankring and looking
after God. At that day ſhall a man look to his maker, and
his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the holy one of Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. 7.
At that day, that is, when God ſhall convert them, then
their hearts ſhall ever be hankring and looking after God.
O then ſet thine affections on God, if thou deſireſt thy heart
ſhould hanker after God. Thou art yet no better then a
wretch, till thus it be with thee. If thine affections be ever
hankering after thy pleaſures and thy copeſmates, and thy
vanities, thou art never well but when thou art at them.
The Sermon is quickly tedious, and prayer tedious, and
godly diſcourſes are tedious unto thee: why? becauſe thy
minde hankers about othergates matters; as long as it is thus
thou canſt not be ſaved. Look unto me, ſayes Chriſt, and
be ye ſaved all the ends of the earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 22. Ye can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſaved, unleſſe ye hanker and look after me, ſayes the
Lord; as the <hi>Heliotrope</hi> or the turn-ſol that ever looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sun, ſo a gracious heart does after the Lord. God
counts it an honour unto him, that the ſoul ſhould be ever
a hankering and ever a looking after him;<note place="margin">Seneca de tranq.</note> 
                  <hi>Aestimari nos
put amus toties, quoties aſpici,</hi> ſayes <hi>Seneca;</hi> it is a true ſaying;
we think we are eſteemed when men do look after us; So
God counts it an honour to his Majeſty, when our ſouls do
hanker and look after him. It is true, the things of this life
may chance to draw away our mindes now and then, and
make us look after them: but if we have any grace, ſo
much as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, our ſouls will ever be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53869:94"/>
and looking after God. So it was with <hi>Ionas,</hi> though
his corruptions had made him to look off from God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe
he could not abide to be in that caſe, his heart
is again looking and hankering after God: oh for the light
of his countenance, oh for his grace and his Spirit, oh for
power and ſtrength yet to be reſolute for God, <hi>Yet will I
look again towards thy holy Temple,</hi> Ionah 2. 4. Let God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
me, I cannot but look to him; let God fling me into
the Whales belly, I cannot but hanker after him, let him
caſt me into the belly of hell, yet will I look again ſayes
he: his affections were ſet upon God, and therefore did
his heart ever hanker and look after God. This is a ſweet
motive to perſwade us: if we would once ſet our affections
on God, our ſouls would ever hanker and look after God.</p>
               <p>The fourth motive is taken from the ſpurrings of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,<note place="margin">4. Our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſpur u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

calcaria,</hi> as <hi>Melancthon</hi> does call them, they are as it were
the ſpurs of the ſoul. What is the reaſon that men go on in
any buſineſſe like lazie jaded Aſſes, ſayes <hi>Vives,</hi> becauſe
they have no affection to it. What is the reaſon they go ſo
ſluggiſhly on to good duties, they ſit ſo ſenſeleſly ſtill in
ſeats at a Sermon, they kneel ſo lumpiſhly and dead-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
in prayer to God? becauſe they have no ſpurs in their
ſides, they have no affection to theſe things. Now if we
would ſet our affections on God, we would feel in our
boſomes a certain ſpur that ſpurs us to every good word
and work? a gracious heart is ſaid to ſtir up it ſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi>
36. 2. God counts thoſe prayers no prayers, that are not
full of theſe ſpurrings and ſtirrings; there is none that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

on thee. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. Doſt thou call upon God, and haſt thou
no ſpurrings nor ſtirrings in the duty? doſt thou not ſpur
up thy ſelf to pray with good life? the Lord ſayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou
doſt not call upon his name at all. As ever thou deſireſt to
be ſtirred up and ſpurred on to good exerciſes, ſet thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
on God, they are the ſpurs of the ſoul: the ſoul
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53869:95"/>
goes cheerfully on, when it goes with affection.</p>
               <p>The fifth motive is taken from the heartineſſe of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;<note place="margin">5.</note>
and therefore the heart is many times and often in
Scripture put for the affections. My heart, ſayes <hi>Deborah,</hi>
is towards the Governours of Iſrael, <hi>Iud.</hi> 5 9 that is, mine
affection is towards them. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is
open unto you, our heart is enlarged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. that is,
our affections are enlarged. Look whatever thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt,
thy heart is ſet upon it; this motive is ſtrong to
perſwade, for if the affections be in a manner the very heart
of the ſoul, this may well move us to ſet our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God; wilt thou ſettle thy heart any where elſe but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon God? O how hainouſly does the Lord take it at
thy hands, that thou haſt no more heart unto him? He
gives thee his Word, and thou haſt no heart to it; he gives
thee his Sabbath, and thou haſt no heart to it; he gives thee
his Sacrament, and his Ordinances, and his Sanctuary, and
his Commandments, and thou haſt no heart to them. O the
Lord is ſo angry with thy ſoul, that he cals thee a fool and
a ſot, and he repents that ever he hath vouchſafed theſe
things to ſuch wretches as thou art. Wherefore is there a
price in the hand of a fool to get wiſedom, ſeeing he hath
no <hi>heart to it?</hi> Prov. 17. 16. Wherefore, ſayes God, and to
<hi>what end is a price put into your hand to get wiſedom?</hi> Ye
might have gotten wiſedom a long time or ere now, how
to be new creatures and in Chriſt, how to get grace, and
peace, and mercy with God; ye have had abundance of
prices put into your hands, a price of abundance of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Sabbaths, a price of abundance of Sermons and
exhortations, many mercies and favours, many threatnings
and warnings, health, ſtrength, life, liberty; ye have had a
fair time to get grace and holineſſe in Jeſus Chriſt; prices
have been put into your hands, but ye have had no heart
nor affection to them. The Lord is exceedingly wroth with
you, he caſts the fool in your face, and repents that ever he
hath lent you theſe things; wherefore is a price put into
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53869:95"/>
the hand of a fool, ſeeing he hath no heart to it? no heart
nor affection to make uſe of it? Wherefore? ſayes he, to
what end? wherefore is a price put into a fools hand, that
ſees not the worth of it? better he had been ſent to hell
quick and never heard Sermon: better he had been damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many years ſince and never had the means. What, will
ye be drunkards in ſpite of preaching? and adulterers, and
fornicators, in ſpite of Gods threats? mockers and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of them that are good, <hi>lovers of pleaſures more then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of God,</hi> in ſpight of the Lord Jeſus? O this does wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
provoke God, that ye ſhould have no more heart nor

then upon God, if ever ye will be wiſe to eſcape the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

rebellious as to deny your heart unto God.</p>
               <p>The ſixth motive is taken from the ſoftnes of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">6. Affections are the ſoftneſſe of the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the affections are the ſoftnes of the heart, <hi>Affectus ſunt
foemineus animae partus,</hi> ſayes the Philoſopher, they are the
feminine and ſoftly brood of the heart. They heart is a ſoft
heart where thine affections do ſtand; if thine affections
be ſet upon the things of this life, thy heart is a ſoft heart
thereunto, thy heart is ſenſible of every profit, ſenſible of
every vain pleaſure: the things of this life can eaſily ſink
down into thy heart, if thine affections be to them. O let
thine affections then be ſet upon God: what wilt thou have
a ſoft heart to the world, the things of the world may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
work on it? and wilt thou have a hard heart to God,
that he may not work on it? <hi>Hardneſſe of heart</hi> is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that a man is damnably and deſperately impudent,
and will neither obey God not his Miniſters. So God tels
<hi>Ezechiel</hi> the houſe of Iſrael will not hearken to thee, ſayes
he, for they will not hearken unto me; for all the houſe
of Iſrael are impudent and hard-hearted, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 7. When
their hearts were once hardned, they were ſo impudent
that they would not hearken and obey the Miniſters of
God, nor God himſelf. This is a lamentable condition then
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53869:96"/>
thou art in: if thine affections be earthly and carnal, the
heart is quite hardned to Godward. Now then my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
we ſee here the reaſon why ye can refuſe to obey,
and be divorced from your ſins: we ſee the reaſon why ye
neither yeeld to God, nor his Miniſters; this is the reaſon
ſayes God, ye are impudent, and your hearts are deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hardned. And this is the brand the holy Ghoſt ſets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you; when your hearts are thus hardned, he cals you
plainly, wicked men and wicked women. A wicked man
hardneth his face, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 29. Is it not a pitifull thing that
a man ſhould go to hell, and have no remedy to deliver
him? to be damned, and have no remedy in the world
to eſcape it? in ſuch a caſe is thy ſoul, whoſe heart is thus
hardned. He that being often reproved hardneth his heart,
ſhall be deſtroyed without remedy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 1. Haſt thou
not been often reproved? I know thy conſcience can tell
thee thou haſt been often reproved; haſt thou not hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thy heart? I know thy conſcience can witneſſe that
thou wouldeſt not leave off thy courſes; but haſt hardned
thy heart to this day, thou knoweſt I ſay true; well then,
reade what a piteous condition thou art come to, there is
no remedy for thee to avoid the damnation of hell: thou
ſhalt be deſtroied without remedy, ſayes God, I confeſſe
there is a remedy, but he ſhall be deſtroyed without it. The
remedy that God uſes to deliver men from hell, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them for their ſins, but thou putteſt off reproofs, the
preaching of the Word, but thou doſt diſobey it, the bloud
of the Lord Jeſus, but thou doſt defile it, and wilt not lay
down thy corruption for it, there is a remedy but thou
wilt not uſe it; no, thy heart is hardned and thou ſhalt be
deſtroyed without remedy: aſſure thy ſelf of it, <hi>for the
mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> I ſpeak to you who ſpeak
evill of the good way, and call it all to nought; your hearts
are all hardned on this manner: when divers were hardned,

Thou knoweſt the Lord commands exhorting and repto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

hath commanded us to walk ſtrictly, and preciſely, and

hear his voice, harden not your hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 7. thou haſt
broken this limit, and thou art not converted to this day,
thou art the man that is hardned. I ſpeak to you who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

they have made their <hi>faces harder then a rock,</hi> they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

have hardned their hearts like a rock, and more too, ſayes
the Text. Ye have refuſed, and it is not unknown to your

Our affections are everlaſting in our ſoul, eſpecially ſome of
them, and thoſe that are not, when the ſoul is in hell, the
very want of them are a little hell to the ſoul, for there
ſhall be no joy, no delight, no hope, no comfort, no love;
and as the Stomack when it wanteth its meat, it devoureth
it ſelf: ſo theſe affections, when the matter is wanting, they
ſhall eat up, and devour up the ſoul. There's no matter in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53869:97"/>
hell to joy at, no matter in hell to delight in, no comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
matter to hope for, no amiable thing for to love,
and this ſhall vex the ſoul with weeping and gnaſhing of
teeth: nevertheleſſe, many of the affections, whether a
man go to heaven or to hell, <hi>are everlaſting affections,</hi> joy
and delight, and love, and all the liking affections ſhall be
everlaſting in heaven: fear, and horrour, and hatred, and
grief, and deſpair, and ſhame ſhall be everlaſting in hell,
there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, ſayes the
Text, he does not ſay there ſhall be love or joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now
are the affections everlaſting in the ſoul? know this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but God can hold the ſoul tack, as we ſay, everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.
It's true, we may affect meat for a while, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a while, and maintenance for a while, and houſes,
and wives, and husbands, and recreations for a while, till
we die, but when death comes, death takes off theſe objects
for ever. If thine affections were mainly ſet upon theſe
things; when theſe are all gone, alas, where art thou then?
thou art at a loſſe for ever and ever. As <hi>Zophar</hi> ſayes of the

               <p>The third motive is taken <hi>from the cloyedneſſe of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. From the cloyedneſs of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</note>
as the affections are infinite and can never be ſatisfied
with the things of this life, ſo they are ſoon cloyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
any of theſe things: ſometimes affecting, ſometimes diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting.
Nothing can give a mans affections full content
but only their God. If thou doſt not ſet thine affections
upon God, thine affections can never have content: the
things of this life were never made for our affections to be
ſet on; if thine affections were made to be ſet upon the
things of this life, they could never be cloyed with them.
Is the fire ever cloyed with burning? Is a ſtone ever cloyed
with lying on the ground? Is the Sun ever cloyed with
ſhining? no, it is made for this end: thou wert never made
to eat and to drink, for thy ſtomack will be cloyed with
meat, and cloyed with drinks: the ſweeteſt meats under
heaven, if ye burden your ſtomack therewith, they will
cloy it: thou wert never made to hunt and to bowl, to
dice, and to card, becauſe thou mayſt be cloied with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
thine affections are ſubject to a cloy, if they be ſet
upon the things of this life; they are monſters and devils
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53869:100"/>
incarnate, that are never weary with ſwearing, and lying,
and playing, and company-keeping. I ſay, <hi>theſe men are all
monſters:</hi> for if a man be a man, and he be not a monſter,
he will be cloyed and wearied with his waies. They are bad
enough that the Prophet does ſpeak of, I am ſure they were
curſed wretches, yet they were not ſuch-damned wretches
as never to be weary with their ſins; they have wearied
themſelves to commit iniquity, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9. 5. They were weary
with ſinning, and cloyed with their waies, and yet they
would on: on they went, but it ſeems they were not quite
monſters to go on and never be wearied, there is nothing
in this life thou canſt ſet thine affections upon, but it will
weary and cloy thine affections, and therefore without
doubt they are not the true objects of thine affections.
What baſe Proverbs have the wicked, when they come from
their ſports? ſometimes ye ſhal hear them ſay, I am as weary
as a dog; when the drunkard hath barreld himſelf with
his liquor, he is as ſick as a dog otherwhiles, as we ſay; ſuch
filthy-mouthed ſpeeches we have, which ſhew they are
cloyed now and then with theſe things; as the Poet ſayes
of the Horſe and the Oxe,<note place="margin">Hor. Ep. 14</note> 
                  <hi>Optat ephippia Bos piger, optat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare
caballus,</hi> the lazie Oxe that is toyling at the Plough,
he is weary with it, he could wiſh he were uſed like a Horſe
to the ſaddle, that would be leſſe weariſome he thinks then
the Plough; the Horſe that is toyled with its riding, O
he is weary with it, he could wiſh he were uſed to the yoke,
that would be a far eaſier life. Thus mens waies do weary
and cloy their affections: the proud Minion is wearied and
cloyed with ſuch an odde faſhion, O ſhe muſt have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the gameſter is wearied with ſuch a kinde of ſport, he
muſt have another; the delicate palate is cloyed with ſuch
taſted meats, it muſt have others, Certainly thine affections
are wrong ſet, when they are apt to be cloyed on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
O therefore ſet thine affections on God, there thou
ſhalt never be cloyed. I know a man may ſet his affections
to Godward, and be weary, but then they are not right ſet
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53869:100"/>
when he is weary. They ſerved God amiſſe when they ſaid,
<hi>behold, what a wearineſſe is it:</hi> Mal. 1. 13. If they had gone
a right way to work, they had never been weary nor cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

well-doing,</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 13. that is, ſet your affections aright
upon, and ſo be never weary with it: the affections will
never be cloyed when they are truly ſet upon God: the
fleſh will be weary, but the ſpirit cannot be weary. God
gives the ſoul full abſolute content; the ſoul is at reſt when
it is ſet upon God. As the ſtone is never cloyed with lying
on the ground, becauſe there is its reſt, ſo God is the reſt
of the ſoul. The greateſt glutton in the world will come

righteous overmuch, why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?
why ſhouldſt thou be ſo preciſe, to be called a Puritan, to

a little gaineſſe of apparrell, a little mirth at the pot

does but bring thee in ſpeaking, as the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> does

Beloved, when a Husband ſuſpects his wives affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not to him, there is an affection of jealouſie ariſes
in his heart to revenge it: a man cannot abide that his wife
ſhould give her affections to another. So beloved, God is
a jealous God, when he ſees he cannot have thy affections
to him: he hath made thee his creature, he hath hired
thee for his ſervant, nay he eſpouſed thy ſoul as a wife and
a Spouſe to his own Son; and if he may ſuſpect that thy
affections are otherwiſe ſet, he will be jealous againſt thee.
This will be the grievouſeſt revenge of all revenges that are

revenged on thee deeply; he will take no ranſome; no
ranſome by Chriſt, no ranſome in the world: couldeſt thou
give him a whole world for the ſin of thy ſoul, he will not
accept it. What ſayes the Husband when he is jealous,
what haſt thou defiled my bed and played the whore? and
ſo forth. I will make you an example: he eats himſelf up,
till he is revenged: he will mark every caſt of her eye, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
geſture of her body, every tread of her foot, every
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53869:103"/>
thing now ſhall be matter of ſuſpicion: ſhe ſhall not ſpeak
to any man in the ſtreet, but he will ſuſpect it is wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
She ſhall not be able to go one ſtep out of doors,
but he will ſuſpect it is to her baſe lovers. So if we ſet our
affections wrong upon other things beſides God, God will
never put it up at our hands. He will then be extream to
mark whatſoever is amiſſe; not one idle word, but he will
be preciſe to obſerve it; not one vain thought, but he will
be curious to note it; not one fooliſh faſhion, but he will
ſet it down in his note-book, he will then be extream with
thee. Ye have read and heard the Ten Commandments of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and often. Ye know what is ſaid in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
Thou ſhalt not do thus and thus, <hi>For I the Lord
thy God am a iealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon
the children.</hi> If thou ſet up theſe Idols in thy heart, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the things of this life, take heed of this jealouſie, I the
Lord thy God am a jealous God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will viſit not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thy ſins upon thee, but he will look what thy father hath
done, and thy grandfather hath done, and thy great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
hath done. If any of them have been drunkards, he
will viſit it on thee: if any of them have been ſwearers and
worldlings, and wicked, he will viſit it on thee. From his
jealouſie the good Lord deliver us.<note place="margin">7. From the tyranny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               <p>The ſeventh motive is taken from the <hi>tyranny of our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
if they be not ſet right.</hi> If our affections be not ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, they are the ſoreſt Tyrants that can be to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
over us. <hi>Philo</hi> compares the tyranny of our affections
to the four hundred years bondage of the Iſraelites in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
Ye remember what wofull and ſlaviſh bondage they
were put to in Aegypt, inſomuch that they groaned under
it, and cryed out unto God. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> played the Tyger-like
Tyrant over them, and made them weary of their lives: ſo
do the affections tyrannize over a man that is carnall and
earthly, they do ſo beſot him, and befool him, that he
knows not how to come out of his ſins; they do ſo harden
him and obdurate him, that no preaching nor counſell can
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53869:103"/>
convert him; they do ſo occupie and task him, and buſie
him, that he can finde no while to ſave his own ſoul, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
himſelf of eſcaping of hell and damnation, he is in
hell before ever he thinks on it ſeriouſly; they plague him
like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> ſayes he, and leave his ſoul in the lurch after
all his vain hopes, he can never be free for God. The Apoſtle
ſpeaking of the luſt and affections of the world, how they
allure men into vanity; he ſayes they promiſe men liberty,
but they are the ſervants and ſlaves of corruption. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 19. A man would wonder how one ſhould be in bondage
with a pot or a pipe, with a bowl or a game, with a carnall
friend, or an uſe he hath gotten; but ſo it is, that nor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
nor Sermon, nor warnings from God, nor any thing
can free him: ſtill he is enthralled. Now conſider, are our
affections ſuch tyrants, when they be ſet upon the things of
this life? O let us ſet them upon God. If they can capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
us to God, and bring us into a golden bondage with
grace and with goodneſſe, we are happy. Seeſt thou how
the wicked are tyed to their ſins, and their luſts? ſo if thine
affections were ſet upon God, thou wouldeſt be tyed unto
God. O it's an admirable tye, this, to be tyed unto God.
This is it that the wiſeſt man in the earth adviſeth us to,
My ſon, ſayes he, keep thy fathers commandments, binde
them continually upon thy heart, and tye them about thy
neck, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 21. Thine affections are theſe ſtay-bands, and
theſe typers: if thine affections be ſet upon the Word, they
will tye it to thy ſoul; if they be ſet upon grace, and love
to Gods Ordinances, his Sabbaths and his waies, they will
tye them to thy heart: if thou wilt not ſet thine affections
upon God, thou art a very ſlave, a very ſlave unto Satan
and to ſinne; thou art not only in a wofull condition, as
thou art, but they tye thee faſt to it; and if God may not
be ſo much beholden to thee for thine affections to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he will intrap thee, and take thee by them, as a Bare
is taken by a Collar, and hale thee to judgement. Thou haſt
little affection or none at all to the Word; may be thou
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53869:104"/>
comeſt not to be reproved and amended by the Word, but
thou comeſt to have ſome knowledge, and ſome pretty ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to talk on, or ſome fine ſtory or paſſage to ſpeak on:
As I live, ſaith the Lord, I will anſwer thee according to
thy thoughts: may be thou comeſt that thou mayſt ſcrape
up ſome hopes to have mercy, and heaven at the laſt; may
be thou comeſt to ſnatch up ſome ſentence or other that
may ſecure up thy conſcience: if there be ever a paſſage of
mercy, that thou wouldeſt fain have; As I live, ſaith the
Lord, I will anſwer thee according to thy thoughts, and
thine own vain heart:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Ezek. 14. 3, 4, 5. &amp;c.</note> that which thou cameſt for in the
Word, as I live ſaith the Lord, thou ſhalt have it. Thou
doſt not come to learn how to be holy and be ſtricter then
thou art, but though thou beeſt no ſtricter then thou art
already, yet to have ſome hopes to be ſaved for all that.</p>
