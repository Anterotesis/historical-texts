            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WIth what regret of ſpirit I behold the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of our Time, and how Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant it is to me to be concern'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God he is Witneſs: And I think it cannot reaſonably be hard for any to believe me, when <hi>meer Reputation</hi> would forbid a man to ſubject his <hi>Religion or Good Name to the Folly and Malice of every inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Wrangler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo intollerable are many Separatiſts, and of them, ſome <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> in their Lyes, Slanders, Traducings, and what not, which may proceed from Wrath and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; that, leſt ſome of the Dirt they throw ſhould ſtick, we are neceſſitated to that Defence, we neither think the Truth (otherwiſe) wants, nor our Adverſaries could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at our hands, and leaſt of all the man concern'd in theſe Letters.</p>
            <p>But we have the leſs reaſon, I confeſs, to expect good Quarter from him, who denies it to his Church-Siſter, or doubt that he ſhould ſlyly ſuggeſt Evil againſt us, who baſely goes to Law with her, and that before thoſe who by his own Principles he accounts Unblievers. Only we cannot but think it a ſtrange Uſe that theſe men make of <hi>Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> to perſecute by Revilings thoſe that have moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for want of it, as if they would walk <hi>Antipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> to the <hi>Government</hi>: For whilſt that perſecuted, they ſeem'd to pitty us; but now that tollerates, they <hi>appear to envy us.</hi> What? do they think it a Blemiſh to Tolleration, <hi>That any ſhould be quiet but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> and therefore will <hi>continue that as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41667:3"/>
in them, which they accounted condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Powers</hi>? But this notably ſhows their ſpirit, who thus adventure <hi>to perſecute without Power:</hi> Let who will believe <hi>they would not do it if they had power;</hi> for my own part, I declare my ſelf <hi>none of that number;</hi> and think it the beſt way, both to wiſh, and lawfully endeavour <hi>they may neuer have any to try.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, I have nothing farther to ſay in this Epiſtle, but that the Perſon herein concern'd, unworthily reflecting upon me (for ſomething in a Diſcourſe I lately publiſht againſt the cloſe, but faint Endeavours of a vizarded <hi>Socinian</hi>) as that I was an Erroneous and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Perſon (terms the moſt hateful to a Chriſtian Man) I writ him, as in Conſcience oblieg'd, a kind of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to make it good, which he vainly endeavour'd by his Anſwer, as my Reply will further manifeſt. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps their Publication may be ſeaſonable, if not to ſome of their own way <hi>(for which I greatly hope)</hi> at leaſt to others, and I am confident to all who cordially love Truth, Righteouſneſs and Peace, above <hi>charging God with Hardneſs,</hi> and impeaching that People as Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, which moſt vigorouſly believe and aſſert the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of his Rectitude and Mercy.</p>

Spirit God had given them was Erroneous,</hi> though it was truly grieved thereat. If all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> ſhould utter the groſſeſt Errors, <hi>the Light wherewith Chriſt as the Word-God hath, and doth enlightened, ought not to be charged with ſuch Defects, but rather they, for not bringing their Errors to the Light.</hi> And I affirm, There is no true knowing either of Evil or Good, but in the Light, wherewith Chriſt hath illuminated Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and if thou knoweſt any thing ſavingly, it is thereby; therefore kick not againſt it, neither fling thy Cavils at it, I Warn thee from the Lord; for, if thou ſeekeſt to pervert the Right Way of the Lord, by thy <hi>Night-works againſt the Light,</hi> it will certainly be one day thy very woful Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>That which concerns me, is called, <hi>First,</hi> Error and Contradiction; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> Fooliſhly charging of God.</p>
                  <p>My Error and Contradiction is this, <hi>That in one place, I make all men to have a meaſure of the Spirit</hi>; and in another, I ſay, <hi>That ſuch as have it not are Hereticks concerning the Faith</hi>; as alſo, that I quote theſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17, 18, 20. again, 16.13. where <hi>Chriſt promiſeth to ſend that Spirit which the World cannot receive</hi>; alſo that of Jude, <hi>Senſual not having the Spirit,</hi> which thou judgeſt to be Error and Contradiction: Did I not know thy Meaning, I ſhould take it for granted, that <hi>what thou calleſt the Contradiction, was also the Error</hi>; namely, <hi>That all had not the Spirit:</hi> but underſtanding by thy ſecond Carp, the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Soul (for it is Predeſtinarian) I will take it for granted, thou meaneſt quite contrary, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That God's Univerſal Love to Mankind is the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blaſphemy thou in Words (I heard) doſt charge me with, though thou art ſomething more Modeſt in thy Letter, by calling it a <hi>Fooliſh charging of God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle begins this Chapter (or elſe they that divided his Epiſtle into Chapters,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> made it to begin) with his great ſorrow for his Country-men the <hi>Jews.</hi> He enumerates their Priviledges, and could wiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accurſt for their ſake; yet whilſt he lamented, that they <hi>to whom were the Couenants, Glory, Adoption, and whoſe were the Fathers, and of whom Chriſt himſelf came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, being of the Seed of Abraham,</hi> ſhould thus barr themſelves out of Chriſt's Kingdom, and not be of the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> and Circumciſion in Spirit, read <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>So that the being of the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>after the Fleſh, or</hi> Iſaac, <hi>or any other man never ſo righteous, rendered them not Children of Promiſe,</hi> albeit it be ſaid, in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy Seed be called, for then would all <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Seed have belonged to the Promiſe, which in <hi>Eſau</hi> was not verifi'd, as teſtifies this very Scripture. Neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but in <hi>Iſaac ſhall they Seed be called.</hi> What is this <hi>[Iſaac,]</hi> and what is this [<hi>Calling</hi>?] that is, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, They which are Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; that is, <hi>They that are carnally deſcended are not the Seed; Iſaac</hi> is underſtood myſtically, as ſhewing forth One conceived <hi>by the extraordinary Power of God, in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed with Freedom and Adoption, as they come to believe and obey</hi>; wherefore adds the Apoſtle, <hi>The Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed</hi>; who are they? <hi>the Jews Inward, and the Circumciſion in Heart.</hi> So that here is only the Election of the true Seed, [<hi>myſtical</hi> Iſaac] <hi>or</hi> [Iſaac <hi>in Spirit</hi>] ſuch as through <hi>Repentance, Faith and good Works come to be tranſlated into the pure Nature thereof, who have

                  <p>So on the contrary hand, when men have ſinned away <hi>their firſt Stock,</hi> God is not bound to recruit them again, He may proceed to determinative Judgement if he pleaſe. Here it is that <hi>he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> And though <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that wicked King, was at laſt hardened by the Lord, yet, if the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9<hi>th.</hi> Chapters of <hi>Exodus</hi> be but read, it will appear, firſt that God did not harden <hi>Pharaoh before Pharaoh had grievouſly imbon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daged Iſrael, rejected his Counſel, deſpiſed his Viſitations, and ſo hardened his own Heart; and who with an audacious Contempt asked</hi> Moſes, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his Voice,</hi> &amp;c? Secondly, That God's raiſing him up,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.2.3.</note> was not from an innocent Child, to be a wicked King, <hi>as if God had infuſed a Cruel and Wicked Quality into his Heart</hi>; O God forbid! But he ſuffered him not to be quite waſted with the many Judgments that God brought upon him for his Rebellion, who after every Judgment, ſtill <hi>encreaſed in his Wickedneſs,</hi> but raiſed yet him up again, that he might renown his Name,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.34.</note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his Great Power, <hi>as well to puniſh obdurate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as ranſom his own People</hi>: Thus God indured this Veſſel of Wrath, to make his Wonders known. So, what if God did give over <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Deſtruction, who reſiſted the Heavenly Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his Son, and rather choſe the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Who could impeach him? had he not waited long? <hi>Which of the Prophets had they not ſlain? and did they not cry of Jeſus himſelf, Let his Blood be upon our Heads, &amp;c?</hi> Wherefore if God would harden them he might: ſince here <hi>he might have Mercy on whom he pleas'd to have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and whom he would of ſuch Impenitents he might harden.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Alan</hi> was made a <hi>choſen Veſſel,</hi> a <hi>right Plant</hi>;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41667:8"/>
but through <hi>Degeneration,</hi> he became a <hi>Veſſel of Diſhonour,</hi> and a <hi>Plant of a ſtrange Vine:</hi> Thoſe therefore <hi>who are Regenerated by the One holy Seed, which Seed is Christ, Elect and Precious, God makes his Veſſels of Honour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>; and they who have ſpent their Heavenly Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, defil'd themſelves, reſiſted the Heavenly Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are become one Spirit with the God of the World, who rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience, ſuch <hi>Adulterated ones</hi> God ſeparates from him, as <hi>Veſſels of Diſhonour and Wrath, fitted for Deſtruction (but by themſelves, not from the Lord.)</hi>

               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe they do not obey it; there is ſomething in them that ſhows them their Sin, when they have done amiſs, and reproves them; for they will ſay, <hi>Lord forgive them,</hi> or the like: that muſt

            <sp>
               <speaker>S.L.</speaker>
               <p>It is ſufficient, if it be obeyed; but God ſaid, His Spirit ſhould not always ſtrive with man: yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man has a Day, or a Time to be tryed; if they rebel, and won't obey, God then gives them over.</p>
               <p>From this he fell to Curious and Unneceſſary Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; As the Devil did about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo did he about the Body of Chriſt: But this he inſiſted on moſtly the ſecond time.</p>

            <p>THis is the very Truth of the matter, which I the rather add, that what Advantage he may think to have gain'd, and his Boaſt of it, may receive ſome Allay by a plain and true Relation of the whole, ſo far as could be remembred.</p>
            <p>Of what force then her miſtake is againſt the Light, is to be Learn'd from her own Ingenuous Confeſſion; and if <hi>John Morſe</hi> were Candid, he would have laid the blame where it was proper, and not have charg'd it upon the Light within.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if we Conſider, firſt, that Chriſt's coming in, the Doors being ſhut, is not mentioned in that Scripture, <hi>Luke 24.38, 39.</hi> as cited by him, but in <hi>Joh. 20.19, 26. 2</hi>ly, That he was not there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Spirit. <hi>3</hi>ly, Were it not unjuſt to ſay, the Light in the Diſciples groſly erred, when they ſuppoſed they had ſeen a Spirit? <hi>Luke 24.37. 4</hi>ly, That it was a Fooliſh and Unneceſſary Queſtion on his part. <hi>5</hi>ly, That he took baſe Advantage of it. <hi>6</hi>ly, That the Maid ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Clear'd the Light from leading her into any, the leaſt Miſtake. <hi>7</hi>ly, That I could ask him ten Queſtions for his one he put to her, of the like abſtruſe and obſcure Matters, that I have cauſe to believe he is wholy ignorant of, &amp; the Knowledge of them not neceſſary to Salvation, I ſay, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe Particulars, and that all aroſe from her loving Invitation of him to a Meeting, I cannot ſee but he is far more Condemnable then the Maid; and I believe, the Light in every unprejudiced Conſcience will ſay the ſame.</p>
