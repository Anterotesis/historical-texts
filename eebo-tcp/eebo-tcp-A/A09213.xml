                  <note>The book exists in three states of the preliminaries and final leaves; contents are given here in presumed chronological order from F.S. Ferguson's notes. State 1: collates *⁴ B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2), with commendatory verses on *4 only. State 2: collates *⁴ [sec.]²  B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2); quire [sec.] contains additional verses. State 3 (pagination given above): collates *⁴ [sec.]⁴ B-G⁴ H²  (-H1 or 2) I²  [K]² . Quire [sec.] contains additional verses, some printed from the standing type of state 2 quire [sec.]. Leaves I1-[K]1 contain "The contentes of the articles of assurance"; [K]2, a table of contents, is often usually bound in or after quire *.</note>
                  <note>In all states *2 is missigned "*.i.". The two leaves of H²  were printed with the same text set in duplicate, intended to be divided and one leaf or the other to be bound into each copy. One setting is signed "H.", the other "H.i.".</note>
                  <note>Quire I comes in two states: I1r line 1 of text has (1) "aduentured with" or (2) "aduentured in money".</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Truely Sir I was for a time, drawen into a doubtfull

intised me, or leaue it off, as good discretion
aduised mee. Eftsoones haue I righte hartely wished
that some of those rype, and perfect witts, adorned with
like iudgement, (wherewith God hath plentifully blessed
this our age) woulde haue imploied their pennes, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
to haue sette foorth thys cause: But seeing that
in wishing, I doo fynde nothing, but to wish, and
that the case so standeth, as eyther the thyng, right

<pb facs="tcp:10845:3"/>
lie in a slumber, or rather rest buryed in the graue
of obliuion, vnlesse I doo make publique my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

to the diuersitye of mens iudgements, I haue made
choyse, rather to indure the disgrace of the one, then
that my Countrey shoulde sustaine the inconuenience
of the other, trusting that your honour (who hath
hetherto beene a principall Patron of this Action) will
vpon my humble sute vouchsafe your fauourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
heereof. For wee doo reade (right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
that <hi>Archimedes</hi> in respecte of his grauitie and
wisedome) helde that reputation amongst the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,</hi>
that whatsoeuer he allowed, was accounted for
good: which historye, if I shoulde apply vnto your
honour perticularlie, as both aptlie and truely I could,
I might (in the opinion of some men) incurre the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of flattery, and receiue from your Honour but
the like aunswer, which King <hi>Theseus</hi> made vnto blind
<hi>Oedipus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doo not (quoth hee) O <hi>Oedipus,</hi> honour my selfe

In silence therefore will I passe your ready and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

fauourably to further all such attemptes as seeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

which (by the testimony of good writers, the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

with all his Captaines, Maisters, Gentlemen &amp;

and of other nations to repayre vnto his Tent: And
then and there, in the presence of them all, he did cause hys

by vertue of her maiesties letters pattents.</p>
            <p>And after theyr Shippes were repayred, whereof one, hee

the Shoare.</p>
            <p>The 21. day they came to Cape <hi>Rase,</hi> towarde the South
partes whereof, lying a while becalmed, they tooke Codd
in largenes and quantitie, exceeding the other parts of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

trending the Coast West, towarde the Bay of <hi>Placencia.</hi>
The Generall sent certain men a Shoare, to view the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
which to them as they sayled along, seemed pleasaunt.
VVhereof his men at theyr returne gaue great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
likeing so well of the place, as they would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
haue stayed and wintred there. But hauing the winde
fayre &amp; good, they proceeded on theyr course towards the
fyrme of <hi>Ameryca,</hi> which by reason of continuall Fogges,
at that time of the yeere especially: they coulde neuer see,
till <hi>Cox</hi> Maister of the Golden <hi>Hinde</hi> did discerne Lande, &amp;
presently lost sight thereof againe, at what time they were
all vpon a breache in a great and outragious storme, hauing
vnder 3. fadome water. But God deliuered the <hi>Frigat</hi> and
the Golden <hi>Hinde,</hi> from this great daunger. And the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
in the presence of them all was lost, to theyr vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
greefe, with all theyr cheefe victuall, munition, and
other necessary prouisions, and other thinges of value not
fitt heere to be named. VVherevppon, by reason also that

with Fogges and Mysts that so couered the Land, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:10845:12"/>
daunger of perishing they coulde not approche it: Sir
<hi>Humfrey Gilbert</hi> and Maister <hi>Hays,</hi> were compelled much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
theyr wills to retyre homewardes. And beeing 300.
Leagues on theyr way, were afterwarde by tempestious
weather, seperated the one from the other, the 9. of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember
last, since which time, Maister <hi>Hay</hi> with his Barke,
is safelie arriued, but of Sir <hi>Humfrey</hi> as yet, we heare no
certaine newes.</p>
            <p>Vppon this reporte (together with my former intent, to
write some briefe discourse in the commendation of this so
noble and woorthy an enterprise) I did call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce,<note place="margin">Plutnrch.</note>
the Historie of <hi>Themystocles</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> (who bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
a right noble and valiant Captaine) signified vnto hys
Countrimen, the cittizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> that hee had inuented
a deuise for theyr common wealth very profitable, but it
was of such importaunce and secrecie, that it ought not to
be reuealed, before priuate conference had with some perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer
prudent person of their choise.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> knowing <hi>Aristides</hi> the Philosopher, to
be a man indued with singuler wisedome and vertue, made
choyse of him to haue conference with <hi>Themystocles,</hi> and
therevppon to yeelde his opinion to the Cittizens concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the sayd deuice: which was, that they might set on
fire the Nauie of theyr enemies, with great facilitie as hee
had layde the plotte: <hi>Aristides</hi> made relation to the Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
that the stratageme (deuised by <hi>Themystocles)</hi> was a
profitable practise for the common wealth but it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest.
The <hi>Athenians</hi> (without further demaunde what
the same was) dyd by common consent reiecte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it, preferring honest and vpright dealing before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.</p>
            <p>By occasion of this historie, I drewe my selfe into a more
<pb facs="tcp:10845:13"/>
deeper consideration, of thys late vndertaken voyage, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were as well pleasing to almightie God, as profitable
to men? as lawfull as it seemed honourable. As well grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Sauages, as gainfull to the Christians. And vpon
mature deliberation, I founde the action to bee honest and
profitable, and therefore allowable by the opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stides</hi>
if he were nowe aliue, which beeing by me heerein
sufficiently prooued, (as by Gods grace I purpose to doo)
I doubt not but that all good mindes, wyll endeuour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

            <p>But the sequel thereof, hath since awaked out of dreames
thousandes of soules to knowe theyr Creator, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
before that time altogether ignoraunt. And hath since
made sufficient proofe, neyther to be fantasticke, nor vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagined.</p>
            <p>VVithall, how mightely hath it inlarged the dominions
of the Crowne of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and greatly enritching the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
of the same, let all men consider. Besides, it is well

            <p>I doe therefore hartelie wish, that seeing it hath pleased

<pb facs="tcp:10845:14"/>
is so nobly begun &amp; enterprised. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I haue taken vpon me to write this simple shorte trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
hoping that it shall be able to perswade such as haue
beene, and yet doo continue detractors &amp; hinderers of this
iourney, (by reason perhappes that they haue not delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
and aduisedly entered into the iudgment of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
that yet now vpon better consideration they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fauorable furtherers of the same. And that such as are
already well affected there vnto, will continue theyr good
dispositions. And with all, I most humbly pray all such as
are no Nyggardes of their purses, in buying of costly and
rich apparrell, and liberall Contributors, in setting foorth
of games,<note place="margin">A reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble request.</note> pastimes, feastings and banquettes, (whereof the

employe theyr liberalitie (heeretofore that way expended)
to the furtherance of these so commendable purposed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>And to this ende haue I taken penne in hande, as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
therevnto mooued, desiring much rather, that of
the great multitude, which this Realme dooth nourish,
farre better able to handle this matter then I my selfe am,
it woulde haue pleased some one of them to haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

to my lott to put penne to the paper, I will indeuour my

GOD) to prooue that this voyage, late enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

            <p>For albeit as yet the Christians are not so throughlye

a cruell kinde of people, whose foode is mans flesh, &amp; haue
teeth like dogges, and doo pursue them with rauenous
myndes to eate theyr flesh, and deuoure them.</p>
            <p>And it is not to be doubted, but that the Christians may
in this case iustly and lawfully ayde the Sauages against
the <hi>Canniballs,</hi> So that it is very likelie, that by this means
wee shall not onely mightely stirre and unflame theyr rude
myndes gladly to embrace the louing companye of the
Christians, proffering vnto them bothe commodities suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor,

&amp; contentation, considering the great abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance that they

Taking no other fruits thereby then such as the ground

the first sort of planting, which as I assuredly hope, so

            <p>Then in such a case I holde it no breache of equitye

with force, and to doo whatsoeuer is necessary for
the attayning of theyr safety: For it is allowable by all

And for theyr more securitie to increase their strength by
building of fortes, for auoyding the extremities of iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p>Wherein if also they shall not be suffered in reasonable
quietnes to continue, there is no barre (as I iudge but that
in stoute assemblies, the Christians may issue out, and by
strong hande pursue theyr enemies, subdue them, take
posession of theyr Townes, Citties, or Villages, (and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding

as in like case among all nations at thys day is vsed: and
most especially to the ende they may with securitye holde

            <p>And in so dooing, doubtles the Christians shall no
whitt at all transgresse the bondes of equitie or ciuility,
for as much as in former ages, (yea before the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

in respect to beginne theyr Planting, for the establishment

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10845:18"/>
We reade in the olde testament, howe that after <hi>Noes</hi>
fludde was ceased, restoration of mankinde began onely of
those fewe of <hi>Noes</hi> children and family as were by God pre
elected to be saued in the Arke with him, whose seed in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cesse
of time, was multiplyed to infinite numbers of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which in diuers sortes deuided themselues to sundry
quarters of the earth. And forasmuch as all their posteritie
being mightely encreased followed not the perfect lyfe of
<hi>Noe</hi> theyr predecessor, God chose out of the multitude, a
peculiar people to himselfe, to whome afterwardes beeing
vnder the gouernement of <hi>Moises in Mount Synay,</hi> hee
made a graunt to inherite the Lande of <hi>Canaan,</hi> called the
Land of Promise, with al the other rich and fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes
next adioyning thervnto. Neuerthelesse, before they
came to possession therof, hauing beene afflicted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
greeuous punishments and plagues for theyr sinnes,
they fell in dispayre to enioy the same.</p>
            <p>But beeing encouraged and comforted by theyr Rulers,
(men of God) they proceeded, arming themselues with all
patience, to suffer what soeuer it shoulde please God to
sende: and at last attaining to the Lande, they were encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with great numbers of strong people and myghtye
Kinges.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding,<note place="margin">Iosua. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Iosua</hi> theyr leader, replenished with
the spirite of God, beeing assured of the iustnes of his quar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell,
gathered the cheefe strength of the children of <hi>Israell</hi>
together, to the number of 40000. with whom he safely
passed the huge Riuer <hi>Iourden,</hi> and hauing before sent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
spyes for the discouery of the famous Cittie <hi>Ierico,</hi> to
vnderstand the certaintie of the Cittizens estate,<note place="margin">Iosua. 6.</note> he foorth

his whole power the space of seuen dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10845:18"/>
In which respite, perceiuing none of the Gentiles disposed
to yeeld or call for mercie, he then commaunded (as God
before had appointed) that both the Cittie <hi>Iericho</hi> should
be burned, yea, and all the inhabitaunts, as well olde as
young, with all their cattell, should be destroied, onelie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<hi>Rahab,</hi> her kindred and Familie, because she before
had hid secretly the messengers of <hi>Iosua,</hi> that were sent the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as spies. As for all their golde, siluer, precious stones,
or vesselles of brasse, they were reserued and consecrated to
the Lords treasurie.</p>
            <p>In like manner he burned the cittie <hi>Hay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iosua. 8.</note> slew the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
thereof, and hanged vp their King. But for so much
as the <hi>Gebionites</hi> (fearing the like euent) sent Ambassadors
vnto <hi>Iosua,</hi> to intreate for grace, fauour, and peace: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
that all their liues should be saued, and that they
should be admitted to the companie of the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.<note place="margin">Iosua. 9.</note>
Yet vnderstanding afterwards they wrought this by
a pollicie, he vsed them as drudges to hewe wood &amp; to carie
water, and other necessaries for his people. Thus beganne
this valiaunt Captaine his conquest, which he pursued and
neuer left till he had subdued all the <hi>Hethites, Amorites,
Cananites, Pheresites, Heuites,</hi> and <hi>Iebusites,</hi> with all their
Princes and Kings,<note place="margin">Iudg. 11. 13</note> being thirtie and one in number, and
diuers other straunge Nations besides, whose lands and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
he wholie deuided among Gods people.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Iosua</hi> was deceased, <hi>Iuda</hi> was constituted Lord
ouer the Armie, who receiuing like charge from God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
the proceedings of the holie Captaine <hi>Iosua,</hi> and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
vanquished many Gentiles, Idolaters, and aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

as withstoode him, and namely, <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> the most cruell

his iustice to reuenge tyranny. We reade likewise, that

               </hi> a most puissant &amp; noble warrior, so behaued himself

               <note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 7.</note> That in

the hands of the multitude of the fierce <hi>Madianites,</hi> but
also subdued them and their Tyrants, whose landes he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p>I could recite diuers other places out of the Scripture,
which aptly may be applied heervnto were it not I do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
my selfe by all meanes to be breefe. Now in like
manner will I alledge some few of Inductions out of the
autenticall writings of the Ecclesiasticall Historiographers,
all tending to the like argument. And first to begin with all,
we doo reade. That after our sauiour Iesus Christ had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
his passion. The apostles being inspired with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost,<note place="margin">India the great, was not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Apostles. Metrodorus the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, the fyrst discouerer of India the great.</note> and the knowledge of all straunge languages, did
immediatly dispearse themselues to sundrie partes of the
world, to the preaching of the Gospell. Yet not in so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
a manner, but that there remained some farre remote
Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries vnuisited by them, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the which it is reported
that <hi>India</hi> the great, called the vttermost <hi>India,</hi> as yet had
receiued no light of the word. But it came to passe, that one
<hi>Metrodorus,</hi> a verie learned and wise Philosopher in that
age, being desirous to search out vnknowne landes, did first
discouer the same, finding it wonderful populous and rich,
which vppon his returne being published, and for certaine
vnderstoode, there was another graue Philosopher of <hi>Tyrus</hi>
called <hi>Meropius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Meropius.</note> being a christian, who did resolue himselfe
(folowing the example of <hi>Metrodorus)</hi> to trauaile thether,
<pb facs="tcp:10845:19"/>
and in a short time assisted but with a fewe, in a small
Vessell arriued there, hauing in his company two young
youthes,<note place="margin">Edesius and Frume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius.</note> 
               <hi>Edesius,</hi> and <hi>Frumentius,</hi> whome (being his schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
he had throughly instructed, both in lyberall Sciences
and christian Religion. Now after that <hi>Meropius</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
staying there, had (as he thought) sufficient vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the <hi>Indians</hi> whole estate. He determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and to bring notice thereof vnto the Emperor, whom
he meant to exhort to the conquest of the same. But by
misfortune he was preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, for being in the middest of his
course on the Sea homeward, a sore tempest arose, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
droue him backe againe, to an vnknowne Port of the
saide lande: where he by the most cruell barbarous <hi>Indians</hi>
on the suddaine was slaine with all his company,<note place="margin">Meropius slaine.</note> except the
two young schollers aforesaide, whome the barbarous <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
by reason they were of comely stature and beautifull
personages, tooke, and foorth with presented them to their
King and Queene:<note place="margin">Edisius and Frumentius preserued by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> which both being verie well lyked of,
the King courteously entreated, and ordeined <hi>Edesius</hi> to be
his Butler, and <hi>Frumentius</hi> his Secretary, and in few yeeres
by reason of their learning and ciuill gouernement, they
were had in great fauour, honour, and estimation with the
Princes. But the King departing this life, left the Queene
his wife with her young sonne to gouerne, and gaue free
scope and lybertie to the two christians, at their best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to passe to their natiue soyles, allowing them all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
for the same. Yet the Queene who highly fauoured
them, was verie sorowful they should depart, and therefore
most earnestlie intreated them to tarie and assist her in the
gouernement of her people, tyll such tyme as her young
Soone grewe to type yeeres, which request they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10845:20"/>
And <hi>Frumentius</hi> excelling <hi>Edesius</hi> farre in all wisedome,<note place="margin">Frumenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in great fauour with the Queene of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>
ruled both the Queene and her subiects at his discretion,
whereby he tooke occasion to put in practise priuilie, that
the foundation of christian religion might be planted in the
hearts of such as with whome he thought his perswasion
might best preuaile, and that soonest would giue eare vnto
him, which being brought to passe accordingly, he then
with his fellow <hi>Edesius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An other great work of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by a man of meane birth.</note> tooke leaue of the Queene to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

there, he reuealed to the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of all those euents: who both commending his deeds
and wholie allowing thereof, by the aduise and good liking

to <hi>Frumentius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreouer, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Historie Ecclesiasticall in precise
termes, and in diuers places maketh mencion how <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the great, not onelie enlarged his Empire by the
subduing of his next neighbours, but also endeuored by all
meanes, to subiect all such remote Barbarous and Heathen
nations, as then inhabited the fowre quarters of the world.
For (as it is written) the Emperor throughlie aided with a
puissaunt armie of valiaunt souldiers whom he had before
perswaded to christian religion, in proper person himselfe,
came euen vnto this our natiue Countrie of <hi>England,</hi> then
called the Island of <hi>Brittaines,</hi> bending from him full west,
which he wholie conquered, made tributarie, and setled
<pb facs="tcp:10845:20"/>
therein christian faith, and left behinde him such Rulars
thereof, as to his wisedome seemed best. From thence he
turned his force towards the North coast of the world, and
there vtterlie subdued the rude and cruell Nation of the
<hi>Scithians,</hi> whereof part by freendly perswasions, part by
maine strength, he reduced the whole to christian Faith.
Afterwardes he determined with himselfe to search out
what straunge people inhabited in the vttermost partes of
the South.<note place="margin">Eu. eod lib. Cap. 39.</note> And with great hazard and labour, making his
iorney thether, at last became victor ouer them all, euen
to the countrie of the <hi>Blemmyans,</hi> and the remote <hi>Etheopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that now are the people of <hi>Presbiter Iohn,</hi> who yet tyl

            <p>In the East likewise, what Nation soeuer at that timè
he could haue notice off, he easilie wunne and brought in

As also in extinguishing of such vsurping tiraunts,<note place="margin">Theodori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus cap. 26 eod. libro.</note> as with

After whose decease his sonnes, <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Arcadius,</hi>
were created Emperors, the one of the East, the other of
<pb facs="tcp:10845:21"/>
the West, who with all stoutly godlines, most carefully i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated
the foresteps of their father, eyther in enlarging
their territories, or increasing the christian flocke.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is reported by the saide aucthor, that <hi>The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotius

conuerting their soules to acknowledge their onelie
Messias &amp; Creator, and their countries to the enlargement

            <p>And for like examples of latter time (yea, euen in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

conquest made of the West and East Indies, by the Kings

of planting the christian. Fath, hath beene thought of some

it is well knowne, that in sundry places of this Realme,
Shippes haue beene built and sette foorth of late dayes for
the trade of fishing onely:<note place="margin">Cox the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

which is taken and brought into <hi>England</hi> by the English

of straungers. And the cheefest cause why our Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doo not goe so farre westerly, as the especiall fishing places
doo lie, both for plenty and greatnes of fish, is for that they
haue no succour and known safe harbour in those partes.
But if our nation were once planted there, or neere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboutes:
whereas they now fish but for two monethes in
<pb facs="tcp:10845:23"/>
the yeere, they myght the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fish so long as pleased the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
or rather at theyr comming find such plenty of Fish rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

them home without long delay, (God graunting that
salt may be found there) whereof <hi>Dauid Ingram</hi> (who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled
in those Countries as aforesayde) saith that there is
great plentie: and withall the Climate dooth giue greate
hope, that though there were none naturallye grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet it might aswell be made there by arte, as it is
both in <hi>Rochell</hi> and <hi>Bayon,</hi> or els where. VVhich beeing
brought to passe, shall encrease the number of our ships
and Marriners, were it but in respect of fishing onelie: but
much more in regarde of the sundry Marchaundises and
commodities which are there founde and had in greate
aboundance.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it is wel known that all Sauages, as wel those
that dwell in the South, as those that dwell in the North,
so soone as they shall begin but a little to taste of ciuillitie,
will take meruailous delight in any garment be it neuer so
simple: As a shirt, a blewe, yellow, redde, or greene Cotten
cassocke, a Cappe or such like, and will take incredible
paynes for such a trifle.</p>
            <p>For I my selfe haue heard this reporte made sundrye
times, by diuers of our Countreymen, who haue dwelt in
the sotherly partes, of the VVest <hi>Indies,</hi> some 12. yeeres

partes,<note place="margin">Clothiers. Wolmen. Carders. Spinners. Weauers. Fullers, Sheremen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diers.</note> are easily reduced to ciuilitie bothe in manners and

            <p>To what ende neede I endeuour my selfe by arguments
to prooue, that by this voyage, our nauie and nauigation
shall be enlarged, when as there needeth none other reason

            <p>And seeing that for small costes, the truth of these thinges
may be vnderstoode (wherof this intended supply wil giue
vs more certaine assuraunce) I doo find no cause to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
but that all wel minded persons should be willing to
aduenture some conuenient portion, for the furtheraunce
of so good an enterprise.</p>
            <p>Now for the triall heereof, considering that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the Societie of the aduenturers in this voiage, there
is prouision made, that no aduenturer shalbe bound to any
further charge then his first aduenture: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
keepe styl to himselfe, his children, his apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and seruants, his and their freedome for trade &amp; traficke
which is a priuiledge that Aduenturers in other voiages
haue not: and in the saide articles it is likewise prouided,
that none other then such as haue aduentured in the first
<pb facs="tcp:10845:27"/>
voiage, or shall become aduenturers in this supply, at any
time heerafter are to be admitted in the said society, but as
Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptionaries, which wil be very chargeable: Therefore
generally I say vnto all such according to the old Prouerb,
<hi>Nothing venture, Nothing haue.</hi> For if it do so fal out, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
to the great hope &amp; expectation had (as by Gods grace
it wil) the gaine which now they reape by traffique into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
farre Countries, shall by this trade returne with lesse
charge, greater gaine, and more safety: Lesse charge I say,
by reason of the ample and large deepe Riuers at the verie
banke, wherof there is many, wherby both easily and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they may transport from the innermost partes of the
maine land, all kind of merchandize, yea, in Vessels of great
burden, &amp; that three times, or twise in the yeere at the least.
But let vs omit all presumptions how vehement soeuer, &amp;

               </gap>e ashes, in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yea, as it is thought inough to serue the whole Realme
of euery of these kindes. And of Traine Oyle such qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity,
as if I should set downe the value that they doo esteeme
it at, which haue been there, it would seeme incredible.</p>
            <p>It is heerby intended, that these commodities in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunt
manner, are not to be gathered from thence,
without Planting and setling there. And as for other
thinges of more value, and that of more sortes and kinds
then one or two, (which were likewise discouered there)
I doo hold it for some respects, more meet for a time to be
concealed and vttered.</p>
            <p>Of the Fishing I doo speake nothing, because it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known: And it is not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what very trifles
<pb facs="tcp:10845:27"/>
they be that the Sauages doo require in exchaunge of these
commodities: yea for Pearle, Gold, Siluer, and precious
stones. All which are matters in trade and trasfique of great
moment. But admit that it shold so fal out, that the aboue
specified co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, shall not happely be found out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this first yeere. Yet it is very cleere that such &amp; so many
may be found out as shall minister iust occasion to thinke
al cost &amp; labor well bestowed. For it is very certaine, that
there is one seate fit for fortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of great safety, wherin
these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities following, especially are to be had, that is
to say, Grapes for wine, Whales for oyle, He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe for cordage
and other necessary thinges, and Fish of farre greater sise
and plenty, then that of <hi>Newfound land,</hi> and of all these so
great store as may suffise to serue our whole Realme.</p>
            <p>Besydes all this if credite, may be giuen to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunts
of the same Soyle, a certaine Riuer dooth therevnto

            <p>And it is not to be omitted, howe that about two yeeres
past, certaine Marchaunts of S. <hi>Mallowes</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> dyd
hire a Shippe out of the Island of <hi>Iersey,</hi> to the ende that
they would keepe that trade secrete from theyr Countrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and they would admit no Mariner other then the
Ship boy belonging to the sayd Shippe to goe with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which Ship was about 70. Tunne. I doo knowe the Ship
and the boy very well, and am familiarly acquainted with
the Owner, which voyage prooued very beneficiall.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this which is already saide, may suffice any
man of reasonable disposition to serue for a taste, vntyll
such tyme as it shall please almightie God through our
owne industrie, to send vs better tydings. In the meane
<pb facs="tcp:10845:28"/>
season, if any man well affected to this iourney, shal stand
in doubt of any matter of importance touching the same,
he may satisfie himselfe with the iudgement and lyking of
those of good calling and credite, as are principall dealers

that this voiage is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken

our Countrie, (as generallie other
trades and iourneies be) it shall fall
out in proofe, that the Sauages shal
heerby haue iust cause to blesse the
howre, when this enterprise was vndertaken.</p>
            <p>First and cheefly, in respect of the most happy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
tydings of the most glorious Gospel of our Sauiour
Iesus Christ, whereby they may be brought from false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to truth, from darknes to lyght, from the hieway of
death, to the path of life, from superstitious idolatry, to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
christianity, from the deuill to Christ, from hell to
Heauen. And if in respect of all the commodities they
can yeeld vs (were they many moe) that they should but
receyue this only benefite of christianity, they were more
then fully recompenced.</p>
            <p>But heervnto it may be obiected, that the Gospel must
<pb facs="tcp:10845:28"/>
be freely preached, for such was the example of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
vnto whom although the aucthorities and examples
before alledged, of Emperors, Kings, and Princes, as wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christes time as since, might sufficiently satisfie: Yet
for further aunswer, we may say with Saint <hi>Paule. If we
we haue sowen vnto you heauenlie thinges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>doo you thinke it
much that we should reape your carnall thinges?</hi> And withall,
<hi>The workman is worthy of his hier.</hi> These heauenly tydings
which those labourers our countrey men (as messengers of
Gods great goodnes and mercy) wyl voluntarily present
vnto them, dooth farre exceed their earthly ritches. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
if the other inferior worldlie, and temporall thinges,
which they shal receiue from vs, be waied in equal balance,
I assure my selfe, that by equall iudgement of any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
person, the benefites which they then receiue, shall far
surmount those which they shall depart withall vnto vs.
And admitte that they had (as they haue not) the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to put theyr land to some vse: Yet being brought
from brutish ignoraunce, to ciuility and knowledge, and
made them to vnderstand how the tenth part of their land
may be so manured and emploied, as it may yeeld more
commodities to the necessary vse of mans life, then the
whole now dooth: What iust cause of complaint may
they haue? And in my priuate opinion, I doo verily think
that God did create lande, to the end that it shold by Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and husbandrie, yeeld things necessary for mans lyfe.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the benefit which they shall receiue by
the christians, for, ouer &amp; beside the knowledge how to tyl
and dresse their grounds, they shalbe reduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnseemly
customes, to honest maners, from disordred riotous rowtes
and companies, to a wel gouerned common wealth &amp; with
all shalbe taught mecanicall occupations, artes, and lyberal
<pb facs="tcp:10845:29"/>

            <p>I say &amp; affirme that God hath prouided such meanes for

God of his great goodnesse, of long time to holde his

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(God he knoweth) which liue in such penurie &amp; wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
as they could be contented to hazarde their liues, and to
serue one yeere for meate, drinke, and apparel, onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wages, in hope thereby to amend theyr estates: which
is a matter in such lyke iourneis, of no small charge to the
Prince. Moreouer, thinges in the lyke iourneis of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
price and cost, as victual (whereof there is great plenty
to bee had in that countrye without money) and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
great artillery, or Corselets, are not needful, in so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
and chargeable manner, as the shew of such a iourney,
may present, for a smal quantity of all these to furnish the
Forte onely wyl suffice, vntyl such time as diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be found out in those parts, which may be thought
wel woorthy a greater charge. Also the peculiar benefite of
Archers which God hath blessed this land withal, before al
other nations, will stand vs in great stede amongst those
naked people.</p>
            <p>Another helpe we haue also, which in such lyke cases is
a matter of meruailous cost, and wil be in this iourney pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
very easily (that is to say) To transport yeerely as wel
our people, as al other necessaries, needful for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into those
parts by the Fleete of Merchaunts, that yeerely venture for
Fish in <hi>Newfound Land,</hi> being not farre distaunt from the
countrey, meant to be inhabited, who commonly go with
empty Vesselles in effect, sauing some lyttle fraught with
Salt. And thus it appeareth that the Souldiers wages, and
the transportation may be defrayed for farre lesse summes
of money, then the detractors of this enterprise haue giuen
<pb facs="tcp:10845:30"/>
out. Againe, this intended voiage for conquest, hath in lyke
manner many other singular priuiledges, wherewith God
hath as it were, with his holy hand blessed the same before
all others. For after once we are departed the coast of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
we may passe straight way thether, without daunger
of being driuen into any the countries of our enimies, or
doubtfull freends, for commonly one winde serueth to
bring vs thether, which sildome faileth from the middle of
<hi>Ianuarie,</hi> to the middle of <hi>Maie,</hi> a benefite which the
Mariners make great account off, for it is a pleasure that
they haue in few or none of the other iournies. Also, the
passadge is short, for we may go thither in thirty or forty
daies at the most, hauing but an indifferent winde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
continually in sixteene or twenty dayes at the most.
And in the same our iourney, by reason it is in the Occean,
and quite out of the way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the intercourse of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
we may safely trade and traffique, without perill of
pyracie, neither shal our Ships, people, or goods, ther be sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iecte
to the arrest or molestation of any Pagan Potentate,
<hi>Turkishe</hi> Tyrant, yea, or christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prince, which heertofore,

our Shippes and marchaundizes, whereby great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our Countrimen haue beene vtterly vndoone, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
put to raunsome, yea and some lost their liues: a thing
so fresh in memory as it needeth no proofe, and well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
