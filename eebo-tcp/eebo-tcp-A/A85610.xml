         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The firſt Inſtitution.</head>
            <p>TO all true cordial Engliſh Souls inhabitant or diſperſed through <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> To Jew and Gentile, Freeborn and Slave: Be it by theſe preſents made known, publiſhed and declared, That we, the legitimate Princes of the Earth, <hi>Iuſtice, Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> having for a time, times, and half a time, by the Tyranny of unjuſt Monarchs and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Lords, been forcibly exiled, and from our Native Rights debarred; are now, at the time of the end, come down into the World to chaſtiſe Injuſtice, to ſettle Peace, and to re-aſſume the Scepter in our own hands, as our proper due, againſt Emperors, Kings, Armies, Councels, maugre Men and Devils; Commanding all other Princes to lay down their Scepters at our feet, and Greatneſs to come under the command of Goodneſs; for this is the firſt Fundamental Right of the <hi>Sea-Green Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Be it next declared, That we intend to advance our Royal Standard, firſt in <hi>England,</hi> this preſent year of King Jeſus 1648. and this by Commiſſion from God our King, and the Parliament of Heaven, unalterably, uncontroulably; and have for that purpoſe made choyce of the deep Seagreen for our Flag and Colours, and do hereby ordain and authorize it to be worn as the lively badg of Conſtancy, Sufferance and Valor in grain, the cognizance of Iuſtice and the mark of Freedom and Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be it by us ordered, That whatſoever noble heart ſhall abhor the yoke of Prerogative pleaſure, the Chains of Slavery, and Tyranny by Princes, the Agents and cruel Inſtruments of Princes: Whoſoever ſhall deteſt the Arbitrary Power and Voyce Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative: Whoſoever ſhall abominate the ſelf will'd Pomp and Dominion of Lords temporal and ſpiritual, the jugling of bribed Iudges, the deviliſh inextriable ſnares of the Law-Courts, and their petty fogging ſitting Dogs, (Pleaders, Officers of Court, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys, Solicitors, perjured Sergeants, Bayliffs, Underſheriffs,) with all their Quirks, Demurs, and Quillets: Whoſoever is ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſenſible of the late bloody plots, and ſtill raging deſigns, of Antichriſtian Chriſtians: Whoſoever groans under the preſent Extortions, unequal Taxes, unjuſt Levies, inevitable Monopolies, new Charters, Plunders and Avarice of Committees, bondage of Priſon under inhumane Gaolors, Oppreſſion of Landlords, all Wardſhips, all Hardſhips; Let them, upon ſight hereof, take up the Croſs, and follow Chriſt their King; take up our Colours; and follow us their Leaders; and in ſo doing the <hi>Sea-green</hi> ſhall be the badg of their warrant and protection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be it hereby inſtituted, That every one ſo wearing our Colours in hatband, cuff, garment, hilt, bridle, mayn, or ſail, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Equity, Freedom and Honeſty, ſhall from henceforth, according to our Noble Order, be intitled the Free born Aſſiſtant of Iuſtice, (but according to the Order of King <hi>Charls,</hi> Levellers,) his is new, ours is old.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Be it further inſtituted, That every Champion of the <hi>Sea-green Order</hi> ſhall vow a ſacred vow, in all his prayers and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, to level firſt the mountain of his own heart, pride, ambition, avarice, ſelf hopes, ſelf ends, ſelf revenge, for this is the true level of the internal Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is decreed, That every ſuch Aſſiſtant of Iuſtice ſhall fearleſly reſolve, promiſe and aſſent to his utmoſt power, to level to the earth all the unequal knobbineſs,—and uneven riſings—of injuſtice pomp, tyranny and oppreſſion, as the very cauſes of this War and things abominated in the eyes of an angry God, Saints and Angels; be it in Prince, Peer, Prelate, Iudg, Magiſtrate, and that without difference or exception of Perſons, Parties, Religions, Relations, Titles, Dignities, indifferently and indiſtinctly; for this is the Level of the external Antichriſt: So help him Chriſt, and the three <hi>Machabean Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, it is hereby concluded, that Honeſty among the Levellers ſhal be counted for the beſt Policy, and Simplicity ſhal bear up the Buckler againſt a whole Junto of <hi>Machavil,</hi> and Politicks Woodbee.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Be it enacted and declared, That whoſoever ſhall jeer, baffle, or vilifie our Colours, or reproach the Wearer—ſhall be cenſured an Anti-Leveller, a Malignant Revolter, Grandee Creature, or Dammee Varlet, and to be regiſtred by the <hi>SEA-GREEN Scout</hi> in the Roul of Iuſtice and Revenge; but whoever ſhall conſtantly and habitually affect us, and our Colours, ſhall be admitted into our favor, whether gallant Cavalier, or valiant Reformadoe.</p>
            <closer>Ordered that this be read in the two Houſes twice a week, as alſo once a week in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and every Pariſh Church for a moneth.
