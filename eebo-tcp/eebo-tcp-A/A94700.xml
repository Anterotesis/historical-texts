            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE SVPREME AVTHORITY OF THIS NATION,
the COMMONS of ENGLAND, in Parliament aſſembled.</head>
            <head>The Humble Petition of divers Young men, and Apprentices of the City of London, and
parts adjacent: in behalf of Lieut. Col. John Lilburn, Mr William Walwin, Mr Thomas
Prince, and Mr Richard Overton, now cloſe Priſoners in the Tower of London, without
any declared juſt cauſe: and of Capt. William Bray in the ſame condition
in Windſor Caſtle.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat the honour of God, the good of the Nation in generall, and the Lives, Liberties and
Eſtates of every Free Commoner in England in particular, is deerer unto us than our
very Lives.</p>
            <p>That about the year 1642. when the late King endeavoured in the like hoſtile way
to ſecure the perſons of the ſame number of men (who were then all Members of this Houſe) you
then declared that ſuch his endeavour was againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the fundamental Lawes of the Land: as alſo a breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the liberties of the Subject; whom ſince you have declared to be a free People.</p>
            <p>That in their juſt Vindication, you then as fellow Members, and we (though bound to our
Maſters for a time, by our own free conſent, yet) fellow Commoners with them, did joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
(we adding our power unto your authority) in managing whereof many of our deer
friends and fellow Souldiers loſt their lives, and others with ſome of our ſelves are ſorely
wounded.</p>
            <p>That our dear friends before mentioned are tender unto us, like the apple of our eye, and ſhall
never be otherwiſe untill we ſee juſt and apparent cauſe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>That therefore it is no ſmall grief and amazement to us, to ſee any (eſpecially ſuch eminent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
of Englands Liberties, as we do apprehend them to be) violently fetcht out of their beds
and houſes, and forced to priſon, there to be ſhut up, without allowing them ſo much as bread and
water, to maintain life, for the ſpace of more than forty dayes and nights; notwithſtanding they
are not known to be accuſed or ſuſpected with the breach of any other Law than the wills of ſome
men in Authority.</p>
            <p>That we apprehend there is too juſt cauſe for us to fear, that ſeeing there is no particular Act
either of Treaſon, Fellony, or any other crime laid to their charge, but only a general accuſation
(which neither in Law nor Reaſon is any whit valid) that therefore inſtead of bringing them to
a Legal Tryal, they will be deſtroyed in Priſons, and that not in an open way at one blow, but by
the moſt inhumane way of Martyrdom, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſtarved to death: for although they have no
allowance (w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich the worſt of malefactors ought to have) yet their neer friends are forbidden
either to releeve them with food, or other neceſſaries, nor yet to comfort them in this their ſad
condition: though in never ſo peaceable and earneſt a manner deſired.</p>
            <p>That we cannot but take notice that the ſame condition which is theirs this day, may be ours
the next, though we judge our ſelves cleer from doing any thing juſtly deſerving the ſame.</p>
            <p>That we find by the anſwer to a late Petition, preſented by ſome of our Maſters, in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs,
that it is not ſafe for them to move any more in their behalf, though in the like way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning
(the moſt inferior badge of Freedome which we know.)</p>
            <p>That therefore we are conſtrained by the law of Nature, and Reaſon which God hath given us,
to appear for them, at leaſt in this humble way, and in their behalf, as they are Engliſhmen, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellow Commoners with us, do humbly pray,</p>
            <p>1. That we may be informed what particular offence every of them are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
guilty of; that ſo if any of them ſhall plainly appear to be Malefactors, we may
no longer take their parts.</p>
            <p>2. That if no crime were legally laid to their charge before they were under their
preſent reſtraint, they may be forthwith enlarged, and have juſt Reparation for the
wrongs they have ſuffered.</p>
            <p>3. That then, if any man have ought to lay to their charge, none but legal and
juſt proceedings be exerciſed towards them; the contrary whereof will certainly be
requited by him who is the Judge of all the Earth, and will do right.</p>
            <p>4. That in caſe the former ſhall be, yet notwithſtanding they may not be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of thoſe priviledges which the worſt of Theeves, Murderers and Traytors do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
<hi>viz.</hi> to have ſuch allowances as have formerly been given to Priſoners of the
like nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be allowed the comfort of Friends in a peaceable way, according to
the Lawes both of God and this Nation.</p>
            <p>And if theſe our deſires ſhall appear reaſonable to you, ſo that we ſhall thereby
obtain the ſame, we ſhall therein rejoyce; but if not, we ſhall fear that the ſame (if
not worſe) oppreſſions which were by you condemned in former powers, will now
appear to ly upon the free Commoners of England, for the deliverance from which
we have conteſted hitherto: and for the ſame <hi>We ſhall pray.</hi>
