            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THou hast here presented to thy view (Courteous <hi>Reader</hi>) in this second Part, a plain discourse of <hi>Dialling,</hi> both <hi>Natural, Artificial,</hi> &amp; <hi>Instrumental. Natural</hi> I call it, from the plain illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, by the Armilary Sphear of Brass herein described, or by the <hi>Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Dial-Sphear,</hi> as I fancy to call it, being only a moving Horizontal-Dial, and a moving Plain, according to the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure thereof in the Book annexed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the Arks, Angles, Scituations and Affections, are very plainly represented to an ordinary capacity. <hi>Artificial</hi> I call it, from the lively delineation of the <hi>Horizontal-projection,</hi> the fittest in my opinion for the making plain the mystery of <hi>Dialling. Instrumental</hi> I call it, from the applying of the <hi>Trianguler-Quadrant,</hi> to the ready resolving all the Arithmetical and Astronomical work,
<pb facs="tcp:63104:3"/>
needful thereunto; and that to competent exactness as in the first Part, and also in this second Part is sufficiently seen, in finding the requisites and delineating the hour-lines to small parts, exactly &amp; spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily by the natural Sines, Tangents and Secants on the <hi>Sector</hi> and <hi>Quadrant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, the ready way of finding the <hi>Suns</hi> Altitude, Hour, Azimuth, Angle of the Plain, and any such business relating to <hi>Dyalling,</hi> as in the first Part is largely treated on.</p>
                  <p>Further, in this second Part you have <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Suns</hi> Declination to every day of the years, <hi>1, 2, &amp; 3,</hi> after the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sextile, as near as any extent. Also, a short, but plain direction, how to use the <hi>Trianguler-Quadrant,</hi> at any manner of way of Observation used at Sea; as backward or forward, as the <hi>Davis-Quadrant,</hi> and the <hi>Cross-staff</hi> is used; also, as <hi>Gunter's Bow</hi> is used both for the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Stars.</hi>

                  <p>The Prints of the Lines of Numbers, as you see here inserted, are in part accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. <hi>Windgates,</hi> as to a single and broken line of Numbers: But the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the line of the Fractional parts of a pound, and the several Gage-points, were never before used as I know of; but do much ease &amp; expedite the Operations by the Line of Numbers, Sines and Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Also, these Scales of Reduction are convenient for the finding the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal-fraction, equal to the other Sexage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary-fraction, and are agreeable to those <hi>Tables</hi> in Mr. <hi>Windgates</hi> Book of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick, <hi>pag.</hi> 82.</p>
                  <p>Also note, that the figure of the Rule

at the beginning of the Book, pasted on a <hi>Board,</hi> is the very same with that spoken of <hi>Chap. XV.

                  <p>The like may I say of the <hi>Gunters</hi>-Lines in the <hi>Figures</hi> annexed, yet as large as the <hi>Book</hi> will bear.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you a brief account of my present Thoughts about this matter, and somewhat more particularly in the First Part, disclaiming all boasting or vain ostentation, knowing that at the next Impression it may be amended in many places; I shall rest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, ready to make amends in the making of these, or any other Mathematical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at my House at the <hi>Sphear</hi> and <hi>Sun-Dial</hi> in the <hi>Great Minories,</hi>

                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the distance from S. to ♑, is 15 deg. taken from 45 toward 0, and laid from S. to ♑ inwards toward the Center Z, as the distance was taken from the Tangent of 45, toward the beginning of the Line of Tangents, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Center;</p>
                  <p>So the Point <hi>Cancer</hi> from N. is 15 deg. counted beyond 45, toward the end, below or beyond the Horizon.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63104:8"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As S. ♋ is 62 degrees from 45 towards 00;</p>
                  <p>So is the other Point 62 degrees below N, taken from 45, <hi>viz.</hi> at 76 degrees; which being laid from N, doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach this little page.</p>
                  <p>So that to draw the Tropick of ♑, the Point ♋ being his opposite, is 28 degrees from Z, or 62 deg. from S; and the other Point of ♑, on the North part of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, is 62 degrees, counting from 45 doubly also; or 28 degrees from 90, the supposed end of the Tangent, which is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, being the Tangent of 76 degrees, or the Semi-tangent of 152, reading the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents doubly from the Center; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Center, to the Tangent of 76; or as half-tangents, 152, laid from Z, gives the Point ♑ on the North-part of the Meridian, below the Horizon; the midst between which two Points of ♑ on the South and North part of the Meridian, is the Center to draw the Tropick of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, to illustrate this difficulty, to draw the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Suns Meridian-Altitude in ♑, his opposite sign is 15 degrees above the Horizon on the South part of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63104:8"/>
Meridian, and 15 degrees below the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, on the North-part of the Meridian, <hi>viz.</hi> the Extent from the Center to the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 52 deg. 30 min. or the Semi-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 105, reading it doubly; being laid from Z, gives the Point ♋ below the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; the middle between which two Points is the Center to draw the Tropick of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, for the Equinoctial or Parallel of ♈; the Meridian Altitude in ♈, is 38-28; and the Meridian Altitude likewise in ♎, his opposite Parallel is 38-28 also; so that if you count 38-28 doubly beyond 45, which will be at the Tangent of 64 degrees and 14 minuts, and take from thence to the Center; this distance laid from Z, shall give the Point AE below the Horizon, and the the middle between the two Points AE, is the Center to draw the Aequinoctial.</p>
                  <p>Then for the Hour-Lines; first, set off the Semi-tangent of 38-28 from Z to P; and the Secant of 38-28 to the same Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us from Z to L, and draw the Line L 45 parallel to EW; then make PL a Tangent of 45 degrees, and lay off the Tangents of 15-30, and 45, from L both-wayes, as you see in the <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also,</hi> As the Sector stands, take out the = Tangents of 60 and 75 severally, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63104:9"/>
turn them four times from L both-wayes, and note those Points with 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Set one Point of the Compasses in L, and open the other to P, and draw the Line WPE for the hour of 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Set one Point in 7-15 degrees from L, and open the other to P, and draw the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line 5 P 5; Set the same Extent also in 7, or 5, on the other side of L, and draw the Hour-line 7 P 7, <hi>as the Figure sheweth.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>Set one Point of the Compasses in 8, 30 degrees from L, and open the other Point to P, and draw the Hour-line 8 P 8, and remove it to the other side of L, and draw the Hour-line 4 P 4: And so for all the rest in order.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, the way of Drawing these Scheams, to represent these varieties, is briefly thus, by the Sector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, to the Radius of the small Tangents, draw the Circle N. E. S. W. observing this Method, if it be a South Recliner, to set the letter N above, and E on the right hand; and contrarily, in North Recliners; for we meddle not with Incliners till afterwards, (and alwayes observe, that a South Incliner is the same with a North Recliner, and the contrary) then cross that Circle with two Diameters, precisely in the Center, as the Letters shew; then according to your Plains Declination from North or South, toward either East or West, set off the Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a Line of Chords or Sines, as before is shewed; and draw that Line for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculer Line of the Plain, and laying the same distance as much from E. and W. draw another Line Perpendiculer to the former, representing the Plain; then, on the first Line, <hi>viz.</hi> the Plains Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, lay off from Z, the half Tangent of the Plains Reclination from Z to E, and the half Tangent of the complement thereof from Z to Q the contrary way; and the whole Tangent of the complement thereof from Z, contrary to E, on the same Line, extended
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63104:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for a Center, to draw the Reclining Circle that represents the Plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> You must draw a Circle through Q and P, (P being alwayes the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangent of the complement of the Latitude laid alwayes from Z toward N for the North Pole) so as to cut the Primitive Circle N.E. S.W. into two equal parts, as is shewed in the 10th Proposition of the third Chapter; part of which Line, doth represent the Stile-Line of the Dial; which last work shall be again shewed in the <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example. To draw the Scheam for a Plain, Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the South to the West 35 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and Reclining 20 degrees, for the Latitude of 51-30.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, to the Radius of your small Line of Tangents, being the Latteral distance from the Center to 45, (or larger if you please) draw the Circle N.E.S.W. representing the Horizon, crossing it in the Center with the Lines N.S. &amp; W.E. for the North and South, and East and West Lines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take out the latteral Tangent of half the latitude, <hi>viz.</hi> 19-15, for 38-30, calling the Tangent of 10, the half Tangent of 20;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63104:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and lay it from Z at the Center, to P for the Pole-point.</p>
                  <p>Then consider the Declination of your Plain, and which way, as here 35 deg. −0′ from the South towards the West; take out the Chord of 35 deg. and lay if from S to C, and from W to A, and from N to D, and from E to B, for the more exact drawing of the Lines AB, CD; the Lines CD repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Poles of the Plain, and the Line AB the Declining Plain it self; then from Z towards D, lay off the Tangent of 10 deg. (being the half Tangent of 20 degrees, the given Declination) to E.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also,</hi> Take out the Secant of 70 degrees, the complement of 20, to the same Radius; and that laid from the Point E, on the Line DC produced, shall be the Center to draw the Circle AFEB, that represents the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, Reclining Plain, that declines 35 degrees, and reclines 20 degrees. <hi>Also,</hi> Lay off half the Tangent of the complement of the Reclination, <hi>viz.</hi> 35 degrees (for the Reclination is 20, the complement whereof is 70, and the half of 70 is 35) from Z to Q.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then to draw the Line <hi>QP,</hi> do thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe how many degrees you count from Z to the Point E, counting from the Center, count so many in the manner of half Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63104:12"/>
from 45; and the latteral distance from thence to the Center, laid from the Center Z, on the Line CD, gives a third Point, <hi>viz.</hi> the Point I; which three Points, QPI, brought into a Circle, will cut the Circle N.E.S.W. into two equal parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Semi-tangent of the complement of the Reclination to 180 degrees, laid from Z on the Line CD, will find the Point I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reclination is 20, the complement 70, being taken from 180 rests 110, whose half is 55, the Tangent of ZI.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or more briefly thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Set one Point of the Compasses in the small Tangent of 45, and count the Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from thence in the way of Semi-tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, both wayes, both above and under 45; and lay one, <hi>viz.</hi> that under 45, from C to Q; and the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that above 45 from D to I; then on the middle Point, between Q and I, last found, raise a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculer to CD, and in that Line will be the Center to draw IPQ.</p>

                     <p>The next Plain to be considered, being also Direct, but not Erect, or Upright, but Leaning from you; and may be either a North or South Recliner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That is thus;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Poles, of a Direct South Plain, are in the meeting-point of the Meridian and Horizon, <hi>viz.</hi> the Point S. in the general Scheam; and the Point N, in the same Scheam, is the Pole of the North Plain; and the Point Z, is the Pole of the Horizontal Plain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63104:25"/>So the Pole of these Plains is a Point in the Meridian, elevated as many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above the Horizon, as the Plain shall recline from the Zenith, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right toward the Horizon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As thus;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose the Hour-circle of 6 in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scheam, to represent a Reclining Plain, the Point AE, in the Meridian, is the Pole of it, being as many degrees above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon S, as P is below the Zenith Z.</p>
                     <p>So also is P the Pole to the North Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Plain WAEE; for the Point P, is as much above the Horizon N, as AE is below the Zenith Z.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see what the Pole of a Plain means, <hi>viz.</hi> a Point 90 degrees every way from it.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore North <hi>Direct Recliners</hi> have their Poles any where between Z &amp; N, and South <hi>Direct Recliners</hi> have their Poles any where between Z &amp; S, according to the degrees and minuts of their Reclination.</p>
                     <p>This being premised, for drawing the Hour-lines, observe, That for South <hi>Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Direct,</hi> the difference between the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and the complement of your Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is alwayes the Stiles height for that reclining Plain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63104:26"/>
                        <hi>But note,</hi> That when the Reclination is more than the complement of the Latitude, that then the contrary Pole is elevated, <hi>viz.</hi> the North Pole on South Recliners.</p>
                     <p>But for North Recliners, the sum of the Co-latitude, and the Plains reclination is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Stiles elevation; but note, when the Sum is above 90, then the complement to 180 is the Stiles elevation; but it must be turned the other way, <hi>viz.</hi> contrary to the nature of a North Recliner, for the Stile will look downwards in the North Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner, and upwards in his opposite South Incliner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note also by the way,</hi> That when the South Recliner reclines equal to the complement of the Latitude, it is called a Direct Polar Dial, or rather an Equinoctial in respect of his Poles, (but I mind not to be singular).</p>
                     <p>And when the Reclination of a North Recliner, is equal to the Latitude, then the Stiles height is just 90 degrees; and the Plain, called an Equinoctial-plain, or rather Polar, in respect of his Poles, (being first in order treated on).</p>
                     <p>Thus understanding, and right concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what the Plains are, the drawing of any of them is the same with the North and South; for the Stiles height is alwayes to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63104:26"/>
counted the complement of the Latitude, and by consequence you have the Latitude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As thus for Example. Comparing the reading, and Figure VII.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose a Plain recline from the Zenith toward the North part of the Horizon 10 degrees, his Pole is 10 degrees above the Horizon; and then 10 taken from 38-30, there remains 28-30, for the Stiles Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or the Latitude to draw it as a Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Dial; and 61-30 for the Latitude for which place you are to draw a Direct E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect South Dial.</p>

                     <p>Suppose a South Recliner, recline 50 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, being more than 38-30, the Co-lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; then take the Co-latitude from thence, and there remains 11-30 for the Latitude or Stiles height, to draw a Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Dial by; and 78-30 for a Latitude to draw a South Dial by; but the Cock must look up to the North, therefore must be turned the other way.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. III. To find the Declination of any PLAIN.</head>
                  <p>FOr finding the Declination of a Plain, the most easie way is by a Magnetical-Needle, fitted according to Mr. <hi>Failes</hi> way, in the <hi>Index</hi> of a <hi>Declinatory</hi> (as he calls it) being 180 degrees of a Semi-circle, divided on an Oblong-Board, or Quadrant, or a longer Needle in a square Box, (or) fitted with Hinges and a Cover; after all which wayes, you may have them made at the sign of the <hi>Sun-dial</hi> in the <hi>Minories,</hi> by <hi>Iohn Brown</hi>; or of any other manner you shall think fit.</p>
                  <p>But, to our <hi>Trianguler Quadrant,</hi> is a Box and Needle also to be fitted of another form, in some things more convenient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whose form is thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in a piece of Box 5 inches long,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63104:35"/>
2 ½ broad, and 6 tenths of one inch thick, is a hole made near 4 inches long, 1 inch ¾ broad, and 4 tenths deep for a Needle to play in; about 50 degrees at each end; with brass-hinges, and a cover, and a brace to keep the lid upright, &amp; an Axis of Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and a Plummet playing in the lid, and a Horizontal and a South-dial, drawn on the Box and Cover; also a hasp and glass to keep the Needle close covered, and on the bottom a Grove one tenth of an inch dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, made just as broad as one leg of the Sector is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The use whereof is thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Put your Box and Needle, on that leg of the Sector, as will be most convenient for your purpose; the North or cross-end of the Needle toward the Wall, when it is a South decliner; and the contrary when it is applyed to a North decliner, as the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Needle will tell you better than many words; then open or close the Rule, till the Needle play right over the Line in the bottom of the Box, (unless there be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, then you must allow for it East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or Westwards what it is). Then, I say, the quantity of the Angle in degrees and minuts the Sector stands at, above or under 90, is the degrees and minuts of Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63104:36"/>
being counted from 00 in the little Semi-circle, as complements to the Angle of opening; as in the 4th <hi>Use</hi> of the 5th <hi>Chapter</hi> is largely and plainly shewed.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the quantity of degrees and minuts of Declination: but to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which way, consider <hi>thus</hi>;</p>
                  <p>If the Needle will stand still in the middle, when the North-end is toward the Wall, then the first denomination is South, if not North.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you know where North and South is, you may resolve which way the East and West is; For, observe alwayes, if the North be before you, then the East is on the right-hand, and the West on the left; and contrarily, If the South be before you, the West is on the right-hand, and the East on the left.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Sun, being in the East-point of the Horizon, can look on the Plain, it is a South-east Plain; but if it beholds it when in the West-point, it is a South-west Plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Likewise,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Cross-end of the Needle will not stand toward the Wall (the Needle playing well) and the Sun being due East, beholds
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63104:36"/>
the Plain, then it is so many degrees North-east; but if it cannot look on the Plain, being due East, then it is a North-west Plain, declining so many deg. as the Sector stands at, under or above 90, being alwayes the complement of the Angle the legs of the Sector stand at, and found by taking the Angle the legs stand at, from 90, when the Angle is less than 90.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Taking 90 out of the Angle, when it stands at an Angle above 90 degrees as a look at the little Semi-circle on the Head sheweth.</p>

                  <p>You must needs take notice of the two Meridians, <hi>viz.</hi> one of the place which is the Meridian, or 12 a clock; to which place, when the Sun or a Star comes, it is said to be in the Meridian.</p>
                  <p>And the other is the Meridian of the Plain, in which Line the Pole-point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Plain is, being 90 degrees distant from the Plain every way, and in all upright-Dials their Pole is in the Horizon; and that degree of Azimuth in which the Pole-point lies, counted from South or North toward East or West, is alwayes the declination thereof; so that by finding the Suns Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth at any time, and the distance of the Sun at the same time from the Meridian of the Plain, is gotten the declination.</p>
                  <p>The Azimuth of the Sun from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the place, is found by the 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 39 <hi>Uses</hi> of the 15th <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                  <p>This is the Operation; the Application or Use is worded several wayes by several men; I hope I shall do it as fully, and as briefly as some others.</p>
                  <p>The Sun, to our appearance, passeth from East, by the Meridian, to the West every day; therefore in the morning it wants of coming to the Meridian; at noon it is for a moment just in the Meridian, and in the afternoon it is past the Meridian of the place.</p>

                  <p>Suppose the same day, in the Afternoon, I find the Suns Altitude 15-0, and the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow 20 degrees want; the Azimuth at the same Altitude, and the same day, will be near the same number of degrees; but in the Afternoon it is past the South, or Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the place; here also it is a North-plain, because the sum is above 90; and a

North-west, because it is against the South, before it comes to be right against the Plain.</p>
                  <p>But if you happen to come when the Sun is in the Meridian of the Plain, then the Suns Azimuth is the Declination, East or West, as the Azimuth is.</p>

                  <p>If you take the shadow, when the Sun is just in the South, or Meridian of the place, the shadow is the Declination; if it is past the Plain, it is Eastward; if it wants, it is Westwards.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have (I hope) shewed the true manner of finding the Declination of a Wall by the Sun shining on the Plain, as plainly and as briefly as the matter will bear, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to young <hi>Tiroes</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>It may be done also, by observing when the Sun just begins to shine on a Chimny, or Wall, or high place you cannot for the present come near, conceiving the Sun to be then just 90 degrees from the Meridian of the place wanting, or just when it leaves it being then 90 degrees past the Plain, then take the Altitude and Azimuth, and work accordingly to the former Rules.</p>

and behold! it makes the — Tang. of 72-33.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take the whole space CE, and make it a = Tangent of 72-33; then take out the = Tangent of 67-30, and lay it from C to H; and take also in the same common-line, right against the small Tangent of 37-30, which is in the large Tangent 10-50, the = Tangent of 10-50, taken for 37-30, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid from E, the place for 8, will meet just at H; which Point H, is the true place for the Substile, to fit and fill the Plain, with the hours determined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sector so set, Take out all the = Tangents above 45, as in the <hi>Table,</hi> and lay them the right way from H, toward C, and E; then take out = Tangent of small 45; and setting one Point in H, strike the touch of an Arch, as at I; then make HI a = Tangent in great 45, and take out the = Tangents of the rest of the hours under 45, as in the <hi>Table,</hi> and lay them both wayes from H, because the Substile falls on an even half hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Draw the Line HK, = to the first Line AD, for the true Substile; then make HK Radius, or the Tangent of 45, and take out the Parallel Tangent of 5-56, the Stiles

height, and lay it from K to L; then take HI, the first Radius, and setting one Point in L, draw the touch of an Ark as by M; then draw a Line by the Convexity of the Arches by I and M, for the true Stile-line.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take the nearest distance from the Point K, to the Line IM, and make it a = Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 45, the greater Radius, and take out the = Tangents, as in the <hi>Table,</hi> and lay them from K both wayes; and then lastly, by those Points draw Lines from the hours required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That if in striving to put too many hours, the sum of the two extream hours come to above 76, it will make the hours too close together, and put you to much more trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also note,</hi> If your Rule prove too small, then take the half of the sum of both the Tangents, and turn the Compasses twice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also,</hi> If you be curious, you may use the Natural Logarithm Tangents, instead of the Line of Tangents, but this will serve very well.</p>
                  <p>This is a general way of augmenting all manner of Dials, when the Stiles height is low, as under 15 degrees; and as ready a way, as you meet with in any Author what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>

                  <p>FOR the compleat and true drawing of these Dials, that you may plainly see their Affections and Properties, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have a Scheam for every variety; in doing whereof, I shall follow the Method that Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> of <hi>Deptford,</hi> used in his <hi>Art of Shadows</hi>; which will comprehend any sort of Reclining and Declining Dial, under 6 varieties, <hi>viz.</hi> 3 South Recliners, and 3 North Recliners (the Inclining being their opposites, and no other, as afterwards is shewed).</p>
                  <p>Wherein I shall be very brief, yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently plain, to a Mathematical <hi>Genius,</hi> and render the Canons, by Artificial and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sines and Tangents, and draw the Dial by the Sector, the fittest Instrument for that use; With other occurrent Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,

as they come in place, and the way by the Scheam Geometrically also.</p>

                  <p>The manner of drawing this Scheam, is plainly shewed before, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) both ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and particularly for the drawing of Dials, and the <hi>Example</hi> there, is the very Scheam for this Dial; wherein you may further consider, That the Perpendiculer-line is right before you, and when you look right on this Plain that declines Southwest, the North is before you on the left hand, the South behind you on the right hand 35 degrees, the East on the right hand, the West on the left; the Line CD the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-line right before you, representing the Perpendiculer-line on the Plain, AB the Horizontal-line, ZE the quantity of Recli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, PF the Stiles Elevation above the Plain, having the South Pole elevated above the lower-part of the Plain, because the

                  <p>That when the North-pole is Elevated on South Recliners, you must draw them as North-decliners; and North-west and North-east incliners, that have the South-pole Elevated, you must draw them as South-east and West-decliners, which will direct as to the right way of placing the Substile, and Hour of 6 from 12.</p>
                  <p>In this place I shall also insert the general way, by Calculation, to find the new Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as well as new Declination:</p>

                  <p>As Radius, or Sine of 90, to the Co-sine of the Plains old Declination;</p>
                  <p>So is the Co-tangent of the Reclination, or Inclin. to the Tang. of a 4th Ark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In South Recliners, and in North Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, get the difference between this 4th Ark, and the Latitude of your place, and the complement of that difference is the new Latitude: if the 4th Ark be less then the old Latitude, then the contrary Pole is Elevated; but if it be equal to the old Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it is a Polar-plain.</p>
                  <p>But in South Incliners, and in North Recliners, the difference between the 4th Ark, and the complement of the Latitude of the place (or old Latitude) shall be the new Latitude, when the 4th Ark and old Latitude is equal, it is an Equinoctial-plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus in this Example;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As sine 90, to Co-sine of 35, the old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination;</p>
                  <p>So is Co-tangent of 20, the Reclination to 66-03, for a 4th Ark; from which taking 51-32, the old Latitude, rests

14-31, the complement of the new Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which will be found to be 75-29, the new Latitude.</p>
                  <p>By which new Latitude, and new Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if you work as for an Erect Dial, you shall find the same Requisites, as by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Operations you have done; and the distance of the Perpendiculer and Meridian will set all right.</p>

                  <p>First, for the Affections, consult the Scheam, wherein, laying the Perpendiculer-line CD right before you, you see that the Substile, and the Meridian, are to be laid from the Perpendiculer toward the left-hand, the Substile lying between the Perpendiculer and the Meridian, and the Stile or Cock of the Dial must look upwards, the North-Pole being Elevated above this Plain, which will guide all the rest.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, draw the Horizontal-line AB, and on C as a Center raise a Perpendiculer, and set off by Chords, Sines, or Tangents, the Meridian or 12 a clock Line, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile, and Stile, as exactly as you may; and draw the Lines 12 C, Substile C, and Stile C.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>As far from the Center C, as you conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently may, draw a long Line perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the Substile, as the Line EHF; then setting one Point of a pair of Compasses in H, open the other till it touch the Stile-line at the nearest distance.</p>

                     <hi>INclining Plains</hi> are but the under faces of <hi>Recliners,</hi> beholding the Nadir, at the same Angle that the Recliners behold the Zenith.</p>
                  <p>And the making of them differs nothing from the Recliners already mentioned; and all the Requisites, as Meridians Elevation, Substiles distance from 12, and the Stiles E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation, &amp; the Hour distances, are the same both in the Incliner, as they were in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner, and have the same Numbers also set to the Hour-lines; So that in drawing of these Dials that have Centers, if you draw all the 24 Hours, you then draw 4 Dials at once; as thus, in the <hi>Example</hi> of the declining E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, being a North declining East 55 degrees, and reclining 35-50. If you draw the 24 hours, being done at the same time

and stroke, by drawing the Hour-lines through the Center on the other-side, and the Substile and Stile also, as here you see in the Dial annexed, being the Equinoctial-Dial, belonging to the second Variety of North Recliners declining Eastward 55, and reclining 35-50; the Lines drawn through the Center, and complemented to 12, is a South-east declining, and Inclining 35-50.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you turn the Paper, and look against the light, and then the North-east becomes a North-west Decliner 55, and reclining 35-50; and the South-east becomes a South-west, Declining and Inclining as much.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, that every Draught of a Dial will serve for 4 Plains, that is for the place you draw it, and his opposite; and for another Plain, declining as many degrees the contrary way, and reclining as much also, and for the opposite thereunto, as by the two Draughts of the two sides, may plainly be seen to appear. And the like holds in all sorts, as Upright Decliners also.</p>
                  <p>As a North-east and a North-west, a South-east and a South-west, declining 30; one Dial drawn round about, serves all 4 Dials; But note, that no South Erect or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Dial, can have the Sun to shine on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63104:94"/>
any Hour-line that falls above the Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-line; and those hours on the North-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners, that fall below the Horizontal-line, belong also to the South Dials.</p>
                  <p>But for a plain general Rule, to know what hours belong to any Plain whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in any Latitude, do thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To know what Hours belong to any Plain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, draw a general Scheam to your Latitude, as this is done for 51-32; and mark the 4 Cardinal-points with E.W.N. &amp; S. as is usual for setting the Scheam right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all Declining Upright Dials, draw on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a streight Line for the Plain, Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to the Line that doth represent the Pole of the Plain, counting so many degrees as the Declination of the Plain shall happen to be from S. or N. toward E. or W. then all the Hour-lines of the Scheam that that Line of the Plain shall intersect, are the Hour-lines proper to that Plain.</p>
                  <p>

                        <hi>1.</hi> Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Line E and W, being Perpendicul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

doth therefore represent a South-plain on one side, and a North-plain on the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you conceive the Sun to be in <hi>Cancer,</hi> and going of his Diurnal Motion, at his Rising about a quarter before 4, beholds the North-side of the Line EW, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so to do till 25 minuts after 7; and then it shines on the South-plain till 35 minuts after 4, and then begins again to shine on the North-plain, and so continues till Sun setting.</p>
                  <p>But when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, it beholds the South-plain at the Rising, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at 6 a clock in the morning; and shines on it all day, till Sun set, being at 6 at night; and then the North Dial is useless.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <hi>2.</hi> For a Declining-Plain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose 30 degrees South-east; first set the Scheam in his right scituation for a South-east Plain; then if you count 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from S toward E, for the Pole of the Plain; and 30 degrees from W toward S, or from E toward N, and draw that Line that shall represent the Plain; then you shall find that the Sun being in <hi>Cancer</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63104:96"/>
to shine on this Plain, just a quarter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 5 in the morning, and continue till near half an hour after 2.</p>
                  <p>But about the middle of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> it will shine on it till a quarter after 4, <hi>viz.</hi> till Sun set; and all the hours after 2, belong to the North-west Plain that declines 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and one hour in the morning also, <hi>viz.</hi> from a quarter before, till three quarters after 4.</p>
                  <p>The like work serves for any Decliner whatsoever, in any Latitude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <hi>3.</hi> But for Decliners and Recliners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Draw a long Line, as AB, and cross it with a Perpendiculer in the Center C, and lay off from C, toward A and B, the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 45; or the Semi-tangent of 90, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the largeness of your Scheam; then lay off the Semi-tangent of the Reclination from C to D, up and down, both wayes; then take out the Secant of the complement of the Reclination, which will be a Radius to draw the Arks ADB, which Paper you must cut out, and apply the two Points of the Paper ADBD, to the two Points of Declination of the Plain, noted in the Scheam with A and B; that is, put A to A,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63104:96"/>
and B to B; then the round or convex-edge of the Paper, represents the reclining Plain; and the same edge, on the other part next the Horizon Southwards, represents the South-west Incliner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose I make the Paper ADB, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline 35-50, the Reclination of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial-plain; then, first set the Scheam right before you in its right scituation, and putting the Points A, in the Paper, on A on the Scheam; and B in the Paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to B on the Scheam; I shall find it to be even with the reclining Circle AEB; then following the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> I find that it shines on the North Recliner from the Rising till near 2, at which time it leaves the North-recliner declining Eastward, and begins to shine upon the opposite Plain, <hi>viz.</hi> the South-west Incliner, declining 55-0, and reclining 35-50, and so continues till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But note,</hi> That if the Line that represents the Plain, cuts the Tropick twice, as the Line EW for a North-plain; then, though the Sun leave the Plain in the morning, it will shine on it again in the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note also,</hi> That a North-east Recliner, is represented by the other Convex-edge of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63104:97"/>
Paper, as here a North-east Decliner 55, and Inclining 35-50, the Sun will shine but till 3 quarters after 8 in <hi>Cancer</hi>; but in <hi>Capricorn</hi> it shines till half an hour after 9, and comes no more on it that day: And <hi>note alwayes,</hi> That when it leaves any Plain, that then it begins to shine on his opposite, as here the opposite to this North-east In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner, is the South-west Recliner, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the same Line or Circle ADB, that the North Recliner was: Only, you must count that side of the Line next to the Horizon, the Inclining-plain; and that side next the Zenith, the Reclining-plain; For, the Line that represents it, having no bredth, can be no otherwise distinguished, unless you will make a material, Armilary Sphear, of Pastboard or Brass, as the following Discourse doth plainly demonstrate, in these several Operations, for the better conceiving of these Mathematical Excercitations.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have the way of making all manner of <hi>Sun Dials,</hi> upon any plain Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, the Axis of the World being the supposed Stile to all these Plains; As for those curiosities of Upright Stiles, and Elip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Dials, and drawing of Dials by the Horizontal, or Equinoctial Dials, you have them in the Works of Mr. <hi>Samuel Foster,</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:63104:97"/>
and others; and in <hi>Kerkers Ars magna, &amp;c.</hi> But I intended not a Volumn of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, but only a further improvment of the <hi>Trianguler-Quadrant,</hi> as you will see in the next <hi>Chapter,</hi> of drawing the Furniture or Ornament of Dials; which being but seldom used, I shall here crave an Apology for the brevity therein, fearing, lest that to the young Practitioner it may seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard to conceive, though to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in these matters it may be plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>Then for a Conclusion, you shall have an easie Mechanick way, to draw a Dial on the Ceiling of a Room, that lieth Flat or Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal, which will be very good for Painters or Plaisterers, to Ornament a Room withal, and is not yet treated on that way, as ever I read of.</p>

                     <p>The measure from the Center of the Dial, to the crossing of every Hour-line, and the Equinoctial-line, taken and laid from G, to the Line AB, gives Points to draw the Hour-lines on the <hi>Trygon</hi>; As in the <hi>Figure.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That if the Substile happens to fall on an even, whole, or half hour, then one Line will serve on both sides of the Substile; but if not, you must draw as many more, and set Figures to them, to avoid confusion.</p>
                     <p>Then, I say, that the several distances from G, to the crossings of those Hour-lines last drawn on the <hi>Trygon</hi>; and the Signs being laid on their correspondent Hour-lines from the Center of the Dial, shall give

Points in those Hour-lines, to draw the signs of the Zodiack, with a thin Rule that will bend to those Hyperbolick Sections.</p>
                     <p>The same way serves to draw the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels of the length of the Day, if you lay the distunce from G, the crossings of the pricked Lines and Hours on the <hi>Trygon,</hi> and is as true as any other way by Calculation, which must afterward be performed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have the way to proportion the Height of the Stile, to fit the Plain, and the place of the Horizontal-line in all <hi>Erect-Dials,</hi> which is alwayes Perpendiculer to 12, and drawn through that point a-cross the Plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this way of drawing the Signs, is general in all Plains whatsoever, that will admit them.</p>

the hour, counted the right way from the marked Meridian-line on the Semi-circle, and there skrew it fast; Then extend the Thred fastened in the Center of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,</hi> till it cut the Altitude of the Sun at the same hour and Azimuth, on the degrees of the <hi>Quadrant,</hi> and extending the Thred to the Ceiling, make a mark for that Hour and Altitude; that Point at that time, gives the true place where the reflected spot will fall, at that Hour, Azimuth, and Altitude on the Ceiling of the Room.</p>

                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> When all is done, to put the Glass in right, the Foile being first rubbed off, to to cause it to give but one spot, let the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Glass lie just so high as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Quadrant</hi> was, in the drawing the Lines, and put some Putty under it, and the Sun shining, make it to play right on the true Hour, Altitude, and Azimuth; or, if it be just at noon, then bend it on the Putty with your finger, till it fall just on the Meridian, and day of the Month also in the Meridian-line.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The making of the <hi>Tables</hi> of the Suns Altitude and Azimuth, is very largely shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 15th <hi>Chapter, Vse</hi> the 37th and 38th, where you have wayes both general and particular, for any one or more Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>

Then being so fixed, and made fast there, pull the Axis streight, and bring the upper Moving Semi-circle just to touch the Thred or Axis; then on the upper and lower Semi-circles, the Axis sheweth the Stiles Elevation; and on the Plain the Semi-circle cuts the Substiles distance from 12, <hi>viz.</hi> 00, because a Direct Plain.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>For these Dials, set the Plain Direct, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63104:134"/>
before, and let the upper part of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon cut the Semi-circle of Reclination, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Plains Reclination, and there make it fast; then the Axis drawn streight, and the upper Semi-circle brought to it, sheweth the Stile and Substile; and the Thred and Hour-circle, laid as before, giveth the Hour-Arks on the Plain, and sheweth also how the Proportion runs.</p>
                     <p>To find any Requisite also you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve for all North-Recliners and South-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners, that the complement of Latitude and Reclination put together, doth give the Poles Elevation, or Stiles height, for all those Plains, which sometime will be above 90 from the South part of the Meridian; and then the complement to 180, is to be set from the North part of the Meridian: But if it be a South-Recliner, then substract the Reclination out of the Comp. Lat. and the remainder is the Stiles Elevation: But if the Reclination be more than the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Latitude, then substract the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Latitude out of the Reclination or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and the remainder is the Stiles Elevation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note also,</hi> That the upper-face of the Plain, that beholds the Zenith, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliner; and the under-face that beholds the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63104:134"/>
Nadir, is the Inclining-plain. <hi>And note,</hi> That both Plains, <hi>viz.</hi> both Incliners and Recliners have the same Requisites in each of them. But, the hours proper to the Recliner, are not to be put on the Incliner; for when the Sun shines on the one, it can't shine on the other. Therefore to know what hours are fit for these or any Plains what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>do thus</hi>;</p>
                     <p>The Sphear rectified, and the Plain set to his true scituation, lay the Thred on the Suns declination, on the Hour-circle (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what time of year you would know when the Sun begins and ceases to shine on any Plain) and turn the Hour-circle, with the Thred so laid, till the Thred do but just touch the Plain, and the Hour-circle doth on the Equinoctial, cut the Hour and Minuit required; when the Sun comes on the East-side, and when it goes off from the West-side of the Plain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose you have a Direct North-plain that Reclines from the Zenith towards the Equinoctial 25 degrees, you shall find the Stiles Elevation to be 63-30, the Substile from 12. The North-Pole to be elevated on the Recliner, and the South-Pole on the Incliner; and that the Sun shines on the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63104:135"/>
North-recliner in the longest dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> 23-31, declination, from the Rising 13′ before 4, till 10; and then it begins to shine on the South-incliner, and shines till 2 afternoon; then it comes on the North-recliner again, and continues till it sets.</p>
                     <p>But in the shortest dayes, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination is 23-30 towards South, then on the North-recliner it shines not at all, but only on the South-incliner, from Rising to Setting; and so doth it all the time the Sun hath South-declination.</p>
                     <p>This Rule serves for all sorts of <hi>Dials</hi> whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the Circles of the Sphear shews the Canon to work this Question exactly, whereof you have a large Discourse in <hi>Wells</hi> his <hi>Art of Shadows,</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 391, to 408, in 35 <hi>Chap.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Also,</hi> By the fore-going Rule you shall find the Sun shine all the year from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, till 12 on the East-side; and on the West-side from 12, till his Setting.</p>
                     <p>

                           <hi>5.</hi> For an East or West-Recliner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Turn the moving Horizon to 90 degrees in the fixed, as before; then set the Plain to his due Reclination, and make it fast there, and pull the Axis streight, and bring the upper Semi-circle just to touch it, and straitway you have the Stile, and Substile, and 12, the Inclination, Meridian, and Hour-Arks on the Plain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An East-plain reclining from the Zenith towards the Horizon 45 degrees, hath his Meridian, or 12 a clock Line in the Horizon; for if you extend the Thred from the Center
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63104:136"/>
to the fore-side of the Meridian, just there the 12 a clock Line must alwayes be, which in this Plain lies in the Horizon. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile doth lie 41-40 from thence upward, as the upper Semi-circle doth shew; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination Meridian is thus found; Bring the Hour-circle, till it stand even and parallel to the upper Semi-circle; then on the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial it cuts 58-7′, the Inclination of the Meridian, with which you must make a <hi>Table</hi> of Hours, or Arks at the Pole, to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the Arks on the Plain, if you work Arithmetically. But by the Sphear, Set the Hour-circle to the hours on the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, and the Thred being brought along the Plain till it touch the Hour-circle, shall shew on the Plain the Angle from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon or Perpendiculer; or with some more trouble, from Substile or 12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Also,</hi> It shews, that the North-Pole is Elevated on the West-reclining; and the South, on the East-inclining opposite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and that the Recliner in ♋, shews from 9 in the forenoon, till 8 at night; and the East Incliner from the Rising, till 9 fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon in Summer; and in Winter, till a 11 in the forenoon.</p>
                     <p>Now to make these Plains, as Erect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliners, let the complement Latitude become
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63104:136"/>
a new Latitude; and the complement De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination a new Declination; then they may become Erect Decliners, as in the next sort following.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>By Declination, I mean the quantity of the Angle that the Meridian or Pole of place makes between the Meridian, or Pole of the Plain; therefore to set the Sphear to any Declination, <hi>do thus</hi>;</p>
                     <p>The Sphear being set to the Latitude, turn the Sphear as well as you can guess, to the scituation of the place; that is, put the North part of the Meridian towards the North; and the South part towards the South; then turn the Notch of the movable Horizon, alwayes to the degrees of the Plains Declination, from North or South, towards either East or West, and Upright also as in Erect Dials: Then is the Plain set to his Declination, <hi>viz.</hi> the distance of the Horizon between the Meridian, or Pole-place, which is alwayes 12 a clock, and the Meridian, and Pole of the Plain, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes just where the Notch is in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Horizon.</p>

                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:63104:137"/>
                        <hi>Now according to these Rules,</hi> A Plain that declines 30 degrees from South to West, The Stiles Elevation is 32-35. The Substile from 12, 21-40. The Inclination of the Meridian 36-24. The South Pole is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the South-side, and the North Pole on the North-side: And the Sun shines on the North-side from Rising, to 8; and on the South-side, from 8 to 7 at night; and on the North again, till Sun-setting, by working as in the former Directions is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> In those Erect Decliners, whose declinations is above 60 degrees, you shall find the Stiles Elevation to be very small; therefore to make it exact, you must use A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical Calculation; for the doing of which, the Sphear, with due consideration, gives the best directions, with these <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or <hi>Canons.</hi>

                        <p>But for North-Decliners, you must turn the Plain out of the way of the Thred, still keeping the same side, AB, to the Wall; and if the Horizontal-Dial hinder, put a Parallel-piece between, as your Rule, or any other thing, and you shall have the Point give the Declination on the Southern Semi-circle on the fixed Horizon.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. How to remedy several Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in the using of the Artificial Lines of Numbers, Sines and Tangents, as they are usually made.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. IF the term required happen to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one degree of Sines and Tangents, then the Line of Numbers will supply it, having due respect to the increase of the Radius, or Caracteristick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the sine of 90, to the sine of 23-31, the greatest Declination;</p>
                  <p>So is the sine of 1 deg. 10′, the Suns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Equinoctial, to 0-28, the Declination which falls beyond the end of the Rule.</p>
                  <p>Now to remedy this, the 1 deg. &amp; 10′,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63104:149"/>
is 70 minuts; therefore by the Numbers <hi>say,</hi> So is 70 minuts, the Suns distance from the Equinoctial, to 28 the Suns Declination on the Line of Numbers, observing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same way, as from the first to the second term.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When you have occasion to use a sine above 90 degrees, then you must count the sine of 80, for the sine of 100; and 70, for 110; and 60, for 120.</p>
                  <p>So also, the distance from 90 to 60 in the Sines, is the Secant of 30 degrees; and the distance from 90 to 50, is the Secant of 40; or the Point beyond 90, that represents the Secant of 40.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Extent be too large for your Compasses, as from 45 or 90, to 3 or 4 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; then instead of 90 or 45, make use of a Point in the Sines or Tangents right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the middle 1 in the Line of Numbers, where you may have two Brass Center-pins, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Tangent of 5-43, and the sine of 5-45; and the extent from thence back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or forward, shall reach in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to the 4th proportional Number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Tang. 45, to 1-61 in the Numbers;</p>
                  <p>So is Tang. of 15-0, to 0-43 in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:63104:149"/>Instead of which, you may <hi>say,</hi> As the Tang. of 5-43, to 1-61 on the Numbers; so is the Tang. of 15, to 0-43 on the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers diminishing a Radius; for as Tang. 45 to 1-15, a greater than that; so is the Tang. of 15, to a greater than 15 also, <hi>viz.</hi> 0-43.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Sines &amp; Tangents, or Sines only, where there is another Caution to be observed, As sine 90, to sine 10; so is sine 20, to sine of 3-24 ⅓.</p>
                  <p>To work this with small Compasses on a large Line, <hi>do thus</hi>; Note, that at 10 on the Line of Numbers, or Sine of 90, or Tang. of 45, is one compleat Radius; but at the middle 1, on the Line of Numbers, is a place, or Radius, less; wherein the Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithm Sines, the Characteristick is 8. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, at the sine of 0-34 ½, the Characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick is 7, (and at 3 minuts it is 6,) which do note the several decreasings of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diusses; Therefore set the distance from one Number given, to the next nearest place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst 1, or next Radius, as far from a greater or a less Radius, as your occasion serves, and note the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Operation, the extent from the Point at 5-45 on the Sines, to the sine of 10 degrees, I set the same way from the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63104:150"/>
Point at 0-34 ½ and note the place, which will be at near 1 degree; then the work is thus; As the place against the middle 1, instead of 90, is to the place last found for 10; so is the sine of 20, to sine of 3 deg. 24′ ⅓, the 4th term required.</p>
                  <p>But in those Lines of Numbers, Sines, and Tangents, where the Number is double, this is performed by working a-cross only.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the last term in Tangents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be above 45, then the remedy is two wayes,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As sine of 30, to sine of 90;</p>
                  <p>So is the Tang. of 30, to Tang. 49-07. which here happens beyond 45.</p>
                  <p>Apply the end of the Rule, next 90, close and even with any thing on which the Point of the Compasses may stay, till you take from thence to 45, for that distance laid from 45, shall reach to 49-07, reading the Tangents as numbred beyond 45.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or more neatly thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Compasses being set from the sine of 30, to the sine of 90; set one Point in the Tangent of 45, and turn the other on the Tangents, and keep it there fixed; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63104:150"/>
the other from 45, and close it to the third term, being here the Tangent of 30; then this last Extent laid from 45, shall reach to 49-07, the Tangent required.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When the first term is a Tangent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 45, and the second under 45.</p>
                  <p>Take the excess of the first Number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 45, and set it the same way from the second Number; then the Extent from the second Number to 45, shall be the true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the first and second terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Tangent of 51-30, to the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of 30;</p>
                  <p>So is the Tangent of 40, to Tangent 21-04′.</p>
                  <p>For the Extent from 45, to 51-30 on the Tangents, set the same way from 30, does reach to about 24-30; then the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent from thence to 45, shall reach from 40 to 21-04 on the Tangents, the 4th Number required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it had been from a Tangent above 45, to a sine, the same way would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied the defect.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When the third term exceeds 45 of Tangents, then thus;</p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:63104:151"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As sine 90, to sine 30;</p>
                  <p>So is the Tang. of 50, to Tang. of 30-48.</p>
                  <p>The Compasses set from the first term sine 90, to sine of 30 the second, a less; then set one Point in the Tangent of 45, and extend the other backwards in the Tangents, and note the place, keeping one Point there close, the other to 50 the third term (being above 45, by counting backwards) Then, I say, that Extent laid from Tangent 45, shall reach to Tangent 30-48, the 4th proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Tangent required.</p>
                  <p>If the Proportion had been increasing, then there had been no trouble at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also note,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That working a-cross, or changing the terms, is a good remedy also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As sine 90, to Tang. 50; which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increasing, for the Tang. of 50 being more than the sine of 90, yet taken on the Rule from 90 to 40, the complement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as if it were decreasing;</p>
                  <p>So is sine 30, to Tang. 30-48, the contrary way: <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As from the first term, properly counting to the second.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:63104:151"/>7. Lastly, When one or two Radiusses (or Alterations of the Characteristick) falls between the first and second term.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, By the Line of Numbers only; As 8000 is to 10, So is 5000 to 6 ¼, or 25.</p>
                  <p>To work this properly, and naturally, the unite on the Numbers should be four times repeated, which is seldom more done than twice, as here: But this, and any other, by the Line of Numbers is not interrupted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a due respect to the Number of Places. For to work this, the best way, is changing of terms thus; As 8000, to 5000 in the same Radius; so is 10, to 6-25 in the same Radius also. Or, without changing; As 8000, to the next 1; so is 5000 turning the Compasses the same way, to 6-25.</p>
                  <p>But to call it so, and not 625, your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must guide you more than precepts.</p>
                  <p>But in using Sines and Tangents, the way in the third remedy will fit you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi> As sine 90, to 1 degree (or under); so is sine 30 degrees, to sine 30 minuts. This being too wide an Extent for the Compasses, the third Rule is a remedy for it; which on a large Radius several times
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63104:152"/>
repeated, as in Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi>'s <hi>Circles of Proportion,</hi> is as easie as may be; being sure to remember the number of Radiusses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first and second term, that you may have so many between the third and fourth term also.</p>
                  <p>Much more might have been said as to this; but this Observation being alwayes kept, That as the Extent from the first term to the second, is either increasing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing; So alwayes must the Extent be from the third to the fourth, increasing or decreasing, in like manner, when you use Sines and Tangents; And Numbers also, except, as before, in a few particuler Rules; then you will be truly resolved.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. The Description thereof FOR SEA-USES.</head>
                  <p>THe Description of the <hi>Instrument,</hi> is largely and plainly set down in the <hi>First Part,</hi> and <hi>First Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in regard that is the general Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Lines that can conveniently be put on, and those necessary for this use being far less, I shall repeat the Description again, as far as concerns the use thereof for Sea-Observations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First for length, it ought to be two foot-long at least, when shut together, and not above 3 foot at any time for Sea-uses; (but for Land-uses it may be 6, 8, 10, or 12 foot in length, to find Altitudes or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to Seconds of a degree certainly).</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:63104:154"/>2. The Form of it is the same, as before, <hi>viz.</hi> an opening Joynt of about an inch and quarter, or half quarter broad each Leg; and 6 tenth parts of an inch in thickness, with a Loose-piece of the same length, breadth, and thickness, to make it an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral-Triangle. <hi>As the Figure sheweth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lines necessary for Sea-uses are, first, the 180 degrees upon the moving-Leg and Loose-piece, numbred as before is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Also, 60 degrees on the innermost-edge of the Loose-piece. The Kalendar of Months and Dayes, and degrees of the Suns Place, and Right Ascention, on the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able-Leg.</p>
                  <p>For the speedy and ready finding the Suns place, and declination, which you may do to a minut at all times, by help of the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Table, and Astronomical Cautions of Time and Longitude.</p>
                  <p>Also, on the Head-leg, is the general Scale of Sines and Lines, to the great and lesser Radius, <hi>as in the Figure.</hi> And thus much will serve both for Observation and Operation, as in the following Discourse will fully appear.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this Instrument doth chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Sights for the Observations at Sea,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63104:154"/>
where the Horizon is made use of in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sun or Stars Altitude.</p>
                  <p>And to this Instrument belongs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex and Square, that makes it a most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Sinical-Quadrant, for the plain and easie resolving of all plain Triangles.</p>
                  <p>Also, a weighty Plummet and Thred, and a pair of large Wood or Brass Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes for Operation.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for Description, being all put on one side only, unless you shall be pleased to add the Artificial Numbers, Sines, and Tangents on the outer-edge, and a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-line, and his Scale on the inner-edge; and Natural Sines, and Natural Versed-Sines on the Sector-side: But these as you please.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. The use of the Trianguler-Quadrant in Observation.</head>
                  <p>THat the Discourse may be plain, and brief, and general; there are 10 terms to be named and described, before I come to the <hi>Vses</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, the Head-leg of the Instrument in which the Brass-Rivit is fixed, and about which the other Leg turns, as AB, in the <hi>Figure</hi>; on which Leg, the general Scale of Sines and Lines are usually set.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The moveable-Leg, on which the Months and Dayes be, as in the <hi>Figure,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by BD; which Leg turns about the Head-Leg.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Loose-piece that is joyned to the Head, and moving-Leg, by two Tennons at each end thereof, noted by DA in the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:63104:155"/>4. The Head-Center, or Center-pin on the round-part of the Head-leg, being Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 60 degrees on the in-side of the Loose-piece; which Point is known by B, in the <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Leg-Center, being near the end of the Head-leg, which is the Center to the degrees on the moving-Leg, and out-side of the Loose-piece, being in all 180 degrees; and noted in the <hi>Figure</hi> by the Letter C.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The great Radius, or greater Line of Sines, issuing from the Leg-Center toward the Head, having the Tangents on the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able-Leg to the same Radius; and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure from the Leg-Center to the Tangent on the moving-Leg, a Secant to the same Radius; as CE in the <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The little Radius that issues from the Leg-Center toward the end, having the Tangents, on the out-side of the Loose-piece to the same Radius, and the measure from the Center to those Tangents for Secants to the same Radius; as CF.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Turning Sight alwayes to be skrewed to the Head, or Leg-Center, known by his shape and skrew-hole, as</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The sliding Horizon-sight to slide on the moving-Leg and Loose-piece, noted with its bigness and hole to look through, as</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:63104:156"/>10. The shadow Sight, and 2 others, to pin the Instrument together, which you may call the Object-Sights, alwayes fixed in the two holes at the ends of the moving-Leg, and the Head-leg; and the shadow-Sight is to set to and fro to any place required; noted in the <hi>Figure</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and the other two with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> And</p>
                  <p>Thus you have their Name and Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at large, which in brief take thus for easie remembring.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Head-Leg. 2. The Moveable-Leg. 3. The Loose-Piece. 4. The Head-Center. 5. The Leg-Center. 6. The great Radius. 7. The less Radius. 8. The turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sight. 9. The Horizon sliding-Sight. 10. The shadow-Sight, and the two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest-Sights; the open-part in one is next to, and the other remoter from the Rule, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the upper or lower-hole in the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sight, according as you please to use them in Observation.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>Terms,</hi> the <hi>Vses</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="application">
                     <head>Use I. To find the Suns, or a Stars Altitude, by a forward Observation, as by a Fore-staff.</head>
                     <p>Skrew the turning-Sight to the Head-Center,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63104:156"/>
and put the object-Sight into the hole at the end of the Head-leg, and put the sliding Horizon-sight on the in-side of the Loose-piece; Then setting the turning-sight to your eye, and holding the Loose-piece in your right-hand, and the moveable-Leg toward your body, then with your Thumb on the right-hand, thrust upwards, or pull downwards the Horizon-sight, till you see the Sun through the Object-sight, and the Horizon through the Horizon-sight; then the degrees cut by the Line on the middle of the Horizon-sight, shall shew the true Altitude required.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Also observe,</hi> That if you like to use the upper or lower-edge of the Horizon-sight, instead of the small bar a-cross the open-hole, after the manner of the ends of a Fore-staff, that then the degrees and minuts cut by the edge of the Brass, is the Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude required, to be counted as it is figured from the Object-sight, toward the Horizon-sight; the degrees between them being the Angle required.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note also,</hi> That if the Altitude of the Sun, or Star, be above 30 degrees, you will find it a hard matter, to behold the Horizon and Sun with a bare roling the ball of the eye only, and a stirring of the head, will
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63104:157"/>
easily cause a stirring of the hand, which will spoil the exactness of Observation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Instrument shall be fixed to a Ball-socket and Three-legged-staff, which is not usual at Sea.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to remedy this, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with the open oval-hole in the turning-sight set to the eye, or taking the turning-sight quite away; Observe just as you do with a Fore-staffe, setting the round part of the head, to the hollow-part beside your eye, so as the Head-Center-pin may be as near the very sight of your eye as possibly as you can; which Center is the Center to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees now used in a forward way of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

                     <p>The same Rule serves, if you were in South Latitude, then you must in forward Observations, to find the Latitude, as with a <hi>Gunters Bow,</hi> stand with your face to the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63104:162"/>
North, and in setting the fixed-sight to the Declination, you must count South Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation toward the Head; because those that have Southern-Latitude, have their longest dayes, when those that live in Northern-Latitude have their shortest dayes.</p>
                     <p>The same Rule serves for the Stars also, for being in North-Latitudes; and observing a Latitude forwards, have your face al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes toward the South, and set one Sight to the Declination, counting the Stars Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern or Southern Declination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the same way as the Suns, (and the contrary in South-Latitude); then holding your eye close to the great-hole of the Turning-sight, slide the Moving-sight till its middle-bar or edge (as is most convenient) cuts the Star, and the other the Horizon; then whatsoever the edge of the Moving-sight cuts short of 0, added to 30, or beyond 00, taken out of 30, shall be the Latitude required.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> If you had rather move the lower-sight than the upper, then count like Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Declinations from 00 on the Loose-piece toward the Head-leg, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the contrary, and then set the shadow-sight fixed there; then observing, as in a back-Observation, the Horizon-sight shall shew the complement of the Latitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, without any adding of 30.</p>

                     <p>This way of Observing without a Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, must be done by an <hi>Astrolabe,</hi> which is a Plummet it self, or else with a Plummet fitted to another Instrument, and at some times may do better service than the Horizon, and for an Altitude barely, is shewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

                     <p>Then let the Sun-beams shine through the small-hole on the Turning-sight, to the small-hole on the Horizon-sight, the Thred and Plummet duly playing, shall shew the Latitude of the place required.</p>
                     <p>But if you look at a Star, having the same Declination, then set your eye to the Horizon-sight, and behold the Star through the Turning-sight, and the Thred shall fall

on the Latitude required, when you look toward the South, being in Northern Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So also,</hi> When you turn your face toward the North, in observing those Stars, it is best done when they come to the Meridian below the Pole; but for their coming to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian above the Pole, then their Declinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is increased by the quantity of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Pole, or the complement of their Declination.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As thus;</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Declination of the Pole-Star, when in the Meridian below the Pole, is 87-20 from the Equinoctial; but when the same Star is on the Meridian above the Pole, then it is 92 deg. 40′ distant from the same Northern part of the Equinoctial.</p>
                     <p>So that if you make 60 on the moveable-leg, to represent the North-pole; then you may count or observe any Star that is 25 degrees distant from the Pole, both above or below the Pole; then adding 30 degrees to what the Thred falls on, shall be the true Latitudes complement required; because you have removed the Pole from 90 to 60, 30 degrees backward.</p>

                        <hi>Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The declination of the uppermost Star in the <hi>great Bears back,</hi> is 63-45; that is, 26-15 below the Pole; or, 25 degrees 17 minuts above the Horizon, when on the Meridian below the Pole; but the same Star, when on the South-part of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, is 77-47 above the Horizon, or 26-15 above the Pole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Star being below the Pole, you may set the hole in the middle of the Horizon-sight, to the Declination, counting 90 the Pole, and looking up to the Star, as usually, the Plummet will fall on 38-28, the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes complement required.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Again,</hi>

                     <p>The same Star being on the South-part of the Meridian, above the Pole, I count 60 on the Moving-leg for the Pole, and 26-15 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that Pole further, <hi>viz.</hi> to 86-15, which is as far as you can well go, counting 60 the Pole; then observing, as you did before, you shall find the Thred to play on 08-28, the Latitudes complement required, for the distance between 08-28, and 86-15 is 77-47, adding 30 degrees, because of 60 instead of 90, for the Pole-point.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the Thred playing near the corner, may prove somewhat troublesome to observe, without help of another person; but if you will be exact in this or any other Observation, a Staff and a Ball-socket, should be applied to this, as well as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instruments, to stand steady and sure in the time of Observation.</p>
                     <p>These wayes are ready and easie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking notice of those Regulations and Cautions, which are to be observed in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Altitude, barely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the <hi>Seamans Kalender,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wrights Errors in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> is plainly seen.</p>
                     <p>But if you know them all, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use those Rules in those Books; then, I say, a Thred and Plummet by this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will do as conveniently as any other, or the three Sights and Horizon, as before is shewed, to find the Altitude.</p>

                  <p>THus much as for the way of <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; now, that your <hi>Operation</hi> may be true also, it is necessary that you have a <hi>Table</hi> of the Suns Declination, for the <hi>first, second,</hi> and <hi>third year,</hi> after the <hi>Leap-year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in consideration, that the <hi>second</hi> after the <hi>Leap-year,</hi> is a mean between the other <hi>three</hi>; I have made a <hi>Table</hi> for that, and the Months on the <hi>Trianguler-Quadrant</hi> are agreeable thereunto; and for the <hi>first, third,</hi> and <hi>Leap-year,</hi> have added a <hi>Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Table</hi> to bring it to a minut at least to the real truth, wherein I have followed the Suns place, according to Mr. <hi>Streets</hi> Table of the Suns place, for 1666.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To find the Suns Declination for the year 1670, on the 12th day of <hi>May:</hi> First, if you divide 70 (being the tens only of the year of our Lord by 4, rejecting the 100<hi rend="sup">s</hi>) you shall find 2, as a remainder, which notes it to be the second after Leap-year; and if 0 remain, then it is Leap-year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look in the Table of Declination for 1666, the second after Leap-year, as the year 1670 is, and find the Month in the head of the Table, and the day on one side, and in the meeting-point you shall find 20 deg. 31 min. for the Declination on that day at noon required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you use the <hi>Trianguler Quadrant,</hi> extend the Thred from the Center over the 12th of <hi>May,</hi> and you shall find it to cut in the degrees just 20 deg. 31 min. the true Declination for that year and day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That if you have occasion to use the Declination before noon, then observe that the difference between stroke and stroke, is the difference of Declination for one day; and by consequence, one half of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63104:171"/>
that space for half a day; and a quarter for a quarter of a day, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As thus for Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose I would have the Suns Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the 18th of <hi>August</hi> 1666, at 6 in the morning; here you must note, that the 18th stroke from the beginning of <hi>August,</hi> represents the 18th day at noon just.</p>
                  <p>Now the time required being 6 hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon, Lay the Thred one fourth part of the distance for one day, toward the 17th day, and then in the degrees, the Thred shall cut on 9-43′, whereas at noon just, it will be but 9-38; and the next, or 19th day at noon, it is 9 degrees 16 min. and 3 quarters of a min. as the three pricks thus ... in the Table doth plainly shew; but by the Rule, a minut is as much as can be seen, and so near with care may you come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note also farther,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That if you shall use it in places that be 4 hours, 6 or 8, 10 or 12 hours more East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or Westward in Longitude, the same Rule will tell you, the minuts to be added in Western-Longitudes, or to be substract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Eastern-Longitudes, as Reason and Experience will dictate unto you with due consideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:63104:172"/>For if being Eastwards, the Sun comes to the Meridian of that place before it comes to the Meridian of <hi>London</hi>; then lay the Thred as in morning hours: But if the place be to the Westwards where it comes later, then lay the Thred so many hours beyond the Noon-stroke for <hi>London,</hi> as the place hath hours of Western-longitude more than <hi>London,</hi> counting 15 degrees for an hour, and 4 minuts for every degree; and then shall you have the Declination to one minut of the very truth.</p>
                  <p>But if it happens to be the Leap-year, or the first or third year after the Leap-year, then <hi>thus</hi>;</p>
                  <p>Suppose for the 5th of <hi>October</hi> 1671, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third after Leap-year, I would have the Declination.</p>
                  <p>First, if you lay the Thred over the 5th of <hi>October,</hi> in the degrees, it gives 08 deg. 42 minuts .., for the Declination in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year after Leap-year; then, because this is the third year, look in the <hi>Rectifying-Table</hi> for the 5th of <hi>October,</hi> and there you find <hi>s.</hi> 4 .., for substract 4 minuts and a half from 8-42 .. rests 8-38, the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination required for the 5th of <hi>October</hi> 1671. The like work serves for any other day or year; but for every 5th and 10th
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63104:172"/>
day, you have the Declination set down in a <hi>Table</hi> for all 4 years, to prove and try the truth of your Operations; and by that, and the Line of Numbers, or the Rule of Three, you may continue it to every day by this proportion.</p>
                  <p>As 5 dayes, or 120 hours, to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Declination in the <hi>Table,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one 5th day and another;</p>
                  <p>So is any part of 5 dayes, or 120 hours, to the difference in Declination to be <hi>added</hi> or <hi>substracted</hi> to the 5 dayes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination immediately fore-going the day required.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppose for the 18th of <hi>February</hi> 1669, the first after Leap-year, I would know the Declination by the <hi>Table</hi> made to every 5th day only; On the 20th of <hi>February,</hi> I find 6-53 ½; On the 15th day, 8-47; the difference between them is 1-53 ½; then the Extent of the Compasses from 5, the Number of dayes, to 1-53<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the minuts difference (counted properly every 10th for 6 minuts) shall reach from 3, the dayes from 15 toward 18, to 1 degree 7 minuts and a half, which taken from 8-47′, the Declination for the 15th day, leaves 7 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 38 minuts and a half, the true Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63104:173"/>
for the 18th day of <hi>February,</hi> in the first after Leap-year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or, by the Line of Numbers thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Extent from 5, the difference in dayes, to 113 ½, the difference in min. for 5 dayes, shall reach from 3, the difference in dayes, to 68, the difference in minuts for 3 dayes, to be added or substracted, according to the increasing or decreasing of the Declination at that time of the year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Proved thus;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you substract 5′ ½ from 7 deg. 44... the declination in the second year, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains 7 deg. 38′ ½, the Declination for the 18th of <hi>February,</hi> 1669.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Tables</hi> may serve very well for 30 years, and not differ 6 minuts in Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the Equinoctial, where the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is most; and in <hi>Iune</hi> and <hi>December</hi> not at all to be perceived.</p>
                  <p>Thus you may by the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Table,</hi> find the Suns Declination to a minut at any time, without the trouble of Calculation.</p>

                  <p>Hanging or putting the Center-hole of the Index over the Leg-center-pin, and counting the fiducial-line on the Head-leg for the Meridian of one place, count on the Tangent Line on the Index the Co-tangent of one Latitude, as suppose the Latitude of the <hi>Lizard-point</hi> (the Center alwayes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63104:192"/>
as 90) and there knock in a Pin in a small hole to hang a Thred on.</p>
                  <p>Then count 70 degrees, the difference in Longitude, on the degrees from the Head-leg, and there stay it; then draw the Thred put over the first Pin, till it cut the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the other Latitude, and by help of another Pin stay it there, which you may conveniently do by one of the sliding-sights; then the Thred being so laid, slide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex to every single degree, or fifth degree of Longitude, and then the Thred shall shew on the Index, the Co-tangent of the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude answerable to that degree of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as in the <hi>Table</hi> annexed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Also,</hi> If you would have equal degrees of Latitude, and would find the Longitude according to it; then slide the Index to and fro till the Thred cuts on the Index an even degree of Latitude; then on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees you have the difference of Longitude from either place.</p>

                     <hi>Also note,</hi> That the drawing of one Line only on the <hi>Trianguler Instrument</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, according to the directions of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Thred; with the Thred and Compasses, will perform this work also.</p>
