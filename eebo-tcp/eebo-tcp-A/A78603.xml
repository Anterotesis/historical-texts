            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for ſeveral Treaſons by him committed</head>
            <p>FOr that he the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> not having the feare of God before his eyes, but being inſtigated by the Devil, did Trayterouſly and Villanouſly by force of armes, diſſolve the late Parliament of the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> who they the ſaid Parliament did Repreſent as the Supreame Authority of the ſaid Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> and for that he the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> being a hired ſervant to ſerve the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> in the Conduct of them the ſaid Lords the people of <hi>Englands</hi> forces, againſt their Enemies, of their the ſaid peoples LIBERTIES, RIGHTS and PRIVILEDGES, and notwithſtanding the high truſt repoſed in him the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> ſo to do, yet the ſaid <hi>Oliver</hi> Trayterouſly conſpired many times before he the ſaid <hi>Oliver</hi> did diſſolve the ſaid <hi>Parl.</hi> by force of Arms, wickdly, and Traytorouſly; thereby to render the ſaid Lords the people of <hi>England</hi> utterly uncapable for ever, to recover their LIBERTIES, JUST RIGHTS, and PRIVILEDGES, and did become Maſter of all the ſtrong-holds; Armes, Forces, and Magazines, Armies, Navies, and made, and ſtill doth make noe other uſe of them but to over awe, and force the Lords the people of <hi>England</hi> aforeſaid, to an Obedience and Compliance, to his the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwells</hi> Tyranicall will and pleaſure; contrary to the intent of the truſt repoſed in him, and contrary to all the Solemne Ingagements, and Declarations, of him the ſaid <hi>Cromwell;</hi> which did invite the foreſaid Lords the people of <hi>England</hi> to a chearfull Contribution of their aſſiſtance to the carying on of the war againſt the common Enemies of their LIBERTIES, JUST RIGHTS, and PRIVILEGES: And further that he the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> did in an unheard of manner, ſummon and require upon great penalties, divers perſons, and Members of the Lords the people of <hi>England</hi> to take upon them the Supreame Authority of this Common-wealth, and accordingly upon the forth of <hi>July,</hi> they the foreſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſummoned by vertue of the foreſaid Traytors ſummons did appeare at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in or nigh the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex: where they received an Inſtrument</hi> of Parliament containing theſe words: <hi>I Oliver Cromwell doe appoint you</hi> (meaning the afforeſaid perſons ſummoned by his warrant, to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>their, and then as aforeſaid; that is to ſay, the forth day of</hi> July, 1653. <hi>at White-Hall) to be the Supreame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Nation, and all Territories, and Dominion thereunto belonging;</hi> and notwithſtanding he the ſaid <hi>Oliver</hi> in ſo doing did commit the higheſt of Treaſons that could be committed; for that he the ſaid <hi>Oliver</hi> did not intreat the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> to Elect their Repreſentative, according to their undubitable Rights, and that he would with their Army ſtand by them as ſervants, as in duty he and they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Army) ought to have done; the which if they had done, their late Act of diſſolving the Parliament had not been Treaſon, becauſe they (<hi>viz.</hi> the late Parliament) contrary to their truſt indeavored to make themſelvs perpetuall, contrary to the Law of the Land, &amp; the intent of the truſt repoſed in them, and after the ſo many demands by Petitions of the Lords the people, for them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſurrender their power to a new Repreſentative (equally Choſen) now for that he the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> did not reſtore the peoples Rights in Election, upon the diſſolving the Parliament he hath made that to be Treaſon, which otherwiſe would not have been Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But further he the ſaid <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> having not the feare of God before his eyes, and being inſtigated by the Divill, did contrive, or cauſed to be contrived, a certaine booke called a coppy of draughts of Acts of Parliament, out of which this mock Parliament is to take their Leſſons, and out of which the late Act of Marriages was taken, and in which is the invention of unheard of cruel torments as well for thoſe that offend or oppoſe him, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederats in this unheard of Tirany; as for the tranſgreſſors of the Laws of civell ſocieties:</p>
            <p>And further the ſaid <hi>Cromwell</hi> hath by himſelfe, and others, forced this mock Parliament, to take away the body of our Law (that hath been our Bulwark , and defence, and only weapons counted againſt abſoluteneſs) to the end and intent that thereby the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> may be ſubject to the will, pleaſures, and intended Tirany of him the ſaid <hi>Cromwell;</hi> all which conſidered wee humbly pray, the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> that juſtice may be had againſt this abominable Traytor, and Enemy to God and mankind, <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end that this may be effected it is deſired, that upon the 16th of <hi>October</hi> 1653. being the next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that all the people of <hi>England</hi> would as one man, as well Maſters, Sons, as Servants, repaire unto every County-Town, or ſome other convenient place within <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and appear Armed with ſuch weapons of war as with conveniencie they can, then and there to Elect, and Chuſe ſuch and ſo many perſons as the people of the reſpective Counties, Cities, and Boroughs wont to chuſe for to repreſent them in Parliament, the which may be Conducted to <hi>London,</hi> with ſuch forces of the ſeveral Counties as they ſhall appeare, and becauſe this may not ſeeme either dangerous, or difficult; it is hereby declared that ſeveral Counties with agreat part of the Army will ingage in this work, and that it may not ſeem to be a weakenes to diſcover it: It is hereby alſo declared that it will be ſo unanimous, that no power will be able to queſtion any for ſo doing; for that which is not lawfull for one or two, may be, and is, lawfull for all, or the greater part when the remaninder is not able to queſtion the party that attempteth, beſides if you the Lords the people of <hi>England</hi> will be unanimous in this the recovering of your LIBERTIES, it will coſt no blood; for riſing in ſmall parcells, is but to be overcome in parcels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further,</hi> we doe hereby delare that ſuch of the Army as ſhal joyn in this our ſhaking of this yoke, ſhal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the favour of the Lords the people of <hi>England,</hi> and be continued in their truſts of Arms; for our incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, wee know this of old ſince man was placed upon the earth, that the triumphing of the wicked is but ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment; for though for the preſent hipocrith mount up to the Heavens, and their heads reach unto the Clouds; yet aſſuredly they ſhall periſh for ever, and they which now ſee them, ere long ſhall ſay, where are they for a long time their Tabernacle have only proſpered though they be robbers, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
