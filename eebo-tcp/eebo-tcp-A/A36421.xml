            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Yee have heard it said of old time, Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

But I say unto you, whosoever is

to goe through the Eye of an needle:</hi>
Then the least <hi>of his words,</hi> not lightly

            </p>
            <p>And thus as no light in many dayes

though in so much danger, yet
escaped <hi>drownding</hi> and <hi>killing,</hi> both
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130862:5"/>
(<hi>Acts</hi>) so in that hopelesse estate of
theirs whose Anchors as it were <hi>cut off,</hi>
for that <hi>capitall offence,</hi> the <hi>sin against the
Holy Ghost,</hi> tis possible with <hi>GOD</hi> to
pardon it, to release them of those
chains seeming endlesse.</p>
            <p>So againe, this for another, <hi>Verily I
say unto thee, thou shalt by no meanes come
forth thence untill paid the uttermost
farthing.</hi> The veritie of which place
of <hi>Scripture:</hi> So wrested for <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
those fictions founded or laid thereon
overthrowing that principle. <hi>Who
shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect?</hi>
Therefore no other way but this
to overthrow that; as in truth
concerning utter darkenesse intended
the utmost <hi>mite</hi> paid to be there: and
not extended in that grosse manner, for

his <hi>being taken up into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
there heareing things not

<hi>Reprobation</hi> and <hi>Election.</hi> The dispute
whereof prohibited: VVith <hi>what art

no more <hi>times without</hi> their determined
<hi>Bounds and precincts,</hi> all things at once
manifested, neither the very <hi>Disciples</hi>
forbears to satisfie them in some <hi>cases.</hi>
Saying, <hi>He had many things to say unto
them,</hi> which they could not beare at
that time: <hi>That in his Fathers House
were many Mansions,</hi> (to witt) <hi>privie
Chambers and Closits,</hi> and the like, how

father hath put in his own power. But the
power of the Holy Ghost shall come upon
you.</hi> Linguae tanquam ignis, super sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And againe requested another time
to know what should be the signe of
his second comming, were put off with
those unwellcome tokens, &amp;c. bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to watch, because the day and
houre unknown, a reserved <hi>point;</hi> and
yet nothing <hi>cover'd, which shall not be
reveal'd,</hi> as much to say, the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>
or <hi>Revelation,</hi> that sevenfold sealed

&amp;c. even how long twas to end, which
he longed so to understand.</p>
            <p>And so still prest, <hi>Lord are there many
that shall be saved;</hi> are commanded to
strive themselves <hi>to enter at the straite
gate,</hi> sent as it were to <hi>Noahs</hi> Cabin
doore; when saved those few soules, a
<hi>cold comfort,</hi> had it not included the
mistery of <hi>Noahs</hi> time, the Gospells

            </p>
            <p>And thus for those hungry soules,
craving the least crumbe or drop of
mercy falling from our table, have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up these multiplied fragments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130862:8"/>
for them, <hi>whose multitude as the sand of

            <p>And in no wise, <hi>So much as a tittle of
these blessed words to be lost, or cast away,
&amp;c. Blessed is he that hath his part in the
first Resurrection, for on such the second
death hath no power.</hi> Inferring for all
such having bin partakers of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

<hi>Therfore return and live, for as I
live I have no pleasure in the death of the

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:130862:8"/>For above reach, <hi>as his Mercy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
