            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ye wyll be spowsed to this myghty pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce /

and to be called after his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his name is Ihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Nazarenus. And soo ye muste be called Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena.
It is wryten (Nazarei candidiores niue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretantur
virgulti vel floridi siue custodientes
aut separati a mundo vel vncti siue sancti aut con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>secrati)
That is to saye. Ye muste be as a yonge

the tresour of your husbonde and seuered from the
worlde as a noynted holy and consecrate quene /

Fyrste ye muste be as a yonge grene braunche / 
the whiche loseth his fayre beaute whan he is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the rote. The rote of all Relygyon is
Ihesu of Nazareth that is charyte (Quia deus ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritas
est) And who soo euer is not in charyte he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
hymselfe from almyghty god. Soo ye
muste loue your spowse Ihesu aboue all thynge / he
muste be in your mynde / in your soule / in your her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / and
in all your werkes. And of hym specyally
ye muste speke / for yf ye haue ony pleasure for to
speke of ony other thynges of the worlde or of ony
<pb facs="tcp:10867:3"/>
other man / thenne wyll he be wrothe. For as saynt
Gregory sayth (Prouidendu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ergo nobis est quia
intueri non debet quod non licet concupisci. Et io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes)
Cryste sayth (Qui studet eligantes faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
inspicere ipse fornacem passionis accendit) For
he wyll that ye kepe oonly and entyerly vnto hym
your fyue wyttes / to haue noo pleasure for to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
vppon man or woman / nor to here of noo worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely
thynges / nor speke of noo concupyscence / nor
handell noo contagyous thynges / but oonly that

Ierom sayth. There was neuer man soo Ielous
of his wyfe and taketh hede of his werkes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
as our lorde your spowse wyll take hede of you
For ye can thynke noo thought but he knoweth it / 
nor speke noo worde but he hereth it / nor be in noo
place but he is there presente / nor noo thynge can
dysceyue hym / therfore ye muste loue hym aboue
all thynge and be in parfyte charyte with all your
systers and his people and seruauntes. Also Cryste
Ihesu is called (Flos campi) The floure of Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zareth / the
beaute of this excedeth all other vertues
and it is so noble a tresoure that it can not be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed / 
and therfore virgynyte is honoured in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty
god. And Cryste the heede and the leder
therof and the fyrste thynge that he dyde in erthe
whan he became man he sette vp his housholde of
virgyns and men of chastyte for to serue hym and
<pb facs="tcp:10867:3"/>
his chirche here in erthe / as he was by virgyns the
angels serued in heuen / his moder was and is per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petuall
virgyne. Iohan Euangelyste his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
a virgyne. Iohan the Baptyst a virgyne. Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remye
the prophete a virgyne / and angeles in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
virgyns and Innumerable there syngynge and
folowynge the lombe of god the seconde persone / 
and euer newe songes of Ioye and glorye. The
angels of heuen honoureth virgyns as theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
and systern And as it is wryten (Apocal .xix)
The angell of god wolde not suffre saynt Iohan
Euangelyste to worshyppe hym / for loue he was a
virgyne as he was and angell and man of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.
And therfore Saynt Bernarde sayth. What
is more full of beaute than is chastyte (Quid cas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titate
decorius. Que mundum de inmundo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum

saynt Cecylye / saynt Agas shewed hyr holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse / 
saynt Katheryne buryed / and delyuered from
deth Susanne. And as it is wryten Numeri .xxxi.
(Omnes feminas virgines reseruare alias omnes
iubentur interfici) That is to saye. That where
all the people sholde be destroyed and slayne for
synne / yet god almyghty commaunded to spare
virgyns. And therfore sayth saynt Ancelme (Don
est salus nisi quem tu virgo peperisti) Saynt Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garete
<pb facs="tcp:10867:4"/>
hadde the deuyll vnder hyr feete and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

ye destroye me. And in lyke wyse Saynt Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyan
bette hym and putte hym to grete rebuke / and
therfore the deuyll worshyppeth virgynyte as it is
radde in Thobye the sixte chapytre. For ryght as
the deuyll hath power of all vnclene lyuers / ryght
soo he honoureth virgyns and feereth theym by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the angelles. And therfore Saynt Iohan
Crysostomus sayth (Castitas est res angelica per
