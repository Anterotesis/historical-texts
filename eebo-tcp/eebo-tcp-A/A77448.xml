            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112693:3"/>
will and pleaſure of the King, now in the hands of moſt deſperate and pernicious Councellors.</p>
            <p>Towards the effecting whereof;</p>
            <p>There was framed a mixture and conjunction of Perſons of ſeverall qualities, ſome whereof were of both Houſes of Parliament; others of the Court and of the Citie, who were in their reſpective Places and Imployments to form and perfect this Work, raiſed out of the Aſhes of the late Petition of <hi>London</hi> for Peace.</p>
            <p>The Method obſerved by them for the Conduct and carrying on their Deſigne, was firſt for ſeverall perſons in the City, to diſpoſe of themſelves into a Committee, being thoſe who had been Principall Movers and Fomentors of that Petition.</p>
            <p>The part which this Committe was chiefly to act, was;</p>
            <p>Firſt, To hold intelligence with both Armies, Court, and Parliament.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To take a generall ſurvey of the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and numbers of perſons, within the ſeverall Wards and Pariſhes of the City and places adjacent, by the Weekly Bill of Mortality, under three Ranks; of, <hi>Right men,</hi> (or the Kings Party) of, <hi>Averſe men</hi> (or the well affected to the Parliament) of, <hi>Moderate men,</hi> (or Neutrals) as they called them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To conſider of Arms, Ammunition, and all other Proviſions of War requiſite thereunto.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Out of themſelves to appoint ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect perſons to treat with Maſter <hi>Waller</hi> and Maſter <hi>Tompkins,</hi> with relation to the Citie, Court, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112693:3"/>
Parliament, as alſo with <hi>Criſpe, Roydon, Broome</hi> and <hi>Benion,</hi> then at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Wallers</hi> part in this buſineſſe was;</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ingage a conſiderable Partie of the Lords and Commons in the Deſigne.</p>
            <p>2. To be the means of conveying all Councells, Reſolutions, and Intelligences between the ſaid party of Lords and Commons, and the Committee of the Citie.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Tompkins</hi> was not only an Aſſiſtant to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Waller</hi> in the premiſſes, but an Inſtrument to convey by <hi>Hazel,</hi> and others, the particulars of their proceedings to the Court by addreſſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the Lord <hi>Faulkland,</hi> and to receive from Court directions, Powers, and Commands, for the compleating of the work. For preventing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, Proteſtations of ſecrecy were taken by them to this effect, <hi>As they were Christians, not to diſcloſe it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>No man to indeavour the ingaging above two, whereby no one man could impeach many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The part which was acted from the Court was,</p>
            <p>1. By Maſter <hi>Herne,</hi> Maſter <hi>Alexander Hampden,</hi> and others imployed upon Meſſages from the King to the Parliament, under pretence of Treaties for Peace, to convey their directions, incouragements, and Councells unto their Partie in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To give Power and Authoritie by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the great Seal, by Warrants under the Kings Hand; and otherwiſe for ſetling of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Warre; naming of Generalls (and other Officers). Execution of Marſhall Law; Raiſing of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112693:4"/>
Moneyes, and Proviſion of Arms and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>3. For the diſpoſing of ſome part of the Kings forces at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be neer the Citie, and in ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to aſſiſt the Partie here, as cauſe ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>The ſteps and degrees to bring this into Action were.</p>
            <p>1. A Commiſſion under the great Seal brought from <hi>Oxford,</hi> about a fortnight ago, by the Lady <hi>Aubigny,</hi> with the Authorities aforeſaid, thereby inabling and commanding them by force of Arms to deſtroy, kill, and ſlay, the forces raiſed by the Parliament, and their Adherents as Traitors, and Rebels.</p>
            <p>2. Severall Propoſitions, moſt of them agreed, and reſolved by Maſter <hi>Waller,</hi> in behalf of the ſaid Partie of the Lords and Commons, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Citie, in behalf of the Partie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon them, for the more ready and orderly execution of the deſigne. As firſt, <hi>Concerning the number of men Armed.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The places where Magazines were laid, The places for Randevouz, and for retreat upon occaſion, The Colours, the Marks and Tokens for diſtinction from others, The ſtrength to be relyed on within the Walls, and without, What to be done with the Tower, Where the chief Commanders affected to the Parliament dwelt, The time of executing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. A Declaration was framed by them under
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112693:4"/>
pretence of aſſerting and maintaining the heads of the Proteſtation, thereby the better to Colour their miſchievous intentions to the people.</p>
            <p>4. A Meſſage was ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> on Saturday was fortnight to acquaint the Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> by <hi>Hazel,</hi> that the deſigne was come to good perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto which, Anſwer was returned, <hi>That they ſhould haſten it with all ſpeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particulars of the deſigne it ſelf were.</p>
            <p>1. To ſeize into their cuſtodie the Kings Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>2. To ſeize ſeverall Members of both Houſes, the Lord Major, and Committee of the <hi>Militia,</hi> under pretence of bringing them to a legall Tryall.</p>
