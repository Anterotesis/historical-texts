            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Romans 14. 20.</bibl>
               <q>For Meat deſtroy not the Work of God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>GOd hath a Work in ſome mens hearts.</hi> The mighty God, who made Heaven and Earth, and whoſe eyes run to and fro through both, he by the finger of his pure Power toucheth ſome of the hearts of the Children of men, and in the pure Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his living Spirit is found work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there. Religion, true Religion is not a matter of opinion (as men, who have not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34778:3"/>
taſted of the Power, are apt to imagine) but a <hi>New-Creation and Work of God</hi> in the heart of the creature, ſowing the Light and Life of his Spirit there, and by it working man out of the darkneſs and Death of Sin (which is the deſtruction and miſery of the Soul) into his Life and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>That this Work of God in man, is lyable to be deſtroyed.</hi> God could ſo have made man, as that he could not have fell: he could ſo have comprehended mans ſpirit in the pure Power of his Life, as that man could not have broke out of it. But it pleaſed him to make him under a Law: wherein, waiting upon and watching to the Power of Life, he might be preſerved and remain happy; but departing from it, he ſhould loſe his ſtate and ſink into miſery. God could alſo ſo redeem man, as that no Power ſhould ſtop or interrupt his Work: but it pleaſeth him alſo to hold forth <hi>a Law of Redemption;</hi> according to which, his Work of Redemption may either go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward. As man is drawn by the Spirit of God, and followeth his lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings out of the corruption, out of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, out of the earthly Nature, out of the wiſdom, reaſonings and ſpirit of this world,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34778:3"/>
ſo the work goeth forward: As man is tempted, hearkeneth unto, and is drawn back from the leadings of Gods Spirit by any of theſe; ſo the work goeth backward, and degrees of deſtruction overtake and come upon the Work of God in that heart.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>A little thing will deſtroy the Work of God in the heart.</hi> A matter of meat, eating but a little meat doubtingly, out of the Faith, (wherein is the preſervation from the deſtruction) this leads into the Sin, where death and deſtruction is ſtill met with. For in the Path of Life, in the Faith, in the Obedience to Gods Spirit, there alone is the preſervation of the Work of God: but in the unbelief, in the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the doubting (though about never ſo ſmall a matter) there is death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction met with, if the Perſon venture upon that, which it doubteth of. Thoſe who have travelled in the path of Life, I know can witneſs this. O how ſmall a thing brings a vail over the Life! What a little giving way to the reaſonings of the earthly ſpirit, about a ſmall matter, drives back the Work of God in the heart, and brings anguiſh and miſery upon the Soul, cauſing the hiding of the Light of God's Countenance,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34778:4"/>
which is the Life and Joy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Spirit. God is a great King, and all his Leadings and Teachings are weighty: and he that rebelleth, or neglecteth in the leaſt thing, muſt bear his burthen, unleſs he feel the Humiliation of his Soul, and the Remiſſion from the Spirit of the Lord, the Grace of God pittying him, and the blood of his Son waſhing him.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>No man should do that, which tendeth to deſtroy the Work of God in himſelf, or the Work of God in another.</hi> There is no ſuch thing allowable by God for any man to do (whether in Publick Government, or in any kind of Commerce or Converſation amongſt men, or in ones private courſe of walking) which tendeth to deſtroy the Work of God. The intent of Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or State, was never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Work of God in any man. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is of God, both in Church and State: but that way of Government, which deſtroyeth his work in any, is not of him, but contrary to him and againſt him. O that men could conſider, and had the ballance of Truth to weigh things in, that they might bow before the God of Truth, and not ſtrive with their Maker, about his Work in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:34778:4"/>
My Soul hath mourned, I may ſay, almoſt from my Cradle, about the eſtate of this Creation. To behold man fallen from his Glory, departed from his God, living without the ſence of him, and ſowing the Seeds of Eternal Miſery for his poor Soul (which he muſt as certainly reap, as he hath ſown, unleſs he travel the path of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the powerful leadings and guidance of God's Holy Spirit) This hath ſo broken my Heart (together with the cloſe exerciſes, which have continually attended this poor wearied Spirit) that I have often wondered, how the natural Life could be contained in the natural veſſel.</p>
            <p>I am a lover of mankind in general, and have been a deep ſufferer with, and traveller for all the miſerable. None knows the path of my Sorrows, or the extent of my Bowels, but he that made me. It is not natural or kindly to me to upbraid any man with any kind of wickedneſs, or never ſo juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved miſery, but my Bowels work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him towards the Spring of Eternal Power and Compaſſions, even as I would be pittied and repreſented to the Father of Mercies in the like Condition. Indeed I have been emptied from Veſſel to Veſſel,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34778:5"/>
and toſſed with multitudes of ſtorms and tempeſts, yet the ſavour of my life remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with me to this day, and the Spirit of my God breatheth on my heart, Bleſſed be his Holy Name for ever. And though I walk with one ſort of People, becauſe my heart ſaith (yea the Spirit of the Eternal God hath witneſſed unto me, and ſhewn me in that Light which cannot deceive, and to that eye which cannot be deceived) that they are the People whom he hath choſen, out of all the gatherings (throughout the Earth) from the Apoſtacy, to manifeſt his Power in, and his preſence among: I ſay, though I have been guided and led by the Spirit of the Lord to walk among theſe, yet am I not bounded there, either in the love or in the unity of my heart; But I have unity with the Integrity and Zeal for God which is in others, of what ſort or gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoever, and I have tender Bowels for all, even for thoſe which hate and Perſecute that, which is my life, and hath the love of my heart for ever.</p>
            <p>O how have I prayed for the loſt World! For all the Souls of man-kind, how hath my Soul bowed in unutterable breathings of Spirit before my God, and could not be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34778:5"/>
ſilenced, until he quieted my ſpirit in the Righteouſneſs and Excellency of his Will, and bid me leave it to him. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Nation and the ſeveral ſorts in it, even thoſe who ſeem moſt caſt off and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſence, yet the preciouſneſs of their Souls have I ſpread before the Lord my God with tears.</p>
            <p>And now, I have ſomewhat to ſay, in the love of my heart, and in the ſhinings of the Light of my God, to ſeveral ſorts of People, which nearly concerns them, as thoſe whoſe hearts are weighty and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (and who are not drunk up in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the ſenſual Nature, or miſ-byaſſed by pre-aſſumed Principles from the wrong ground) may eaſily perceive.</p>

               <p>Well; The Lord will open the eyes of many, and mercy towards mankind is iſſuing from his Throne, and he will smite that through and through, which maketh the Earth miſerable and deſolate of his Life. But, O that man could hear in the day of his proſperity, that adverſity might not come upon him.</p>
               <p>Wait to read theſe things in the Life from which they ſprang, and then tell me, whether there is not a cauſe for what I write.</p>

            <p>THere hath been a great Apoſtacy (ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles) from the living Power, into dead forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Devotion, where likeneſſes of truth have been ſet up, in ſtead of the Truth it ſelf. Now the Lord is gathering his true ſeed (even <hi>Iſrael</hi> his beloved off-ſpring) out of all dead forms of all kinds, into his living Truth, and into the true Spiritual Worſhip: and who is he, that ſhall be able to ſtop him herein? Let him conſider his ſtrength, who girds himſelf to the Battle againſt him: for not by might, nor by the Power of man, but by the Spirit of Life in his Called, Faithful, Choſen and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambs, will the Lord of Glory carry on his Work in the World.</p>
            <trailer>THE END.</trailer>
