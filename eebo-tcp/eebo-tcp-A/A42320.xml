            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SInce it is Your Deſire, I ſhall ſend you ſome other time the Relation of My Adventures at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and the Four Years Slavery which I endured in <hi>Barbary</hi>;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94489:3"/>
and I hope you will not repent of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſee that part of my Hiſtory, for my Imployment was under ſuch Maſters as have enabled me much for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Curioſity: But your Requeſt at preſent, is, News from the Famous City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> which I viewed before my Arrival at <hi>Athens</hi>; It is your pleaſure likewiſe that I ſend you an Account of my Remarks in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp before <hi>Candia,</hi> where I was preſent at that time. I ſhall out-do your Propoſals, and give you the particulars of the Life of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Mahomet</hi> IV. and of the Miniſtery of the Grand Viſier. It is pleaſant to me, and reaſonable, not only to ſatisfie, but exceed the deſires of a Brother, who (like you) by a thouſand good Offices in my abſence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me that the bonds of our Friendſhip are ſtraiter than the bonds of our Birth.</p>
            <p>The truth is, a Perſon of your Curioſity could not have Addreſſed himſelf more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly than to me; and, as it ſeems, you have already had ſome intimation of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in my Travels: Whilſt my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were purſuing their Affairs, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where their Commerce required, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained my Curioſity, ſometimes with Merchants, to whom I was recommended; ſometimes with mine Hoſt, and ſometimes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94489:3"/>
with our Guides, eſpecially if I found them any thing ingenious; in that caſe I brib'd them to procure me the Converſation of the moſt Conſiderable Perſons in thoſe Quarters; and where ever I came, my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to inform my ſelf of every thing.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>February</hi> 1669. I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Tunis</hi> in a Veſſel belonging to <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> call'd the St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> which Veſſel, though of <hi>Legorn,</hi> carry'd the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and was commanded by the Captain <hi>Crivellieri</hi> of the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> which as you know belongs to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Genoa: Crivellieri</hi> was a Gentleman, with ſome tincture of Learning, which is rare in his Country: He took pleaſure in my Converſation, and during my Voyage, having made ſome benefit of my Experience in Navigation, he did me a thouſand civilities; told me that the Fraight was already paid for his Ship to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> as ſoon as ſhe had unladen at <hi>Genoa</hi>; and endeavouring to oblige me to go along with him, as an inducement, he told me his Veſſel was to touch at <hi>Porto-lione</hi> a league and half from <hi>Athens,</hi> to the ſight of which place I was formerly moſt ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclin'd: But two years Service in the Wars of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and four years ſlavery in <hi>Barbary</hi> had cool'd me, and taken off much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94489:4"/>
of my rambling Fancy which indeed was the great infirmity of my Mind: I had then thoughts of repoſing it for a year or two, and to go try in my own Country whether I could not cure it by the pleaſures of a retir'd life, and applying my ſelf afreſh to my former ſtudies. However the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains propoſition ſtartled me, and rais'd no ſmall combate betwixt my Reſolution and Inclination. The ſame day we came to an anchor at <hi>Genoa,</hi> he was viſited by two <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> two <hi>Italian,</hi> and one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who came in company from <hi>Rome,</hi> where they had contracted a friendſhip, and agreed among themſelves to paſs together into <hi>Turky.</hi> They had been tempted to <hi>Genoa,</hi> upon intelligence, that our Ship was to arrive very ſuddenly, and to paſs from thence to <hi>Athens</hi>: Thoſe who had adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd them of that convenience, had told them withal, what an advantage it would be to them to make their Voyage in a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel belonging to that Republick; for ſince the Year 1665. it had been at Peace with the Port, and obtained a Priviledge of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying out its own Colours; whereas till that time She had managed her Commerce into the <hi>Levant,</hi> under the Standard of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being come on Shore, the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94489:4"/>
Captain return'd a Viſit to the Travellers, and took me along with him. I found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently that they were Learned and Curious. They had provided themſelves of a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant</hi> well enough made, and a Perſpective-Glaſs that was ſold them for one of <hi>Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius Divinus</hi> his making, who was famous in <hi>Rome</hi> for thoſe kind of things, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor with the admirable <hi>Campani.</hi> The Captain knew theſe Gentlemen were for my turn, and ſmiling upon me, put the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective-Glaſs into my hands; I eyed it a little, and looking gravely, to give my ſelf Authority, I blunder'd out two or three Optick terms, that put my Gallants into a ſurpriſe, to find a perſon of their own Learning and Curioſity in the habit of a Slave; but having deliver'd my Opinion of it to the Captain in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man and the two <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> embraced me; profeſs'd they had found a Treaſure, and would needs oblige me to go along with them into <hi>Greece:</hi> The truth is, the Languages that I ſpoke, and the Experience which I had, perſwaded them they ſhould be very happy to have me with them, and they expreſs'd their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in that point by a thouſand Careſſes, and a thouſand importunities to tempt me. It is no ſhame to me to confeſs, that the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94489:5"/>
Stock of one who had been four years a Slave, was too ſhort to defray the charge of that Voyage; and the ſudden departure of the Ship would not ſuffer me to attend till the Truſtees for my Eſtate could make me any Returns from my little Patrimony in <hi>Auvergne</hi>: But my Fellow-travellers ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd me, and all things went on very well, and very honourably for me: They were content to take my Bill for a ſumm of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which they advanc'd. Could I have diſpenc'd with my Natural Pride, I ſhould have accepted of the offer they made of bearing my whole Charge, to the very Taxes which the <hi>Turks</hi> in roguery do exact from the Chriſtians upon ſeveral unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pretences: However, I would needs have it thought I borrow'd it only, though perhaps they might have given it as well.</p>
            <p>Our Ship was of Two hundred and fifty Tun, mounted with ſixteen pieces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and ſet ſayle the 20. of <hi>March</hi> 1669. At firſt we were carried with a <hi>N. W.</hi> wind with which that very night we doubled the <hi>Cape Corſo,</hi> Coaſting along by the Shore of <hi>Corſica,</hi> with deſign to put in at <hi>Porto-Vecchio,</hi> which lies in the Gulf of <hi>Arfiano,</hi> due Eaſt of the ſaid Iſland.</p>
            <p>You ſee Sir, according to your Advice, I make uſe of Sea-term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94489:5"/>
reaches no farther than the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the <hi>Streights</hi>: You juſtifie me by an irrefragable Argument, in telling me that writing principally for my own private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in <hi>Paris,</hi> I may well uſe ſuch terms as are already familiar to them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides you are not ignorant, that unleſs it be thoſe of the <hi>Provence,</hi> all our Pilots do uſe the ſame phraſes which I make uſe of to you.</p>
            <p>Our little Troop of Travellers retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cabin appointed them by the Captain in the Stern of the Ship, to free them from the noiſe and clutter of the reſt: The <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> were call'd, one of them <hi>Bocca-negra,</hi> and the other <hi>Bianchi</hi>; the two <hi>Germans,</hi> one of them <hi>Hermerſtat,</hi> and the other <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eninghen,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans name was <hi>Drelingſton.</hi> You may imagine, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had voluntarily undertaken a Voyage to <hi>Athens,</hi> had at the leaſt ſome ſmattering of Learning. The Country is ſo poor there, there is little of profit to tempt a Man thither; nor would it indeed ſatisfie any Mans pains or expectation but a Scholars. Two of our number were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in Mathematicks and Chymiſtry, and all of us well verſed in Hiſtory, both Ancient and Modern, which was of great uſe to us in our Voyage; for having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94489:6"/>
our ſelves with certain Greek Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, we conſulted them with as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs as poſſible, to inform our ſelves of the Situations, and Models of ſeveral great Fabricks, which time had ſo perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd, that they were loſt beyond the very tradition of the Inhabitants. Our uſual pains and impatience in matters of Navigation, we ſweetned ſometimes by pleaſant and agreeable Recreations; and when we were tired with any thing that was intricate and knotty, we diverted our ſelves upon the Intereſts of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi>; For matters of State are alwayes the laſt part of the Converſation of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as well as of the entertainment of the Common People.</p>
            <p>The wind being contrary, and our Ship (with much Veering ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other) got up into the mouth of the Gulf <hi>Arſiano,</hi> our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain took his Shallop and went on Shore at <hi>Porto-Vecchio</hi>: He would not acquaint us upon what ſcore; but I underſtood ſince, it was by Expreſs Orders from the States of <hi>Genoa</hi> to ſee what they did there in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the <hi>Magnotti</hi> or <hi>Mainottes</hi> (for they are pronounc'd both wayes.) Theſe <hi>Magnotti</hi> are a People of <hi>Greece</hi> inhabiting part of that Country which belong'd anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94489:6"/>
to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>; and the only perſons of all <hi>Greece</hi> that have to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent preſerv'd themſelves a Common-wealth in ſpite of the great Power of the <hi>Turks:</hi> But of late they are grown apprehenſive leſt <hi>Candia</hi> ſhould fall into the Enemies hands, and after the taking of that Town, the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſhould addreſs himſelf to the ſubverſion of their Government: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the <hi>Magnotti</hi> have ſome thoughts of quitting their own Country, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing in the Iſle of <hi>Corſica</hi>; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they have lately ſent underhand to the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to deſire that admiſſion near <hi>Porto-Vecchio</hi> which they were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered; ſo that our Captains buſineſs on Shore was only to inform himſelf how the Commiſſioners deputed by the Republick proceeded in the diſtribution of ſuch Lands as were aſſigned them.</p>
            <p>Our Captain return'd, we ſail'd directly for <hi>Malta,</hi> and, for the diſpatching of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Affairs, remain'd at Anchor half a day within ſight of the Chief Port in that Iſland. About Evening a Shallop came on board us with an <hi>Italian</hi> and a <hi>Turk,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd, by the convenience of our Veſſel to be ſet down in ſome Iſland of the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi> or ſome Port of <hi>Morea.</hi> The <hi>Turk</hi> ſeem'd a perſon of Condition, though juſt

then coming out of Slavery. The <hi>Italian</hi> and he had both of them had relation to a Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> lately dead, who to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the Services of the <hi>Italian</hi> had given him the <hi>Turk</hi> for a Legacy. The <hi>Turk</hi> pretended to be conſiderable in his own Country, and gave ſufficient teſtimony that he had been honourably imploy'd in the Wars both of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Candia</hi>: But with all his Merit, and all his boaſting, he had not been able to ranſom himſelf, though he had ſent many Letters to his Friends; the <hi>Italian</hi> hereupon (his new Maſter) was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſelling him to a Captain who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting his Gally; but the <hi>Turk</hi> unwilling to keep longer at the Oare, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prevent it, had ſo cox'd the <hi>Italian</hi> with aſſurances of honeſty, and hopes of a good ranſom, that they came lovingly from <hi>Malta,</hi> with intention to have paſs'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Veſſel into <hi>Turky,</hi> where the Ranſom was to be readily paid, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Friendſhip to be contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. We were at that time by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident upon the Deck, and heard them give an account of their deſign; moſt of our Equipage fell a laughing, and derided the ſimplicity of the <hi>Italian,</hi> upon whom they look'd as a perſon little better than a fool. In ſhort, though in thoſe caſes little heed is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94489:7"/>
given to the ſtories of a Slave, yet they are never ſparing of their promiſes, and to get leave to go and ſolicite their Ranſoms, are never ſhort in magnifying and proteſting their own probity and gratitude. A Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary who was with us, gave us an inſtance, and told it on purpoſe that the <hi>Italian</hi> might hear it: His account was this, That he had at one time ſeven Slaves of <hi>Acrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri</hi> in <hi>Natolia</hi>; that he had been perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to truſt five of them to return into their own Country, and to go along with them to raiſe the Ranſoms of all, and that he kept the other two as Hoſtages for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Articles. They pretended that at <hi>Smirna</hi> they ſhould find Friends enough who would treat them handſomly, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with Camels and Money to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat their Journey; and yet when they came there, and all the way beyond, they had nothing to truſt to, but what they begg'd; and when at length they came to <hi>Acrioteri,</hi> all their Relations were either gone or dead, or ſo poor that they were not able to relieve them: In a word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of paying him as they had ingaged, it was once in debate to ſell their Maſter, and it was no ſmall happineſs for him that they choſe rather to give him the ſlip: He had a thouſand fears upon him (till their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94489:8"/>
Hoſtages were reſtored) that they would have ſecured him: He added alſo that at his return he uſed the two Hoſtages very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, but to no purpoſe, it neither brought the other back, nor conſtrained the two poor Creatures to ranſom themſelves.</p>
            <p>This Story quite altered the <hi>Italian,</hi> and expunged all his former ſentiments of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and Confidence. The Veſſel that brought them from <hi>Malta,</hi> was ſtill with us, attending an Anſwer to certain Letters which our Captain had received; ſo that the <hi>Italian</hi> prepared to carry his Slave back, reſolving to diſpoſe of him to ſome other perſon: This he inſinuated to the <hi>Turk,</hi> who to ſpeak truth, at that time teſtified the greatneſs of his mind; he ſeemed not at all ſurpriz'd, but having aſſerted his quality with all the modeſty in the world, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that he would have ſincerely kept his Parole; he expreſt himſelf very ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Malta,</hi> if his Maſter pleaſed. This modeſty and reſignation in him, wrought compaſſion in me; and by good fortune it came into my mind to ſpeak to my Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades of a thing which I had gathered from his Diſcourſe. This <hi>Turk</hi> had told me that he was born in a place not far from <hi>Athens,</hi> in a Country to which all of us had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to go, and indeed would have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94489:8"/>
ſuch a Perſon at a dear rate, if for nothing but his aſſiſtance during our reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there. I acquainted our friends how uſeful he might be, and adviſing them not to ſlip ſo fair an opportunity; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to buy him: It was only the hazard of ſo much money as his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom would coſt, which might be poſſibly repayd, however it would not be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, ſeeing it would give us at leaſt a fair pretence into that Country, and afford us convenience of ſeeing that ſecurely, which we would otherwiſe have done, though with more danger. We propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the <hi>Turk,</hi> not doubting but he would gladly embrace it: He finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf returning to the Galleys, and that we offering ſo honourably to redeem him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed great ſenſe of our kindneſs, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

had cheated him; He was ſenſible enough that it had hindered his return with his old Maſter, and hazarded the continuation of his ſlavery; yet he was ſo far from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, that he came to him, embraced him with both his Arms, and thanked him for being inſtrumental in delivering him from ſo rigid a Maſter, and placing him with ſuch perſons of worth: We uſed him very civilly, and I entered into a more particular friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, by reaſon of my ſmattering in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> language, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our frequent diſcourſe.

            <p>Being got up to the height of <hi>Capo-Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaro,</hi> which is South-eaſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcryed a Veſſel that gave us an alarm: We diſcovered by her Hull ſhe was a <hi>Chriſtian Frigot,</hi> but ſhe carryed the Colours o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Colours of <hi>Raguſa:</hi> We were all this while upon the Decks, no whit delighted with this kind of ſport: but the Frigot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as little deſirous to put an end to our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94489:9"/>
confuſion, put out new Colours ſtill, as the Colours of <hi>Genoa, Holland, France,</hi> and <hi>Hambourg,</hi> which laſt are very rare to be ſeen in the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas: Not long after we obſerved the Standard of <hi>Savoy,</hi> as great a rarity as the other; and after that the <hi>Pope</hi>'s, with the Arms of the Family of the <hi>Roſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glioſi,</hi> out of which his Holineſs was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. Having taken down thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, the Frigot continued ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, as we ſuppoſed, employ'd in looking out the Colours of <hi>Algier,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> which were hung up afterwards. Thus have I given you in part an Inventory of the Goods of the Pyrats, who by a new name, from an old word, are at this day called Capers, of which ſort of Cattel there is ſcarce one but is furniſhed with all ſorts of Colours; by which means the poor Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant is many times deluded, ſuffering them to come ſo near, upon an imagination they are Friends, that 'tis then too late to get off, and they are forced to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>We were not ſo taken up with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant changes, but we could obſerve the Enemy preparing all the while to attack us; and indeed we had but few of our crew that were deſirous of that. When the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got came within diſtance of twice Canon-ſhot ſhe ſlackned her Sails, to give us notice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94489:10"/>
by their Shalop, that we ſhould take down our Standard, and ſalute them with all the Guns we had in our Veſſel, otherwiſe they would ſink us to the bottom: In contempt, they ſent this Meſſage to us by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable perſons among them; yet one of them, more rational and civil than the reſt, took our Captain aſide, and told him the Frigot was commanded by a Chriſtian, but a haughty inſolent perſon who affected to make himſelf terrible, and his name you ſhall have hereafter. All his crew were drunk, it being their third day of rejoicing for two Prizes which they had taken from the <hi>Turks</hi> of a conſiderable value. Whilſt we were in this ſuſpence, the Frigot gave us two Guns with Bullet, and had like to have brought our Fore-Maſt by the Board. Their Meſſenger told us we might perceive with what kind of Perſons we had to deal; that their fingers itcht to be at us, and that whilſt they were under the fury of their debauch, it would not be diſcretion in us to provoke them. He told us likewiſe, that before he came away, they had prepared to burn our Sails, and to that end had ram'd into their great Guns Rags of Linen ſteep'd in Oyl and Strong-waters. Our Captain called a Council, and made it appear how ſenſible he was of, and how willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94489:10"/>
ſo great an affront, if we thought him in a condition to do it, but he refer'd to our advice, and was not much offended when we gave our judgments, that we were in prudence to quit our ſelves of thoſe deſperado's, though at the expence of a little Formality; and to do it with as little diſhonour as might be, we inſiſted that when we ſtruck and ſaluted them, the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got ſhould hang out either the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours; But the Meſſenger told us it was not to be expected, his power was limited; and that we muſt ſtrike either to the <hi>Hambourg</hi> or <hi>Raguſa</hi> Colours, (which were the moſt inconſiderable of them all) and to no other; and obſerving the Frigot working her ſide to us, he required us pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to ſalute the Standard of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> increaſing the injury by taking away the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of our choice, even of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible two; but the inequality of our force made our Captain conſtrain himſelf. We ſent their Shallop on Board again, and they cauſing the Banner of <hi>Raguſa</hi> to be ſet up; we Lowr'd our Top-ſails, ſaluted them with all our great Guns, and to ſatiate their ambition, if poſſible, came under their Lee, which is the baſeſt and moſt abject Formality upon the Seas. In this manner the madneſs of the Corſair brought us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94489:11"/>
with the greateſt part of the Standards belonging to the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>; but his Ceremony at parting was nothing inferiour, and one muſt have ſpent ſome time in a conſiderable Fleet to underſtand what he meant: he hung out the ſeveral Flags that are uſed to diſtinguiſh every particular Ship, according to the rank and dignity of the Officer; For having ſet up the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Standard, he repreſented an Admiral by clapping his Colours upon the Main-Maſt; taking them down there, he perſonated a Vice-Admiral by ſetting them up in his Miſne, and then the Reer-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by removing it to another: In ſhort, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, he made himſelf another Officer, by hanging out a Flame at his Main-Maſt, and at laſt, the Commander of a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, by his Cornet, and with that he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> being naturally jealous, our Captain ſuſpected there was more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in this inſolence; for my part I was not at all troubled to find there were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world that could mortifie the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſince they had a new Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of their own. They have made no great advantage of it theſe three years paſt, ſince which time they have laid aſide the <hi>French</hi>; nor has this whimſie been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94489:11"/>
of reſtoring the authority which they had formerly in thoſe Seas, where doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have been more potent than the <hi>Venetian.</hi> But how remarkable ſoever theſe paſſages are, our Phyſitian <hi>Boccane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra</hi> (who for his divertiſement kept a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of our Navigation, after the manner of a Pilot) took no notice of them in his Book, where our Captain would many times look in curioſity, but could never find any thing, but by what wind we were carryed, and how many fathom water.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 6. of <hi>April,</hi> and 18. of our Voyage, we diſcovered the Coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and by ten in the morning were got within ſight of the old Caſtle <hi>de Maina,</hi> which denominates the Canton of <hi>Brazzo di Maina.</hi> We were obliged to keep at a diſtance of two miles from the ſhore, where we came to an Anchor in fifteen fathom water, (for nearer there was no ground for greater Veſſels) the Caſtle lying to the N. W. Here we underſtood we were not above eighteen Leagues from <hi>Miſithra,</hi> which is the name at preſent of the famous City of <hi>Sparta.</hi> In a word, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> like the <hi>Turks,</hi> meaſure their way by the hour; and an hours diſtance is as much as a Footman can make in an hours time at the ordinary walk of a Horſe, which is near as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94489:12"/>
much as a <hi>French</hi> League or three Miles in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Brazzo di Maina</hi> is the Southerly part of the famous Country of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> incloſed betwixt two rows of Mountains that run into the Sea almoſt full North and South, and form the Cape of <hi>Matapan,</hi> called anciently <hi>Tenara</hi>; ſo that Weſtward the Cape makes the Gulf of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> formerly called the Gulf of <hi>Meſſena</hi>; and Eaſtward the Gulf of <hi>Colochina,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Antients the <hi>Laconick Gulf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weſtern Coaſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> begins at the Port of <hi>Calamata,</hi> which is the moſt Northerly of that Country, and runs on to the Cape <hi>de Matapan,</hi> where the Eaſtern Coaſt commences, and runs along bending inſenſibly towards the North, till at laſt it ends at <hi>Port-Rapani,</hi> the fartheſt Port in the <hi>Brazzo di Maina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Port <hi>de Calamata,</hi> and the Port <hi>de Coron</hi> lie ſeven Leagues aſunder, one of them W. N. W. the other E. S. E. But the ordinary way from <hi>Calamata</hi> to Cape <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapan</hi> is S. S. E. and about Fourteen Leagues.</p>
            <p>The Eaſtern Coaſt runs N. E. about ten Leagues from Cape <hi>Matapan</hi> to <hi>Pagana,</hi> from <hi>Pagana</hi> to <hi>Colchina</hi> it runs Eaſtward about four Leagues; from <hi>Colchina</hi> to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94489:12"/>
Point of <hi>Porto-Rapani</hi> (where the Coaſt is moſt bending) it inclines Eaſtward for about five Leagues together.</p>
            <p>It may well be ſaid that on the Weſtern Coaſt the anchoring is not ſo good as on the Eaſtern; for on the Weſtern Coaſt the Ground is falſe, and conſiſts much in banks of Sand, ſo that to Cruiſe upon that Coaſt at the diſtance of a League, it is neceſſary to have a <hi>Greek</hi> Pilot, or otherwiſe you muſt be perpetually Sounding. I could deſcribe all the Soundings, did I not fear to be troubleſom, for I have them in my Memoires as they were given me by one of the beſt Pilots in that Country. <hi>Calamata</hi> retains much of its old name <hi>Calamiae,</hi> of which <hi>Polybius</hi> makes mention. Paſſing from thence to the Cape, <hi>de Matapan,</hi> the firſt Village we came to is called <hi>Chriſto,</hi> which name was given it from a miraculous Crucifix, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> have erected in that place. The <hi>Greeks</hi> do not uſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſs'd work, and therefore this Crucifix was only painted upon Wood. <hi>Chriſto</hi> of old was called <hi>Gerenea,</hi> and was the place of the Nativity of <hi>Neſtor,</hi> whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence contributed ſo much to the taking of <hi>Troy.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94489:13"/>From <hi>Chriſto</hi> the Coaſt leads to <hi>Chiores,</hi> which is a little <hi>Chorion,</hi>

            <p>About half a League from thence lies the ſmall Village <hi>Cardamile,</hi> which has kept its name from the time of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>; it is one of the richeſt little Towns in the <hi>Brazzo di Maina,</hi> wherefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> do not call it a <hi>Chorion</hi> but a <hi>Chora,</hi>

            <p>The Banks about <hi>Cardamile</hi> are famous in memory of thoſe delicate Nymphs which came out of the Neighbouring Waters to be preſent at the Nuptials of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Son of <hi>Achilles,</hi> when he came into thoſe parts to ſolemnize his Marriage with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Village <hi>Iſtechia</hi> is not above three ſmall Leagues from <hi>Cardamile</hi> upon the Coaſt, but is not to be confounded with another large Town of the ſame Name not far from <hi>Thebes,</hi> and eminent for the great Battel <hi>Epaminondas</hi> gained there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Our <hi>French</hi>

            <p>About Canon ſhot from <hi>Iſtechia,</hi> the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rock of <hi>Pecno</hi> is to be ſeen, about a Musket ſhot diſtance in the Sea; the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents called it formerly <hi>Pephnos,</hi> and 'twas a wonder to me that they ſhould denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate an Iſland from ſo pitiful a Rock, whoſe top is no larger than the top of <hi>Mont-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr:</hi> However, in this Country it was that <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> were born. It was told us as a great wonder, That upon the top of that Rock an infinite number of Piſmires were to be ſeen; our <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> falling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to their Philoſophy, and canvaſing the cauſes of ſo unuſual a thing, the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Bocca-negra</hi> demanded of a Seaman who had been there, if the top of it was not ſandy, and what colour the Sand was of? The Seaman had no ſooner told him that it was very ſandy, and the Sand extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary white, but he cryed out, That we need trouble our ſelves no farther for a reaſon, for the whiteneſs of the Ants: That ancient Hiſtory was much to blame to have omitted ſo evident an Argument; and for our further conviction he urged the example of the Bears and Foxes which are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94489:14"/>
white, in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and thoſe Northern Countries by perpetual reflection of the Snow; concluding at laſt, that either quick tranſpiration of the little particles in the body of the Inſect, attract by their activity the colour of the Sand; or elſe the colour of the Sand does of it ſelf penetrate the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Inſect, by means of the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pecno</hi> is equidiſtant from the Port of <hi>Iſtechia,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Preſtean,</hi> which laſt is built upon the ruines of the Ancient <hi>Thalamae,</hi> a Town never very Eminent, but now moſt miſerably poor.

            <p>Upon the Coaſt betwixt <hi>Preſtean</hi> and <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilo</hi> by the Sea ſide, there is an excellent ſpring of freſh water, very well known to the <hi>Corſaires.</hi> It was formerly Conſecrated to the Moon; and not far from it was the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> remarkable for the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which by way of dream, reſolv'd all thoſe who conſulted it concerning future Events: I know not whether any thing of this Temple be remaining, as they aſſure us; but this is certain, that in the <hi>Brazzo di Maina</hi> there are the ruines and reliques of many Noble and Magnificent Buildings to be ſeen, preſerv'd as well by the valour of the Inhabitants, as the barrenneſs of the

            <p>Our Veſſel having been at anchor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours, ſent her Shallop with a white flag within Canon ſhot of the Caſtle, which is the formality uſed when Pratique or Commerce is deſired with a ſuſpected people: The Inhabitants hung out like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a white flag; and a while after two or three of their Barks came on board us: Our Captain had no mind we ſhould know his Negotiations with them, and to take off our curioſity of going a Shore, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to terrifie us with ſtories of the frequent inſolence and rudeneſs of thoſe people toward ſtrangers; but <hi>Oſman Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi</hi> aſſured us the contrary, though there were ſeveral affirm'd that he himſelf would be in as much danger as any of us: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our own inclinations, and his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence prevail'd, and he put himſelf with us into one of the Boats of the <hi>Magnotti</hi>: we landed about a hundred paces from ſome of the aforeſaid <hi>Grottos,</hi> out of which

Theſe Raſcals do lye flat upon their bellies about fifty paces from the Rode, and appearing at that diſtance like ſo many little heaps of rubbiſh, a man ſuſpects nothing, and is ſtrangely ſurpriz'd to ſee them leap up ſuddenly, and come and catch them by the coller. The <hi>Magnott</hi> who conducted us, had a little barrel of Brandy in his hand that we had given him; he proffer'd it to theſe honeſt Fellows to drink, who being much pacified thereby, each of them took two hearty gulps, and invited us very civilly into their Dens: <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chelibi</hi> encouraged us to go along, but we durſt not truſt him, and for more ſurety ſate our ſelves down upon the bank.</p>

            <p>Not many dayes before we came to an anchor in the Road of <hi>Maina,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a pleaſant accident in the Cabans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94489:19"/>
               <hi>Maina</hi> and <hi>Bytilo</hi>: Two of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notts,</hi> one of them call'd <hi>Theodoro,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Anapliottis</hi> (both great <hi>Corſaires,</hi> both married, and formerly great friends) fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out about the diviſion of a Barque which they had taken from the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged; in revenge, unknown to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the ſame time they enter'd upon a deſign of ſtealing one anothers Wives; and it ſucceeded on both ſides: They knew there was in the Road at the ſame time a <hi>Corſaire</hi> of <hi>Malta: Theodoro</hi> got the Wife of <hi>Anapliottis,</hi> and away he went with her to the Ship, but could by no means come to an agreement with the <hi>Corſaire</hi> about the Prize; for having viewed and conſidered her well, the <hi>Corſaire</hi> refuſed to give what he demanded, and told him, it was not two hours ſince he had bought another much handſomer for half the money; and that <hi>Theodoro</hi> might be ſatisfied he ſpake truth, he commanded her to be brought up; She was produc'd, and <hi>Theodoro</hi> found it was his own Wife, and that <hi>Anapliottis</hi> had been before-hand with him; He was ſtrangely ſurprized, yet thought not ſo much of reſcuing his own Wife, as preſſing the <hi>Malteſe</hi> to take the other at his own rate; that when the whole ſtory came out, (as one day it was likely it would) it might
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94489:19"/>
be known that both the good Women were ſold at the diſcretion of the Pirate, and that he might not be alone the perpetual ſubject of mockery and diſgrace: But <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliottis</hi> miſſing his Conſort, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her condition, armed out a Shallop (and <hi>Theodoro</hi> in ſpight of the quarrel join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him) they made up to him, and ſo hectored the poor Pirate, that he was forced to deliver them, or otherwiſe he muſt have ruined the reſt of his Affairs in that Country. The Husbands, by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their friends, were ſo perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, that two days after they were Cruiſing again together in the ſame Veſſel, and looking for Prize: They might have been Divorced from their Wives if they had deſired it; for nothing is more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greeks</hi>; but they were both good natured and took them again.</p>
            <p>Not far from <hi>Maina</hi> we were carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a long Cabin, in which there were two large Rooms hung with Cloaths, one ſide <hi>a la Turque,</hi> the other <hi>a la Françcois</hi>; here hung the Turbans, there the <hi>Calpas</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Bonnets; here the <hi>Sabers,</hi> there our <hi>Couteaux</hi> or ſhort Swords; here our Shoes, and there the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Chippins. This Wardrobe was the Spoils and Trophies of many victories at Sea, where ſparing no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94489:20"/>
they make all Fiſh that comes into their Net. They offered us very good peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths, and a young <hi>Piemontois</hi> of our company, called <hi>Bertaldi,</hi> bought a very fair Veſt that had been taken from a <hi>Greek</hi> Merchant of the Iſle of <hi>Engia,</hi> which is an Iſland not far from <hi>Athens</hi>: For my part I had not the courage that <hi>Bertaldi</hi> had; Cloths that are gained in that unjuſtifiable manner, are many times owned, and great miſchiefs do fall out to the buyers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are every day ſenſible of the Cunning and Courage of the <hi>Magnotti,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Veſſels with <hi>Officers</hi> and Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their Camp before <hi>Candy,</hi> many times intercepted by them. The <hi>Turks,</hi> however provoked, durſt never formally invade them, or ingage their Troops in thoſe hideous Mountains: inſtead of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right attacks, they have thought it more prudent to debauch ſome of the moſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous of the people, and make a Faction among them. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> has reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſwallowed a thouſand inſolencies from them, which they did to revenge the death of ten or twelve of their <hi>Corſairs</hi> taken in the year 1667. and impaled in <hi>Candy</hi> by his order. They have come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the night and burned his Ships under the very Canon at <hi>Canea,</hi> and got off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94489:20"/>
much difficulty; for their Veſſels are nimble ſailers, draw but little water, and will run any where, where another will ſtrike. To pacifie them, and furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the better, the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> offered them double the price for all Proviſions they will bring in; but his propoſition being rejected, he ſent a Squadron to infeſt their Coaſt under the Command of <hi>Áſſam Baba</hi> the famous <hi>Corſair</hi> and beſt Seaman the <hi>Turks</hi> have; and indeed the very man, who having committed ſo many inſufferable Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences upon ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Veſſels, gave juſt occaſion for the Complaints which our Ambaſſadors made againſt him, and was a great cauſe of the jealouſies betwixt the two Crowns. <hi>Aſſam Baba</hi> having appeared with his Squadron of four Ships before <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> hung out his White Flag; promiſed an amneſty, and propoſed to them to ſend Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to Treat with him. They ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was but a deſign, and thoſe of the <hi>Magnotti</hi> who were moſt diſpoſed for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, replyed only with their Muskets and long Guns, of which they have great ſtore. The Alarm was taken all over the Country, and they ſent in great confuſion to raiſe the third man quite thorow that <hi>Canton,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing ſeveral Rendezvouſes at <hi>Sytrè</hi> and <hi>Adrabyſta,</hi> two of their principal Villages:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94489:21"/>
In the mean time the Inhabitants of <hi>Maina</hi> carried all the beſt of their Goods to the top of their Rocks. It was a ſpectacle of ſtrange confuſion to ſee them haling their Wives and Children along thoſe terrible Precipices; and the Old and the Lame limp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along, with each of them a great bundle at their backs, and driving before them their Flocks of Goats, which is the chief wealth of that Country. But the Women came back, and were preſent at the defence of their Shore, and by an accident that I cannot omit.</p>
            <p>It hapned that a young man in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their <hi>March,</hi> overtaking one of the Women who had a Child of three days old at her breaſt, told her that her Husband had ſent him after her to enquire where ſhe had laid his Sword and Fuzil in the hurry. Tell him (replied the woman in a paſſion) that he come and look to my Goats, and my Child, and I will fetch his Arms and uſe them better than he; and thereupon having put her Child into the arms of an old woman that was next her, ſhe took her courſe directly to the Shore, and gave an Example to all the reſt, who following her unanimouſly, came and put themſelves at the head of their Militia that was already arrived at <hi>Adrabyſta,</hi> and <hi>Syrtè;</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:94489:21"/>
it fell out to be at the ſame time as <hi>Aſſam-Baba</hi> was ſending his Shallops on ſhore with Armed Men to repel them; but the cries and comminations which theſe women ſent up to Heaven; and the marks of courage and undauntedneſs which ſhe ſhowed, did exceedingly incourage the <hi>Magnotti,</hi> and made <hi>Aſſam-Baba</hi> unwilling to hazard a deſcent. The Woman who animated them in that manner was of the Houſe of <hi>Giracaris,</hi> which was the moſt ancient and moſt conſiderable Family in that Quarter. The next night ten or twelve of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notti</hi> ſwam ſecretly to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships, and cut their Cables in ſuch manner, that being daſhed together by the agitation of the Sea, they fell foul upon one another; were driven violently upon the ſhore, and ſeveral of their Men taken Priſoner, where they were plundered in ſight of the two other Ships, which, by reaſon of the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the Water durſt not attempt to relieve them. This way of infeſting of Ships is ordinary among the <hi>Magnotti,</hi> who are excellent Swimmers. The Veſſel where <hi>Aſſam-Baba</hi> was in perſon was ſaved; yet this advantage obtained againſt a man that was the very Soul of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, gave the <hi>Magnotti</hi> ſuch incouragement that they took the confidence to intrench themſelves
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94489:22"/>
regularly at <hi>Cerifo, Maina, Collocythia, Cardamile,</hi> and <hi>Sytrè</hi>; for till that time their Mountains were their refuge upon all occaſions. The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who did not think this an Enterprize worthy of his Force, betook himſelf to an Artifice: He had certain of the <hi>Magnotti</hi> Priſoners, and among the reſt one <hi>Lybiracis</hi> a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon in his own Country. He found out a way to ſeduce them, and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them, after he had loaden them with money and private inſtruction, they undertook their deſign, and by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, with their acquaintance in the <hi>Braz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> brought it about, that the greateſt parts of the Inhabitants being frighted or corrupted, conſented that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſhould build a Cittadel at <hi>Porto-Caglie,</hi> and another at <hi>Bytilo,</hi> under pretence of ſecuring the liberty of Trade; for at firſt they were unwilling to alarm them with the name of Dominion. When the two Cittadels were defenſible, the perſons whom the <hi>Turk</hi> had debauched, ſeized of all ſuch as they thought capable of oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Treaſon, and hung up five or ſix of the moſt active among them. In this the <hi>Turks</hi> gave great evidence of their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; nothing appeared to be done by their order; great formality was uſed in forming
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94489:22"/>
the proceſs againſt thoſe poor Creatures, who were condemned (forſooth) as diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the publick repoſe; and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done in the name, and by the authority of the whole body of the <hi>Magnotti.</hi> But their Eyes being opened at laſt, in ſpight of their ſubtilty, there grew to be two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions among them, one of the <hi>Giracaris,</hi> the other of the <hi>Lybiracis</hi>; and this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is the great object of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, who would fain reduce this people to a condition of deſtroying themſelves, without any Force or Invaſion from them.</p>
            <p>The Poſts which the <hi>Turks</hi> have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the <hi>Brazzo,</hi> are each of them ſecured by an <hi>Aga,</hi> with a certain number of <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> under his Command. But this new ſervitude growing inſupportable to the <hi>Magnotti,</hi> they have had thoughts of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanting into <hi>Italy</hi>; and that inclination is increaſed as oft as they ſee thoſe Cittadels, which they look upon as the firſt ſtep to their ſlavery: However, they are as yet ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute, and who can admire it in an affair of ſo tender an importance? 'Tis probable the ſucceſs at <hi>Candia</hi> will ſettle their minds, and what that will be, God only knows; If it be fatal to the <hi>Turks,</hi> they will not venture to attack them, but ſeem to diſown the Mutineers who will doubtleſs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

               </gap> the Effort the <hi>Turks</hi> will be conſtrained to make, that they may leave nothing in all <hi>Greece</hi> conſiderable enough to give them apprehenſion. The Creatures which the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> imployed among the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notti,</hi> were every day inſinuating into the people, and eſpecially the <hi>Papas,</hi> and <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> would allow them their Churches and Croſſes upon their Steeples, and publick Market places, a priviledge of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> are generally very fond; and all thoſe who are dependent of the <hi>Turk,</hi> have often endeavoured to purchaſe at no inconſiderable rate. They do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe promiſe the <hi>Magnotti</hi> exemption from the Tax upon Children, and that they ſhall pay but one half of the duty exacted in <hi>Morea,</hi> where every Male pays two Crowns a head. At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the Males pay three Crowns. On the <hi>Terra firma</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men pay nothing, but in the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> Men and Women pay equally two Crowns a piece; and all this without diminution of their other Taxes, of which I ſhall ſpeak elſewhere; all which were to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94489:23"/>
be excuſed to the <hi>Magnotti:</hi> and to inveigle them yet farther, they aſſured them that no <hi>Turk</hi> ſhall ever be permitted to live in their Country, but ſuch <hi>Janizaries</hi> as will be neceſſary for the Garriſoning their Forts.</p>
            <p>Theſe fair promiſes are the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, having the reputation of the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> word to ſecure them, who paſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them as a Man of great Sincerity and Honour; on which ſcore they ceaſe not to cry up his rare Qualities to the skies, who in our dayes has found out a way (as the <hi>Turks</hi> themſeves ſay) of diſtinguiſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with advantage from the Greateſt and Moſt Heroick Perſons of their Nation: He has as they ſay, the infallibility of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, with a peculiar Gift of keeping his Parole. Nevertheleſs among the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notti</hi> this reputation has no great influence upon ſuch as have an averſion to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who to ſupport thoſe that are tottering, do as often inculcate the reſolution of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to allow them but one Church in a Town, which is a menace that makes them commonly tremble.</p>
            <p>In a word, the moſt prudent and beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the <hi>Magnotti</hi> do intend to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant, rather than be ſubject to the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Turks</hi>; and accordingly they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94489:24"/>
have ſent to the Pope to beg admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Patrimony of the Church; and to the Great Duke into <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; but having been denied by both, they Addreſſed to the Republick of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the brutiſhneſs of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Corſica,</hi> was the more inclinable to gratifie them, upon conſideration that the barbarity of the <hi>Magnotti</hi> muſt be very great, if it out-did the rudeneſs of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicans:</hi> This is moſt certain, if the late Treaty ſucceeds, never Nations will be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matched; their intermarriages muſt needs produce Children which will be ſo many Maſter-pieces of ferocity; for, which of the <hi>Corſicans</hi> is it, that having the leaſt quarrel with another, begins not his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of hoſtility with a ſtab? and if he miſſeth, his Adverſary will be ſure of him; ſo natural to them is the ſpirit of revenge: Some of theſe <hi>Corſicans</hi> have been known upon an injury received to lye hid a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night together in the buſhes, contenting themſelves to brouze all that while upon Raiſins, ſo they did but proſper in their ambuſh.</p>
            <p>This then is the preſent condition of the laſt Common-wealth among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and if you will have the truth, the matter is not great; for were it not in ſo much

            <p>Our Captains private Affairs being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, and the <hi>Magnotts</hi> having nothing farther wherewith to detain us; we weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anchor the ſeventh of <hi>April</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Sea being ſomething calmer, and took our leaves of this rude kind of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Having left the Old Caſtle <hi>de Maina</hi> to the Eaſtward, to gain the Wind and double the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Metapan,</hi> we were forced to ſtand out to Sea, and fetch a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs

with our Ship: As we were ſteering to the South to avoid the dangerous Rock of <hi>Reneſta</hi> (which lies about a good League from the shore) we heard a great thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Canon that way towards which we were ſailing: The Soldier that was Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell upon the Scuttle could ſee nothing by reaſon of the height of the Coaſts, but we, having no maw to ingage in other mens quarrels, declin'd them, ſlackning our ſails becauſe we would not ſtraggle too far from the place where we were: But the noiſe of the Guns ceaſing, we ſail'd on to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and doubled the <hi>Cape</hi> that was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo Famous for the adventure of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to whom we are obliged for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts in Muſick, he being the firſt who taught us to ſing in Parts.

have of Deer, wild Boars and Bears. Not far off, we ſaw a vaſt number of Sea-hogs, or (if you will have them under a better title) <hi>Dolphins</hi> following our Ship, and rang'd, according to their cuſtom, two and two, a Male and a Female, and the Male always behind: They did not ſwim quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as other fiſhes do, but were ſtill leaping up and falling down again into the waters, which our Seamen interpreted an infallible prognoſtick of ill weather.

Our <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> (being full of their Learned <hi>Ideas,</hi> and lying as it were at catch for any thing that might give new light to their old Notions) propoſed to themſelves an Experiment about theſe <hi>Dolphins</hi>; they reſolved to take two or three of them with their harping-irons; (and if they took one they might take a hundred, their amity one for another, not ſuffering them to part) the deſign was to diſſect a Female, and examine the form of her belly, her breaſt, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of her <hi>Aſpera arteria,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication betwixt her lungs and her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtril; that if poſſible we might find out whether in the ſtructure and fabrick of this fiſh, there might not be ſome ſecret analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie with the Inwards of a man, to which (for want of better reaſon) we might aſcribe their kindneſs, and ſtrange inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Sex: But we diſcover'd that the inclination of Man was more powerful to them; for the <hi>Italian</hi> Marriners would not endure that we ſhould do them any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, calling them the Companions of their Voyage, and the faithful Sentinels, who by their leaping and playing upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, do give them conſtant notice of any tempeſt approaching; and by this means our Experiment was loſt.</p>

               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:94489:28"/>But the ſight of <hi>Tenara</hi> gave us another contemplation. The paſſage into Hell (if you will believe the Antients) is there, and <hi>Cerberus</hi> tyed there by <hi>Proſerpine</hi> to guard it. This is certain, on the middle of the Mountain there is a diſmal hole to be ſeen, that was formerly conſecrated to <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>: the entrance is ſo horrid, and the depth ſo immenſe, that it gave occaſion to that opinion that it went down into Hell: That it was by that <hi>Hercules</hi> deſcended, Hector'd <hi>Pluto</hi> in the midſt of his Eſtates, and in defiance of him, brought away his Three-headed Dog. 'Tis the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at this day, quite through the <hi>Brazzo di Maina,</hi> that by this hole the Devil comes out a hunting every day in the ſhape of a Hound.</p>
            <p>In this Mountain <hi>Tenara</hi> there was found formerly good Cryſtal of the Rock, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of Metals, and ſome Precious Stones; The <hi>Greeks</hi> ſay the Veins are as fruitful as ever, but that the Inhabitants conceal it, for fear it ſhould invite the <hi>Turks,</hi> and bring them ſooner into their Country.</p>
            <p>At the foot of <hi>Cape Matapan</hi> towards the N. N. E. the old Caſtle is to be ſeen; from this Caſtle the Coaſt runs two Leagues N.E. as far as the Port of <hi>Colocythia,</hi> called an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

the Port of <hi>Achilles:</hi> There the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choring is good, but not ſo good as at <hi>Porto-Caglie,</hi> a Haven about ſeven Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Cape. To enter into the Harbour at <hi>Porto-Caglie</hi> we kept to the Southward Coaſt, where we found ſixteen Fathom water: Towards the North, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Piſtol-ſhot of the Shore, great care is to be had of a Rock, which is the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous becauſe it lies almoſt juſt level with the water. Our Anchorage here is in danger of nothing but a South-Eaſt wind; The Town is large, (and in it one of the beſt Fountains in the world) it was called in former days <hi>Teuthrone,</hi> and was once a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Athenians.</hi> Here it is that the Sea makes a great Arch in the Shore, to form the Gulf of <hi>Colochina,</hi> heretofore called the Gulf of <hi>Laconia.</hi> In this manner our Veſſel ſailed on to the Southward of Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> where we were to double the Point. On the Shore from <hi>Porto-Caglie,</hi> towards the North, we found the place which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in former times the <hi>Temple of Jupiter,</hi> and two large Rivers, where the Barks did frequently ſupply themſelves with freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The River that lies Northward of the other, retains ſtill the quality of its water, which paſſed among the Ancients for the moſt pure and delicate, and leaſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

            </p>
            <p>Beyond the River, the Coaſt runs into a Point, upon which ſtands the Town of <hi>Pagana,</hi> which name though it be the moſt commonly given, it is called likewiſe <hi>Pago, Gade Pagou,</hi> or to pronounce it more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Cape de Pago</hi>; the Ancients called it the Promontory of <hi>Diana Dictynna,</hi> and the Town is built of the ruines of the old City <hi>Las</hi>; its ſcituation is eaſily known by three Mountains, <hi>Hama, Ilion,</hi> and <hi>Cuacadion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

we grew fearful of a Storm. It drove us near enough the Shore to diſcover the large and long Reeds which grow in the mouth of the <hi>Eurotas,</hi> and they put us in mind of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> who made Mats of them formerly to lie upon. This River is now called <hi>Bazili Potamo,</hi> or, the <hi>Royal River,</hi> and might be made Navigable ſeven or eight Leagues up, for there is water enough, but then it is ſo narrow there is not room to turn, and ſcarce for another Veſſel to paſs.</p>
            <p>Our apprehenſion of ill weather, made us reſolve to put in at the little Iſle of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> formerly famous by the name of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naz:</hi> But what think you did we find in a little Creek where we put in for ſhelter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the anchorage was good? We found two Veſſels, who coming the ſame road with us, and driven with the ſame wind, had put in there not above two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. You will be ſurprized when I tell you that one of thoſe Veſſels was the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Corſair</hi> who had changed his Colours upon us ſo often, and treated us ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently.

Our Captain ſent his Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop a ſhore, and in it his Mate, to ſalute the Pirate; our curioſity would needs make us accompany the Mate, where we found the Pirate very buſie; his Veſſel ſhot through and through in ſeveral places, took water in ſuch plenty, that all her Pumps (though they wrought continually) were not ſufficient to clear her: This was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſign that the <hi>Turk</hi> had defended herſelf well; but we perceived alſo that the <hi>Turk</hi> had been as ill treated, for her Tackling was in the greateſt diſorder imaginable; no Sails, no Cables, no Maſts, but every thing in moſt deſperate condition, and the relation we had of it was this. The <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giac</hi> or Governour of <hi>Modon,</hi> had ſent a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſel with Ammunition and three hundred <hi>Janizaries</hi> to the Siege of <hi>Candy.</hi> It was the misfortune of this Ship, to meet our <hi>Corſair</hi> in the ſame height of debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the ſame impatience of being at miſchief as we left him; ſo that without the leaſt ſcruple or heſitation the <hi>Corſair</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:94489:30"/>
fell to work upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> who defended herſelf very well; received and returned ſome hundreds of ſhot. But the <hi>Corſair</hi> obſerving ſtore of <hi>Janizaries</hi> upon the Deck, changed his deſign of laying her on Board as he intended, and betook himſelf to his <hi>Granado's</hi> and <hi>Boſſes</hi> (which are a ſort of Glaſs-bottles very thin and ſquare, and holding about ſix pounds of Pouder, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Her greateſt Commerce was with young Ladies, whoſe Husbands were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlain, or abſent at <hi>Candia</hi>: Among the reſt She had a particular intimacy with a very pretty one called <hi>Majunama,</hi> whoſe Husband was at that time attending the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>: About ſix months before, the good old Jew had fixt her eye on a young <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Gentleman who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to take a view of that place, and proceed afterwards in his Journey quite thorow the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Country: He was a handſom man, about eight and twenty years old, and appeared to be a perſon of Quality. The old Jew immediately had her deſigns upon him, mentioned <hi>Majunama</hi> to him, and him to <hi>Majunama,</hi> and order'd things ſo, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junama</hi> had as great curioſity to ſee him. It is moſt certain theſe practiſes are more difficult there than any where; yet it does not follow, that every thing that is difficult is impoſſible: and the greateſt obſtacles were removed by a certain dexterity the old Woman had, in diſguiſing young men in the habit of her Slaves, when ſhe had a mind to introduce them among the Ladies. The <hi>Neopolitan</hi> was timerous and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and would not be brought to ſuch an enterview but with great caution and

forecaſt. Beſides the fear of her Relations, and the unexpected return of her Husband, he conſider'd ſhe might grow weary of her Gallant, and by an effect of her penitence or inconſtancy, follow the cuſtom of moſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dames, who in like caſes, do take ſuch courſe with their Gallants, that they are never more to be heard of; a Sack, and the neighbourhood of the Sea are of great uſe to them in thoſe occaſions. He confeſſed frankly his apprehenſions to the Jew, who laughing at his fears, asked him whether he would be contented if the Ladies Father and Mother were ſent to him in hoſtage; if that would not do, he ſhould have the Governour of the Town, but at length ſhe prevailed over him ſo far that he ventured. Having been aſſured, that the Ladies do never rid themſelves but when the performance of their Gallants is not anſwerable to their undertakings, he managed his ſtock with great prudence and oeconomy, like uſurers who will generally promiſe more for the next day than they will give in the preſent: But he relapſed, and was always in his fears. After he had been eight days together locked up in his Miſtriſes Lodgings, leſt ſhe ſhould cut his throat, he declared he would be gone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all the Swords and Daggers, and even

the knives in the houſe were brought to him at night, and laid under his bolſter. <hi>Majunama</hi> offer'd in rallery, if he ſuſpected her, to lye by him with her hands and legs bound, but all that could not ſhame him into better ſecurity: The good Lady, to incourage him, gave order he ſhould have what Wine he pleaſed, though at firſt out of a principle of Religion ſhe ſcrupled to let any come into her houſe; but in ſpite of her ſcruples, he found out a way to make her drink it her ſelf: He was ſo fear-full of being poiſon'd, that he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor drink any thing but what ſhe taſted in his preſence: She muſt take the firſt ſip ſtill, or nothing could ſatifie him: In the mean time an alarm was ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad that her Husband was return'd from <hi>Candia:</hi> The <hi>Neopolitan</hi> was diſmiſſed, and he went away in ſuch a fright, that he left <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> immediately: This report was only an invention to be quit of him, and <hi>Majunama</hi> being accuſtomed, and much taken with the Society of ſtrangers, continued that Commerce by the induſtry of the officious Jew, who not long after brought her a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, whoſe brisk and airy way was quite contrary to the timidity of her <hi>Neopolitan</hi> The firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More than once he would have been kicking down the ſtairs a deaf Slave, who had not come in as ſoon as he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But this Gallant was leſs pleaſing to the Lady than the others; ſhe would have them brave, but not vain and obſtreperous: So that <hi>Majunama</hi> was not much ſorry that his Affairs called him away, and that he was obliged ſuddenly to leave her.</p>

After the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman had been a week together in her Quarters, as he was going abroad for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, word was brought that two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels were expected from <hi>Canea,</hi> and that undoubtedly if the Husband had any inclination to return, he could have no opportunity like that; That if ſo, there could be no danger in their meetings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe care was taken that notice ſhould be given of their arrival, and of the number and quality of the Paſſengers. This was his contrivance, and by it he deſigned when he pleaſed to alarm her with a report that her husband was come, and to ſee thereby what ſhift ſhe would make to diſintangle her ſelf in caſe it were true. Among all the Family of <hi>Majumana,</hi> none was ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to her ſecrets as a certain young Slave called <hi>Ketevan,</hi> who was a witty laſs, and had made all the Servants of her party ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunning, to the end that being all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices in the intrigue, it might be their common intereſt to conceal it. <hi>Ketevan</hi> was fair and young, and being taken with the <hi>bonne mine</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman; ſhe had a ſnickering after him, and pleaſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

They had many Conſultations to conſider of his Eſcape in caſe of neceſſity; and in what part of her Lodgings he might be concealed to avoid the ſudden return of her Husband. There was not a corner in the whole houſe but was examined, and the convenience and inconvenience of it thoroughly debated; at length it came into <hi>Ketevan</hi>'s head, that a <hi>Sofa</hi> in the Hall might be uſeful: (The <hi>Sofas</hi> are holes about a foot high, of a competent breadth, and covered over with Tapeſtry.)

Temple built by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and Dedicated to <hi>Pallas.</hi> We could obſerve, that the Palace had been twice as long as broad, and had Pillars round about it, which other Temples had only in their Fronts. Hereafter you may have a ſight of a draught that I took upon the place, which will give you the dimenſions exactly. Thoſe who are skill'd in Architecture, and would know the true proportions of the <hi>Dorick</hi> Order, will be able to judge whether this was the work the Moſt Famous Architect hath ſo highly commended.

            <p>Theſe <hi>Cabanes</hi> were inhabited by thoſe kind of people which are known to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> by the name of <hi>Arnautes,</hi> and to others by the name of <hi>Albanians:</hi> Part of them came Originally from the Frontiers of <hi>Macedon</hi> not far from the Towns of <hi>Apoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> and <hi>Sapoza,</hi> and part of them from <hi>Epirus</hi> towards the Mountains of <hi>Chimera.</hi> Theſe <hi>Arnautes</hi> are naturally brave, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and indefatigable, great thieves, and the ſame at Land, that the <hi>Magnotts</hi> are at Sea.

The Body was extended upon a piece of courſe cloth before the door of his Hutt, with a large Sheephook on one ſide, and a Carabine on the other, which (being their whole equipage in Peace and in War) are diſplay'd conſtantly on the ſides of the Corps upon thoſe occaſions. His Widow was not wanting with her ſhreeks and expreſſions of ſorrow; but in ſo diſmal a Tone, that they provoked more to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour than pitty: Her hair hung down looſe upon her ſhoulders, only ſome few hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls ſhe had pulled off, more in formality than any thing elſe: Her yells were ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the conſort of the whole Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, after which they intermitted for ſome time, till the eldeſt began again, and was anſwered by the reſt. The Men in their turns came up to the Corps, and every one in his degree accoſted it with ſome ſaying or other that teſtified his regret. I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, without the teſtimony of mine own ſenſes, I could not have believed a thing ſo ſottiſhly ridiculous. Why wouldſt thou dye? ſaid our Hoſt to him: what was it you wanted? the purſes of all Paſſengers were at your mercy; and if it had been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney you lookt for, they might have ſupplyed you. Another Apoſtrophiſed thus; You were a terrour to the whole world, and do
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94489:46"/>
you not think that dying ſo indiſcreetly, you have done a pleaſure to your enemies in taking from them the only cauſe of their fear? Your Wife that ſtands by you, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offended you in her life; your Children never diſputed your Commands; your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were alwayes obedient, ſo that no man being more abſolute in his Family, what was it that could provoke you to dye? And the reſt of their exaggerations being ſuitable, I was of Opinion, that they had been ſuggeſted by <hi>Oſman Chelebi,</hi> on purpoſe to entertain us: But the truth is, the <hi>Arnautes</hi> do in this manner boaſt of their Out-rages, and (which you would hardly believe) deſign them as documents and ſtimulations to their Children, who dare not be abſent from theſe excellent Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks. One of the Neighbours had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way by himſelf, and it was thus; Seeing you are dead, (ſays he) and that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is done, let me recommend it to you to deſire Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to let you into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that you may look down into Hell, and ſee how the Devils do revenge us of thoſe miſcreant <hi>Turks</hi> who have ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly treated us.

As ſoon as the body was interr'd, <hi>Oſman</hi> came up to us, and told us, That if we pleaſed he would go before the next morning, to ſee what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition his Family was in, and prepare for our reception: We conſented, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted before day with a Guide, which he ſent back for us with horſes about Noon: We mounted immediately, and paſſed on under the Conduct of our <hi>Calaous</hi> or Guide.

The Glaſs went merrily about, and the word <hi>Eskina</hi> (which is with them a Good health to you) was often repeated, and anſwered with <hi>Afietler,</hi> I thank you, Sir. <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had given private Orders, that his Wifes ſhe Slaves ſhould appear ſuddenly at a little Window that opened into the Hall. <hi>Oſman</hi> told us in our Ears, that his Wife and her Siſters had a mighty curioſity to ſee us, and it was poſſible would be peeping.

We regal'd the Ladies of the houſe, and in the name of our fraternity preſented them with a handſom Clock (that we had brought on purpoſe, if we liked our entertainment) and ſome other little things. When we took our leaves, <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> aſſured us, he would make us a viſit e're long at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi> He acquainted us that it was his reſolution to repair to <hi>Candia,</hi> and make uſe of his Friends about the <hi>Viſier</hi> to be reſtored to his Timariotſhip, which was given to another during his abſence.

               <hi>Pyraeum</hi> had formerly the glory within the compaſs of its walls to ſee ſome of the firſt Schools of Philoſophy in the world: For in that, as in other Countries, the groſs ignorance and brutality of former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges having contracted a ſtrange depravity and corruption in their Manners; in proceſs of time there came forth a ſmall number of virtuous and ingenious perſons, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to more regularity in their lives, and to diſcover what was moſt rare and obſcure in the nature of things, and for their good inclinations, and the happy progreſs they made, were called Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. I ſhall tell you once for all, You muſt not be ſurprized if you meet in this deſcription ſome ſlight and imperfect touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Ancient Philoſophy, which do ſometimes fall in naturally enough, and without any Violence or Conſtraint; and indeed we had as good never have gone to <hi>Athens,</hi> if contenting our ſelves with an Inventory of the old pieces of Marble, we ſhould have neglected that which made them ſo glorious whilſt they were united and ſtanding. Nor can I bring my ſelf to believe that men of any Curioſity or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would ever have forgiven me, ſhould I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94489:62"/>
have paſſed by ſeveral things, becauſe they were nor viſible to my eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> then having produced ſeveral Philoſophers, it was at <hi>Pyraeum</hi> that one of them called <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> undertook to ſet up a particular Sect: For ſtill as the moſt Learned among them eſtabliſhed any new Hypotheſis, thoſe of his party and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſſerted his Principles, and formed themſelves into ſeveral Sects under different appellations. <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> was the firſt of the Sect of the <hi>Cynicks.</hi> The word imports originally a Dog, from which their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not altogether abhorring, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much leſs gentle and refined than the reſt. It admits nothing of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, Logick, nor Mathematicks; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies wholly upon Morality, and that the moſt auſtere and rigid in the World. To render a man wiſe, it requires that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with an extream contempt of himſelf, and to enure him to it, the Rules preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have in them more of inſolence that inſtruction: For to decry their Vices, they reproach men with ſcandal, ſo that it is from their barking and ſnarling at every mans miſcarriages that they are called <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Crates</hi> and <hi>Hypar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> juſtifies that appellation by other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that I ſhall not mention in this place;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94489:62"/>
and it is poſſible it was given them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the place called <hi>Cynoſarges,</hi> which was a part of the Suburbs in <hi>Athens,</hi> where they ſettled themſelves after they had quitted <hi>Pyraeum.</hi>

            <p>All that is now to be ſeen of <hi>Pyraeum</hi> is only a fair Marble Statue of a Lion that gives the preſent name to that famous Port. It is placed gaping with his face towards the Sea, and as it were ready to leap into all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that come in there to anchor, <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> his Tomb was formerly not far from it.

(who gave us this account) ſeemed to be much concerned that the memory of this <hi>Johahi</hi> was almoſt loſt in that City, though in other things (perhaps leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable) not only events, but names, and other circumſtances of above 3000.

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 23. in the Morning, the firſt thing we did was to ſecure our ſelves of the

protection of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers, to whom we preſented ſeveral curioſities, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made them a Viſit our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lves: <hi>Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> would by no means be perſwaded along with us for reaſons that he kept to himſelf. For our Interpreter, we made choiſe of a <hi>Janizary,</hi> a haughty ſupercilious fellow, but one who knew every body, was well known himſelf, and ſpake <hi>Italian</hi> very well. In a word, our confidence in him was ſo great, that we refuſed <hi>Cajetas</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſta Jannis</hi> the <hi>French Dragoman,</hi> who were each of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us. The <hi>Sardar</hi> and the <hi>Cadi</hi> were not then in <hi>Athens</hi>; ſome three or four days before the <hi>Sardar</hi> was gone to one of his Country Houſes not far from <hi>Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina</hi>; We therefore addreſſed our ſelves to the <hi>Diſdar</hi> in the Caſtle, but more in curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity than duty. When a Stranger or <hi>Greek</hi> himſelf deſires to go into the Caſtle, he muſt have the conſent of the <hi>Diſdar,</hi> who ſends his Ring for their ſafe Conduct; and the Servant by whom his Ring is ſent (receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Preſent, either from <hi>Greek</hi> or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) ſhowing his Ring, the Guards ſuffer him to paſs, as we found by experience.</p>
            <p>In the time that <hi>Athens</hi> flouriſhed, the Caſtle ſtood in the middle of the Town, and was called indifferently <hi>Glaucopion,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94489:87"/>
Parthenon, Cecropia, Polis,</hi> and <hi>Acropolis,</hi> at preſent they call it <hi>Caſtro.</hi> It is ſituate upon a Mountain which the Ancients called <hi>Tritonion,</hi> becauſe dedicated to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> called formerly <hi>Tritonia,</hi> or <hi>Tritogenia.</hi> As we were making our <hi>Tower,</hi> to get up to the Caſtle, we ſaw at the top of the Rock a <hi>Caloger</hi> or <hi>Nun</hi> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who kept the door of a much frequented Church that ſtands in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the ſaid Rock: The Church is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Panagia,</hi> as being dedicated to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> we being willing to beſtow the firſt fruits of our curioſity upon it, went in, and found it very handſom, and richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned by the care of the Lady Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were come forth of the <hi>Panagia,</hi> I perſwaded our Companions to look about them more ſeriouſly, for it was thereabouts that the <hi>Grotto</hi> was, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancients was ſo Famous for the adventures betwixt <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Creuſa,</hi> Daughter of a King of <hi>Athens</hi>; which <hi>Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was afterwards by the <hi>Athenians</hi> turned into a Temple, and dedicated to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Pan:</hi> And thanks to the hardneſs of the Rock, there is the moſt entire relique of all the Monuments remaining of the Old <hi>Athens</hi>; and of this <hi>Grotto Euripides</hi> makes
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94489:88"/>
mention in two or three of his Tragedies. The hollow Rock that is near it was called <hi>Macrae Petrae,</hi> and it was admired by ſome of us (more verſt in Warlike Affairs than the reſt) that the <hi>Chriſtian Corſaires,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their many Deſigns and Enterprizes upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> never thought of making uſe of that hole as of a Mine half made to their hands for blowing up the Caſtle, which in their judgment ten or twelve Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder would eaſily and effectually have done: but this was only whiſpered among our ſelves, for the <hi>Turks</hi> are very ſhy in thoſe points, and we had our <hi>Janizaries</hi> always at our heels.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that about eighteen months ſince, a <hi>Greek</hi> of the Iſland of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> who had lived long in <hi>Athens,</hi> came privately to <hi>Daniel Juſtiniani,</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and Treaſurer-General for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Fleet, and propoſed to him the pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of <hi>Athens,</hi> which being an open Town would have been no hard matter, and for the Caſtle, he would have taken that by the hole I mentioned before; to effect this, the <hi>Candiot</hi> deſired only eight hundred Men, and three or four Field-Pieces (more for terrour than execution) with ten barrels of Powder for ſpringing the Mine. It is ſaid, that at firſt <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> rejected his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94489:88"/>
upon the ſcore, that the Plague was in <hi>Athens,</hi> and he was fearful the Troops which he imployed in that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſhould bring the Sickneſs into the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Fleet: But afterwards having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it better, he Communicated with <hi>Franciſco Cornaro,</hi> and <hi>Zorz Foſcarini,</hi> two Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> that ſerved in <hi>Candy,</hi> and all three of them reſolved to have broke it to <hi>General Moroſini,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor Cornaro</hi>; but in the very nick, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having the better againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in a Sea-fight upon the Coaſt of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> changed their minds and took other meaſures.</p>
            <p>For my own part, when I heard of this deſign, I concluded it rejected upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of difficult execution, for the Guards in the <hi>Pyrgo</hi> or Watch-Tower in <hi>Porto-Lione,</hi> are too diligent to have been ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or to have failed giving timely Alarm to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> though diſperſed up and down in the Country by reaſon of the Plague: Beſides, the diſtance betwixt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and <hi>Porto-Lione</hi> (where their deſcent muſt have been made) would have given the <hi>Athenians</hi> leaſure to have got into a body, and endangered the retreat of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> though they had come in a body of four thouſand men; and as to the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94489:89"/>
up the Caſtle by that hole in the <hi>Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> I thought it unpracticable in reſpect of the height of the Rock, which is of ſuch a nature, that the breach cannot be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for let the Rock fall which way it will, it will fall into the Mine, and leave ſuch heaps of rubbiſh as will require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mine to remove, which is not to be done without more time than is conſiſtent with thoſe ſudden attempts; in a word, the <hi>Venetians</hi> durſt not venture upon it.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Panagia</hi> we paſſed on towards the Caſtle, and nothing could be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than the way by which we went: It was made of the ruines of the old <hi>Lyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the Famous School where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught his Philoſophy. It is now level, and very pleaſant, but nothing to be ſeen of the old <hi>Palaeſtra</hi> where their Champions wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtled. Upon this flat it is, that in time of War, their new raiſed men are exerciſed, and prepared for the Field. Upon certain dayes in the year, the <hi>Athenians</hi> dine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly upon it, where they have no want of water, being ſupplyed by the ruines of an old Aquaeduct. We fell into mighty To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographical diſputes about the place where formerly ſtood that Famous Fountain call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Panopis,</hi> whoſe waters have been ſince diverted. That Fountain was called alſo
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94489:89"/>
               <hi>Diocharis,</hi> as being not far from a Gate of the City of that Name: There are ſome wooden Pipes to be ſeen, but nothing ſo big as has been mentioned by very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors. The Trees which have been planted are ſo ſhady and delightful, that it is become the common walk of the Town, and is therefore called <hi>Peripatus,</hi> and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, it was the convenience of that, which invited <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> gave him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of teaching his Diſciples as he was walking, and the name of <hi>Peripateticks</hi> to his Followers.</p>
            <p>To dilate upon their Doctrine would be ſuperfluous, ſeeing it is at this day the great Theme of our Schools: I ſhall only ſay, that their great ſtudy is to underſtand the proprieties of Nature, and the force of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes. Their Morality is pleaſant, affirming, that to arrive at the <hi>Summum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and make our lives happy in this World, our Virtue muſt be beholding to the advantages and commodities of our Bodies: <hi>Corporis commodis compleri vitam beatam putant.</hi> As to paſſions, they are ſo far from eradicating them, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them neceſſary. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> upon the flight of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught in the ſame School, and had above two thouſand Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:94489:90"/>In this <hi>Lycaeum</hi> was alſo kept the Court of the <hi>Polemark,</hi> who is the third of the nine <hi>Archontes:</hi> The firſt of the <hi>Archontes</hi> by way of excellence was called <hi>Archonte</hi>; the ſecond, King of the Sacrifices; the third <hi>Polemarque</hi>; and the ſix others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly by the name of <hi>The ſmothetes.</hi> This Tribunal in the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for ſtrangers, for in time of War the <hi>Polemarque</hi> was Captain-General of all the Forces of that Common-wealth; and in time of Peace, he was Judge in all Cauſes and Controverſies betwixt Strangers and the Inhabitants of that Town.</p>
            <p>Not far from this Tribunal ſtood a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Heros Lycus</hi> or <hi>Lycius</hi> the Son of <hi>Pandion</hi>; which Statue repreſented a Wolf, and by every Tribunal in the City there was a Statue of the ſame Figure.</p>

               </gap> Eminence, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> obſerves, are to be ſeen the ruines of the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> that Renowned and Majeſtick Court, whoſe Members are never mentioned in Hiſtory, but with great Veneration for their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Integrity and Juſtice. It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>Areopagus</hi> from <hi>Ares,</hi> a Name which the <hi>Greeks</hi> had given to <hi>Mars</hi>; and the firſt Cauſe that was ever heard in it, was an Impeachment againſt him, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94489:90"/>
ſlain one of the Sons of <hi>Neptune.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may remember how thoſe Pagans are reproached with it by <hi>Lactantius; Vos homicidam Martem conſecraſtis ut Deum, quod tamen non feciſſetis, ſi illum Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitae in Crucem ſuſtuliſſent.</hi> But <hi>Lactantius</hi> prevaricated, and did not ſay all, for this Homicide was judged by twelve of their Gods before the Court of the <hi>Areopagitae</hi> was erected. Authors do not agree upon their number; ſome will have them Thirty one, others Fifty one, and others above Five hundred, which makes it probable that in different times their number was different. All the reſt of their Magiſtrates were annual, only the <hi>Areopagitae</hi> were for life. They held their Court always in the night, and in the dark, that they might diſpatch their buſineſs with more intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and impartiality, when free from all objects that might work upon their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and diſpoſe them unjuſtly either to ſeverity or pity. But it was a general practice in all Courts for the Judges to ſit in the open air in places uncovered: Their Salaries were all equal, and paid out of the Publick Money, beſides a Fee of about Three half pence in every Cauſe. In <hi>Cicero</hi>'s time the <hi>Romans</hi> entered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among theſe <hi>Areopagitae,</hi> and referred
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94489:91"/>
ſeveral knotty and ambiguous Cauſes to their deciſion.</p>
            <p>On the left hand of the <hi>Areopagus</hi> we paſſed by a Hill exactly of the height of the Caſtle, it is called <hi>Trajans Arch,</hi> from the ruines of a Triumphal Arch which <hi>Trajan</hi> cauſed to be erected upon it: but anciently it was called <hi>Muſeon,</hi> from <hi>Muſaeus</hi> who uſed to recite his Verſes there. The Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> built there to bridle the Town; and the brave exploit of <hi>Olympiadorus,</hi> who (with twelve more) beat out the Garriſon, have made the place very memorable in Hiſtory. Some of our Fellow Travellers having taken a fancy (from the great noiſe that at this day the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> makes in that City) would needs have it that that Arch was dedicated to him, but it is a miſtake of you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve common report, which calls that Hill at this hour <hi>Trajans Arch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but one avenue to the Caſtle and that not imbelliſhed as of old with the famous Ante-Port called <hi>Propylaea,</hi> whoſe magnificent ſtructure coſt as many Talents as amounts of our money to Two Millions and ſix hundred Livers, which went very high in an age when the Salary of one of their Soveraign Judges was but 4 <hi>d. per diem.</hi> This <hi>Propylaea</hi> is at preſent nothing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94489:91"/>
but rubbiſh, yet even that ſhows it to have been noble and great. On the ſide of it there is built a place for a double Court of Guard, but the building is very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>Formerly the Keys of this Fort were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the hands of ſome conſiderable man, who notwithſtanding (by a certain diffidence in the Government) was to keep them but one day: and the perſon was choſen by lot. Afterwards it was intruſted with one of the <hi>Epiſtatae</hi> or <hi>Prytanes,</hi> of whom you ſhall hear more hereafter: Only this by the by: There were three ſort of Animals that never were admitted into this Caſtle; Dogs, becauſe of their naſtineſs; Goats, leſt they ſhould crop the branches of the ſacred Olives; and Crows, as being forbiden by <hi>Minerva.</hi> The reaſons you ſhall have afterwards.</p>
            <p>Part of the Garriſon was in Arms at the Gate, not ſo much in complement to us as to ſhow the exactneſs of their Guards, though we had ſent them a Preſent before. The whole Garriſon conſiſted of about 300 men; they would have them thought to be <hi>Janizaries,</hi> but they were but ſo many dead pays, and the Soldiers when called to their Arms, were born and bred in that Country, and far ſhort of that Martial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94489:92"/>
of which more another time. In all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories there are ſuch ſort of people which take upon them that name to make them more formidable; and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon the Frontiers where the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are inforced with <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and where there is a neceſſity of good Soldiers, theſe are looked upon as the refuſe of their <hi>Militia,</hi> and called by way of contempt <hi>Muhanat</hi> or <hi>Poultrons,</hi> as I ſaid before. In the Caſtle of <hi>Athens</hi> there are about three hundred of them; they are upon the Guard only in the day time; for as ſoon as it is night the Children of theſe <hi>Janizaries</hi> walking round within the Works, with continual ſhouts and cryes would perſwade us of their vigilance and readineſs, and eſpecially upon the arrival of any ſtrangers they are more clamourous than ordinary, to ſignifie the carefulneſs of their Parents, and ſtrike us with greater terrour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them, whilſt in truth the good men are either aſleep in their beds, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad about their buſineſs, being moſt of them Mechanicks. That part of the Wall which they call <hi>Cimonion</hi> (which is towards the South) is covered over with a kind of Herb they call <hi>Parthenon</hi> or <hi>Matricaria</hi> like our <hi>Mother-wort,</hi> of which you may ſee more in <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life of <hi>Sylla.</hi> There
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94489:92"/>
is nothing ſo much of it on the other Wall called <hi>Pelaſgicon:</hi> Theſe Walls are old and decayed, but well ſupported by Buttreſſes in ſeveral places: The <hi>Greeks</hi> are obliged to keep them in repair, and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are preſerved to them for their pains.</p>
            <p>The Artillery belonging to the Caſtle, conſiſts of twenty Pieces of Canon; their Carriages are alwayes in very good Order, and it is part of the Chriſtians Duty to keep them ſo: We made our Viſit to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi> who received us very civilly: He was a corpulent Man, well enough behaved, and had two Sons, one already in the Army in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the other preparing to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The latter was a very handſom Youth, with a great skar upon his lip, that he had got with darting of a Javelin after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and being cured by a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom which Father <hi>Simon</hi> gave him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a great kindneſs for him, and did him many good Offices to his Father; and his Father was ſo ſenſible of what he had done for his Son, that he never ſince comes that way, but he ſtops at his door, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes him in <hi>Greek</hi> with a <hi>Callimera Patera,</hi> or, <hi>Good Morrow Father,</hi> which is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed with a Viſit, and great expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of favour. He treated us with Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94489:93"/>
and Perfumes, and other kind of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which we had beſpoke by our more ſolid Preſents: His Ceremonies were not long, but they tired our whole Company, which the <hi>Diſdar</hi> perceiving, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Curioſity, and obſerving our eyes ſtill ſixt upon the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> he commanded it ſhould be opened, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Kiaia</hi> to attend us.</p>
            <p>This Temple was built by <hi>Pericles</hi> (in the place where the Old Temple was burnt by the <hi>Perſians)</hi> and all People and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were imployed in the building of it, as you may ſee in <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor. <hi>Callicrates</hi> and <hi>Ictinus</hi> were the Chief Architects, and <hi>Ictinus</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the greater reputation of the two) left us a deſcription of it in a Book which he writ expreſly, but it is loſt; and indeed the building it ſelf is little better, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time nothing conſiderable would have been left of it, had not <hi>Adrian</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed his care, and repaired it; to whom we are obliged for whatever is memorable or antique in <hi>Athens:</hi> I wiſh Poſterity may find the <hi>Turks</hi> as well inclined to preſerve them.</p>
            <p>After this Temple had for a long time been made uſe of in the worſhip of <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> turned it into a Church,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94489:93"/>
And called it <hi>Santa Sophia:</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> have turned it ſince into a <hi>Moſque.</hi> I hope one day to ſhow you a draught that I took of it, by which you will at one glance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſo much beauty and magnificence, as will attone for the reſolution I have taken of loſing no more time in deſcribing it thus, than barely in letting you know, that the Dorick Order is no where ſo excellent as there. That it is ſo Noble and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent without, that the very Sea-men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to their Perſpective-Glaſſes as far as they can ſee: That the Frontis-piece is moſt beautifull, and the <hi>Portico</hi>'s (which make the Wings) with the Figures wherewith they are adorned, do add ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to it.</p>
            <p>Upon this Frontiſpiece it was, that with great Joy and Veneration we read that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Inſcription mentioned in Scripture, <hi>To the unknown God:</hi> It is not ingraven upon the door of a little Chappel, as ſome People would have it, who do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in the <hi>Moſco</hi>'s there are neither Chappels nor Altars permitted to remain.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs you muſt not conceive that this was one of thoſe Inſcriptions which gave occaſion to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to diſcover to the <hi>Athenians</hi> that God of whom till then they had been ignorant. The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94489:94"/>
the third Century had ſet them up in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Ancient Inſcriptions which <hi>Epimenides</hi> cauſed to be ingraven on the Altars in the time of <hi>Solon,</hi> as we are told by <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi>; and <hi>Pauſanies</hi> gives us an account of the ſituation of thoſe Altars in <hi>Phalerum,</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Elis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the Statues on the out-ſide of the Temple, the beſt work is a Marble Statue of a <hi>Lion.</hi> They have all of them been in great danger of pulling down by the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion, which forbids the Image of any Animals, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſcore ſeveral of them are maimed; but at length ſome civiler than others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained their Law with more favour to the Statues, and preſerved thoſe of them which are left; and yet the kindneſs of the Officers could not have done it, had not Divine Providence Cooperated; for at our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Moſco,</hi> the firſt thing our <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary</hi> ſhew'd us, was, a Picture of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> one of her Eyes being ſhot out with a Musket bullet by a <hi>Turk</hi>: The Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (though not at all to their advantage) is commemorated by the <hi>Turks</hi> as well as by the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; the <hi>Turks</hi> aggravate it, and will tell you that the ſacriledge was puniſhed miraculouſly, the bullet rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94489:94"/>
upon the Malefactor with ſuch violence that it ſtruck out his brains; but the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> (whoſe teſtimony is looked upon as more credible) ſay only that he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt the uſe of his right Arm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued lame ever after.</p>
            <p>The building within is not ſo rich as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but it is as regular; It is but of late years that it has been diſcernable, and that was by removing the traſh wherewith it was full by reaſon of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For it ſeems the place where this Temple ſtands has had in all Ages a Power to incourage and ſpur men on to Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there being a certain kind of fatality that determines Men and Cities to peculiar Practices and Cuſtoms. The ſame Star that made <hi>Athens</hi> ſuperſtitious in times of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, that made them ſo fervently pious in times of Chriſtianity, has made them as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous under the Diſcipline of the <hi>Turks.</hi> 'Tis not above fifteen years ſince this Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> was one of the moſt Celebrated <hi>Moſquos</hi> in all <hi>Turkie</hi>; to which Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was advanced by the <hi>Dervices,</hi> which are a ſort of Religious <hi>Turks</hi>; and before the preſent Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> (Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in the Port) provoked by their frauds and colluſion in matters of Religion, had baniſhed them out of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Cogna</hi> where
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94489:95"/>
they were Originally Inſtituted, they made no reckoning even of their <hi>Dervices</hi> till they had been in Pilgrimage at the <hi>Moſque</hi> in <hi>Athens:</hi> Theſe ſort of Pilgrims had (as they thought) adorned the inſide of this Temple with pieces of Taffaty and old Scarffs which they had hung up and diſplayed in every corner. There was not any of their Devotes (for each Order has its Devotes) but faſtned to the Walls ſome little Banner or other of Red and Yellow Taffaty, and now and then of Yellow and Green, which are the Colours the <hi>Spahi</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry carry in their hands upon any ſolemn Cavalcade. Others of them who had been in Foreign Parts, would hang up ſome bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they had brought from thence; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were Artificers, when they had made any thing extraordinary, would give ſome of them to their <hi>Moſque,</hi> and hang them up againſt the Wall: but this clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Offerings is almoſt quite laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Standing ſo high as it did, it was ſtrange, me thought, to find it ſo dark; but by the wiſdom of that excellent Architect <hi>Ictinus</hi> it was contrived with very few windows, that it might with more force and ſolidity reſiſt the aſſaults of the winds, which for want of free paſſage do many times make a great noiſe in the <hi>Moſque</hi>; and the Lamps,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94489:95"/>
according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very numerous, and hanging thick with gilt wires, the wind ſtrikes them one againſt another, and makes a noiſe very unpleaſing to the ear.</p>
            <p>It is only at Prayer time theſe Lamps are lighted, and indeed they give but little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the common light of the Temple; and yet we were no ſooner entered, but we were ſuprized with a more than ordinary luſtre, refracted from two bright poliſhed Stones, placed cloſe by one another in the main wall towards the bottom of the <hi>Moſque.</hi> They ſeemed to be two large Lamps that caſt an extraordinary light, and as we advanced the light ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Their Colour was not unlike the Carbuncle, and ſome body had had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to examine them; for in one of them there is a little hole, made I ſuppoſe to that purpoſe. The jet Mirror or Looking-Glaſs in the Abbey of St. <hi>Denis</hi> is nothing ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. Their Figure is rectangular, or a long ſquare, each of them about three foot long, and a foot and a half broad. We having obſerved that the <hi>Turks</hi> which were with us looked upon them with more than uſual reſpect, had not the confidence to touch or examine them any farther leſt we ſhould have been guilty of ſome great profanation.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94489:96"/>
Beſides the <hi>Kiaia</hi> interpoſed, and we were obliged to the more formality, the <hi>Iman</hi> of the <hi>Moſque</hi> making towards us himſelf, accompanied by the <hi>Taliſmans</hi> and his <hi>Kod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias,</hi> which are one to the other in the ſame ſubordination as the Parſons, and Vicars, and Curates among us. It was no little favour which the <hi>Diſdar</hi> had done us in preparing the <hi>Iman,</hi> and diſpoſing him to be civil to us, who of himſelf was a ſevere and rigid man, having been a <hi>Kodgias</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> are ſo ſcrupulous, that if a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be taken in any of their <hi>Moſques,</hi> he has no way to get off, but either by apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie or death.</p>
            <p>Theſe Officers advancing with great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity towards us, attributed the cauſe of that light to a Miracle of their Prophet <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>; for the Religion of the <hi>Turks</hi> runs much upon Miracles, and we thought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſafe, nor indeed civil to conteſt the truth of it. The Stones being tranſparent, one of theſe two things muſt of neceſſity produce that light; either there muſt be two Lamps behind it, whoſe light is ſeen through, or elſe the two Lamps before it being placed exactly in the oppoſite Wall, dart their rays upon thoſe Stones, which rays are reflected again as from a Looking-Glaſs. We could diſcern nothing behind
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94489:96"/>
that might be the cauſe, though on the ſides of it, according to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mode, there hung great numbers of <hi>Auſtriges</hi> Eggs; ſeveral little Lamps without lights, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral little Globes of Cryſtal. Be it from which it will, it is probably deſigned to perpetuate the prodigy of that Golden Lamp which was placed there by <hi>Calima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> the famous Sculptor, who was the firſt that invented the way of piercing Stone with an Augar. This Lamp was ſupplied with Oil but once a year, though it was to keep a conſtant light night and day before the Statue of <hi>Minerva:</hi> But the Ancients (though otherwiſe ſufficiently ſuperſtitious) made no Miracle of it, ſuppoſing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the light proceeded from an occult property in the nature of the Wick, which as they thought was made of a ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combuſtible Cotton; nevertheleſs it burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not without ſmoke, for to carry it off, <hi>Calimachus</hi> had made a moſt admirable Pipe that conveyed it out at the top of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. At preſent it is quite otherwiſe: But to ſettle our thoughts: with an eager and deciſive tone, the <hi>Iman</hi> told us, that the firſt appearance of the Miracle of the two Lamps, was the very day that <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> II. turned that Temple into a <hi>Moſque.</hi> In a word, <hi>Mahomet</hi> II. is in <hi>Athens</hi> of ſo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94489:97"/>
great reputation, that they think all things extraordinary that are done either by him or for him.</p>
            <p>Before theſe two Stones there ſtands a white Marble Chair formerly imployed by the Arch-Biſhop, but now it is the place from whence the <hi>Iman</hi> diſpences his <hi>Alchoran</hi>; and in each ſide of the Chair, in the main Wall there are two Cupboards, covered with two Tables of Marble, in which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſed to put the Ornaments for their Altar. One of thoſe Cupboards has not been opened ſince the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had poſſeſſion of that Church; and the other being raſhly and audaciouſly opened not many years ſince by a <hi>Turk,</hi> there came forth ſo miſchievous and peſtilent an Air, as brought the Plague into the City, and was the occaſion of a great Mortality. This is confeſſed by the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves, and ſince that time no body has had the courage to open them.</p>
            <p>When we came out of the Temple, at a diſtance of about fifty paces, we ſaw that famous Well that is recorded as one of the Wonders in Nature; and even at this day the <hi>Athenians</hi> do eſteem it one of the greateſt Rarities of their Country. Its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſalt, and of the ſame colour with the Sea; every time the South wind blows, it
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94489:97"/>
is mightily agitated, and makes a great noiſe in the bottom of the Well.</p>
            <p>Our Fellow-Travellers being impatiently and inceſſantly addicted to Natural diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, had not found a fairer ſubject for their diſſertations. Some were of opinion that from the Sea to the Well there was ſome ſecret and ſubterraneous <hi>Meatus,</hi> into which the wind forcing it ſelf, made an ebullition, or elſe the Sea was driven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by violently up to the Well, and ſupplied it with Salt waters. Others objected that the Spring muſt be there, and proceeding upon Hydraulick Principles, concluded that the Water riſing naturally no higher than the level of its Fountain, could not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the Sea ſo high as to the top of the Caſtle Hill, but would rather have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged into the Pits in the lower Town, where yet there is not the leaſt ſemblance of any ſuch thing. But all agreed that the noiſe proceeded from the force of the wind diſperſing the vapours which the ſaltneſs of the Water exhaled, and that it was from the diſpoſition of the Sea-banks, that only a South wind could come at it.</p>
            <p>In a Country proper for Experiment, we ſhould have weighed it with Rain and Sea-water, examining how they would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and which of the three had
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94489:98"/>
fallen down to the bottom: We ſhould have tried whether Freſh-water Fiſh would have lived longer in it than Sea-Fiſh; and cauſing both of them with a gentle fire to evaporate, have ſeen which had left the moſt Salt. Had it been Winter we ſhould have tried which would have been firſt frozen. We ſhould have likewiſe obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the bottom of the Well had been Chalky, Gravelly, Turfy, Rocky, or Sandy; and perhaps have proceeded ſo far in our Curioſity, as to have taken ſome Criminal out of Priſon, and cauſing him to drink it, have ſeen whether it would have put him into a <hi>Dyſentery</hi> according to the propriety of the Sea-water.</p>
            <p>From the Caſtle Hill, we could diſcover all the Iſles in the Gulf of <hi>Engia,</hi> without the help of our Perſpectives, of which indeed we durſt not make uſe to look about as we would have done, becauſe we were very near a ſteep place that is to this day memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the precipitation of a King, and might well be a place of puniſhment to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are over-curious. It was <hi>Egeus,</hi> Father of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who threw himſelf down headlong 2905 years ſince, having from the ſame place where we ſtood, deſcried a far off at Sea, the black Sails of that Ship which brought back from <hi>Creet</hi> his Son,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94489:98"/>
whom he ſuppoſed the <hi>Minotaure</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; <hi>Plutarch</hi> gives you a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>At a ſmall diſtance upon the plain or flat of the Caſtle there is a ſmall point of a Rock with nothing about it, which probably was the place where <hi>Silenus</hi> diſpoſed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he came along with <hi>Bacchus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Caſtle: In the ſame Court there were formerly a hundred remarkable things to be ſeen, and as many more in the houſes that are now ſet apart for the entertainment of the <hi>Janizaries:</hi> Upon the Plain there were ſeveral Altars dedicated to <hi>Friendſhip, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, Integrity, Oblivion, Jupiter, Vulcan, Neptune</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi>; ſo that you may obſerve, that in old time their Altars were not alwayes within the Precincts of their Temples: Many were in the Field, and uncovered, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Sub Dio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On that ſide where the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are lodged, nothing is to be ſeen but ruines, except the <hi>Arſenal</hi> built by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Son of <hi>Lycophron,</hi> which <hi>Arſenal</hi> appears ſtill very Magnificent and Lofty, eſpecially the great Tower, which is one of the firſt things that diſcovers the Caſtle to the Ships at their entrance into the Gulf of <hi>Engia</hi>; and I have an Opinion it was upon that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94489:99"/>
Tower that the Statue of <hi>Minerva</hi> was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, which Statue was of ſuch a vaſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that from the Promontory of <hi>Sunion,</hi> the caſque and lance of it might eaſily be deſcried. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> built this <hi>Arſenal</hi> of Marble, and among the reſt of the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, there is conſtantly in readineſs a proviſion of fifty thouſand Arrows.</p>
            <p>Quite through the <hi>Janizaries</hi> Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is nothing to be ſeen but ruines of houſes, that in appearance have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been very Magnificent; but the <hi>Greeks</hi> frequenting thoſe places but ſeldom, we had not the help of Tradition to inform us where ſtood the Temples of <hi>Jupiter Tutela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, Minerva the Protectreſs, Neptune, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaura,</hi> her Siſter <hi>Pandroſa,</hi> and <hi>Victoria</hi>; as likewiſe the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Phaedra</hi> cauſed to be Erected, to acquit her ſelf of a Vow that ſhe had made for her recovery from loving <hi>Hippolytus:</hi> Theſe Famous Places, where of old ſo many Gods had Incenſe burned to them, are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and profaned with the Tobacco of the <hi>Turks,</hi> at preſent the greateſt ſmoaken in the world: I ventured among then rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of one of thoſe ruined houſes; In my life time I never ſaw ſo many <hi>Choughs</hi> as I ſaw there, which Birds are more common in <hi>Athens</hi> now than formerly, but nothing ſo conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:94489:99"/>This great demolition conſidered, I do not think you can reaſonably inquire after the Olive-Tree which ſprang up ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly in the Caſtle when <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> had their great difference about the poſſeſſion of that Country.

            <p>As we came from the Caſtle we left the ruines of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> upon our left hand, and being dinner time, we went directly to our lodging, without any farther obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the way.

               </gap> that Town for his zeal and abilities in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their Errors and Schiſm; and (not to mention any more of thoſe Reverend Fathers called thither by the providence, and for the ſervice of God) the Fathers, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Teſſier,</hi> of late years have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gloriouſly aſſerted the Catholick Cauſe, till certain <hi>Athenian</hi> Prieſts jealous of the progreſs of their doctrine, excited the raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cality againſt them, which being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the artifice of ſome Proteſtant Merchants at that time in <hi>Athens,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people beſieg'd the poor Fathers, forc'd them out of the Town, and plundered their Houſe: but they were better treated at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gropont,</hi> where, Father <hi>Richard</hi> has already brought over ſeveral Families from the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church, and preaches daily to the <hi>Bey</hi>'s Gally-Slaves which are moſt of them <hi>French.</hi>

            <p>About this time there hapned a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage to this poor Father <hi>Richard.</hi> The <hi>Baſha Caterzo-Ogli Caraman Beglerbeg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

was by accident at <hi>Thebes,</hi> and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Candy,</hi> where he was Surveyor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Works under the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> Father <hi>Richard</hi> went to make him a Viſit, and took the opportunity to beg of him a protection againſt ſome deſperate people that were exaſperated againſt him by the Prieſts of <hi>Negropont</hi>; and having obtained it as he deſired, the <hi>Baſha</hi> (a gentile well-bred man) among other diſcourſe, asked him if it was true that the Monks in <hi>France</hi> never drank Wine but in their Maſs, and ſeemed much ſatisfied with their tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: But the good Father, with a pious confidence, becoming the zeal of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, replied, If we never drank Wine but at Maſs, we ſhould never drink any, for what is drank there is tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, and ceaſing to be Wine, becomes the real blood of Chriſt the Son of God; to which with a moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> eagerneſs he added, that all opinion to the contrary was damnable. The throng of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers that were about the <hi>Baſha,</hi> would fain have rebuked the confidence of the Father; But the <hi>Baſha</hi> being more moderate than all of them, ſmiled and corrected them with this gentle anſwer: <hi>Do you not ſee he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and can ſcarce ſpeak the language of the Country where he is?

take</hi> Candy, <hi>and when we come back he will be better able to explain himſelf:</hi> and had it not been for the generoſity of the <hi>Baſha,</hi> it was not unlikely but the poor Father might have been added to the number of the Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Not far from this houſe of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> there is another where the <hi>Calogers</hi> of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delli</hi> are lodged when they come to <hi>Athens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The <hi>Sardar</hi>'s Palace is at the end of the ſame Street, and his <hi>Seraglio</hi> over againſt his Palace; all the <hi>Chelibi's</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> have every one their <hi>Seraglio</hi> over againſt their Lodgings.</p>
            <p>On the right hand towards <hi>Panagia</hi> ſtands the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> a magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but there having been formerly five or ſix Dedicated to the ſame God, we could not inform our ſelves whether this were the <hi>Encyclios,</hi> the <hi>Epopete,</hi> or the <hi>Phratrios</hi>; be it which it will, it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and ſtands at the end of the ſtreet.</p>
            <p>And this let me tell you by the by, at this day the ſtreets of <hi>Athens</hi> have no name but what they receive from ſome Church, Moſque, or Palace of ſome great Man. The <hi>Vecchiados Capitanakis</hi> (next neighbour to the Capuchins) knew not the name of the ſtreet where he lived, but called it <hi>my

Unleſs it be this ſtreet, there is none of the reſt either broad or ſtreight, and the crookedneſs and oddneſs of their turnings at this day, anſwers very much to the deſcription given of it long ſince by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caearchus</hi> the Geographer. <hi>Athenienſium urbs amaena &amp; humanitatem prae ſe ferens; at ſicca tota, neque aquis bene inſtructa, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que rectè item in plateas ſecta ob vetuſtatem: Athens is a pleaſant City, and pretends much to civility; but it is dry and ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with waters; nor are the ſtreets ſo ſtreight as they ſhould be by reaſon of their antiquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Suburbs that lye Eaſtward of <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> are full of Gardens, which run along as far as the Ancient Village called <hi>Amazonion,</hi> from the great Battel fought there betwixt <hi>Theſeus</hi> and the <hi>Amazons.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſet up a Pillar in the place, and called it <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazonia,</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:94489:103"/>
where alſo thoſe Martial Women Erected a Temple, and called it <hi>Amazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>; In the ſame place where ſtood the Gate of the Ancient City of <hi>Ithonia,</hi> which is now in the way to <hi>Phalerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Gardens lye likewiſe where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was that famous place for publick Aſſemblies, called <hi>Pnyx,</hi> in which there were frequent and great concourſes, in which many a great Orator has recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to them in an excellent harangue. About the Bench or Tribunal (which ſtood in the middle of the Court) there was a competent proportion of Ground called <hi>Periſcaeniſma,</hi> for that it was roped about to keep the Multitude off from incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Judges: The <hi>Lithos</hi> was on the ſide of it, being a high Stone upon which the Publick Cryer ſtood, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſilence: Not far from it there was a Sun-dial, and at one Corner a Temple De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Muſes: On the other ſide ſtood the Houſe where <hi>Cimon</hi> dwelt and <hi>Elpinice,</hi> from whence we paſſed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quarter called <hi>Chryſa,</hi> and famous, as being the place where the <hi>Amazons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.</p>
            <p>We returned into the City by the Gate which is hard by the Covent of Capuchins, and to ſpeak truth, we might enter as we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94489:103"/>
pleaſed, for there was not above a pane or two of Wall ſtanding together by the Gates of the City, and they pitifull things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Ancient Gates which were very magnificent; one of them, it is true, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well, but of that hereafter: As we entred into the Town, on the right hand there ſtands a Monaſtery of <hi>Calogers,</hi> whoſe Church is Governed by a particular <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>; on the other ſide of the ſtreet is a Cloiſter of Capuchins; the Cloiſter was ſhut, and leaving it on our left hand, we paſſed by the houſe of <hi>Vecchiados Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakis,</hi> where we ſaw one of his Sons, but not like to be ſo accompliſhed as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not far from it we were ſhown a little building, which the <hi>Athenians</hi> called <hi>To Phanari tou Diogenis,</hi> or <hi>Diogenes his Lanthorn:</hi> It is uſed at preſent for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Water from one of their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Ancients called it <hi>Analogaean,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was built like a Pulpit; but there being a <hi>Cupola</hi> like a Lanthorn on the top, the Common People called it <hi>Diogenes</hi> his Lanthorn, in alluſion to a capricious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his, when to upbraid the effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of thoſe Times, he took a Lanthorn at Mid-day, and pretended he was looking for a Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Pollux</hi> ſpeaking of this <hi>Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaean,</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:94489:104"/>
would perſwade us it was Erected by <hi>Diogenes</hi>; but I cannot think he intended the Philoſopher, who was not Architect enough to repair his own Tub when bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Tumult; for the <hi>Athenians</hi> were fain to ſupply him; ſo that probably <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchs</hi> Opinion is the beſt, that it was ſet up by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> a Governour of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Garriſons in <hi>Attica,</hi> who drove the <hi>Athenians</hi> out of <hi>Pyreum, Munichia, Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Sunion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence we paſſed by the houſe of the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, which ſtands at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Market-place, with the Dining-room jetting out into the ſtreet, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Pillars: There is a fair Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Wall, and under the Fountain a large watering-place.</p>
            <p>There is a Story told very confidently at the Conſuls houſe, but laught at by moſt of the <hi>Athenians:</hi> They perſwaded us that every night the Fairies came into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls Stables, dreſſed his Horſes, gave them many and terrible blows with their whips, and when they had done, led them out to water to a Fountain that is within his Court.</p>
            <p>A little above the <hi>French</hi> Conſuls Houſe towards the ſtreet called the <hi>Bazar,</hi> we ſaw the ſecond great Moſque of that City. It
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94489:104"/>
was anciently the Temple of <hi>Venus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> built by <hi>Egeus,</hi> and repaired by <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> It was famous for the Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> done by <hi>Phidias: Vulcans</hi> Temple, called at preſent the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> (and now the Archiepiſcopal Church in <hi>Athens)</hi> is not far from it; and it was ſome pleaſure to us to obſerve that their proximity agreed with what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaid of it.</p>
            <p>From this Moſque, we went to ſee the Houſe which is vulgarly called <hi>Anemoi</hi>; it was formerly the Tower of <hi>Andronicus Cyrrheſtes: Pauſanias</hi> makes no mention of it, and <hi>Meurſius</hi> confeſſes he knows not where it was; but it is hard by a noted place, of which I ſhall ſpeak largely elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. This Tower is built of Marble, in an Octangular Figure, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and upon every Angle <hi>Cyrrheſtes</hi> cauſed the Figure of that wind which blew directly upon it, to be engraven: The work in <hi>Bas-relief</hi> is incomparable; but the Triton of Braſs is down, that ſtood on the Top of the Tower, and turning freely with the wind, with a ſtick which it held in his hand, ſhew'd the place where the wind was: Nevertheleſs there is ſomething more than either <hi>Varro</hi> or <hi>Vetruvius</hi> have told us of; and that is Eight Sun-dials, upon each of the flats of the Octogone one; yet only
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94489:105"/>
ſeven of them are viſible in the ſtreet, the eighth being incloſed in a <hi>Turks</hi> houſe that is built againſt one of the Angles.</p>
            <p>And here I fancy you moſt eagerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive whether the <hi>Athenians</hi> do reckon their hours now as they did formerly, and as they reckon them in <hi>Italy,</hi> that is, by the number of four and twenty, from Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe one day, till Sun-ſet the next: To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your Curioſity, that is not now the Cuſtom. The Common People regulate their intervals by the Cryes which the <hi>Muc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins</hi> make from the top of their Moſques, at Day-break, at Noon, and at ſix a clock at Night: But the better ſort have watches from <hi>Venice,</hi> or hour-glaſſes which are very common among them.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of <hi>Vecchiados Panajotti Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valieri</hi> is right over againſt the Houſe of the winds; and the famous place I hinted before is a little higher toward the <hi>Vicus Ceramicus,</hi> and called <hi>Poecile,</hi> or <hi>Porticus varia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the <hi>Porticoes</hi> that adorn this great City, this was the moſt conſiderable, and to diſtinguiſh it from the reſt, it was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by way of Excellence <hi>the Portico</hi>; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently it was called <hi>Piſianactios.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Athens</hi> was in its Glory, the Painters of thoſe Times had repreſented with great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacie

upon the Walls of this <hi>Portico,</hi> the memorable Exploits of all the Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of this Common-wealth; and which is remembred both by the Greek and Latin Authors, the Famous Artiſt <hi>Polignotus</hi> drew one of his Maſter-pieces there, and gave it freely to the City. But if you will take the Judgement of the great Scholars, they will tell you the thing that made this <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico</hi> ſo Eminent, was the Philoſopher <hi>Zeno,</hi> who built a School there for the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> a Sect that was Inſtituted by him, and called at firſt <hi>Zenonians,</hi> till this <hi>Stoa</hi> or <hi>Portico</hi> was Erected that changed their Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And here it was that ſuſtained by the Teſtimony of Antiquity, I convinced our Camerades of the errour of Common Tradition, that at this day calls the School of <hi>Zeno</hi> a certain place without the Town, betwixt the Temple of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy</hi> upon the way to <hi>Thebes</hi> at the foot of the Mountain of St. <hi>George.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Stoicks tends principally to the ſubduction of our Paſſions, by which they affirm it poſſible to take off the ſting and affliction of grief and ſorrow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and make them unpainful.</p>
            <p>But impugning the frailties and ſoftneſs of our Inclinations, with Maximes too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and ſevere, they are reproached by the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94489:106"/>
other Sects for Dogmatizing againſt Truth, and the Experience of Senſe: <hi>Doctrina non moderata, nec mitis, ſed paulo aſperior, &amp; durior quàm aut veritas, aut Natura pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatur:</hi> maintaining that a Wiſe Man is not ſuſceptible of Adverſity, and that Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are neceſſary for the exerciſe and tryal of our Vertue, which without agitation would languiſh and relax. They place in themſelves the Principle of the higheſt Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, affirming, that the Soveraign Good has no need of Forreign Acquiſition, if it had, it would be ſubject to Fortune; ſo that the greateſt diſgrace or diſhonour that could befall another man, ought not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or make the leaſt impreſſion upon a <hi>Stoick,</hi> becauſe all that is good or neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is within him, as Temperance, Prudence, Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They do confeſs themſelves ſubject to, and ſenſible of misfortunes; but then they maſter and ſubdue them, and though their humanity will not ſuffer them to be totally exempt, yet they are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to them; adding that their Doctrine, though charged with auſterity and rigour, is worthy and ſuitable to the courage and magnanimity of a Man; whereas the ſoft and tender maximes of other Sects are only proper for the delicacy of a Woman: In ſhort, they affirm, that the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94489:106"/>
the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and the other Sects of Philoſophers is as great as the difference betwixt Man and Woman, the one being Created for Command, and the other for Obedience.</p>
            <p>The Learned diſſertations of theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, though they denominated this <hi>Portico, Porticus ſapiens,</hi> were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſecure it from the publick diverſions, for <hi>Apuleus</hi> obſerves, that hither the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> did uſually come to behold their Vaulters, and perſons of Activity; and at this day theſe ſort of Spectacles are exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the People in their Feſtivals of the <hi>Bayram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Portico</hi> put an end to our walk that way, for you cannot imagine that we would ſpend much time in contemplating places that were utterly void, though formerly there had been many Curioſities in them, nor trouble our ſelves with the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every particular relique. It would have been the ready way to have drawn all the raſcality after us, who followed us up and down, and perhaps would not have let us eſcape with a bare deriſion: To prevent it, rather than to make one tedious walk of it, we choſe to come again two or three times, that they might not think us ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and affected.</p>

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:94489:107"/>The next night being fair and ſerene, we imployed a good part of it in Aſtronomical Obſervation. We took the height of three ſeveral Stars as they were to paſs the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of <hi>Azimech, Zubana Gienoubi,</hi> and <hi>Antares:</hi> We rectified their Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude by the Table of their peculiar Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and found their Declinations by their Spherical Triangles; <hi>Zubana Gienoubi</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Province I will give you my Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Its Longitude anſwers to 10 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and 30 Minutes of <hi>Scorpio:</hi> Its Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is Septentrional, and is but of 26 Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes: Its declination Meridional is of 14 Degrees and 37 Minutes, and its Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Elevation 37 Degrees and 42 Minutes, and adding that height to its Declination, there remained 52 Degrees and 19 Minutes for the Elevation of the Equator, whoſe Complement (that is to ſay, 37 Degrees and 41 Minutes) is the height of the Pole at <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt of their Obſervations accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with mine, and we found all the three Stars without the limits of refraction; and the Moon not riſing till midnight, her light gave us no impediment. The exact time of my Obſervation was about 25 Minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Midnight, which agreed not only with our watches, but with the Obſervations the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94489:107"/>
reſt made the following days about the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Sun, which was in 4 degrees and 16 minutes of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and its right aſcenſion in 31 degrees and 59 minutes; and my Star being 218 degrees 15 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, determined the moment of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <p>The 24. of <hi>April</hi> in the morning we went to hear Maſs of Father <hi>Simon de Compiegne,</hi> at the Covent of <hi>Capucins</hi> who were then <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Father <hi>Barnaby,</hi> whoſe Reſidence is at <hi>Napoli de Romania,</hi> is Preſident of that fraternity: Father <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> lived in a ſmall houſe of Marble, though little, yet very good building: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meurſius</hi> nor any other ancient Authour has taken notice of it, though it be called by the Common people indifferently, <hi>To Phanari tou Demoſthenis,</hi> and <hi>To Palati tou Demoſthenis,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Lanthorn, and ſometimes his Palace. The <hi>Athenians</hi> never mention him, but they ſpeak of (what <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) the thickneſs of his Tongue that hindered the grace and liberty of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation; and as they tell us, there it was that he made uſe of his pebbles to help his imperfection. The workmanſhip of this <hi>Phanari</hi> is excellent.</p>
            <p>This Houſe Father <hi>Simon</hi> bought of a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94489:108"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> for a hundred and fifty Crowns, but a while after the <hi>Greek</hi> would have put a trick upon him, pretending that he had ſince been informed he could not by the cuſtom of <hi>Athens</hi> put a Stranger into the poſſeſſion of any Antiquity, leſt the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould demoliſh it: The Father replied, as he might very well, That he was no Stranger, and in effect he had been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Citizen of <hi>Athens,</hi> and got Letters of Infranchiſment to obviate ſuch kind of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; however the buſineſs was brought to a hearing before the <hi>Vecchiados,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the poor <hi>Capuchin,</hi> but appealing to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> it was confirmed to him upon condition he ſhould not impair it, and that he ſhould ſhow it to any man who had the curioſity to ſee it, which ſhows the eſteem they ſtill have of their antiquities in that Town: and the poor Father was ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſoblige them, and ſo careful to gain their good will by any reaſonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, that he removed his Altar and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory into a low Parlour within the ſaid <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this ceremony and reſpect that he ſhewed to the <hi>Athenians</hi> did not hinder, but that at firſt he was treated with the ſame inſolence that had been uſed to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> there; for the <hi>Capuchin</hi> being ſettled in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94489:108"/>
his houſe juſt about the time that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had baniſhed the <hi>Dervices</hi> out of all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Boys in <hi>Athens,</hi> who had been uſed to thoſe <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> (ſuppoſing the poor <hi>Capuchin</hi> had been one of them in diſguiſe, that would not ſubmit to the <hi>Grand Viſiers</hi> order) flocked about him in the Streets, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>a Dervice, a Dervice,</hi> had like to have ſtoned him to death. But the graver ſort of <hi>Athenians,</hi> nay the <hi>Turks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and particularly the <hi>Diſdar,</hi> reſcu'd him from their outrage, which he gratified abundantly by his care of their Children afterwards; teaching them to Read, Write, caſt Accompt, and ſpeak <hi>Italian</hi>; and which was much more, he taught them their Catechiſm according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> being tranſlated into the vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> and Printed at <hi>Venice:</hi> and though in it the Errors of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church were formally condemned, their Parents regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not, nor took notice of the diſſuaſion of their Archbiſhop who was highly againſt it. Nay they proceeded ſo far to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that according to their cuſtom the Apoſtles Creed, as received among us, was put in meaſure and ſet to their Muſick, in ſo much that we heard them ſing it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the Streets; and this may very
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94489:109"/>
well be attributed to the diligence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation of the ſaid Father, who by his Piety, and a certain affability peculiar to that Order, wrought himſelf ſo happily into their affections, that both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> invited him frequently to their Houſes, with ſo great an opinion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his life, that during his Viſits they never ſent away either their Wive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Chapel of this Monaſtery there was a Pew and a Stool to kneel upon for the <hi>Conſul Chaſtagner</hi>; Monſieur <hi>Giraud</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Conſul</hi> had only a little Seat in a Corner. Father <hi>Simon</hi> paſſed only for the <hi>French Conſul</hi>'s Chaplain, that thereby he might oblige the King's Miniſters, and ingage them to favour the progreſs of his <hi>Miſſion</hi>; and he ſucceeded ſo well, that it is there only that <hi>Chaſtagner</hi> appears in his character, and ſhows himſelf with all the Formalities of his <hi>Conſulſhip</hi>; and this he did effectually ſome three or four years ſince to a Deputy from <hi>Genoa,</hi> who came to <hi>Athens</hi> to ſettle a <hi>Conſul</hi> there. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty was of the Houſe of <hi>Doria</hi> (a great Family as you know) and looked upon himſelf as a Prince: The truth is, he had a very good train, which followed always in good order when he went abroad to ſee the antiquities of the Town, and that kind of Oſtentation goes a great way with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy. He gave and received Viſits from all the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers: <hi>Chaſtagner</hi> in his turn went to pay his reſpects, and expecting that <hi>Doria</hi> would have given him the <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teüil,</hi> he was nettled to find that honour omitted to a <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>France: Chaſtagner</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:94489:110"/>
reſented it highly, and watched an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of returning his kindneſs, with which in a ſhort time the <hi>Genois</hi> themſelves preſented him. <hi>Doria</hi> ſent one morning very early to Father <hi>Simon,</hi> to deſire he would be ready to ſay Maſs to him preciſely at Eight a Clock. The Father, as Chaplain to the <hi>French Conſul,</hi> was obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Chaſtagner,</hi> and to know whether he would be preſent. <hi>Chaſtagner</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was at the requeſt of <hi>Doria,</hi> thought that a fit time to be revenged, and ſent word he would be there, and Father <hi>Simon</hi> ſhould attend him. The Clock ſtruck Twelve and no <hi>Chaſtagner</hi>; during which time the <hi>Genois</hi> continued in very great impatience: at length in a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion they perceived ſix <hi>Janizaries</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-breaſt with their Truncheons in their hands; the Interpreter <hi>Baptiſta Jannis</hi> followed them, after whom came ten or twelve <hi>French</hi> Merchants, and ſome of the <hi>Vecchiados</hi> who were friends to our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>; laſt of all with his train or Attendants came the <hi>Conſul</hi> himſelf in a Red Sattin Gown lined with a rich Fur, and entering ſternly (without ſaluting of any body) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Pew that was covered with Tapeſtry wrought with the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> he fell to his Prayers. Monſieur <hi>Giraud</hi> was ſo
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94489:110"/>
civil as to give <hi>Doria</hi> his Pew; when Maſs was done, Father <hi>Simon</hi> according to his uſual cuſtom made a little harangue; at that time it hapned to be in <hi>Italian,</hi> and addreſſing himſelf firſt to his own <hi>Conſul,</hi> he gave him the Title of <hi>Illuſtriſſimo Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore,</hi> and paid him ſome little Complement, after which he faced about, and addreſſed himſelf very emphatically to the Prince. <hi>Chaſtagner</hi> pretended to be ſurprized, and that he had neither ſeen <hi>Doria</hi> nor his Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; and turning ſhort, ſaluted him, and offered him place in his Pew, but without any precedence; the Prince refuſed his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and went out of the Church before the laſt Goſpel was done.</p>

            <p>OUR <hi>Janizary</hi> went out with us in the afternoon, but in the morning he was abſent, in order as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to provide entertainment for us
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94489:112"/>
after dinner: I told you before, he was an ingenious perſon, and having found our humours to be inquiſitive and generous, he ſtudied all ways of gratifying them. We left the <hi>Bazar</hi> on the left hand, and croſs'd the <hi>Ceramick</hi> Street without any remarks; and being got as far as the Temple of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> which is in the way to the Academy, and one of the laſt houſes in the Town, our <hi>Janizary</hi> propoſed to us to go ſee a <hi>Greek</hi> of his acquaintance who was a <hi>Dida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcalos</hi> or School-Maſter: We deſired no better, and were upon thorns till we were with him, but alas, how were we diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, (who expected nothing but the ſublime notions of <hi>Plato, Zeno,</hi> and <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,)</hi> when the <hi>Janizary</hi> told us he was a mechanick; how were we ſurprized to conſider a man of that quality ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the place of ſuch excellent perſons. We found about thirty young Lads ſitting upon Benches, and their Maſter at the head of them teaching them to read; he roſe up when we came in, and received us very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, in which, to give them their due, that Nation is not ſparing. The <hi>Janizary</hi> deſired him to go on with his Boys, and give us the liberty of ſeeing his method, which was pretty, and much beyond ours; the Maſter cauſing the whole <hi>Claſſis</hi> to read
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94489:112"/>
at a time without confuſion, every Scholar being obliged to attention, and to mind what his next neighbour reads: They had each of them the ſame Authour in their hand, and for example, if he had thirty Scholars, he choſe out ſome continued Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and gave them but thirty words to read; the firſt Boy reading the firſt word, the ſecond Boy the ſecond word, the third Boy the third, and ſo on. If they read roundly and right, he gave them thirty words more. But if any of the Boys were out or imperfect, he was corrected by the next who was always very exact in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and he his neighbour, till the whole number of words were read: So that the thirty Scholars lying all of them at catch, and ready to take advantage of any defect in their neighbour, ſtimulated by an ambition of being thought the beſt Scholar, every one's Leſſon was the Leſſon of all; and happy was he that could ſay it the beſt. To obviate any of the Scholars in eluding that order by preparing himſelf for any ſingle word; their places were changed, and he who at one reading was in the firſt place, was removed a good diſtance in the next. Thus one Leſſon was enough for a whole Form how numerous ſoever, and which was very convenient for the Maſter, the Boys
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94489:113"/>
were not conſtrained to come to him one after another, for every one was a Maſter to his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing we had a mind to be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, our <hi>Janizary</hi> was ſo civil as to leave us to our ſelves, pretending ſome little affairs of his own, but with promiſe to return in a very ſhort time.</p>
            <p>The Civility of the <hi>Didaſcalos</hi> was ſo great, that he would not ſuffer us to refuſe a Collation that he offered; and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate us the better, he conveyed us into his Chamber, from whence he had careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed his Wife to a Neighbours houſe, by an effect of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Jealouſie: But he ſent for two <hi>Calogers</hi> of his acquaintance to entertain us in her ſtead. They were reputed two of the graveſt men of the Town, and our Landlord had enlarged much upon their parts. Our firſt diſh was <hi>Botargo</hi> of <hi>Larta,</hi> which is a kind of Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage made up with eggs and the belly of a Fiſh they call <hi>Cephale,</hi> and we a Pollard; it is an excellent <hi>Ragouſt,</hi> and nothing in the world better to drink withall. The beſt <hi>Botargo</hi> is made at <hi>Larta,</hi> which is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Town of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> betwixt <hi>Epirm</hi> and <hi>Acarnania</hi>; after our <hi>Botargo,</hi> came is a diſh of incomparable dry'd Neats Tongues brought from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> than which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:94489:113"/>
no place affords better. Our minds were fixt upon our Antiquities, and we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to be gone, nevertheleſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance we were glad to feed, or at leaſt to pretend to it. The <hi>Calogers</hi> eat nothing, for you muſt know, they never eat fleſh: The Wine was better than ordinary, for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in <hi>Athens</hi> it is blackiſh and not fine, which is their own fault, for their Wine would be good enough, if when they preſs their Grapes they did not put in ſo much water: the beſt Wine in theſe Parts is the Wine of <hi>Lepanthe.</hi> On the South-ſide of the Houſe where we were, and as it were juſt under the window, there was a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed Vineyard pitifully managed, though the ſtocks of the Vines were thick and well grown enough to have invited the <hi>Dida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcalos</hi> to more care, and better cultivation; and when he told us the Wine that we drank came out of ſuch another Vineyard, I could not forbear rebuking his negligence in not improving of that: One of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,</hi> and he that the <hi>Didaſcalos</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended (for the greater Conjurer of the two) replyed in <hi>Italian,</hi> which he ſpake very well, that the ground indeed was very good, and would produce very good Grapes, but they might hang 10000 Years before the Wine would be fit to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94489:114"/>
drink. We ſtared one upon another to hear him talk at that rate, and thought it odd and ridiculous, eſpecially coming from an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and one who had been mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified ſo highly. We proceeded afterwards to their Bread, and found fault it was no better made: The <hi>Didaſcalos</hi> told us the fault was in their Mills, and that at preſent the River <hi>Illiſus</hi> was parted into ſo many cuts, that there was not water enough to grind the Corn. And why then, ſaid <hi>Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlington,</hi> do you not make uſe of Wind-Mills? Why, ſaid the <hi>Caloger</hi> very gravely, we cauſed five or ſix to be ſet up in a large Vale hard by, and ſcarce any of them was ſerviceable: That Anſwer me thought cleared the point, and quite took away my Opinion of thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi>; we could not forbear blurting to one another, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in Latin againſt the ignorance of the preſent <hi>Greeks:</hi> They in the mean time kept their countenance, and looked very demurely; we thought them affected, and that by their looks they had been highly pleaſed at what they had ſaid, and we laughed at them the more: The School-Maſter ſmiled, and ſaid not a word.

I will not ſwear, that with your skill in the Latin Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſh you ever heard this Story that I ſhall tell you; <hi>George Gemiſto</hi> was a Platoniſt, <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Trapezund</hi> a Peripatetick: theſe two Sects were formely in great emulation, and perhaps are none of the beſt friends at

this day; <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Trapezund</hi> writ againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> and I queſtion not but ſome of his works falling into your hands has been the occaſion that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has been of late received into your Schools. Come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> come to <hi>Sinopi</hi> a Famous Port in the Black Sea, and you will find Profeſſors in Philoſophy that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you ſeven years together. My modeſty will not ſuffer me to ſpeak of thoſe in <hi>Athens</hi>; In thoſe three there are publick Schools for the teaching of thoſe Notions; but in the reſt of the Towns of <hi>Greece,</hi> we have no Science but what teaches us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this world, and preparation for the next. Our Philoſophy teaches us to deteſt Sin, and our Theology to Pray. The great Apoſtle, to whom this Town is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for its Converſion, inſinuates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and that is the main drift and ſcope of his Epiſtles to us. For you, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, what fruit is there of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Eloquence? of the confuſed tumult in your Schools? of the vain and obſtinate conteſts of your Doctors, your chimerical diſſertations upon what you call Criticiſms, and we nothing but fooleries? Your great queſtions in Philoſophy are rather ſubtilties and curioſities, than matters of uſe; in a word, meer Metaphyſical reflections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond,

if not contrary to natural experience, ſerving rather to perplex and obumbrate, than to illuſtrate the Truth, whilſt the ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties of your Great Colledge are either the cauſe or ſupport of New Hereſies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Sects, monſtrous Opinions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies, Civil Wars, and corruption in matters of Juſtïce. Since <hi>Plato</hi> was reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> received into your Schools, how many of your Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have there been, who would make the Peripatetical Doctrine the foundation of their Chriſtianity, declining the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scripture, and not only doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but queſtioning and diſputing <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> with great ardency whether there be a God or not? You will ask perhaps, have not we the ſame difference and reſpect for theſe Philoſophers? No, they were our own Countrey-men, and taught publickly here; yet when Reaſon diſſents, we are the firſt in the Liſts againſt them. And having ſpoken thus freely of our exerciſes in Peace, let us now ſee how we can match you in enterprizes of War: We will not look back to former Ages, in that Oaſe you have little to pretend; but it is not above 464 years ſince we defeated one of your moſt Conſiderable Fleets at the Mouth of the <hi>Strymon,</hi> which is a River in <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>

Your Arms had never any advantage over the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but at the taking of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and even that was done by fraud and impiety; for the Army which your Allies aſſembled (about 15 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defeat at <hi>Strymon</hi>) for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Zara</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> inſtead of reducing <hi>Paleſtine</hi> as was declared, changed their deſign, and undertook the Enterprize againſt <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and thereby betraying and falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oath of the <hi>Croiſade,</hi> and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Charity of thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who had ſo bountifully ſupplied them, they Marched unexpectedly againſt <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> ſurprized it contrary to their publick Profeſſion, and the pious hopes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the good people of your Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; afterwards you ſet up two or three Emperours, of which one paid his head to expiate his Uſurpation. When firſt our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire became ſenſible of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, had you conſulted either your own Intereſt or Religion, you would have joined your Forces with ours, and endeavoured to have ſtopped in the ſource an evil that muſt needs draw ſuch ill conſequences upon your ſelves.

The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Archbiſhop being proſcribed, his Leſſons are only exhortations to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; both of them read in their own Houſes, without any Salary but what comes from the good will of the Scholars: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maskinos</hi> and <hi>Beninzellos</hi> have not never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs been ſo ſucceſsful in Scholaſtick

points, and criticiſms of Divinity, as in matters of Philoſophy; yet there is no ſtranger comes near them at expounding the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers. At length we took our leaves both of our <hi>Didaſcalos</hi> and <hi>Calogers,</hi> we parted with great friendſhip, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed our <hi>Janizary</hi> who was returned, and tempted us away.</p>
            <p>He conducted us towards the <hi>Dypilon,</hi> which was the only Gate remaining of the old City. There were three Gates one within another, great, well built, curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, and deſerved to be reckoned among the beſt Antiquities in <hi>Athens. Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides, Polybius, Plutarch,</hi> and all the ancient Hiſtorians have mentioned them, but none of them more particularly than <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> who ſpeaking of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> has this paſſage, <hi>Ad Dypilon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit, porta ea velut in ore <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis poſita, major aliquantò, patentior<expan>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucian</hi> tells us that there ſtood formerly the Tomb of the Phyſician <hi>Toxaris,</hi> who among the <hi>Athenians</hi> was in great venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94489:121"/>
and often invoked by them upon any violent Feaver; and he ventures upon the very place, aſſuring us it ſtood on the left hand as we paſſed to the Academy, not far from the Temple of <hi>Theſeus.</hi> There is to be ſeen likewiſe the Tomb of <hi>Anthemocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the Herald at Arms, whom the <hi>Megari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> killed againſt the Law of Nations: This Gate had alſo been called <hi>Thryaſia, Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Ceromica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the right hand from <hi>Dypilon,</hi> we had the ſight of a very ancient and fine Wall, with the ruines of an admirable Gate: It had formerly been the <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> of <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Braſs Statues, there was one of <hi>Mercury</hi> in Stone, an excellent piece that paſſed fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The moſt probable opinion is, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his Palace was on the South-ſide of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s <hi>Gymnaſion,</hi> not far from <hi>Melita,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> has deſcribed it.</p>
            <p>On the ſide of theſe ruines there are the remains of an old Brick Wall, of which <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> ſpeaks, and looks, as he ſays, upon the Mount <hi>Hymettus,</hi> not far from the Mountain of <hi>Saint George.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the right hand towards the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and near the <hi>Dypilon</hi> ſtood the ancient Temple of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> remarkable for the Feaſts which the Ancients ſolemnized in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Heroe, and for the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Meal which was made among the poor of that Town: But the greateſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their veneration for their Founder, was their making an inviolable <hi>Aſylum</hi> of his Temple, in which all Slaves were received and protected from the ill uſage of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: It was built after the Battel of <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> Conſecrated during the Victories of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and repaired (as the reſt) by the orders of <hi>Adrian,</hi> ſince when, by the bounty of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94489:122"/>
certain <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes, it has been turned into a Church; at preſent it is much decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not likely to be repaired but by the misfortune of making it a <hi>Moſque:</hi> Hitherto the <hi>Turks</hi> have attempted it, but in vain; The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is have been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to keep it, by their Intereſt with the <hi>Keſlar Agaſi.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> in madneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they would not be troubled with it, and that being without the Town it would not be convenient for them.</p>
            <p>Becauſe it ſtood without the City, ſome of our company would not believe it was the ſame that is ſo much mentioned in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hiſtory, in reſpect that <hi>Plutarch</hi> has placed it in the middle of <hi>Athens</hi>; not conſidering how much this City is altered ſince <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s time, nor obſerving the vaſt demoliſhment before the Temple towards the Field, and perhaps not knowing that all that ſide was inhabited and divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three great Wards, called <hi>Kyera Siki, The Academy,</hi> and the <hi>Colonos Hippios:</hi> and it could not be more exactly in the midſt of <hi>Athens,</hi> than by lying betwixt the preſent Town, and that place which they call now <hi>Aſti,</hi> or the City. But beſides theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, the very Walls and Building are ſufficient to perſwade us of its antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:94489:122"/>About this Temple there were formerly four conſiderable places; a Court or Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, a Priſon, the <hi>Horcomoſion</hi> (where the Peace was concluded betwixt <hi>Theſeus</hi> and the <hi>Amazons)</hi> and the Theatre of <hi>Regilla,</hi> which Theatre was built by <hi>Herodes Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> becauſe the Theatre of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> though great and magnificent, was not ſufficient to receive the vaſt multitude of ſpectators that came to ſee their publick repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. At this day, hard by the ſaid Temple, is to be ſeen a large and fair Marble Statue of a Lyon couching upon the ground, and as it were aſleep; to diſtinguiſh it from that upon the Coaſt, and that other in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who are both Rampant, and as it were in a rage: Upon which ſcore the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens,</hi> as they paſs by this Lyon, they whiſper it in the Ear, and tell it, <hi>You may ſleep on, Lyon of</hi> Athens, <hi>and take your reſt, for the Lyon upon the Coaſt and the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Caſtle watch for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some four or five years ſince, this Lyon was the occaſion of a Prodigy in that City. The Wife of one of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> of the Caſtle paſſing many times with her Husband by this Lyon, reſted herſelf one day before it, and fixing her eyes firmly upon it, ſhe hapned to conceive at the ſame time, by which means her imagination impregnated
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94489:123"/>
with that Object, and re-inforced every day by the ſight of the Lyon in the Caſtle, it had ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon her, that at the end of Nine months ſhe was brought to bed of a Monſter with a head like a Lyon, which the <hi>Diſdar</hi> cauſed to be ſtifled.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed by that, we went on by the Gardens in the ruines of the <hi>Faubourg</hi> of the <hi>Academy</hi> or the <hi>Ceramique,</hi> for it is called equally by both names.</p>
            <p>Before I came to <hi>Athens,</hi> I have admired a hundred times that among ſo many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men as have Tranſlated and Commented upon <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and particularly <hi>Amazeus</hi> and <hi>Meurſius,</hi> never any of them gave us a Plain of that City: But my aſtoniſhment ceaſed when I was in this <hi>Faubourg,</hi> and conſidered the ground, and I could not but acknowledge they had done well. I ſhall give you but one inſtance. <hi>Pauſanians</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given us a deſcription of the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> jumps immediately to the <hi>Academy,</hi> and who would not upon probable conjecture believe but two places that are ſo jumbled together in his Writings, ſhould be next neighbours in their ſcituation? and yet there is no more communication nor proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity betwixt them than there is betwixt the <hi>Cours de la Reyne</hi> and the <hi>Place Royalle</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:94489:123"/>
in <hi>Paris,</hi> or St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church and the <hi>Porte Latine</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> for there is a compleat League betwixt them, and to paſs from one to the other you muſt croſs the whole City.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Academy</hi> was called ſo for being the Inheritance of one <hi>Academus,</hi> who lived in the time when <hi>Theſeus,</hi> after his infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to <hi>Ariana,</hi> ſtole away <hi>Hellen,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her from <hi>Lacedaemon: Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux</hi> her two Brethren, purſued with what Forces they could make, and came as far as <hi>Athens</hi>; but not being able to diſcover where ſhe was, they were privately adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by this <hi>Academus,</hi> which was a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo well taken by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that in all the Wars and depredations committed by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the <hi>Athenians,</hi> their Armies ſtill ſpared the <hi>Academy,</hi> for <hi>Academus</hi> his ſake. <hi>Sylla</hi> was not altogether ſo civil, for he ſacrificed to the Laws of War, and the liberty of the Soldier all thoſe brave Groves and pleaſant Walks which <hi>Cimon</hi> had made for the entertainment of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and imployed the Timber to make Engines for the battery of the Town.</p>
            <p>There it was that ſuch men were interred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s had done any great Service for their
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94489:124"/>
Country; among others, <hi>Harmodius, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtogiton,</hi> and <hi>Thraſibulus.</hi> Upon the two Wings of this <hi>Faubourg</hi> there was a kind of Forreſt, of Marble Pillars, loaden with ſo many Statues and Epitaphs, that he, who in a ſhort time had a mind to underſtand all the great actions of that Common-wealth, had no more to do than to read over all thoſe Elogies and Inſcriptions. Among the reſt of the Tombs there was one for <hi>Zeno</hi> the Philoſopher, which his old friend <hi>Antigonus</hi> obtained from the <hi>Athenians</hi> as a conſiderable favour. <hi>Plato</hi> had his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument too, but nor ſo magnificent, for which he may thank himſelf, for it was he that regulated their exorbitancy in their Tombs, affirming that a Stone big enough to have four Verſes engraven upon it, was big enough for the recording of any mans memory after he was dead.</p>
            <p>Not far from this <hi>Academy</hi> there ſtood a little Temple, dedicated to <hi>Bacchus Liber</hi>; a little conſecrated Incloſure, in which they worſhipt <hi>Diana,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Caliſta</hi>; and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents to the honour of <hi>Theſeus, Oedipus,</hi> and <hi>Pirithous.</hi> Among ſeveral Altars di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed up and down, <hi>Minerva, Vulcan, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Hercules,</hi> the <hi>Muſes, Love,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> had every one one. That was the firſt that ever was dedicated to <hi>Love,</hi> and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94489:124"/>
the firſt man that ever came thither to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was <hi>Charmus,</hi> the favourite of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtrates.</hi> The Altar of <hi>Prometheus</hi> was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for a Courſe which was run there du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Feſtivals conſecrated to <hi>Minerva</hi>; for the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſometimes on foot, and ſometimes on Horſe-back, ſtarted at this Altar (each with a light Torch in his hand) and running quite along the <hi>Faubourg</hi> to an appointed place, he who made his Courſe without putting out his Torch, had a Prize for his pains, and was in great reputation with the people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> being the firſt Philoſopher that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aught in the <hi>Academy,</hi> gave the name of <hi>Academicks</hi> to all of his Sect. After his death (which is now 2016 years ſince) Learning increaſed in <hi>Athens</hi> ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that two other <hi>Academies</hi> were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well to accommodate the multitude of Scholars, as by reaſon of diverſity of Opinions that began to ſpread among them: <hi>Arceſilas</hi> founded the ſecond <hi>Academy,</hi> and <hi>Lecydes</hi> the third.</p>
            <p>Their Doctrine in general conſiſted in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heſe Principles, That nothing ought to be poſitively affirmed, becauſe nothing could be certainly known. That there were of all things certain <hi>Species</hi> which they called <hi>Phantaſies</hi>; which <hi>Species</hi> were not formed
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94489:125"/>
according to the nature of the things, but according to the diſpoſition of the body or object to which thoſe <hi>Species</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: From whence they maintained that nothing ſubſiſted actually in it ſelf, or had any proper or peculiar Eſſence, but ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by reference, as they were formed in our Senſes, not in the ſubject from whence they flowed, and this you may find in <hi>Aulus Gellius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Morality bore the character of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Religion, and the doctrine of the <hi>Academy</hi> obtaining a long time, was taught in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris.</hi> At length the doctrine of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> prevailed with us as more ſubtil and conſentaneous with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>When we arrived at this famous School, how ſtrangely were we ſurprized? how ſadly were we affected to behold its ruine and deſolation? There was nothing to be ſeen but heaps of Rubbiſh, and great ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Stone over-grown with Graſs, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Earth. Here and there were a few Fig-Trees and Olive-Trees, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Cabins where the Gardiners were lodged. If in ſo melancholy a ſpectacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing occurred of conſolation, it was, to think that the name of that place, and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94489:125"/>
the qualities of that Genius which preſided there, were tranſplanted to <hi>Paris</hi>; for in ſhort, we muſt acknowledge as <hi>Rome</hi> did of old, <hi>Omnis ubertas, &amp; quaſi ſylva dicendi, ab Academia ducta eſt. All our Elegance, and exactneſs of expreſſion, is deducible from the</hi> Academy.</p>
            <p>But the name of <hi>Academy</hi> is almoſt loſt in <hi>Athens,</hi> and it is called at this day <hi>The School of Plato.</hi> It is ſcarce poſſible to dig ſix foot deep into the ground, but you muſt find ſome conſiderable piece of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Some three or four years ſince a Gardiner digged up a <hi>Pallas</hi> of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he ſold to <hi>Giraud</hi> for two Crowns. <hi>Giraud</hi>'s Wife was, as I told you, an <hi>Athenian,</hi> of a pleaſant merry hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as appears by a trick ſhe put upon Father <hi>Simon.</hi> She laid this Statue in a Bed betwixt a pair of Sheets, and ſending for the Father, told him one of her Maids was ſick, and deſired to be confeſſed. The Statue was dreſſed very decently in night linnen, and the Father turned alone into her Chamber. The Father was grave and modeſt, and kept himſelf at a diſtance, and his modeſty contributed to the Cheat. He fell immediately to his pious Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, endeavouring thereby to diſpoſe the poor Creature to Repentance, and the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94489:126"/>
of her Conſcience. The Miſtreſs of the Houſe called out to him, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the door, to ſpeak out, for the Maid was deaf, and had been ſo a long time. The good man elevated his voice, and went nearer to the Bed, when the good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entring haſtily into The Room, Let us ſee, Sir, ſaid ſhe, 'tis poſſible ſhe may be dead, and then ſhe has no need of your Confeſſion, and ſo running to the Bed ſide, ſhe turned up the Cloaths and ſhew'd him the <hi>Pallas,</hi> which put the whole company into a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The Houſe the Famous <hi>Miſanthropos,</hi> is to be ſeen about a hundred paces from the ruines of the <hi>Academy:</hi> The place is now full of Fig Tree, and if you would entertain your ſelf with the ſtory of that renowned Enemy to mankind, read what <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays in the Life of <hi>Mark Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Returning towards our Lodging, we came on the left hand to the foot of <hi>Mount St. George,</hi> where we ſaw the ruines which at this day they call the <hi>School of Zeno,</hi> though indeed it was nothing but his Tomb: You may remember what I have ſaid of it in ſpeaking of the <hi>Porcile</hi> or <hi>Stoa.</hi> About half a mile from the Town; the great Road is cut in the midſt by two other, and make
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94489:126"/>
a <hi>Carrefour,</hi> where there ſtood formerly a Statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Tetrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalos.</hi> The Oratour <hi>Ephialtes</hi> (who if you will believe <hi>Pericles,</hi> was a great leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diminution to the authority of the <hi>Areopage)</hi> had his Tomb within a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 25. of <hi>April,</hi> we march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the morning to viſit the ruines of <hi>Stadion Panathenaicon,</hi> and the Palace of <hi>Adrian.</hi> By the Gate through which we paſſed to <hi>Raphti,</hi> we ſaw the <hi>Triclinion,</hi> an excellent piece of Antiquity, not yet taken notice of by any Authour: It is a large Stone, digged ſome years ſince out of the Earth, and embelliſhed with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bas-relief repreſenting a Hall and a Banquet of the Ancients, from which Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture it is called <hi>Triclinion.</hi> A <hi>Greek</hi> has placed it in the wall of his Houſe as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to it.</p>
            <p>Without the <hi>Port de Raphti</hi> we left the Palace of <hi>Adrian</hi> on our left hand, and on one ſide the place which they call <hi>Ta Mni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muria</hi>; it is a Cemetery of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who quite through the <hi>Levant,</hi> are buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City. The ancient <hi>Athenians</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the ſame Cuſtom, and it was by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favour when they ſuffered any of their Tombs to be within the compaſs of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94489:127"/>
their Walls. But now a days the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are buried in their Churches. As we paſſed to the Bridge over the River <hi>Iliſſus,</hi> we obſerved a place where formerly was the Tribunal called <hi>Ardettos,</hi> where the Judges took a ſolemn Oath to <hi>Jupiter, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> to adminiſter Juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Land, and where the Laws were defective to proceed according to their Conſcience. There it was that there was an Altar conſecrated to the <hi>Muſes</hi> called <hi>Iliſſiades</hi>; and there it was that <hi>Codrus</hi> King of <hi>Athens</hi> was ſlain. Near the Bridge we ſaw another place, the ruines of a Chappel which they called <hi>Agios Phrancos,</hi> where the Image of St. <hi>Francis</hi> is to be ſtill ſeen painted upon the Wall. When the <hi>Accioles</hi> were Maſters of this Country, they erected a Chappel in honour of this Saint, which is yet in ſo great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do at this day give that name to their Children in Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The Bridge ſtands upon three Arches, through which the River <hi>Illiſus</hi> paſſed in former times, but at preſent it is dry, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been diverted and divided by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of little Rivulets, cut on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſupply the Water-works in the Gardens about the Town; and it was a

wonder to us to conſider, that whereas commonly Fountains were contracted, and their Waters brought together to make Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; here the <hi>Illiſus</hi> was exhauſted and annihilated to furniſh their Fountains. The <hi>Bridan</hi> that paſſed of old through <hi>Athens,</hi> had a worſe deſtiny, for its Chanel is loſt, and nothing of it now to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the Bridge is the quarter which they call indifferently <hi>Agra</hi> and <hi>Agrae</hi>; where <hi>Boreas</hi> one of the Gods of the Winds ſtole away <hi>Orythia</hi> a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the King of <hi>Athens:</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> the Goddeſs was firſt delighted with the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Hunting. The Soil is Sandy, and great plenty there is of Partridge, but they are not ſo good as ours.</p>
            <p>Not far off there is a little eminence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which are to be ſeen the ruines of the Goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Agrotera</hi> or the Huntreſs; to whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a Sacrifice of 500 male Goats, to acquit themſelves of a Vow into which they entered before the Battel of <hi>Marathon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this little Hill, we ſurveyed the ruines of the <hi>Stadion Panathenaicon</hi>; they are ſtill ſo magnificent, that we were amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to behold them, and could not but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves ſay of that morſel that was left, what <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaid of it when it was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94489:128"/>
entire, <hi>That it was not to be looked upon without admiration.</hi> This <hi>Stadion</hi> was the place where the publick Courſes were kept; its figure was oval, and as exact, as if Nature had intended it on purpoſe as a liſt and bound of their Cariere. The rows of Stairs that are ſtill viſible, are of white Marble: and the <hi>Area</hi> was ſo large, that <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour (as a ſpectacle to the people) cauſed in one day a thouſand Wild Beaſts to be baited in it.</p>
            <p>At the foot of this Hill of the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſtands a Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> built of white Marble, as neat and ſpruce a piece of work as is in the world. It is now made uſe of by the <hi>Greeks</hi> for a Church, and in it there is the Picture of our Saviour upon the Croſs, as well done as ever I ſaw. Here it was that <hi>Hercules</hi> was firſt initiated to the ſmaller Myſteries of <hi>Ceres,</hi> for the grand Myſteries were celebrated in another Temple dedicated to the ſaid Goddeſs, but with the Title of <hi>Eluſinion.</hi> From thence we paſſed to the Temple of <hi>Agne</hi>; I would not judge raſhly of the devotion of our Company, but I am afraid it was not ſo much that that carried them thither, as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ſee the place where <hi>Hercules</hi> had been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:94489:128"/>From thence turning to the right, we went to ſee the ſtately Pillars, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Portail remaining of the Palace of <hi>Adrian</hi>; the common people call it <hi>Dida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcalion.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> having turned it into a <hi>Gymnaſion,</hi> had ſpared no coſt either in the choice of his Marble, or the gilding and decoration of the Seeling and Wainſcot; and when finiſhed he put into it the Library of <hi>Piſiſtrates,</hi> who was the firſt that ever made ſo accurate a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Books: and to ſpeak truth never poor Books made ſo many peregrinations. <hi>Xerxes</hi> carried them firſt into <hi>Perſia,</hi> from whence, a long time after, <hi>Seleucus Nicanor</hi> returned them to <hi>Athens</hi>; in the days of <hi>Sylla</hi> they tranſmigrated to <hi>Rome,</hi> but could not reſt there, for <hi>Adrian</hi> ſent them back to adorn his <hi>Gymnaſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near theſe Pillars we ſaw the <hi>Ta Mni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouria</hi> or Cemetery of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and on one ſide, the rubbiſh of the Temple of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> being the remains of a large one built by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and dedicated in common to <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> it was called <hi>Pan-Hellenien,</hi> and is at preſent a <hi>Greek</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Hard by there was a little Plain where the <hi>Turks</hi> uſed to gallop their Horſes, which minds me of a ſtory of Father <hi>Lewis,</hi> who as I told you before, had been a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94489:129"/>
Colonel, and as good a Horſeman as was in the Army. This good Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning one day from <hi>Medelli</hi> on Horſe-back, booted and ſpur'd, and with a long <hi>Greek</hi> Veſt over his habit (which is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when their Miſſion appoints them any extraordinary Voyage) paſſing over this place, he ſaw a mad-headed furious Jade throw five or ſix <hi>Turks</hi> one after another, and all of them reputed very good Jockies. The <hi>Sardar, Vaywood,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Cheliby's</hi> were by. The Father could not but ſmile, and the <hi>Vaywood</hi> obſerving it, asked him if in <hi>France</hi> their Horſemen were better: The poor Father anſwered with another ſmile, which being looked upon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Skill, and a defiance of their Nation, the <hi>Cheliby's</hi> were nettled, and cried out to have the <hi>Caloger</hi> get up: The whole company concur'd, and nothing could ſerve, but he muſt immediately mount, not doubting but the Horſe would ſerve him in the ſame kind, and that in a ſhort time they ſhould ſee his divinity upon the ground. The Father pretended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, but the <hi>Sardar</hi> was the more obſtinate: I cannot ſay but in deſpight of the mortification of his Order, the good man might have ſome little vanity upon him, and be touched too much for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94489:129"/>
of his Countrymen. Be it how it will, he alighted from his own, and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mad Horſe, he Gallop'd and chang'd, rid him all the Airs of an Academy, and all the Exerciſes of the Army, and, contrary to the expectation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> maſtered him with ſo much comlineſs and dexterity, that the <hi>Vaywood</hi> telling the <hi>Cheliby's</hi> he had been a Souldier, and made ſeveral Campagnes in his own Country, they called him ever after the <hi>Colonel Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We came home the ſooner, that after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we might take a larger walk, and we began it by the great Street called <hi>Cerami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> or <hi>Baſar,</hi> which at this day is the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the City: It took its name from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros Ceramos,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ariana</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi> But for the <hi>Vicus Ceramicus</hi> in the Suburbs as you go along to the <hi>Academy,</hi> it was called ſo from the Pot-makers that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that <hi>Faubourg,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Janizary</hi> carried us into the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon</hi> which ſtands on one ſide of this Street: I thought it much more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent than the <hi>Rotund</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> which was alſo a <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and built by <hi>Agrippa:</hi> That at <hi>Athens</hi> was built above Six-ſcore years after by the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> For
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94489:130"/>
a long time it was a <hi>Greek</hi> Church dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagia,</hi> but it is ſince turned into a <hi>Moſque</hi> by the <hi>Turks.</hi> There were two very fine Horſes of the work of <hi>Praxatiles</hi> which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> cauſed to be ſet up; they are ſtill to be ſeen, but they begin to decay, and muſt erelong yield like other things to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievouſneſs of time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Porticoes</hi> that of old time ran along from thence to the Gate of <hi>Dypilon,</hi> were remarkable for nothing more than for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walk and Rendezvous of all the Proſtitutes of the Town, many of whoſe names are with the names of their Gallants written upon their Pillars and Walls; of which you may ſee more in the Dialogues of <hi>Lucian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bazar</hi> formerly the Market-place of the <hi>Ceramique,</hi> is ſtill in that Street; in the middle of which there is a little Hall, with a Fountain on one ſide of it. On the ground where the Hall is built, there ſtood anciently an Altar conſecrated to <hi>Mercy,</hi> and at a little diſtance another called <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catheon,</hi> being dedicated to twelve Gods. On one ſide of the <hi>Dodecatheon</hi> was their <hi>Cyclos</hi> or place where they ſold their Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:94489:130"/>The richeſt of the Inhabitants, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly their <hi>Vecchiados</hi> have their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es near this <hi>Bazar.</hi> The Houſe of <hi>Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trios Beninzellos</hi> is on one ſide of the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon:</hi> The Houſe of his Brother <hi>Janis Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninzellos</hi> is over againſt it. I had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to ſee the Lodgings of <hi>Stamantis Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondilos,</hi> in memory of the famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>Laonicus Calchondilos</hi> who was an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and of the ſame Family. This <hi>Stamatis</hi> is one of the <hi>Vecchiados,</hi> and rich; but the reſt of his Relations are very poor men, and one of them a Taylor in the Town.</p>
            <p>The publick Butchery ſeparates the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> from another great Market-place, which the Ancients called ſimply <hi>Agora</hi>; but touching upon the two Streets of <hi>Colonos</hi> and <hi>Colytos,</hi> the two ends of it were called by their Names. There is an excellent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be ſeen in it, it is called <hi>Agoraeus,</hi> much like the Statue of the ſame <hi>Mercury</hi> before the <hi>Poecile</hi>: At preſent this <hi>Agora</hi> is called the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s Place, becauſe he has a Houſe there himſelf, and his <hi>Seraglio</hi> looks out upon it.</p>
            <p>Over againſt this Place ſtands the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> call their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>Caloger Damaski<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> is one of its principal Dignitaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grand Vicar to the Archbiſhop.

            <p>In a direct line from the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> over againſt the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s Place, ſtands the <hi>Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> or publick Priſon.

we came near any place, to tell one another This is ſuch a Temple; this ſuch a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this ſuch a Ruine; and our great ſatisfaction was to hit generally right.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colytos</hi> is a quarter below the <hi>Cadi</hi>'s place, and ſtands towards the South; <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and that great <hi>Miſanthropos Timon</hi> were born in it: <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Oratour, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> lived in it: You may ſee in <hi>Plutarch</hi> the ingenious anſwer of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> when he accuſed <hi>Demades</hi> the Orator for having been taken in Adultery in the <hi>Colytos. Tertullian</hi> has a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obſervation of this place; he tells us that Children do ſooner learn to ſpeak there, than any where elſe; and <hi>Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> affirms that they are generally born hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer and more beautiful there, for which reaſon they are called the delights of <hi>Greece:</hi> I aſtoniſhed the Inhabitants when I told them theſe things; but as to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Children, Experience does at this day confirm the teſtimony of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.</p>
            <p>And thus I have brought you through a quarter, of which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> has not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a word, no more than of that of <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> which came ſo near the <hi>Colytos</hi> that there was nothing but a Pillar that diſtinguiſhed them.

            <p>Finding in this quarter ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Churches, and particularly two Covents of <hi>Calogers,</hi> or Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Baſilia,</hi> we were very inquiſitive whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none of them were built upon the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of ſome of theſe Temples, but tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion failed us, and we could not have that ſatisfaction which we found in other places, where examining the Corniſhes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters, and Frizes betwixt the Pillars, we found ſometimes Eagles, ſometimes Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts, as the ſymbols of <hi>Jupiter</hi>; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Serpents and Clubs as the ſymbols of <hi>Hercules</hi>; Harps of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; but here we could find nothing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Colonos Hippios</hi> ſeemed a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant place to us; <hi>Pauſanias</hi> only names it, without any mention of four remarkable Temples to be ſeen there: one of <hi>Venus,</hi> another of <hi>Neptune,</hi> a third of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> and fourth of the <hi>Eumenides</hi> or infernal Furies.

with eaſe the whole circumference both of the Old and New <hi>Athens</hi>: And caſting our eyes upon two or three Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the order of St. <hi>Bazil,</hi> not far from the <hi>Mount Hymetta,</hi> and upon certain Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages upon the roads to <hi>Thebes</hi> and <hi>Megara,</hi> one of our Company pointing us to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about a League off, acquainted us that that was the Mountain which the Ancients called <hi>Icaria,</hi> at the foot of which there was a Town call'd by that name where the firſt Comedy was invented. This put it into our heads to Viſit the next morning the <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down from Mount <hi>Pentelicus,</hi> we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd our ſelves with the conſideration of the Village of <hi>Icaria,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt certain the inhabitants of this Town were the firſt inventors of Comedy: <hi>Icarius,</hi> Lord of the Mannor, and famous for being the firſt Planter of <hi>Vines</hi> in thoſe parts, having one day cauſed his people to fley a <hi>Goat</hi> that he took ſpoiling his Grapes, he cauſed the Skin to be blown up, and giving it to the Peaſants, they in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment leaped and skipped upon it having dreſſed themſelves with Vine leaves, and beſmear'd their faces with the Lees of Wine: Which ſort of Dancing grew to a cuſtom in Vintage time, and was uſed in all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94489:134"/>
the neighbouring Villages: and the fumes of the new Wines having at ſuch times an ill-effect upon their brains, becauſe it often happened that they were ill treated by the rich Citizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> who had lands in the ſaid Towns; the Peaſants took the opportunity of theſe Feaſts to affront and retaliate upon their adverſaries. When night came, attended by throngs of people that this divertiſement had drawn together; they marcht along together in a tumult to inveigh and clamor againſt thoſe who had done them any injury, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to their very doors, and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them publickly: Thoſe who had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in thoſe Villages failed not the next Morning to inquire into the Riot, and to commence an Action againſt all thoſe who were ſo enormous the night before; and comonly the tumult ceaſed either for fear of puniſhment, or ſhame. This expedient ſucceeding ſo well in the Country, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing a good remedy againſt thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, the ſame cuſtom was taken up in <hi>Athens</hi>: The Rendezvous or Confluence of common people was generally in a <hi>Medow</hi> called <hi>Lenaeon</hi> in the quarter called <hi>Lymnae</hi>; and becauſe it was near the Ancient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> by degrees theſe kind of Pranks grew into the ceremonies of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94489:135"/>
became part of their divine worſhip, and by little and little to be a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part in the Feſtivals of that God. As occaſion ſerved they continued their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives (under that pretence) againſt ſuch as had offered them Violence. At length the Poets took up the ſame Method to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid particular vices, or to turn their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies into ridicule: Then it was that the <hi>Athenians</hi> withdrew their repreſentations from their Market place; and Exhibited them in a large Room which they called a <hi>Theatre,</hi> and dedicated it to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Poſterity, that it was the Vintage time that gave the firſt occaſion to Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. At firſt their whole action was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> which was the whole body of their Muſick both inſtrumental and vocal. <hi>Theſpis</hi> the Poet was the firſt man who, diſſatisfied with the ſinging of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> brought in one Actor, with the natural way of recitation: And <hi>Eſchiles</hi> as much offended to ſee one perſon ingroſs the whole Play, brought up the way of converſation, and exhibited two Actors upon the Stage. The Poet <hi>Cratinus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced three; and afterwards their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was advanced to five, which was the reaſon they divided their whole Play in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to five Acts. Then was the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94489:135"/>
performed betwixt the <hi>Comedians,</hi> the <hi>Mimicks,</hi> the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and the ſymphony or Muſick: and the whole ſhow ſeen upon two Elevations or Platforms, which ſerved as Poſts or particular places for the ſeveral perſons: The <hi>Comedians</hi> Quarter was called <hi>Proſcenion,</hi> and was peculiar to them: The other was in common, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes the <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Logaeon.</hi> There were five intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the five Acts, in which the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were entertained either by the <hi>Chorus,</hi> or the <hi>Mimicks.</hi> The word <hi>Mime</hi> was uſed promiſcuouſly for the name of the Poem, or for the Actor who danced as he recited, and made his poſtures and geſticulations as he was prompted by the ſubject. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Mime</hi> was called <hi>Pantomime,</hi> which is but a term of exaggeration that puts greater force upon the thing, for <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> is an Imitator, and <hi>Pantomimos</hi> is an imitator of every thing. Sometimes their repreſentations were Heroick, to excite to generoſity, but for the moſt part they were upon amorous Intrigues; and criminal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions: At ſuch times their Dances were laſcivious, their Geſtures indecent, and their Songs immodeſt, according to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity of the ſubject, in ſo much that the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> began to be infamous. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94489:136"/>
above all, none was ſo impudent as the Dance they called <hi>Lamprotera,</hi> in which they not only danced ſtark naked, but added the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of words to the <hi>effrontery</hi> of their poſtures: So that though the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> was not guilty of theſe impurities, yet it became diſguſtful to the adverſaries of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, who were not willing to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi>; whereby the <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> has ſuffered much among thoſe who will not allow any difference betwixt him and the <hi>Mimick</hi>; but the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> may eaſily be juſtified; for we need no more but caſt our eyes upon the Tragedies tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ancients, and we ſhall ſee that in the action of thoſe heroick parts it is impoſſible the <hi>Comoedian</hi> ſhould intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that baſeneſs of Geſture, or be guilty of a diſſolute Dance, in ſo magnificent a matter. And if in time that Corruption has crept into Comedy, if ſordid expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have mingled with good inſtruction, and ſcandal gone along with their docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it does but infer that few things are ſo pure, but they are ſubject to be altered, and thoſe that are altered may by good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms be rectified again. And indeed we are not to admire if St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other Fathers of the Church declaim againſt Stage-plays, and on the other ſide <hi>Thomas Aquinas, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:94489:136"/>
Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Raynerius</hi> do magnifie the uſe of them, ſeeing both ſides have ſpoke according to the different ways of writing in their ſeveral times.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reflections with which the fight of <hi>Icaria</hi> inſpired us; and indeed Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy being a thing which originally we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Athens,</hi> it was but reaſonable we ſhould conſider whether it was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the other great faculties that we derived from thence; and whether we were not juſtly to admire that wiſdom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance which invented ſo pleaſant a way of relaxing our cares, diverting the activity of our Spirits, and ſweetning our ferocity and moroſeneſs by the concourſe and ſociety of Spectacles.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the 26. of <hi>April,</hi> in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we took a large Breakfaſt by way of precaution againſt the long walk which we propoſed to our ſelves. Beſides that, our <hi>Janizary</hi> had ſent two men before to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us at the Fountain of <hi>Enneacrunos</hi> with more belly-timber, and two or three luſty Flasks of <hi>Lepanthe</hi> Wine, eſteemed the beſt in thoſe parts. Theſe Flasks among the <hi>Athenians</hi> are a kind of Glaſs-bottles that hold each of them three or four pints.

lived in that houſe a good Man and his Wife, who had only one Son of about ten or twelve years of Age, but excellently handſom, and very well educated.

In ſpite of her cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſpruce young <hi>Turk</hi> got a ſight one day of this Virgin, and fell in love with her; having made his addreſs to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as he loſt his labour, he loſt his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with it, and conſpired with certain of his Accomplices like himſelf, to gain her by force.

               <hi>Cajetan,</hi> Drogoman to the Conſul <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud,</hi> had his Lodgings in this Palace of <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> A little beyond it we ſaw the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> a very admirable Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Of the three Temples Dedicated an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to that God, we could meet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could aſſure us whether this was the <hi>Elates,</hi> the <hi>Cynades</hi> or <hi>Aſphalius.</hi> It is at preſent a Greek Church, govern'd by the Caloger <hi>Damaskinos,</hi> whoſe houſe being hard by, and upon the brow of a Rock, is the higheſt in the whole City.

            <p>Near the Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> there is a Fountain of the ſame name, whoſe waters are turned for the benefit of the Caſtle:

From thence we came into the <hi>Vicus Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus,</hi> where we ſaw on our right hand the place where formerly ſtood the <hi>Leocorion,</hi> or Monument of <hi>Leos,</hi> who having ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed his Daughters for the ſafety of the publick, deſerved well to have a Tomb in the City. Facing about to the left, we ſaw the ruines of a magnificent Building, called the Kings <hi>Portico,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico</hi> of the King of the Sacrifices, or the ſecond of the <hi>Archontes.</hi> The <hi>Portico</hi> of <hi>Jupiter Elutherion</hi> was behind it, and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancon,</hi> or the Tomb of <hi>Heros Eudanos</hi> was hard by, which <hi>Eudanos</hi> was ſirnamed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos</hi> the Son of <hi>Neptune.</hi> Thence towards the Caſtle, we obſerved the <hi>Metroon</hi> or Chapel of the Mother of the Gods, in which place died <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophron,</hi> as famous in <hi>Athens,</hi> as the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was in <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Barathron</hi> or <hi>Orygma,</hi> that famous dungeon into which their criminals were tumbled, was behind that <hi>Metroon</hi> at the foot of a ſteep Rock in the Caſtle; and near the <hi>Barathron,</hi> was the Tribunal called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabyſthus,</hi> in which only ſmall Cauſes were tryed; and that Court conſiſted of eleven Judges: The nearneſs of this Court to the <hi>Barathron</hi> (which was an ignominious place) was the occaſion that ſome Authors
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94489:142"/>
have ſaid, that the <hi>Parabyſthus</hi> ſtood in a vile and abominable place. At ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Kings <hi>Portico,</hi> we ſaw the <hi>Bucoleon</hi> or Court where the King of the Sacrifices had his Tribunal: Not far from that we ſaw the ruines of a ſmall Chapel, called <hi>Agios Dionyſios,</hi> where Maſs is ſaid conſtantly upon Saint <hi>Denis</hi> his day. To reſtore that Chapel one would have need not only of Money, but good intereſt at the <hi>Port,</hi> where they ſuffer Chriſtians to repair their Churches, they will not ſuffer them to rebuild them when they are down: This Chapel joyns to the Archbiſhops Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, which they pretend was the Palace of Saint <hi>Denis.</hi> The place is very pleaſant, and is the lodgings of the Archbiſhop and five <hi>Calogers</hi> that make up his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. They ſhew us a Well there, which among the Chriſtians is in great Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe as their tradition tells them, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a priſoner in it, and reſcued by the Authority of Saint <hi>Denis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not far from the ruines of the <hi>Pryta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum</hi> we ſaw the Court where the fifty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators Aſſembled who had the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick Affairs: The perpetual Fire was kept there.

            <p>On the right hand towards the Temple of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> there was a Grove dedicated to the <hi>Heroina Aglaura</hi> daughter to King <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crops,</hi> and behind the Grove was a field Conſecrated to <hi>Famine</hi>; the field was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Limoupedion.</hi> Formerly the Gate called <hi>Hiera</hi> ſtood at the end of this field: <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era</hi> is as much as ſacred, and it was called ſo, becauſe it was the way to <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> by which they paſſed in their famous Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion belonging to the myſteries of <hi>Ceres.</hi>

            <p>Not far off was a <hi>Gymnaſium</hi> of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> with a Porticoe and Market-place of the ſame name; and becauſe nothing of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity ought (at leaſt in my fancy) to be loſt, and the leaſt obſervation is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in that caſe; it is not amiſs to let you know that near the <hi>Portico</hi> there are to be ſeen the ruines of a large <hi>Courèon</hi> or Barbars Shop, of which <hi>Lyſias</hi> makes mention.</p>
            <p>Behind this <hi>Portico,</hi> is the Garden of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthus</hi> the Philoſopher, in which Garden the Orator <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was buried; a little beyond we ſaw Statues repreſenting a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt <hi>Neptune</hi> and the Giant <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot:</hi>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:94489:144"/>
Not far from the <hi>Port du Pyraeum</hi> we ſaw a Temple, conſiderable only for ſome certain Statues of <hi>Praxitiles</hi> his work; from thence we went to the <hi>Pompeon,</hi> which is the place where they depoſite all the Implements and Utenſils belonging to their publick ſolemnities. Beyond that Gate there is a Tomb adorned with the Statue of a Horſman, by <hi>Praxitiles</hi> own hand.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Pyraeum</hi> Gate was twice Muſquet ſhot from where the new one ſtands now. From thence we turned towards the Caſtle, following a Path on the right hand that led us towards the ruines of the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympicus. Titus Livius</hi> has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry elegantly expreſſed its magnificence in theſe, <hi>Templum unum in terris inchoatum pro magnitudine Dei: The only Temple in the world begun with proportion to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of a God.</hi> But it was not finiſhed in his days, for the greatneſs of the deſign kept it unfiniſhed for above ſeven hundred years, though ſeveral Kings contributed largely to have it finiſhed; the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> perfected it at laſt, at the expence of more than nine Millions. Its circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was about half a mile, and in its whole extent ſcarce a place but was embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with ſome excellent Statue, more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94489:144"/>
for the curioſity of the work, than for the Gold or Ivory which had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally laviſhed upon them.</p>
            <p>There was alſo to be ſeen the Temple of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Rhea</hi>; the Grove of <hi>Olympia,</hi> and a Ditch that has been famous ever ſince <hi>Ducalion</hi>'s Flood; for it is from tradition believed that the waters of that deluge were carried off through that, and they fancy it the more credible, becauſe there is <hi>Ducalion</hi>'s Tomb hard by. There is alſo the houſe of <hi>Morychia,</hi> and another of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midas,</hi> who was a man of a moſt prodigious memory.</p>
            <p>Southward of this Temple ſtood ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dedicated to <hi>Apollo</hi> and called <hi>Delphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>; it was alſo a Court that took cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of, and judged finally in Cauſes where Murder was evidently committed and confeſſed, but juſtified to have been done according to Law. The old Port of <hi>Eugeus</hi> was hard by, and his Palace not far off: A little lower was the Quarter called <hi>Coepi</hi> or the Gardens, where there was to be ſeen a Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> of <hi>Alcamenes</hi> his making; in the opinion of <hi>Phidias,</hi> the choiceſt of his work, and eſteemed rather a Miracle than a Maſter-piece, There was likewiſe a Temple dedicated to <hi>Venus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and by it, another to <hi>Euclaea,</hi> another
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94489:145"/>
to <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> and another to <hi>Ceres,</hi> which laſt was called by way of excellence <hi>Eleuſinion,</hi> becauſe the Grand Myſteries of that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs were celebrated there, in which only women were aſſiſtant, though ſeveral of the Ceremonies were very licentious: You may read elſewhere (if you pleaſe) the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues betwixt <hi>Ceres, Baubo,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which made a great part of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>One thing is remarkable in the Quarter called <hi>Aſti,</hi> that it is ſo full of Temples, and Monuments of Piety, that there is ſcarce room for private Houſes: You have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it in <hi>Paris</hi>; from the <hi>Palais</hi> to <hi>Noſtre Dame</hi> (which lies as it were in the Arms of the <hi>Seine</hi> that runs of each ſide of it) the Churches are ſo thick, as almoſt to touch one another: You may number them at your leiſure.</p>
            <p>To the Eaſtward of the Temple dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Jupiter Olympicus,</hi> there was another dedicated to <hi>Lucina,</hi> called by the <hi>Greeks Elithia,</hi> and another to <hi>Serapis.</hi> The place where <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Pyrithous</hi> ſwore amity, was not far from it. The Street of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Tripods</hi> ran from thence to the <hi>Pryta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,</hi> and croſſed another place called al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Sacred <hi>Tripods,</hi> in which there had been a ſtately Temple of the ſame name,

adorned with the Statue of a Satyr, one of the moſt excellent of <hi>Praxitiles</hi> his pieces, is will appear by this following Story. <hi>Praxitiles</hi> was enamour'd of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Phryne,</hi> who for a long time imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her entreaties and careſſes to make him tell her which was the beſt piece he ever had made; not being able to prevail that way, ſhe got it out of him by an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. She corrupted one of his Servants, and obtained of him to come running in to him in a great fright, and ſurprize <hi>Praxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> with the news, that his Work-houſe had been on fire, but that only a certain number of his Pictures were burned: In ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſcompoſure <hi>Praxitiles</hi> cryed out, Unhappy man that I am, I am utterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In this Street there was formerly a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Market-place, in which there ſtood a Court or Tribunal, called in thoſe days <hi>Trigonon,</hi> and at ſome diſtance Southward of the <hi>Prytaneum</hi> there were three other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals that had been anciently very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>

               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:94489:147"/>At a ſmall diſtance from thence we paſſed into the Quarter of <hi>Lymnae,</hi> conſiderable for the Famous Temple of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> In that Quarter we ſaw a place called <hi>Lymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machiae,</hi> where the youth of the City were accuſtomed to exerciſe themſelves at Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Fiſty-cuffs. We ſaw another place that was again become a Meadow after a long intermiſſion, having been drained and built with many fair houſes. This Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was anciently called <hi>Lenaeon,</hi> and had on one ſide of it a famous Grove of Poplar-Trees called <hi>Aegyron.</hi> The Peaſants when they brought their Comedies to <hi>Athens,</hi> began their Recreations there; and the people of the City made uſe of the Trees in that <hi>Aegyron</hi> to build the Scaffolds upon which they placed themſelves to behold their ruſtick repreſentations.</p>
            <p>In that Meadow we obſerved a little Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and followed it againſt the ſtream, in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to know whither it would lead us; it brought us to the famous Fountain <hi>Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acrunos,</hi> called anciently <hi>Callirhoe</hi>; it is much fallen from its ancient magnificence. In ſtead of the coſt and new Tyle that <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> beſtowed upon it, there is nothing to be ſeen now in it, buy the green Turf of the Meadow. Being deſirous to taſt of the Waters, I found them excellent; and our
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94489:147"/>
               <hi>Germans,</hi> contrary to the Genius of their Nation, in ſpight of the <hi>Lepanthe</hi> our <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizary</hi> had brought in his Flasks, fell as heartily to the Water and were as well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But among all theſe variety of objects, we were ſenſible there was one ſtill wanting, and caſting our Eyes up and down, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered behind the Trees, among the Graſs, what we ſought for, and that was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the firſt Theatre in the world. We had no ſooner got to it, but <hi>Dreſlington</hi> cryed out in his facetious way, At length we have found it, and are arrived at the illuſtrious Throne of four great Empreſſes, <hi>Melpomene</hi> the Empreſs of Tragedy; <hi>Thalia</hi> of Comedy; <hi>Euterpe</hi> of Paſtorals, and <hi>Calliope</hi> of other Verſe. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of this Theatre is ſtill viſible, and we judged of the magnificence of the whole by the ruines that remained. Moſt part of the ancient Buildings in <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> that are either half, or utterly demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, may one day poſſibly be repaired, or ſomething built in imitation; but this excellent piece of Antiquity is of a ſort that can never be reſtored: For though both Princes and People do ſtill retain their old love and inclination to thoſe kind of ſhows, yet now adays they rather affect and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94489:148"/>
endeavour convenience than magnificence in their Theatres, I hold my ſelf obliged therefore as much as in me lies to preſerve the memory of ſo unimitable a Fabrick, and to pick out of Ancient Authors, and from my own obſervation of the place, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts that compoſed it, ſeeing ſcarce any one of them has given us a particular deſcription: I muſt be free with you in this, and acknowledge, that if any where, here it is that I expect you ſhould value my obſervation, and the curioſity of my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. Among all the things of which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authors have treated, the conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Theatres is the moſt obſcure and imperfect, and delivered with moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. <hi>Vitruvius</hi> has left us in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and given us no account of its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſituation, nor number of its principal and conſtituting parts, preſuming I ſuppoſe that they had been well enough known, or could never have periſhed. For example, he does not determine the quantity of the <hi>Diazoma</hi> or <hi>Praecinctiones,</hi> which we call <hi>Coridors, Retraittes, Paillers,</hi> which are ſeveral rows of Benches. Beſides, in things that he does ſpecifie, he ſets down ſuch rules as we find actually were never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; as when he tells us of two ſorts of heights obſerved in the building of their
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94489:148"/>
ſtairs, it is manifeſt that neither the one nor the other have any proportion with what are ſtill remaining of the Ancient Theatres and <hi>Amphitheatres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among our Modern Writers, the Jeſuite <hi>Gallutius Sabienus,</hi> and the learned <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> have omitted the moſt eſſential parts; and the unformed maſs of <hi>Bulengerus</hi> his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are enough to fright any mans cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; ſome of them we have conſulted our ſelves, as <hi>Atheneus, Heſychius, Pollux, Euſtathius, Suidas,</hi> and others, but all their light is ſo weak and imperfect, that had we not viewed the ground, we had been ſtill in the dark: But our curioſity putting it into our minds to take an exact plane of it in <hi>Profile,</hi> we had opportunity to conſider th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> real meaſures and proportions of the parts ſtill viſible in <hi>Athens,</hi> and comparing them with rational preſumptions taken out of ſuch Authors as had imparted to us the uſe of ſuch parts as were abſolutely demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, they ſupplyed us with probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of all their dimenſions.</p>
            <p>We made uſe of Rule, divided accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common foot among the ancient <hi>Athenians,</hi> not much differing from that we uſe now in <hi>France,</hi> which exceeds the preſent meaſure in <hi>Athens</hi> about eight or nine lines; ſo that three of our feet in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94489:149"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> is more than three <hi>Athenian</hi> feet by above two thumbs breadth; ſo then a hundred of their feet anſwer to about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four of ours, and ſome ſix inches, reſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little fractions to avoid cavil in our Calculation; ſo that you muſt remember to judge of all the following meaſures by the <hi>French</hi> computation. By this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent we found with what equity the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents called this Edifice <hi>Hecatompedon,</hi> for we perceived that the ſemidiameter of our Plane or Ground-plat was forty ſeven foot and three inches, which made the diameter to ariſe to a hundred of their feet, and gave it the name of <hi>Hecatompedon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the word Theatre, the Ancients in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the whole building where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Aſſembled to ſee any of their publick repreſentations. The famous Architect <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> built this in the time of <hi>Pericles,</hi> above two thouſand years ſince; and <hi>Philos</hi> deſign was followed by <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> King of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> who repaired it the firſt time, as the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> did afterwards. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted without, of three rows of <hi>Portico</hi>'s o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Galleries, one above the other, and within there were two principal places, one for the Spectators, and the other for the Spectacle themſelves. The parts deſigned for the Spectators were the <hi>Coniſtra</hi> or Pit, the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94489:149"/>
rows of Benches called the <hi>Diazoma,</hi> the little ſtairs, the <hi>Circys,</hi> and the <hi>Echea</hi>; the parts appropriated to the Actors were the <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> the <hi>Hypoſcenion,</hi> the <hi>Logeon</hi> or <hi>Thimele,</hi> the <hi>Proſcenion,</hi> the <hi>Paraſcenion,</hi> and the <hi>Scene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To take a Plane of this Ediſice, a circle was drawn whoſe ſemidiameter conſiſted of forty ſeven foot and three inches: Having made our Circle, we retrench'd a fourth part, and drew a line of ninety degrees, which line determined the front of the Scene, that is to ſay, the front or face of the Decorations, for properly the word <hi>Scene</hi> imports nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>The ſmall part of the diameter, which the line of ninety degrees had cut behind the <hi>Scene</hi> was about fourteen foot; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen foot from the ſaid Line to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the centre of the Circle, a Line was drawn parallel with the face or front of the <hi>Proſcenion,</hi> (for (as I ſaid before) ſo it is that they call an elevation or plat-form that was peculiar to the <hi>Comedians</hi>) ſo that the breadth and depth of that place was eighteen foot compleat; and the face or front of the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> retrenching one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty two degrees and forty ſix mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of the circumference of the Circle, the remainder, that is to ſay, two hundred
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:94489:150"/>
and ſeventeen degrees and fourteen minutes was the full circumference of the inward part of the Theatre; ſo that the draught was more than a ſemicircle, contrary to the general Opinion that it was a perfect <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micycle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bottom or lower part of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference they called <hi>Coniſtra,</hi> or the <hi>Pit</hi>; the <hi>Romans</hi> called it <hi>Arena.</hi> In <hi>Athens</hi> the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> took up ſome part of the <hi>Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra,</hi> inſomuch that ſome have miſtaken a part for the whole, and called it all <hi>Orche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra:</hi> This corruption, or promiſcuous uſe of words proceeded eſpecially from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; and it is remarkable, that though the <hi>Roman</hi> Theatres had almoſt the ſame parts with the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and thoſe parts had almoſt the ſame names; yet there was great difference betwixt their proportions, ſituations and uſes: But it is our Province to deſcribe the <hi>Greek</hi> Theatres, and to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no farther with the <hi>Roman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inward building of the Threatre ran along like the arch of a Circle to the two corners of the <hi>Proſcenion</hi>; and in that part of the circumference were erected four and twenty rows of ſeats or benches which went round the <hi>Coniſtra</hi> or <hi>Pit,</hi> and were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Spectators: Theſe benches were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, eight and eight, by three <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridor</hi>'s
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94489:150"/>
or paſſages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the <hi>Athenians</hi> called <hi>Diazoma</hi>; they were of the ſame figure with the rows of ſeats, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the paſſage of the Spectators from one ſtory to another, without incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe who were placed before; and for the ſame convenience there were little ſtairs that paſſed from one <hi>Coridor</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croſs the ſeveral rows; and not far from thoſe ſtairs there were doors by which the people entred from the Galleries on the outſide, and took their places as they thought fit.</p>
            <p>The beſt places were reckoned upon the eight ranks betwixt the eight and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth, and that ſpace was it which they called <hi>Bouleuticon,</hi> deſigned for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Offices of Juſtice: The other rows were called <hi>Ephebicon,</hi> and were proper to the Citizens after they were eighteen years of age.</p>
            <p>The height of each of theſe rows of benches was about thirteen inches, their breath about two and twenty; but the loweſt bench was near four foot high from the level of the floor: each ſtep of the ſtairs was but half the height of the benches, and as their height was but half, ſo was their breadth. The height and breadth of the <hi>Coridor</hi>'s or paſſages was double the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94489:151"/>
height and breadth of the benches; but the ſtairs were not parallel, for the ſpaces betwixt them grew ſharper as they came near the Pit, and ended in the figure of a wedge, from whence by the <hi>Romans</hi> they were called <hi>Cunei</hi>; and to prevent the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the rain upon thoſe ſteps, there were certain pent-houſes ſet up to carry off the water.</p>
            <p>Along the <hi>Coridors</hi> at convenient diſtance in the thickneſs of the wall were certain holes, in which were placed little veſſels or kettles of braſs open towards the Scene, and with little holes for an uſe that I ſhall mention by and by. Theſe holes or cells were called by the <hi>Athenians Echaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above the upper <hi>Coridor</hi> there was a Gallery called <hi>Cercys,</hi> where their Women were placed; but thoſe who were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or irregular in their lives, had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place by themſelves. In this <hi>Cercys</hi> they placed likewiſe ſuch Strangers and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as were free of that City; for none could be admitted there but ſuch as had their freedom.

Scaurus</hi> the <hi>Edilis</hi>; for in that there was room for ſeventy nine thouſand perſons; a good Geometrician will eaſily compute the number of perſons that this would hold, and he who deſires it may take the pains to inform himſelf: there was a foot and half allowed for every mans place; and this we may conclude, that the people aſſembling there many times to regulate diſorders in the State, there muſt be room at leaſt for ſix thouſand men; for by the Attick Laws there were of neceſſity to be ſix thouſand ſuffrages to make a decree of the people authentick.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the place appointed for the Spectators. As to that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the Actors, the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> (being an elevation out of the <hi>Coniſtra</hi> or Pit) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about fifty four foot from the front of the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> or Poſt of the Comedians, and ended at the <hi>Proſcenion.</hi> The height of the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> was about four foot from the ground: Its figure was a long ſquare divided from the ſeats of the Spectators: In certain places of this <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> were the Muſick, the Chorus, and the Mimicks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently diſpoſed: Among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was put to a more honourable uſe, for the Emperour, the Senate, and the Veſtals had their places upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:94489:152"/>Upon the flat of the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> towards the place of the Comedians, was another elevation or plat-form called <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> or <hi>Thimele,</hi> which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was called <hi>Pulpitum</hi>; from the <hi>Coniſtra</hi> or Pit this <hi>Logeon</hi> was raiſed about nine foot, and five from the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi>; the figure of the <hi>Logeon</hi> was ſquare, and had four and twenty foot of a ſide: there it was the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi> practiſed their Interludes, and the <hi>Chorus</hi> made their Recitations.</p>
            <p>At the foot of the <hi>Logeon</hi> upon the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſtra</hi> was a row of Pillars incompaſſing a place called the <hi>Hypoſcenion,</hi> and this was a part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Theatres that Modern Writers have not well underſtood; ſome have confounded it with the <hi>Podion,</hi> or place within the Balliſters, betwixt the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenion</hi> and the <hi>Scene</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres: But that Opinion is manifeſtly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, from the difference both of their uſes and ſituation: I will make it more clear to you if ever I return to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence I deſign you a deſcription of the Theatre of <hi>Marcellus</hi>; others will have the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenion</hi> to be the forepart of the <hi>Proſcenion</hi> contained in the ſpace betwixt the floor of the <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> and the flat of the <hi>Proſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> but I ſhall confute that fancy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:94489:152"/>The <hi>Hypoſcenion</hi> therefore was a place upon the <hi>Orcheſtra</hi> for the convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Muſick, and perſons belonging to the <hi>Logeon</hi>; for the <hi>Chorus</hi> and Mimicks kept ſtill in the <hi>Hypoſcenion</hi> till their parts in the repreſentation obliged them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the <hi>Logeon.</hi> The Poets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſate likewiſe in the <hi>Hypoſcenion,</hi> and what I ſay, is juſtified by <hi>Atheneus,</hi> when he tells us that <hi>Aſopodorus Philiaſius</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the unjuſt acclamations of the people, among whom all things are many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded; for he obſerves, that <hi>Aſopodorus</hi> being in the <hi>Hypoſcenion,</hi> and hearing the obſtreperous approbation that was given to a player upon a Flute, What is this for? cryed he, my life for it, it is ſome new ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm that they are taken with; from whence it is plain, it paſſed not for a front or outſide, but for a certain place where <hi>Aſopodorus</hi> had placed himſelf, either to ſit out the whole Play, or perhaps only in his paſſage to ſome other place, which indeed it probably implyed, for his words are, <hi>being already in the Hypoſcenion.</hi>

            <p>The compaſs of the <hi>Hypoſcenion</hi> was the ſame with the <hi>Logeon</hi>; its breadth was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix or ſeven foot: but to be ſhort, the <hi>Logeon,</hi> the <hi>Hypoſcenion,</hi> the <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> and the <hi>Coniſtra</hi> are four diſtinct places which

               <hi>Paraſcenion</hi> was a general word for the whole ſpace before and behind the <hi>Scene,</hi> and the ſame name was given to all the avenues, and paſſages from the Muſick-room, to the place where the Actors kept.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> oftentimes made uſe of <hi>Machines,</hi> the principal of which was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Theologeon</hi>; it was generally in the air, and brought in the Gods when the Poets thought fit to introduce them: For that reaſon it is, that among the Learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients they are ſo much decryed, being (as they believed) of no other uſe but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſterility of the Poet, whoſe brains growing muddy, and unable by natural or ingenious extrication, to clear himſelf of ſome indecorum or perplexity in his plot, brings himſelf off in a moment by bringing in one of the Gods upon a <hi>Theologian,</hi> who by his pure authority, and an unſeaſonable and ridiculous contrivance, in a moment, from ſome remote place brings a man home to his own Country; reſtores a man to health who had been ſick, or reſcues ſome body from the calamities of a Priſon; a fancy ſo inſufferably idle, that the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:94489:154"/>
have in raillerie turned it to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, and when they ſee a man at a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, and ignorant what to do, they cry out in deriſion, <hi>Apo Micanis,</hi> as the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in <hi>Rome</hi> upon the ſame occaſion were wont to ſay, <hi>Deus è Machina; Now for a God from a Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, we are not to believe the Comedies of the Ancients were altogether ſo profane as ſome would repreſent them; for when their Gods came forth in the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologeon, Tully</hi> tells us, <hi>Ex ea (Machina) Dii effata ſaepe fabantur, homines ad virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem excitabant, à vitio deterrebant: From thence the Gods did many times deliver their Precepts, exciting men to Virtue, and deterring them from Vice.</hi>

the corrupt and debauched ſuffrage of the people, came to <hi>Philemon</hi> in the midſt of his acclamations, and whiſpering in his Ear, asked him, <hi>whether he was not aſhamed of his Victory?</hi> This <hi>Menander</hi> was a famous Poet, had made a hundred and five Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but never gained the Prize but for eight: <hi>Euripides</hi> was another who had made ſixty Comedies, and fifteen Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet never came off Conquerour but in five.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a deſcription of the Theatre of <hi>Leneon</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which Theatre was imployed not only for their publick Plays, and ſpectacles, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of State; but ſometimes as Schools for the eminent Philoſophers to read in to their Diſciples; nor were Theatres ſo much decryed in the Primitive times as ſome would perſwade us: The Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was originally taught there; <hi>Cajus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> were carried forcibly out of the Theatre at <hi>Epheſus</hi> as they were expounding the Goſpel; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> was intreated by his Diſciples not to hazard himſelf there for fear of the like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Before I had ſeen and conſidered this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick in <hi>Athens,</hi> I could not believe that the excellence and curioſity of Architecture,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:94489:156"/>
was to be ſhown only upon a Theatre: It was not enough for <hi>Philo,</hi> like an admirable Architect, to regard the juſt ſymmetry and proportion of parts, and to make one ſide and the other, the upper and lower part of the Building ſuitable and concurrent; but as well as in Architecture, he ſhew'd great judgment both in Muſick and Phyſick, and indeed there was a kind of neceſſity for it; for the Voice being like to be loſt in an open and ſpacious place, where the Walls, though of Marble, at that diſtance could give little or no repercuſſion to make it audible to the People, <hi>Philo</hi> contrived thoſe Cells or Holes in the thickneſs of the <hi>Coridors,</hi> and in thoſe Cells he placed the Braſs Veſſels that I mentioned before, each of which Kettles was ſupported by a wedge of Iron, and placed in their ſeveral, ſo as not to touch the Wall, that the voice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the mouth of the Actor as from a Center, and being carried circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Coridors,</hi> might ſtrike upon the concavity of thoſe Veſſels, and from them be reverberated with more clearneſs and force: But the Muſick in the <hi>Hypoſcenion</hi> had more advantage; for the Braſs Veſſels being diſpoſed Mathematically, and at a diſtance that agreed exactly with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and modulation of the Muſick, every
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94489:156"/>
Note was ſuſtained and reinforced by reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion from thoſe Veſſels placed there me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically on purpoſe; their number in all were twenty eight.</p>
            <p>To his care for improving the harmony to the people, he added his care for their healths; for carrying always in all his Buildings great regard to that where-ever he lodged or diſpoſed them, he thought it no improper reflexion to conſider that without ſome ſmattering in Phyſick (to underſtand how the Weather and the Sun affected mens bodies) it would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but the pleaſure and tranſport at thoſe ſpectacles, impetuouſly agitating the ſpirits of the ſpectators, muſt needs cauſe an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in their healths, againſt which he provided very well by a judicious placing of the Windows and Columns, and by a learned Oeconomy and diſpoſition of the Winds and Sun, which were admitted or rejected as he pleaſed: but his chiefeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was to the Weſterly Wind, which was received with great care for a particular ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy it has in carrying things far, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to the Ear: But this Wind being commonly infeſted with Vapours, it was his Maſter-piece to turn the Lights of the Galleries with ſuch exactneſs, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>temperance of that Wind might produce
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:94489:157"/>
no rheums nor defluxions among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>Scene</hi> looked out upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Hill, and had the <hi>Cynoſarges</hi> behind it; the <hi>Muſaeon</hi> was on the right hand of it, and the Cauſſey to <hi>Pyraeum</hi> on the left.</p>
            <p>At this day there is nothing remaining of <hi>Eumenicus</hi> his <hi>Portico,</hi> which conſiſted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of a double Gallery divided by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rows of Pillars.

and deprave and debauch the manners of all that are preſent.</p>
            <p>Having examined the Theatre of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> we proceeded to the Fountain <hi>Enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acrunos,</hi> where our Flasks of <hi>Lepanthe</hi> proved as neceſſary as delicious: From thence we paſſed into the Quarter of <hi>Aſti,</hi> to trace out the School of <hi>Epicurus</hi>; for as to his Houſe <hi>Laertius</hi> tells us it was in the Quarter of <hi>Melita,</hi> not far from the School of <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I muſt tell you, that neither Hiſtory nor tradition could give us the leaſt light where it ſtood; only it is agreed by common conſent it was in a Garden belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the old Town. <hi>Pliny</hi> aſſures us that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was the firſt that ever made a Garden within the Walls of that City, and that he did it for the convenience of his School.</p>
            <p>The Sect of <hi>Epicuraeans,</hi> though general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exploded, have notwithſtanding found certain reaſons to excuſe or palliate their doctrine; for though their principal propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is, That pleaſure is the chiefeſt good; yet his Diſciples will tell you that you muſt not be frighted at words, but ſearch deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the merits of the Cauſe, and then you will find that pleaſure is the chiefeſt good, but that that pleaſure conſiſts only in

being virtuous: But however his Enemies have diſparaged and reproached his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is certain many illuſtrious perſons among the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> have followed it, as <hi>Julius Caeſar, Caſſius, Mecenas</hi>; and it is remarkable that <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Morals was never ſo plauſible or acute, as when he began with ſome grave ſentence out of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We continued our walk and viſited the Quarter of <hi>Diomea,</hi> where there was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Tribunal or Court conſiſting of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Judges, as alſo a Temple dedicated to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and called the <hi>Diomean.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Diomean</hi> Gate was at the foot of the Hill <hi>Cynoſarges,</hi> which we aſcended by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and had the proſpect of ſeveral ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines. Upon the top of this Hill it was the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philoſophers kept their School: From the top of this Hill we ſurveyed the whole Quarter of <hi>Aſti,</hi> which put us in mind of a ſtory of <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynick.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> upbraiding his poverty, and interrogating him about his Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had none to live in, he replied, That they themſelves had provided him with variety of noble Buildings, ſhowing them the magnificent Cloiſters in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jupiter Olympicus,</hi> and the Palace of <hi>Polition:</hi> We could eaſily diſcern the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94489:158"/>
foundation of this Temple, and I mention it only to advertiſe you of the errors of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Travellers in their deſcription of its ſituation.</p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Cynoſarge</hi> it was, that illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſpurious Children were expoſed, and a <hi>Gymnaſion</hi> or place of Exerciſe erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; for the Children of Freemen, and Strangers, the <hi>Athenians</hi> confounding them all together. <hi>Plutarch</hi> will tell you with what ſubtilty and addreſs <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> extinguiſhed the diſtinctions of Birth and Quality in that place. There was alſo a Temple conſecrated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> who, though the Son of an Adultereſs, was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and invoked on that account. Not far from the ſaid Temple, was a Court to which any Baſtard that had ſuſpicion of his Father, might cite him, and conſtrain him (if he could prove it) to own him.</p>
            <p>If you will believe the <hi>Athenians,</hi> it was an Advocate or Lawyer in this Court who was the occaſion of that ſmart wipe that <hi>Diogenes</hi> gave the Lawyers and Phyſicians of his time: For a great conteſt hapning in the preſence of <hi>Diogenes</hi> betwixt an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> and a <hi>Phyſician</hi> about places; it being referred to his arbitration, he decided it in his manner, <hi>Praecedat Fur, ſequatur Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Quarter of <hi>Alopece</hi> is at no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in which <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> were born: There is now a large but dry Canal where the Waters of the <hi>Iliſſus</hi> did formerly diſcharge themſelves for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication betwixt the City and Sea; in ſo much that Veſſels came up to the very foot of the <hi>Muſaeon.</hi> There is likewiſe a Grove of Olive-Trees that runs along half way to <hi>Porto-Lione</hi>; and on the other ſide it extends it ſelf from North to South, makes a kind of a Semicircle, and is a great Ornament to the Town.</p>
            <p>Deſcending from the <hi>Cynoſarge,</hi> by that part where the old Monuments were to be ſeen, we found (upon the declenſion) where the <hi>Ereae</hi> ſtood formerly, or the Gate of Sepulchers; from whence ſteering back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Town, we left the Theatre of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94489:159"/>
               <hi>Bacchus</hi> on our left hand, and paſſed by the Tomb of <hi>Talus,</hi> an excellent Artiſt, who invented the Saw, and Paſſer, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Inſtruments. Not far from this Tomb we viewed the Temple of <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and within its Walls the Fountain of <hi>Hallirrothius, Neptune</hi>'s Son, ſlain by <hi>Mars</hi> in that place. Antiquity believed that there was a ſubterraneous paſſage from this Fountain to <hi>Phalerum,</hi> through which ſuch things as were thrown into the ſaid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, were convey'd underground to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our way from thence to the Caſtle we ſaw the Temple of <hi>Themis,</hi> and hard by it the Tomb of the beautiful <hi>Hippolytus</hi> the Son of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> by the <hi>Amazon Hippolyta</hi>; The ſame <hi>Hippolytus</hi> that was ſo much in love with <hi>Phaedra.</hi> Towards the Caſtle, we ſaw likewiſe the Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> ſirnam'd the <hi>Courotrophos</hi>; but now it is called the Temple of the Goddeſs <hi>Terra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Paſſing betwixt the Caſtle Hill and <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>'s Arch; that little interval was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the Temple of <hi>Perdrix</hi> Siſter to <hi>Daedalus</hi>; as likewiſe for the Temple of the <hi>Eumenides</hi> or <hi>Erymnes,</hi> or infernal Furies. The Fountain <hi>Panopis</hi> was anciently there, but now it is dried up, and not far from it was the ancient Gate called <hi>Diocharis,</hi> but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94489:160"/>
we left that on our right hand, as we did the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> and the Gate <hi>Ithonia.</hi> The <hi>Palladion</hi> (a Court conſiſting of a hundred Judges called <hi>Ephetes,</hi> half of <hi>Athens,</hi> and half of <hi>Argos)</hi> was a little lower in the way to <hi>Phalerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we had repoſed our ſelves a little at our Lodgings, as our cuſtom was we fell to our Memoirs, and ſet down what we had obſerved. The next day we review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more curioſity and application what we had but run over the day before; copying ſeveral ancient Inſcriptions; tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing draughts of the Temples and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable pieces of Architecture; ſearching for Meddals; diſcovering the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the <hi>Vecchiados</hi>; regaling our Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page who came to ſee us; and making our Viſits to the <hi>Sardar</hi> and <hi>Cadi</hi> juſt then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Athens.</hi> I tell you our buſineſs, and you may eaſily judge how we were pleaſed: I do aſſure you we paſſed our time very merrily, having nothing but good Cheer and good Company to moleſt us: and as I have told you the virtues, ſo I muſt tell you the vanity of ſome of our people (and it is common among ſtrangers) nothing could ſerve the turn, but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Braſs muſt mention them hereafter in <hi>Athens,</hi> whereupon ſeveral of them writ
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94489:160"/>
their names upon the moſt conſpicuous Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, for want of tools to ingrave them; and in revenge for my laughing at them, they writ mine in two or three Languages, and two or three different terminations.</p>
            <p>In the evening on Saturday the 20. of <hi>May,</hi> when we thought nothing of <hi>Oſman Chelebi,</hi> we ſaw him brought into our houſe by our <hi>Janizary,</hi> to whom the other <hi>Turks</hi> had applyed themſelves to know what he was. Never was ſurprize ſo acceptable, we ran all of us to embrace him. He told us he was going for <hi>Candia</hi> in a Saique that unladed certain Goods at <hi>Parto Lione,</hi> where he hoped to embarque again next morning, and find a company of brave <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Officers that he had left there. I was the man of our whole Gang who made him the leaſt Careſſes, being taken with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſire to go along with him to <hi>Candia,</hi> and take a view of that famous Camp which is not at all underſtood in Chriſtendom, though the condition of the Town be very well known.</p>
            <p>I took <hi>Oſman</hi> aſide, and deſired I might go along with him as his ſlave; at firſt he was averſe, pretending it was unſafe for us both in reſpect of the ſmall acquaintance he had in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, being uncertain whether he ſhould find any of his old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merades
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94489:161"/>
that were with him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and if not, the leaſt ſuſpicion would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to us both. But I was prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe objections, and asked him what it was he could apprehend at <hi>Athens</hi> where his perſon and deſign was utterly unknown, and if there were no danger there, there was leſs in the Camp, from whence Slaves and Renegades came and went ſecurely eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, who in regard of their carriage and language were more ſuſpicious than I. With theſe and ſome other Reaſons he was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and aſſiſted me with a contrivance much better than I could deviſe for my ſelf: He had left at <hi>Porto Lione</hi> a <hi>Turkiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Officer, who was a ſuitor to one of <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha Bey</hi>'s Daughters, and looked upon him as his Brother in Law already. Upon the ſcore of the intimacy betwixt them, <hi>Oſman</hi> did not queſtion but he would do me all poſſible kindneſs, and undertake to ſecure me in my Voyage. This Officer was called <hi>Amurat Aga,</hi> a perſon who had about two months before been ſent from the Camp upon buſineſs of importance that required his ſpeedy return. I was much pleaſed with the expedient, and conjuring their ſecreſie, acquainted my companions with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. My Companions were troubled to loſe me, and the more, becauſe I was their
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94489:161"/>
principal Interpreter. They askt me how I could leave <hi>Athens</hi> at time when they were proceeding to ſuch excellent diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but I anſwered them as <hi>Iſocrates</hi> did thoſe of old, who demanded if there was any Town in the World ſo pleaſant as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Iſocrates</hi> intimating, that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments were pleaſing indeed, but not ſolid enough to detain a man long, replyed very facetiouſly, That <hi>Athens</hi> was fitter for Courtſhip than Marriage; <hi>melior Meretrix quam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Oſman</hi> and I getting up betimes, I took my leave of my Camerades, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given them hopes of ſeeing them ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again, and ſetled our Correſpondencies at <hi>Emporion, Zeithon, Volo,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> embracing with great kindneſs, we parted.</p>
            <p>Taking my leave of <hi>Athens</hi> thus abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I could do no more than ſend you this Deſcription, which I hope you will not think altogether unexact; for doubtleſs thoſe things which eſcaped our curioſity, may have the ſame ſucceſs with thoſe who come after us: however they will do very well if they can diſcover where thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities ſtood that we over-paſſed, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the <hi>Phorbantheon</hi> or Temple dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Phorbas</hi>; the <hi>Eacontheon</hi> or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

We muſt ingenuouſly confeſs we could find nothing of them, nor of the three hundred and ſixty houſes, called <hi>Leſchae,</hi> where the poorer ſort of <hi>Athenians</hi> were provided for by the publick; thoſe Authors having given us no light where they ſtood: Nor can we be ſo audacious, as to preſcribe the preciſe place of the <hi>Ceramicus,</hi> where the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree ſtood, to which they faſtned their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt Women that were ſeen dirty or undreſſed in the ſtreet; for in ſuch caſes every ſuch Woman was condemned in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of a thouſand drachmes, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with the name of the Woman tranſgreſſing in that manner, affixed to the ſaid tree: Their thouſand drachmes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to about three hundred ſeventy five Livers French. A true and faithful diſcovery of theſe places, would (I confeſs) be a great curioſity, and very grateful to all people that are inquiſitive.</p>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94489:166"/>
It is he that muſt ſtrengthen, 'tis he that must inſpire us; and doubtleſs had not be ſided with us in this War with the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we could never have conquered ſo many Provinces, nor ſaved ſo many millions of Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Officers are full of ſuch ſort of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences taken out of their <hi>Azoares,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, the Chapters of their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran.</hi> When his Speech was done, they all embraced, promiſed amendment of their Lives; and an Officer of the <hi>Topigi Baſſi,</hi> or Grand Maſter of the Artillery, who had had formerly ſome quarrel with <hi>Amurat-Aga,</hi> came to him, asked his forgiveneſs, and reconciled himſelf ſo effectually, that ever ſince they have been the beſt, and moſt ſincere friends in the world: But all their Devotions were loſt, for the Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ill ſailer, and finding himſelf unable to come up with us, gave us over, and tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about towards the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> A <hi>French</hi> Renegade of <hi>Provence,</hi> that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board us, told us, the Chriſtians were gone to double the <hi>Cape de Grip,</hi> which it ſeems is a phraſe among the Chriſtian Privateers, and implys that they are Pirates, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute of their Calling.</p>
            <p>One thing I was much amazed at in our great Officer of the Artillery; before we
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:94489:166"/>
were chaſed by the Chriſtian Privateers, all his diſcourſe was of the uſe and execution of Canon, how excellently he could ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage them at Sea, and hit his mark in ſpite of the toſſing and agitation of the waters; yet when it came to the Teſt, he had not wit enough to open a Port-hole: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the <hi>Turks</hi> are the worſt Canoniers in the world, and the moſt unfit to manage a Sea-fight: You may judge then to what purpoſe our valour would have been. We had in our <hi>Saique</hi> a young <hi>Turk</hi> not above three years old, carrying by his Father into <hi>Candia,</hi> to beg a boon of the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi>; the Eunuch, upon appearance of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Corſaire, put a little bow in his hand, and ſet him upon the Decks to threaten the Chriſtian, incouraging him as ſoon as they came within diſtance to call them <hi>Giaours,</hi> (as well as he could) by way of provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defiance.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a new thing to ſee younger Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers than he in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Armies; a Child, of what age ſo ever, is no ſooner poſſeſſed of a <hi>Ziamet,</hi> or a <hi>Timar</hi> upon the death of his Father, but in oſtentation and complement to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Wars: I ſaw one of them in <hi>Hungary</hi> carried upon a Camel in a Pannier, and a Goat along with him, to ſupply the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94489:167"/>
young <hi>Janizary</hi> with milk; and the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> many times diverted himſelf with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ziamets</hi> and <hi>Timars</hi> are certain pieces of ground that the victorious <hi>Turks</hi> have taken from the Clergy and Nobility in the Countrys that they have conquered, which Lands being confiſcated, are given by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> for the maintenance of ſome <hi>Zaim</hi> or <hi>Timariot; Zaim</hi> or <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> being the Title of the Man, and <hi>Ziamet</hi> or <hi>Timar</hi> the appellation of the ground: The difference betwixt a <hi>Ziamet</hi> and a <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> is only in the quantity of Acres, and the value of them; for a <hi>Ziamet</hi> is ſeldom worth leſs than twenty-thouſand <hi>Aſpers per Annum,</hi> if it be under it is called a <hi>Timar</hi>: Twenty thouſand <hi>Aſpers</hi> are worth about ſeventeen hundred Lievers <hi>French</hi> Money, both of which may be transferred by the conſent of the <hi>Beglerby,</hi> or Governour-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Province; but if they be of more than ordinary value, and lye upon the Frontiers, they belong to the <hi>Grand Vizer,</hi> and cannot be transferred but by his approbation.</p>
            <p>The young Soldier that was with us in the <hi>Saique,</hi> went to <hi>Candia</hi> to ſolicite for preferment, which he was very like to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, having had his Father and two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:94489:167"/>
ſlain in the Service. I was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at our firſt coming on board to find that <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> gave out underhand that he was going to <hi>Candia</hi> to beg the ſame <hi>Ziamet</hi> from that young Child; every body blamed his deſign, and I, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an Opinion of his Prudence, thought him indiſcreet in that, as believing the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> a perſon of too much Juſtice and Conſideration to give it away from a perſon whoſe Relations had purchaſed it ſo dearly: But <hi>Oſman</hi> told me privately his deſign was upon another <hi>Ziamet</hi> that was vacant; of which having ſecret notice, he thought fit to publiſh his pretences to the other, to prevent ſolicitations for that. It is not to be imagined with what induſtry and cunning the <hi>Turks</hi> do purſue thoſe kind of preferments. Only the <hi>Janizaries</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as being uncapable of that ſort of preferment. One would have thought thoſe perſons who deſign upon Benefices in <hi>France</hi> have learned from the <hi>Ziams</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> to keep their ſcouts in the Country to give them private advertiſement of Vacancies. In <hi>Candia</hi> the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s (who are in ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the <hi>Grand signior</hi>) are very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in informing themſelves of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> actually in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and have alwayes their ſpies in ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94489:168"/>
upon any deſperate ſervice to give them Liſts of the ſlain, that they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their intereſts to ſucceed them.</p>
            <p>In our paſſage I underſtood many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues both of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court and the Army; for though the <hi>Turks</hi> are not very talkative, and the preſence of the Eunuch made them careful what they ſaid; yet the Renegado of <hi>Provence</hi> being diſpleaſed at their reſervedneſs, and not yet come up to the cloſeneſs and mortification of the <hi>Turks</hi>; cauſed them to talk in ſpight of their teeths. He was come lately from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa,</hi> and ſome of them were very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive about Affairs of the Court; for my own part I ſpake very little, as fearing I might be ſuſpected, but I put <hi>Oſman Chele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> upon asking him ſeveral queſtions that gave me great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>About the height of <hi>Cerigo</hi> (which we left ſixteen or eighteen Leagues to the Weſt) we met a <hi>Saique</hi> that came on board us: She had been at <hi>Canea</hi> with Victuals, and being upon her return, gave us notice that the <hi>Turks</hi> expected that Town would be ſuddenly beſieged, all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fleets being united in order to that deſign. Thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> who were moſt concerned in the occurrences of the War, arguing among themſelves about the preparation of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94489:168"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> could not imagine they would attempt the <hi>Vizer</hi> in his Camp with a leſs Army than 50000 Men: of which number all their Auxiliary Troops coming much ſhort, they concluded the deſign of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would be rather to give the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſome diverſion by beſieging <hi>Rhodes</hi> or <hi>Canea.</hi> And indeed to beſiege <hi>Canea</hi> would have been in effect to have beſieged the Beſiegers, and force the <hi>Vizer</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move leſt he ſhould be ſhut up in the Iſland; for the Conqueſt of that Town would have cut off his communication with <hi>Morea,</hi> and intercepted his ſupplies. But 'tis a private Maxim among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not to be long obſtinate in a War: They will have Peace (when they ſee their time) at any rate, and accordingly they diſpoſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. We believed therefore (upon this <hi>Saiques</hi> intelligence) that before we ſhould get there, <hi>Canea</hi> would be blocked up; whereupon we ſtood off as far as we could, ſteering our Courſe to the S. E. to put in at <hi>Fraskia</hi> which lies to the Southward of <hi>Cape Sanſona</hi> about nine or ten Leagues from the City of <hi>Candia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being got within five Leagues of <hi>Fraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia,</hi> we diſcovered the Mountains covered with Snow, and particularly the <hi>Mount S. Paul.</hi> Not long after we perceived the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:94489:169"/>
Mountain of <hi>Jupiter</hi> that is hard by <hi>Candie.</hi> We paſſed betwixt the Iſles of <hi>Pelagia</hi> and <hi>Standia,</hi> which lie N. E. and S. W. one of another: at length, the 8. of <hi>May,</hi> we came to an Anchor in <hi>Fraskia,</hi> one of the beſt places in all <hi>Candia</hi> for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and anchoring: at preſent there is very good Water, and formerly there was ſtore of Wood, but the Siege has exhauſted it: 'Tis a Port very commodious for the <hi>Turks,</hi> but yet much infeſted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who are for the moſt part Cruiſing on that ſide, becauſe though on the other ſide <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtro</hi> be nearer <hi>Candia,</hi> yet there is no anchoring but for ſmall Veſſels.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Porto-Lione,</hi> or if you will, from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Candia,</hi> is much the ſame diſtance as from <hi>Breſt</hi> to <hi>Haver de Grace,</hi> or from <hi>Marſeille</hi> to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> that is to ſay about 90 Leagues.</p>

            <p>This Iſle of <hi>Candia</hi> is that which formerly was called <hi>Crete,</hi> famous for the nativity of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Sepulchre is to be ſeen there at this day, but I muſt confeſs I did not ſee it.

            <p>On the North-ſide it looks towards the Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago</hi>; on the Eaſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Cyprus</hi>; on the South toward the Country of <hi>Barca</hi>; and on the Weſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sicily.</hi> 'Tis ſomething larger than <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but leſſer than <hi>Sicily:</hi> Its length from E. to W. that is to ſay, from Cape <hi>Solomon</hi> to Cape <hi>des Gabarouſes</hi> is about 70 Leagues: Its breadth from Cape <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſona</hi> to the Port of <hi>Girotela,</hi> is ſomething more than 20 Leagues.</p>

            <p>We were no ſooner on Shore at <hi>Fraskia,</hi> but ten or twelve <hi>Spahi</hi> or Horſemen came up galloping to examine us; for ſince the report of the approach of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſuccours, they keep exact Watch upon the Coaſt, and having but few Cavalry in their Camp, the greateſt part are diſtributed upon the Roads, and near all the Harbours

               <hi>Mahomet</hi> IV. has a ſcar in his face, which ſcar he received from his Father the laſt year of his Reign; and the occaſion was thus, This young Prince was brought up in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> among the ſhe-ſlaves, where till they are about twelve years old, the <hi>Chez-adde</hi> are generally brought up; <hi>Chez-adde</hi> is the name given to all the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Sons whilſt their Father is living. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> was alwayes in the Arms of the fair <hi>Odaliques</hi>; and ſhe who careſſed him moſt, be would be ſure to be withal: They would make him talk a thouſand ſmart things, ſometimes againſt one, ſometimes againſt another, as quarrels aroſe among them, (and their jealouſie would ſeldom ſuffer them to be long without) with this cuſtom of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

has been pleaſed with any divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to preſent thoſe who entertained him; and all perſons at that time about the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> do conſtantly do it. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlar-Agaſi</hi> and the <hi>Odaliques,</hi> preſented the Mutes immediately, which being neglected by the young Prince, (though to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one of the <hi>Odaliques</hi> had thruſt ſome pieces of Gold into his hand) <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was angry, and turning to him, demanded why he did not preſent the Mutes as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had done; becauſe, ſaid the young Prince very briskly, <hi>I am not ſo much a fool as other people</hi>; the ſharpneſs of his anſwer put <hi>Ibrahim</hi> into a paſſion; in the heat of which, forgetting the Ring upon his finger, he ſtruck him with his hand ſo hard upon his face, that his Diamond cut the skin, and left a ſcar that is to be ſeen at this day. The <hi>Keſlar-Agaſi</hi> carried away the Child immediately with the blood run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about his face, and roaring as loud as if he had been killed: The paſſion of the Emperour being over, and he much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at what he had done, ran after the Child, and in ſuch haſt, that not minding where he went, he tumbled into a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that was in his way; which accident doubling the confuſion, the <hi>Odaliques</hi> that were thronging after the Child, came back,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:94489:175"/>
and pulled the <hi>Sultan</hi> out of the water.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> is of a tender and delicate complexion, but he manages it very ill. The Malecontents (who are very numerous in that Country) call him in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion the <hi>Hunts-man</hi> or <hi>Aviegi.</hi> He takes great delight in the noiſe of Canon, and has them often ſhot off only for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. He ſhoots very well both with the Bow and the Musket: He is very cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and extreamly deſirous to be in perſon with his Army, whatever the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians publiſh to the contrary, imagining that his great affection to hunting, and his propenſity to the pleaſures of Women, makes him apprehenſive of the hazards of War. Would his Council have permitted it, he had been long ſince in <hi>Candia</hi>; ſuch was his zeal to be in the Army, that he threatned oftentimes to ſteal to them in diſguiſe; and when being a hunting, he was at any time loſt, and failed to return at his accuſtomed hours, the whole Court was afraid he had given them the ſlip: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that his being in the field would have eclipſed the Glory of the <hi>Vizer,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him of leſs importance to his affairs; the abſence of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and the dangers to which he would have been expoſed, would have enhaunced the courage of the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:94489:176"/>
Malecontents, and ſuch who having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the murther of his Father, were afraid of his revenge, and did ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire his death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> will tell you wonders of his Wit: But every Nation cryes up the viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Prince; This is moſt certain, he had for his Tutor a perſon called <hi>Vani Effendi,</hi> one that paſſes for ſo worthy and ſo learned a Man, that if any one pretends to extraordinary Judgement or Sagacity in any thing, the <hi>Turks</hi> by way of Irony will tell him, <hi>Yes, you are wiſer, and underſtand more than</hi> Vani Effendi.</p>
            <p>Among all the Brothers of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> the Peoples eyes are fixt moſt ſtrongly upon <hi>Soliman,</hi> whoſe Mother being dead, has procured him the compaſſion of the Army more than any of the reſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence expoſed him more to the jealouſie of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who had like to have ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him with his dagger at <hi>Adrianople</hi> in the year 1666. ſome months before the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> went for <hi>Candia,</hi> where he has continued ever ſince: The particulars you ſhall have hereafter. Since that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have taken a greater care of the lives of <hi>Soliman</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by an action as couragious as prudent, have put them under the tuition

of the <hi>Sultaneſs Validè</hi> the Mother of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> but with caution that ſhe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for them, though they do well underſtand that ſhe would ſacrifice them all to the intereſt of the <hi>Sultan</hi>: And indeed nothing can be more ſtrange than to ſee the Sheep committed to the cuſtody of the Wolf. This <hi>Sultaneſs</hi> is a Lady of great Magnanimity and Spirit. In the beginning of her Sons Reign ſhe cauſed the old <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidè</hi> widow to <hi>Achmet</hi> to be ſtrangled. That old Lady was an ambitious Woman, who to keep her ſelf in the Supreme Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Affairs fomented the diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Spahi</hi> and the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who were the death of her Son <hi>Ibrahim.</hi>

At the end of three years (which is the common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

of thoſe <hi>Sangiacats) Coprogli</hi> not having been able to pay all the money to the Emperour for which he had contracted, was a fair way to have loſt his head, had it not been for the friendſhip of ſome in the <hi>Divan</hi> or Council of State, who obtained for him the Government of <hi>Alepo</hi> to ſee how that would inable him; but he was no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier there than where he was before, or rather he was no more corrupt or exacting, for the people do magnifie him for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; but that is not ſo good as ready money with the <hi>Turks,</hi> eſpecially now a-days, when the whole Treaſure of that Prince is nothing but the fruit of Violence and Extortion.

moſt turbulent Officers among them; moſt of which were cut off either at the taking of <hi>Waradin,</hi> or in the ſeveral skirmiſhes of <hi>Ragoteki.</hi> Afterwards they were forced to raiſe their Siege from before <hi>Clauſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> (the uſual reſidence of the <hi>Hoſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars)</hi> but however that Enterprize proved ineffectual, it devoured many of their beſt men.

They were unanimouſly bent upon affrighting the Emperour, and if poſſible, deſtroying him. <hi>Coprogli Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet</hi> to obviate their deſigns, and make an Example of theſe ſeditious Officers, had cauſed the famous <hi>Delli <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſani Pacha</hi> (Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in <hi>Candia,</hi> and as brave a man as ever was among the <hi>Turks)</hi> to be ſtrangled.

the ſeven Towers, with ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers taken in the Wars of <hi>Candia,</hi> and ſent Priſoners thither.

            <p>
               <hi>Coprogli</hi> was married to an illuſtrious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who as I told you is ſtill living, and in <hi>Candia</hi> promoting the affairs of her Son. She is called <hi>Fateima Kadun</hi>; She is a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a large Soul, and a Wit infinitely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt of her Sex, as appeared by her ſubtilty in advancing her Son to the dignity of his Father, which was without preſident, for till that time it was never known that the Son ſucceeded the Father in ſo important a charge. The Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Death-bed, the <hi>Validè</hi> Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> underſtanding there was no hopes of his recovery, ſent to viſit him the ſix other <hi>Vizers</hi> who made up the <hi>Divan,</hi> of which they were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but the <hi>Grand Vizer,</hi> the head, and indeed abſolute Maſter: Their order was to confer with him about the myſteries of State which had been committed only to him. <hi>Fateima Kadun</hi> having notice of their Viſit, and deſigning to make the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of her Son, perſwaded her dying Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to pretend himſelf ſpeechleſs, which
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94489:182"/>
he did, and the <hi>Vizers</hi> being admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him really incapable of any ſuch diſcourſe, and accordingly complained very heavily how much his being ſpeechleſs would be prejudicial to the intereſt of the Empire. <hi>Fateima</hi> interrupting them, told them, You ſee by misfortune my Husband is unable to adviſe you any farther, but there is his Son with whom he has depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all thoſe ſecrets that concern the State; he is the only perſon can advance, he is the only perſon can perplex the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; my humble advice to the <hi>Sultan</hi> is, that he would ſpeedily conſider what he is to do, and either prefer my Son to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Father, or ſtrangle him; that if he may do his Majeſty no ſervice, it may not be in his power to hurt him. Her Counſel being reported to the <hi>Validè,</hi> who was well acquainted with the abilities of <hi>Achmet Pacha,</hi> it made ſuch an impreſſion upon her, that ſhe gave ear to <hi>Fateima</hi>'s Propoſition, as having loved her very well, and converſed her often when her greater Negotiations brought her to the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer.</hi> By this Stratagem <hi>Achmet Pacha</hi> was ſworn <hi>Vizer Azem</hi> in the place of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and (as an addition to the wonder) when he was ſcarce thirty years old, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as till him, never any was advanced to that
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94489:182"/>
Honour before forty at the leaſt. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1662.</p>
            <p>The new <hi>Vizer Coprogli Achmet Pacha</hi> following the maximes of his Father, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to proſecute the War in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> if poſſible to extinguiſh the Mutineers that remained among the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> before he revived his old quarrel in <hi>Candia.</hi> But the intereſts of <hi>Hungary</hi> having ingaged the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> in its relief, the new <hi>Vizer</hi> in the year 1663. came in perſon to the Army, which before was commanded by <hi>Ali Pacha,</hi> and that <hi>Campagnia</hi> took <hi>New-hauſel:</hi> The next year 1664. he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Siege of <hi>Caniſia,</hi> and carried a Fort by ſtorm from Count <hi>Nicholas de Serini</hi>; after which he attempted to paſs the River <hi>Rhaab</hi> under the noſes of the Chriſtian Army, with deſign to have made an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and haraſſed that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and he had proceeded ſo far as to have broken and cut off a conſiderable body of the <hi>German</hi> Forces, under the Command of the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> when being incounter'd and ſtop'd in his Carier by a Squadron of <hi>French,</hi> who (animated by the bravery of the Duke <hi>de Fuillade)</hi> took the Poſt which the <hi>Germans</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned, defeated a ſelect body of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and beat the whole Party over the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94489:183"/>
River. This great Victory obtained in the latter end of the year 1664. obliged the <hi>Vizer Azem</hi> to conclude a Peace with the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi>; after which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his ſervices, and the qualification of his perſon recommended him ſo highly to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that ever ſince he has had the ſole Government of his Affairs.</p>
            <p>The next year 1665. was ſpent in ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Peace, in ſuppreſſing private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and defeating the deſign of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party (who had eſpouſed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Brothers) and in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the War in <hi>Candia.</hi> All the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers about the <hi>Sultans</hi> Perſon, and all the Members of the <hi>Divan,</hi> who were any wayes ſuſpicious, were removed by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pretences, and their places ſupplyed by his Creatures: But in the Army he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the old Officers on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, no ſolid preferment is to be got, or at leaſt enjoy'd long, without his protection. When upon neceſſity of his abſence he has diſpoſed about the perſon of the <hi>Sultan</hi> certain young Favourites to entertain and attend the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in his Sports, if by imprudence, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency they have given the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> any
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:94489:183"/>
occaſion of jealouſie, he has found wayes immediately to ſupplant them. He has at preſent, as Favourite to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> placed about him a young Gentleman of <hi>Cogna</hi> in <hi>Natolia,</hi> his name is <hi>Koulogli Mouſaip,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>the Favourite Son of a Slave.</hi> He is of his perſon a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome man, an excellent Huntſman, rides well, and in a word, performs all the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Exerciſes with great dexterity. This <hi>Koulogli Mouſaip</hi> (being much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet than any of thoſe who had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the ſame ſtation, and been ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled by the <hi>Vizer</hi>) is very well ſatisfied, that to continue a Favourite with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> he muſt not give the leaſt umbrage to the <hi>Vizer</hi>; and therefore he avoids all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mentioning Publick Affairs to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> unleſs it be to magnifie the Exploits of his Chief Miniſter. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, that he never concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any great thing but once, and that was when meeting one day in the ſtreets of <hi>Adrianople</hi> a poor <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſt of his own Town <hi>Cogna,</hi> with whom he had been well acquainted in his minority, he called him to him, and after ſeveral careſſes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of kindneſs, offered to make him <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which the poor <hi>Papas</hi> thought too great for his conduct,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:94489:184"/>
and contented himſelf with an Alms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Port</hi> reſolving to make a ſtrong At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach upon <hi>Candia,</hi> the <hi>Sultan</hi> left <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1666. and is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, nor like to be in a long time; and all, to humble the Citizens of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who have been too forward in their concurrence with the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> deſigning thereby to chaſtiſe their malevolence, and make them ſenſible of the incommodities that enſue upon the abſence of their Prince. The <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> attended him as far as <hi>Adrianople,</hi> from whence the <hi>Sultan</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to <hi>Methoca</hi> a City in <hi>Romania,</hi> in an excellent Countrey for Hunting, the <hi>Vizer</hi> took his leave, and croſſing <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> he arrived at <hi>Thebes,</hi> where he continued for ſome time, till the Troops that were to attend him could be brought together. They took their March by the Famous <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> called at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Hexamile,</hi> and came to imbark ſome at <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> anciently called <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plion</hi> in the Province of <hi>Argos,</hi> and part at <hi>Porto-delle-Botte</hi> which is the old Town of <hi>Cyphanta.</hi> The <hi>Vizer</hi> himſelf imbarked at <hi>Malvezie</hi> (called otherwiſe <hi>Monembazie)</hi> and not at <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> as ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have publiſhed.

whoſe Harbour is ſo bad, that a Veſſel that draws but ſix foot water, cannot enter without ſtriking: But the <hi>Vizer</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off in a <hi>Tartan</hi> to a Galley that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with five and forty others for his Convoy to <hi>Canea,</hi> where they landed him ſafely.</p>
            <p>His Mother <hi>Fateima Kadun</hi> had been conveyed thither four dayes before by four Galleys. <hi>Kadun</hi> I have told you (if I be not miſtaken) is as much as Madam with us. This <hi>Fateima</hi> has made it appear, that in <hi>Turkie,</hi> her Sex is neither ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor ſo much contemned as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Her Magnanimity is ſo great, that I muſt tell you, as the whole Eaſtern world is convinced of the Potency of her Son, ſo they are ſenſible her intereſt with him is ſuch, that ſhe governs him abſolutely, and by conſequence manages the whole Affairs of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vizer</hi> remained four months at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi> to inform himſelf of the condition of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and prepare himſelf for the Siege of <hi>Candia.</hi> The beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1667. he brought his Army to a Rendez-vouz at <hi>New Candia,</hi> an old Caſtle with a few pittiful houſes about it, ſome two leagues from the City. About fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years before, the Famous <hi>Delli <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſain
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:94489:185"/>
Pacha</hi> leaving that Iſland to go (as I ſaid before) and finiſh his dayes miſerably at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Troops that he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, intrenched themſelves at <hi>New-Candia,</hi> and called it <hi>Eina-die,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>harm watch, harm catch</hi>; For the <hi>Venetian</hi> Garriſon making frequent Excurſions, and the <hi>Turks</hi> being as buſie from thence, gave it the name of <hi>Eina-die,</hi> and in my judgement with a great deal of propriety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Genzar-Aga,</hi> or <hi>Maiſtre de Camp</hi> to the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> being a Creature of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> took a general view of his Army at <hi>Eina-die,</hi> and found them complete fifty thouſand men, beſides about fourteen thouſand Pioneers, and ſeveral Victualers, and ſuch kind of people following the Camp. Moſt of the Pioneers were forced out of the Iſlands in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> and <hi>Morea</hi>; the Army having ruined their Huts at <hi>Fina-die,</hi> advanced againſt <hi>Candia,</hi> where the <hi>Vizer</hi> met them from <hi>Canea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Candia</hi> was called formerly <hi>Cytaeon,</hi> not much differing from <hi>Cytion</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where <hi>Zeno</hi> was born, who was the Founder of the Sect of the <hi>Stoicks.</hi> This <hi>Candia</hi> (in Ancient Times ſo Famous for its bigneſs and wealth, that in the Reign of the laſt Emperours of the Eaſt it denominated
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:94489:185"/>
the whole Iſland) is ſcarce cognoſcible now but by the glorious reliques of its ramparts, which notwithſtanding have, and do ſtill reſiſt the ſtrongeſt Efforts that ever the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſtrength has been able to make.</p>
            <p>'Tis the common talk of thoſe parts, that never City has ſuſtained ſo fierce a Siege ſo long a time; perhaps they may reckon for one Siege all the Encampments that the <hi>Turks</hi> have made there from the year 1647. when they belcaguered it firſt, for when they diſcontinued their formal Leaguer, they blocked it up ſo cloſe for above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years together, that the Garriſon durſt not ſtir out above Cannon-ſhot from the Walls; and in that ſenſe it has been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the longeſt Siege that has been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Town is fortified with ſeven Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, five towards the Iſland, and two (<hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Sabonniera)</hi> towards the Sea: Theſe two are in a ſtreight Line at the two ends of the Harbour, which is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dramata,</hi> and looks toward the North. About a year ſince, the <hi>Turks</hi> quitted their old Works that they had raiſed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt the Baſtions towards the Iſland, and turned their approaches upon the two Baſtions towards the Sea. On the <hi>Sabon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niera</hi>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:94489:186"/>
ſide they preſs not ſo hard, by reaſon the ground conſiſting much of ſand, their Works are apt to moulder as faſt as they make them: But the hotteſt ſervice is on the ſide of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> where their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are carried on by the Sea ſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of an Artificial Mountain which they removed thither from another place.</p>
            <p>The Poſt of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> is a kind of half Baſtion, built only with a Flank that ſcoures towards the Fort of <hi>Panigra,</hi> but towards the Sea, it is only a Plat-form that flanks nothing, and has nothing to flank it.</p>
            <p>'Tis a ſtrange thing, that for twenty years together, both beſiegers and beſieged ſhould have neglected this Poſt. Standing upon a hard Rock, the <hi>Turks</hi> thought it unminable, and therefore unapproachable; and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believed themſelves ſafe there by the meer nature of the place: But both of them were miſtaken, and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> worſt of all, for the place muſt be ſuddenly relieved, or it will be certainly loſt, and had it not been for an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which the <hi>French</hi> ſignalized their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and courage, the Town had been taken on that ſide by a <hi>demy Gorge,</hi> which is a piece of Fortification, that till then was never uſed in any Town, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:94489:186"/>
of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Engineers; the firſt diſcovery of that place was made by certain Renegadoes that ran into the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Camp, where there are but too many of them: About the latter end of the year 1668. the Duke <hi>de Feuiliade</hi> brought to the ſuccour of the Town four Brigades of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen Commanded by the Count <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Chaſteau-Thierry</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Caderouſe,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Villemor.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de la Motte Tenelon,</hi> had not the Command of a Brigade, as being left free to execute the extraordinary Commands of the Duke <hi>de Feuillade,</hi> who adviſed with him in every thing; and this by accident gave him means to do the beſieged the moſt ſignal piece of ſervice that could be expected from any one Man; for viewing the Works on that ſide, he perceived the <hi>Turks</hi> were Maſters of all the ground betwixt the Fort St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and the Sea; had planted their Batteries, fixed their Lodgements, and provided very well for the ſecurity of their Poſts; and which was moſt dreadful to him, they were battering the <hi>Scotch</hi> Work, which was the only place that could give any defence to a breach they had already made in the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie-Gorge.</hi> The <hi>Scotch</hi> Work was an old Tower in the middle of a Wall that flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:94489:187"/>
the <hi>Demie-Gorge</hi> ſo effectually, that if that Flanker was made unſerviceable, the Town was impoſſible to be defended. The Marqueſs <hi>de la Motte Tenelon</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated all this to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and convinced them of the importance of that place, they left it to his care to prevent the great danger which at that time was very preſſing upon them. The firſt thing to be done, was to repair the old <hi>Capponnieres</hi> towards the Sea which they themſelves had deſtroyed, and quitted not long before. A <hi>Capponniere</hi> is a little Lodgement or Poſt for their outermoſt Guards to lye in, it is made of Planks, driven half way into the ground, and lined with earth, in which there was room for about a dozen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Muſqueteers, that ſired upon occaſion out of little holes made to that purpoſe. The <hi>Turks</hi> had brought vaſt quantities of earth, and thrown them upon the <hi>Cappon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,</hi> and thereby brought their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the very foot of the breach. The <hi>Marqueſs</hi> was preſent at the recovery of theſe <hi>Capponniers,</hi> and had the <hi>Turks</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his teeth with only nine or ten foot of earth betwixt them: Having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and refitted his <hi>Capponniers,</hi> he ran a Gallery under the Batteries and Lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and blew them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94489:187"/>
the air, thereby giving the beſieged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to repair the <hi>Scotch Work,</hi> from whence they ſhot ſo effectually with their Cannon, that it has been too hot for the <hi>Turks,</hi> and they have not attempted it ſince. But for this Work, the Town had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken above three months ago.</p>
            <p>You would not believe it, and yet it was certainly true, the <hi>French</hi> were at that time forced to preach Moderation and Temper to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe Commanders were then ſo full of animoſity and emulation, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <hi>Moroſini</hi> and <hi>Cornaro)</hi> that their Councils of War were nothing but Threats, and Exprobrations, and <hi>Manifeſto</hi>'s, and Proteſtations one againſt the other; our great Officers (who were admitted to thoſe Councils) were amazed at their own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and temper, in reſpect of thoſe who had alwayes reproached our Nation by its heat and activity. Had I not been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told this by more than one or two of the Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, I ſhould never have believed it. The <hi>Turks</hi> underſtood it very well, and laught at the <hi>Venetian Pantalons,</hi> for that was the name they gave the <hi>Venetian</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
            <p>This is certain, the Garriſon has never effectually ſeconded the Efforts of their Auxiliaries. The <hi>Venetian,</hi> as it is thought,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94489:188"/>
being unwilling to be relieved by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable ſupplyes, have fancied, that by expoſing them, and ſuffering them to be cut off, their Maſters, the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes would be provoked to eſpouſe them more vigorouſly to repair their own Honours, and by degrees grow to make the <hi>Venetian</hi> Quarrel their own.</p>
            <p>Upon Friday the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1669. (which the <hi>Turks</hi> count the 9<hi>th</hi> of their <hi>Douleggaide,</hi> and of their <hi>Egire</hi> 1080.) I arrived at the Camp, two days before their little <hi>Bairam,</hi> which fell out the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>; for there being that year ſeventy compleat days from the end of the Moon of <hi>Ramaden,</hi> to the tenth of the Moon of <hi>Douleggaide,</hi> the little <hi>Bairam</hi> happened the tenth of that Moon, and the <hi>Ramaden</hi> concluded the laſt day of our <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp had no Lines either of Circumvallation or Contravallation; a Line of Circumvallation would have been utterly uſeleſs, becauſe they feard no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours by Land. And the Garriſon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves very happy if they can keep their own ground, there was no great need of any Contravallation againſt their Sallies; only about Cannon-ſhot from the two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, the <hi>Turks</hi> thought fit to caſt up a few pittiful Lines, to ſhelter their place of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:94489:188"/>
Arms, where they draw up, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out upon any conſiderable Service. Theſe Lines, inſtead of being brought up ſtreight one to another, as with us, are turned with a bow at both ends, which ſeems repugnant to our Rules; but our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity is not ſo uſefull among them, for the Enemy never going directly towards an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, nor many times together the ſame way, the pedantry of our methods would be to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The whole ſtrength of their Camp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of great Plat-forms, which thoſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels have raiſed upon the ſhore, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them very liberally with Cannon to play upon the Chriſtian Ships. There are alſo Plat-forms that lie low, and even with the water, made on purpoſe to hinder the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went firſt to the <hi>Vizers</hi> Quarter, which among us would have been called the Royal Quarter. It lies towards the Fort of Saint <hi>Andre</hi> weſtward of the Town; and in that quarter moſt of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and ſelect Troops of the Army are diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>The Quarter of the <hi>Romiliots,</hi> or <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Troops under the Command of the <hi>Beglierbey</hi> of <hi>Sophia</hi> was before the Fort of <hi>Panigra</hi> on the S. W. ſide of the Town. The <hi>Meſſerliotts</hi> or Troops out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:94489:189"/>
and <hi>Arabia</hi> were quartered on the South; the <hi>Natolians</hi> or Troops out of <hi>Aſia</hi> on the South Eaſt: And towards their <hi>Lazaret</hi> or Hoſpital, over againſt the Poſt of <hi>Sabio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera</hi> directly to the Eaſt, lay a conſiderable body of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> with detachments, and commanded parties out of all the other Quarters.</p>
            <p>The Chief Officers commanding in thoſe ſeveral Quarters, have no certain place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to themſelves, as with us, for the <hi>Vizer</hi> changes them as he pleaſes, and many times removes the whole <hi>Brigade</hi> from one Quarter to another. The <hi>Baſſas,</hi> who at my coming were in principal Command, were the <hi>Vizer du Camp,</hi> which is as much as the <hi>Vizer Azem</hi>'s Lieutenant-General: the <hi>Beglerbey</hi> of <hi>Romulia</hi>; the <hi>Capoudan Baſſa</hi> Brother in Law to the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi>; the <hi>Genizar-Aga,</hi> a brave Man, and his Creature; <hi>Zambatag Ogli-Houſſekni</hi> Son to one of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Siſters; <hi>Zatt-Patat-Ogli,</hi> for a <hi>Turk</hi> a very underſtanding man in all Foreign Affairs, and deſigned to be <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Cairo; Frane Mehemet Pacha,</hi> a Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade <hi>Portugeſſe,</hi> to whom the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> has promiſed tho Government of <hi>Candia</hi> when taken: And <hi>Bebyr Pacha,</hi> a man of Execution, and one who ſpeaking very well the Language of the <hi>Franks,</hi> would be a
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:94489:189"/>
proper perſon to Treat with the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General of their Horſe called <hi>Spahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-Agaſi,</hi> continued at <hi>Canea,</hi> from whence he made frequent Cavalcades about the Iſland to keep an eye over his Horſe which were quartered all along upon the Coaſt under the Command of ſix Colonels, or <hi>Boulouk Agalar</hi>'s. It is not above four years ſince this perſon was made General of the Cavalry; his predeceſſor was ſlain by the <hi>French</hi> at the paſſing of <hi>Raab</hi> near St. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thard</hi> in the year 1664.</p>
            <p>The Quarters of the <hi>Vizer Azem</hi> is the only fix'd Quarter in the Army, and choſen with all the convenients that is conſiſtent with the ſecurity of the Camp. The little <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels can land juſt by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing before the Town; it lies upon the Road to <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Policaſtro,</hi> and there is no Forrage but on that ſide: His Troops are ſheltered from the City by a little hill, which gives alſo to the Beſiegers an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to raiſe Batteries: But its greateſt Commodity is from the River <hi>Giofro,</hi> which runs at the foot of the ſaid Hill. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is not much bigger than the <hi>Gobelins</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and yet it contributes exceedingly to the miſeries of the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe waters the <hi>Turks</hi> could not have ſubſiſted ſo long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:94489:190"/>At the beginning of the firſt Siege in the year 1648. ſome of the <hi>Venetians</hi> poiſoned thoſe waters, without adviſing with their General, and it was the deſtruction of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi>; which being no fair action, according to the punctilio's of War, the <hi>Turks</hi> (who of themſelves are not over-apt to give quarter) revenged it effectually by moſt incredible barbarities.</p>
            <p>I was aſtoniſhed at the number and beauty of the Tents in that Quarter: For the Hutts and Cabins for the common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, I ſaw three great Boards that had ſerved to make ten thouſand of them. You will ask what kind of things thoſe Cabins are among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and how they are built: They take of the fatteſt earth they can find, ſprinkle it with water as they do Mortar, and having marked out a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it of about ſeven foot in length, and ſix in breadth, they take three large Planks, and faſten them round, as they were to make a Cheſt: The Planks are uſed as a kind of Mould for the caſting of theſe <hi>Cazernes,</hi> for when the Boards are diſpoſed right, they throw more water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mould, and then let it ſtand till it be dry: when it has ſtood long enough, is grown to a conſiſtence, and is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtiff to ſtand by it ſelf, the Planks are
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:94489:190"/>
taken away, and imployed in another place. Every one of theſe <hi>Cazernes</hi> or Cabins is allowed to be five foot high, covered a top with certain old pieces of Wood, over which they lay a little of their prepared Mould, which they ſuffer to dry, and with very good effect; but for thatch, it is not to be thought on in <hi>Candia,</hi> where they have neither ſowing nor reaping, and trees are more ſcarce than ſtraw; the great ones have been all cut up to make their Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes and Fortifications, and the little ones have been burned: In ſhort, each of thoſe Caverns built according to the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned dimenſions, will receive twelve Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but for greater numbers, they are proportion'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> was not lodged in a Tent; they had built him a <hi>Serrai</hi> or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace half a quarter of a league about: The <hi>Turks</hi> preſumed when he once ſate down before the Town, he would not ſuddenly riſe again, and therefore they thought fit his Quarters ſhould be made durable. The Walls of his <hi>Palace</hi> were of ſtone ſome ſix or eight foot high from the floor; the reſt of the Houſe (which in ſome places was two ſtories high) was made of that ſprinkled dirt dryed, and a little old Timber. In the Camp there were at leaſt a hundred of theſe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:94489:191"/>
               <hi>Serrai</hi>'s ſet up by the Principal Officers for themſelves. The <hi>Serrai</hi> or Palace of <hi>Delli-Houſſain-Pacha,</hi> built in the time of the firſt Siege over againſt the Fort of <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nengoe,</hi> was the moſt conſiderable of them all: When the Army was drawn off, and the Siege diſcontinued, it was ſet on fire by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but the <hi>Beglerbey</hi> of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> has repair'd it again.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Grand Vizers Serrai</hi> was a kind of a Gibbet ſet up with ſeven horſe tails upon it; each <hi>Beglerbey</hi> in the Army has ſix before his door: But thoſe are honorary and no more, the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi>'s is a great mark of authority. When the <hi>Sultan</hi> in perſon is in the Camp, he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nine tailes before his Tent or Palace, or where ever he lies. The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> has no ſuch thing before his, though he be one of the moſt conſiderable Officers in the Army: Before the Tents of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Baſſas</hi> there are two, and ſix before the <hi>Caimacan</hi> of the <hi>Vizer,</hi> who is in the nature of Super-intendant of the Army.</p>
            <p>The Gibbet ſet up for theſe Tails before the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi>'s Tent is four ſquare, and when the Army marches, the ſquare in which the Horſe tails are faſtened, directs the way the Army is to take: for if the tails be faſtned towards the Eaſt, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:94489:191"/>
is to be that way; and ſo in general all their Campments and Lodgements in their march are ſignified by that part of the horizon towards which the tails are hung.</p>
            <p>Being got into the Camp, each of us found ſome of our friends, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperſed. <hi>Amuret-Aga</hi> went one way and we another; I continued with <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> in a Hutt that was offer'd him; his two Brothers in Law (Sons of <hi>Muſtapha Bey)</hi> that he thought to have found before <hi>Candia,</hi> and quartered with them, were ſent in Garriſon not long before to <hi>Girapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etra,</hi> a Poſt that they have fortified in that Iſland.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, though it be very numerous, any body that one inquires for is eaſily found out. Their <hi>Oda</hi>'s are known and diſtinguiſhed by their ſucceſſion and order of their numbers, as firſt, ſecond, third, and ſo on: But for greater inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the door of every <hi>Chorbagi</hi> is hung up the name of ſome animal or other, as a Lion, a Camel, an Eagle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a great paper with the name of it in large Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
            <p>We were ſcarce ſetled in our Hutt, but the ſilence that is alwayes very remarkable in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, was on a ſudden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:94489:192"/>
by a moſt dreadful noiſe in ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Mines that were ready under the Fort of St. <hi>Andre,</hi> and the Yells of the <hi>Turks</hi> advancing to the Aſſault: The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non both in the Leaguer and City, made up the Conſort. This was the firſt time I ever ſaw the <hi>Grand Vizer,</hi> he was got a top of a little eminence out of Cannon-ſhot from the Town, to ſee the execution of the Mines, and ſucceſs of the attaque: The ſight of this great perſon ſtruck my heart more violently than mine eyes: He is but of a middle Stature, yet very vigorous and ſtrong; his Face is ſomething pitted with the ſmall Pox, and his Cheeks very red; his Eyes are black, and hollow, and ſtern; his Complexion is tauny; his Beard long and very black; he was on foot in the midſt of fifty or threeſcore of his Guards armed like <hi>Albanians,</hi> with their Captain <hi>Delli Bachi</hi> at the head of them. The <hi>Vizer</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with <hi>Zambatag-Ogli-Houſekni,</hi> a young Gentleman, and as they ſaid there, much like the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> who is his Uncle: The <hi>Vizer</hi> had no ſooner placed himſelf, but all his Officers came about him. It is concluded by all hands, that he is perſonally brave, and as great a Souldier as ever they had; yet he is cautious, and runs not head-long himſelf upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,

to viſit the Works; with a ſmall, but excellent Perſpective, he was viewing the order of their attaques; but becauſe the duſt and the ſmoke did many times obſtruct him, he ſent ever and anon ſome body to underſtand how things went in every Poſt; which meſſengers, to give him an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, expoſed themſelves ſo freely to the Enemies ſhot, that of thirty ſent out, there was but four returned.</p>
            <p>This was one of the hotteſt attempts du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Leaguer; the <hi>Turks</hi> had ſprung three Mines under the Fort of Saint <hi>Andre.</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Vizer</hi> was imployed with his Perſpective-Glaſs in obſerving the execution of the Mines, wagers were lai'd by the Officers about him that the Work was blown up, and a gale of wind blowing away the ſmoke diſcovered who had won: The execution was great, carrying away a whole row of Paliſadoes from the beſieged, and making a breach in which the <hi>Turks</hi> endeavoured many times to lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their ſwords in their hands, but were repulſed with great ſlaughter. They gave out that they had ſlain the General of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but the repulſed Troops never return without ſome ſuch ſtory for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Honour: but at this time there was ſome reaſon for their report, for
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:94489:193"/>
a day or two afterwards we underſtood by a fugitive, that the Marqueſs of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Man, and Governour of the Town was in that action wounded in the face by the ſplinter of a ſtone: This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the 9<hi>th</hi> of their <hi>Douleggiade,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Kalendar on the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1669.</p>
            <p>The Troops that are daily deſigned for the Guard of the Trenches, are relieved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very twelve hours: And when an <hi>Oda</hi> is appointed for the whole day, the Chorbag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi takes one half of them to mount the Trenches, and twelve hours after is reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Oda Baſchi</hi> with the other moity. But an <hi>Oda</hi> conſiſts commonly of three or four thouſand men, which are eaſily divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſervice. In the evening two <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouxes</hi> having placed themſelves before the <hi>Grand Vizers</hi> door, one of one ſide, and the other of the other; they make procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as loud as they can, and cry out <hi>Allah, Allah</hi>; upon which the Souldiers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in great numbers, the <hi>Chiaouxes</hi> ſet certain prices upon the heads of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for the next day; this is their cuſtome every night, that the hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward might animate their men, for nothing is better money than the head of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>; but their heads are not alwayes at
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:94489:193"/>
a rate; when the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Army is ſtrong, and heads harder to come by, a head is worth 25 or 30 Crowns; but when their Army is weak, and heads are like to be plentiful, nine or ten Crowns is a good price, and they think it well if the Market would hold there. The next day being a Feſtival, and their <hi>Bayram,</hi> they ſet twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Crowns upon a head. There was alſo a rate ſet for every piece of a Paliſade that could be forced from the Works of the City, and brought to the <hi>Vizer,</hi> and the price for the next day was ſet at three Crowns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſet their Prices in the ſame manner upon the heads of the <hi>Turks</hi>; but they are not ſo good Chapmen, for ten or twelve Livers is as much as they give for a head; and at that rate they come in ſometimes ſo plentifully that they have been known to ſet their Walls round with them, and all ſuch other places as have been within ſight of the Enemy. But there was a time once when theſe kind of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies were prohibited in the Town, and that was when the Plague was in the <hi>Turks</hi> Camp, then the head of one Infidel might have been enough to have infected ten thouſand <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1667. an accident hapned in the <hi>Vizer</hi>'s Camp that was very rare;
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:94489:194"/>
There was in the Quarter of the <hi>Meſſerhots</hi> a great heap of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> heads, and it was reported that one of thoſe heads moaned and complained every night, and that half the Army in that Quarter had heard it: and it was the more wonderful with them, becauſe they believe nothing of the return, or apparition of Spirits, but laugh at thoſe ſtories. This accident made ſuch a noiſe that it came to the Ears of the <hi>Vizir.</hi> The <hi>Vizir</hi> being a curious, but no credulous perſon, went himſelf to the place, and heard an odd kind of noiſe from out of one of the heads that lay uppermoſt upon the Pile: The <hi>Vizir</hi> was a quick man, and obſerved that the Head ſtanding with the Face to the wind, the wind blew ſtrongly into the Noſtrils, and not being able to get out but with difficulty, by its working and agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Skull produced that ſound. He cauſed the Noſtrils to be ſtopt with Clay, but the Soldiers reporting ſtill that the Head was heard to complain, and that it was doubtleſs ſome among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who had dyed a <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Vizir</hi> cauſed that and the whole heap to be thrown into the Sea.</p>
            <p>Every morning at five a clock the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are called to their prayers by ſound of Trumpet; the Troops in their ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:94489:194"/>
repair immediately to their place of Arms: To begin their Devotions they cry out as loud as they can <hi>Allah</hi> three times, and they make a noiſe with it that may be heard two Leagues; and in this it is that they may well reproach the careleſneſs of our devotions. He that ſhould behold their modeſty and humility at their prayers, would wonder it ſhould be poſſible that ſo much courage and piety could conſiſt.</p>
            <p>They have a larger ſort of Drums than ordinary that call them from their Prayers, of which there is but one in every Quarter, and that is either placed upon a piece of wood to that purpoſe, or elſe upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel before the <hi>Vizer</hi> or <hi>Beglerbey</hi>'s Tent who Commands in chief. Their noiſe is almoſt like Thunder, and heard two or three Leagues, and the profound and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſilence of their Camp, makes it heard the farther. The ſmaller Drums are for the Soldiers commanded by the <hi>Beglerbeys</hi>; for the <hi>Janizaries</hi> uſe no Drums, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other Inſtrument in the room of them, no not ſo much as in their March. There are <hi>Chiaouxes</hi> on purpoſe, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Orders to the <hi>Janizaries</hi> when at any time they are commanded. In that caſe they hang up Colours before the Tent of the <hi>Chorbaggi,</hi> and the Word paſſes from
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:94489:195"/>
one to the other. In their Marches they follow the directions of the great Drums which belong to their General Officers: The common Drums are beaten at both ends, with two ſticks of an unequal big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, With their right hand they beat quick and ſtrong, with their left they ſtrike more ſlowly, and make a ſound in my judgment more ſolemn and martial than ours.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Beglerbey</hi> has his Company of Guards, compoſed only of his own Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men called <hi>Moulaggi:</hi> Upon a March the <hi>Moulaggi</hi> are always mounted, and on Horſe-back, but in <hi>Candia</hi> they ſerve on foot. Theſe <hi>Moulaggi</hi> have their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, their Haut-bois, their Trumpets, and Kettle-Drums, and upon ſeveral occaſions do make uſe of them all. The <hi>Zaims</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> have likewiſe their Kettle-Drums.</p>
            <p>As to their Colours or Standards, every <hi>Oda</hi> has its <hi>Bairakter</hi> or Enſigne. This Officer is never without ſeveral Colours, to ſet up and diſplay upon the Platform of their Batteries, upon their breaches or their logdments in an Attack. The Colours are commonly charged ſalterwiſe with Syme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars <hi>vert</hi> upon a Field <hi>Or:</hi> ſometimes <hi>Gules</hi> in a Field <hi>Argent.</hi> Sables is forbidden as
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:94489:195"/>
altogether ominous. Sometimes they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters, the name of God, or ſome of his Attributes. In their skirmiſhes with the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> they are very proud if they can get any of our Colours, becauſe they know it is a loſs highly regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among them, and very diſhonourable: but they do not ſhow them, nor hang them up publickly as we do; only now and then the Renegadoes will keep them and hang them up in their houſes, as retaining our Cuſtoms, though not our Religion.</p>
            <p>The Order obſerved by the <hi>Turks</hi> in their night-Guards, is different from ours; they have indeed their Horſe-Guards petrolling about all night long; but with their Foot it is quite otherwiſe: They never put one ſingle man upon a Sentinel, but place little Squadrons of thirty and forty men in a Squadron about their Camp, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards the Enemy, on which ſide they place their Squadrons or Parties about two or three hundred paces diſtance at the moſt. They have none of our <hi>Perdue's,</hi> thinking it little leſs than madneſs to truſt the lives of 100000 men to the vigilance or fidelity of a ſingle perſon, contrary quite to our opinion, who think it as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant to diſturb a whole Army to watch, when one man may do it as well; but I am
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:94489:196"/>
rather of their judgment than our own. Their opinion is ſober and cautious, ours more vain and ſecure. Let the occaſion be what it will, their Foot never go the Rounds, and therefore are never truſted with the Word. When theſe little bodies upon the out-Guards deſcry any body near them, they cry out <hi>Kimpſem,</hi> who goes there? which is followed immediately with <hi>Dourbourda,</hi> ſtand. Their common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is <hi>Biz-iz, 'Tis we</hi>; for they ſuppoſe no man will come alone with a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and therefore our complement, <hi>A Friend,</hi> would not paſs with them. If there be two or three in the company, and none of them replies, the next Word from the Guards is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ldurun,</hi> or kill them, kill them, and commonly they are as good as their word, and then give the alarm to the whole Camp.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Siege they were not ſo ſtrict, there being no talk of ſuccours from <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> nor no apprehenſion from the <hi>Iſlanders</hi>; then if any of their Guards had eſpied a man, after their <hi>Allah Allah</hi> three or four times, they called out in the <hi>Frank</hi> language, <hi>A Largua, A Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> which is a Sea phraſe, and as much as <hi>who are you for?</hi> Thoſe who are queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do anſwer immediately <hi>Alla</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:94489:196"/>
the Court of Guard cryes out <hi>Alla</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and fires upon them. It would be no eaſie matter for the <hi>Venetians</hi> to think to ſurprize the <hi>Turks</hi> by crying out <hi>Alla</hi>; for the Turks have a peculiar way of ſpeaking that word, pronouncing it in the throat, according to the way of the <hi>Arabians.</hi> In the ſame manner the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pronounces <hi>Muger,</hi> in which it is not poſſible for a <hi>French</hi> man to imitate him.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that are not uſed to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> articulation, will tell you, that when thoſe Infidels go to an ingagement, they do it with ſtrange yells and noiſes, which indeed is nothing but their pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations: However at thoſe times the word <hi>Alla</hi> is alwayes in their mouths, and I doubt the fear that ſeizes us commonly at thoſe times, makes the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Muſick leſs gratefull to our ears.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have skill in Souldiery, will perhaps condemn this cuſtom of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and object, that the <hi>Romans</hi> (who were greater Conquerours of the two) obſerved better Order in their Camps. I will not meddle with the ſpeculative part, let us come to the active: 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi> have not that regular way of incamping, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had, nor their method of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for the <hi>Turks</hi> underſtand nothing of
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:94489:197"/>
wheeling, or the other Military Motions that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, and yet in three hundred years they have won more Battels, and made lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conqueſts than the <hi>Romans</hi> in eight hundred; 'tis true, afterwards the <hi>Romans</hi> out-did them, but the more ſhame for the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now, who underſtanding the way of facing about, the way of countermarches, doubling of ranks and files, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motions, are yet ſo often beaten by the <hi>Turks.</hi> There is one thing which to me has been alwayes very admirable; Moſt Authors that write of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People ambitious of Honour, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually counſelling to make War upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> repreſenting them Cowards, and Sots, and eaſily conquered: By their account the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is a trifle, and ſo eaſie, 'tis not worth the name of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; I wonder they can forbear diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing before-hand of the plunder of that great City, and that every one of them has not reſerved three or four of the Principal <hi>Odaliques</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> for himſelf. What then muſt be the odds betwixt us in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſcipline? Why? the <hi>Turks</hi> are more obedient to their Officers, are more at uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among themſelves, more ſober, and leſs fugitive; and this certainly muſt be the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:94489:197"/>
reaſon, for their skins are no harder than ours, unleſs poſſibly it be that Empires have their periods like particular men.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> 11. of <hi>May,</hi> on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Camp put themſelves in arms to begin the Feſtivity of their <hi>Bayram,</hi> which they ſignified to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by three rounds of great ſhot from their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and as many ſalvoes of ſmall ſhot from their Infantry who gave very good fire: But the whole Army was not drawn up as I expected. Every Quarter rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it ſelf. I think there could not be braver men ſeen in the world than the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi>'s <hi>Janizaries:</hi> Their Arms were ſo bright, they were able to dazle a mans eyes: the fierceneſs of their looks, and the Majeſty of their Motion preſaged their ſucceſs: their <hi>Dolimans</hi> or Coats were as good as new, very well ſhaped, though made of a courſe cloth from <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi>; they had not had them above two months: Once every year the <hi>Sultan</hi> gives them new Coats at his own charge, and the time that they are delivered is about the month of <hi>Cheuval,</hi> that they may be neat and ſpruce againſt their <hi>Grand Bayram:</hi> they had not their <hi>Zercola</hi>'s or long Coifs upon their heads which they wear upon Solemnities; in the Army they would be
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:94489:198"/>
troubleſome; they had only Bonnets or Caps of wooll or coloured cloth, with their handkerchiefs roll'd about them to make them look like <hi>Turbans:</hi> They wear no beards, but not upon the ſcore that we pretend, who would have it a mark that they are the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s real ſlaves, for, as they ſay, he who is a <hi>Muſleman,</hi> what is he elſe? All the reſt of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Subjects, wear their <hi>Muſchatoes</hi> very long, and they would let their under lips grow ſo too, were not they fearful of being taken by the beard in their Battels, and ſo put to the worſt. 'Tis moſt certain, that for the ſame reaſon <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great commanded his Captains, that all the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhould cut off their beards: And the <hi>Abanthes,</hi> a war-like People of <hi>Eubea,</hi> do uſe it at this day.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi>'s Quarter there was near fifteen thouſand <hi>Janizaries,</hi> beſides a party of them ſent about to the Poſt of <hi>Sabonniera:</hi> I judged the whole Army to conſiſt of about forty five thouſand men, and near as many others, Cannoniers, Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, Sutlers, half of which upon occaſion were able to bear Arms: Should I tell this among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I ſhould hardly be believed; for they pleaſe themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing the numbers and courage of the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:94489:198"/>
               <hi>Turks,</hi> and perhaps it is a ſtratagem of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to wheedle their <hi>Allies:</hi> So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army muſt not be above thirty thouſand ſtrong.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, about a year ſince, the Plague and incommodities of the Army had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to that number: and I know at <hi>Tunis</hi> (where I was at that time) the <hi>Turks</hi> confeſſed it themſelves, to excuſe the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Progreſs; they pretended like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Town of <hi>Candia</hi> ſtood upon an impenetrable, inacceſſible Rock, and was defended by a Garriſon of ſixty thouſand men. It was great pleaſure to hear how they magnified our numbers, and the ſtrength of the City, and yet kept us all in with an Army of twenty five thouſand men at the moſt: Not that the Emperour could have wanted more men, but the <hi>Vizer</hi> in gallantry had made an Oath, with that ſmall number of <hi>Turks</hi> to beat and deſtroy the ſixty thouſand lubberly <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that had pin'd themſelves up in that inacceſſible Rock.</p>
            <p>That was a day of great Execution; one of the <hi>Turks</hi> Mines blew up a Poſt of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> near Saint <hi>Andre,</hi> where many a brave man of the Garriſon periſhed; the <hi>Vizer</hi> was in no little danger himſelf, for having laid aſide his Perſpective, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94489:199"/>
in the Trenches to the very Ditch of the Town, to ſurvey their Works, and obſerve his advantage, he ſtood perſonally expoſed to all the fire from the Garriſon for a complete half hour together, and <hi>Kiaca-Bey</hi> the Lieutenant General of the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> was ſhot in the Arm, not two ſteps from him; the <hi>Vizer</hi> when he ſaw it, with an angry kind of ſmile, ſaid, I think theſe rude <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would not have us Celebrate our <hi>Bayram</hi> to day: but for all that, he ſtirred not till a Lodgement was finiſhed that he had ordered, and to that end, he cauſed his dinner to be brought to him into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the day was ſpent in <hi>Douna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or publick rejoycing: The <hi>Turks</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their cuſtome on their <hi>Bayrams</hi> ſend one another Preſents, as we do at New-years-tide. One <hi>Janizary</hi> gives his Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade Tobacco, and he to requite it, takes him to the Sutlers, and gives him a diſh of Coffee, or ſtrong waters. The <hi>Vizer</hi> aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the pay of thoſe who did any thing ſignally; if their pay was ſix <hi>Aſpers</hi> before, he advanced it to twelve; and God knows what emulation and courage that raiſed in the ſeveral <hi>Oda</hi>'s: The Principal Officers regal'd the <hi>Grand Vizer.</hi> The <hi>Beglerby</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> ſent him ſix black Eunuch Boys,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94489:199"/>
and received from him a rich <hi>Saber</hi> or Sword of a more than ordinary temper. The <hi>Vizer</hi> ſent a noble Tent to <hi>Zambatag-Ogli-Houſſekni.</hi> Such of the <hi>Spahi</hi> as had been defective in their duties, and were to be drubb'd, according to their diſcipline of War, were pardon'd in reſpect of that day; as alſo ſuch of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> as for their miſdemeanours were condemned to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with cudgels on their buttocks. A <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariot</hi> or <hi>Teskerectis</hi> that before was worth but five or ſix thouſand <hi>Aſpers</hi> a year, was advanced to a <hi>Teskereber,</hi> or a <hi>Timar</hi> of twenty thouſand pound. Some of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> produced the heads of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that they had concealed three or four days together, to have their recompence inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that day. The <hi>Kaimacan</hi> gave three <hi>Sequins</hi> to a Pioner for having taken a pair of Gloves from a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>; and to take a pair of Gloves is looked upon as a great prize, for the <hi>Turks</hi> wearing none them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis no eaſie matter to come by them any other way.</p>
            <p>I ſaw the <hi>Vizer</hi> as he paſſed to the <hi>Eouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai,</hi> (which is one of their ſervices of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) he was talking to <hi>Mehemet-Aga</hi> his <hi>Kiaia,</hi> or Intendant of his houſe, an honeſt man, moderate, and one who has done many good offices to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94489:200"/>
               <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> was going to his own <hi>Moſque,</hi> for he had one belonging to his own Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to which none but his own ſervants reſorted. He has alwayes five or ſix <hi>Imans</hi> or Prieſts which attend him in the Army to perform Divine Service, and every great Officer has two or three. The <hi>Vizer</hi> was attended by a throng of Officers, and ſelect men of his Troops that followed him in confuſion. At the head of the Proceſſion were ten Trumpets, and as many Bag-pipes playing and ſounding before him: There was likewiſe a <hi>Touke</hi> or kind of a Banner with ſeven horſe tails faſtned to a Pike; but the other <hi>Touks</hi> carried before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers had fewer according to the difference of their qualities, ſix tails before a <hi>Beglerbey,</hi> and two before a <hi>Bachas.</hi> When prayers were done, he treated all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and three <hi>Oda</hi>'s or Companies who had performed very well in a late action. He never dines alone, but ſends alwayes for the Officers that come off the Guards, that either at dinner or afterwards they may give him an account of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. He loves good Meat, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors Wine; contrary to the humour of his Father, who delighted in it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. He diverts himſelf ſometimes a Hunting, ſometimes at Cheſs, and takes
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94489:200"/>
great pleaſure in ſeeing his Officers dance. He had with him beſides, ſeven or eight <hi>Hoingi,</hi> or Dancing-Maſters, who danced to two or three Baſe-Vials, or Inſtruments very like them: Sometimes they danced alone, ſometimes two and two, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more: They dance likewiſe with a ſort of <hi>Caſtignettes,</hi> and do very well: Theſe dancers have upon them little ſtrait waſtcoats that come down to their gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, from whence they have a kind of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoats (like our Women) which come down to the ground, and are very wide; and their great dexterity being in turning ſwiftly and long upon one foot, the wind getting under their petticoats fills them up like a ſail: In this poſture the <hi>Hoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi</hi> will bow, plunge, leap up again, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and diſappear with ſtrange prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and exactneſs. There was one thing I thought remarkable; Not long ſince in <hi>Turkie</hi> there was a ſort of Religious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans</hi> called <hi>Dervis,</hi> whoſe Devotion conſiſted in dancing in their Moſques, which they would perform with indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable ſwiftneſs: The <hi>Vizer</hi> having dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them lately out of <hi>Romulia,</hi> thoſe who had no mind to go ſo far as their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Covent at <hi>Cogna</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> turned <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingi,</hi> and danced as eagerly for Money
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:94489:201"/>
as ever they had done for Devotion.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> took Horſe, and rode to <hi>Eina-die,</hi> or <hi>New-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> to confer with <hi>Fateim Kadun,</hi> who was come thither to meet him, from her Quarters at <hi>Philopoli,</hi> which is a great Houſe ſtanding upon the Road betwixt <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Girapietra.</hi> Nothing paſſed in the Siege, nor indeed in the whole Empire, but the <hi>Vizer</hi> imparted it to his Mother. She brought with her into <hi>Candia</hi> forty or fifty Eunuchs, two thirds of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are imployed conſtantly all over <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie</hi> for intelligence: All news from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa</hi> is conveyed by ſome or other of them, I ſay news, becauſe Orders are ſent always by other people. The greateſt reſolves are ſtill concerted betwixt her and her Son; and the ſupplyes of Men or Money were managed for the moſt part by their Eunuchs, for which the <hi>Vizer</hi>'s Slaves bare them no good will: It was ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of their pockets, and their gain was ſo great, that it was reported ſome months ſince, two ſingle Voyages were worth to one of <hi>Fateima</hi>'s Eunuchs above twenty thouſand Crowns.</p>
            <p>The Eleventh at night, the <hi>Vizer</hi>'s Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was all in Arms, upon Alarm of a Mine which the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſprang before
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:94489:201"/>
the Fort of Saint <hi>Andre</hi>: There were ſlain in that buſineſs above ſixty <hi>Janizaries,</hi> moſt of them Officers, as good as any in the Army, and all of them the <hi>Vizer</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and it was reported, that the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to improve their advantage, were ſallying out of the Town; but that was but a report.</p>
            <p>The twelfth of <hi>May</hi> in the Morning I ſaw ſeveral Companies of <hi>Janizaries</hi> come to bid their <hi>Chor-baggi</hi>'s or Captains good morrow, and 'tis it ſeems their cuſtome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning. To requite their Civility, the Captains preſent every Souldier with a diſh of Coffee, which is the only thing that ever they return them. When a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is killed, his cloaths go to the <hi>Chor-baggi,</hi> but his Arms and the Money about him is delivered to the Treaſurer-General of the Army, who is accountable for it to the <hi>Vizer:</hi> But the Money paſſing through the hands of the <hi>Chor-baggi,</hi> to whom the body is brought off to be ſtripped, does many times ſtick to his fingers, and come ſhort to the Treaſurer. But if a <hi>Janizary</hi> be mortally wounded, and has time to make his Will, he may bequeath what he pleaſes to the Souldiers of his own <hi>Oda,</hi> to ſupply their neceſſities: They are paid but once in three months, and, as I ſaid
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:94489:202"/>
before, their pay is unequal. The new raiſed men have but ſix <hi>Aſpers</hi> a day, which is about three pence half penny of ours; and thoſe who have moſt have but twelve pence, but then the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> finds them Victuals: Their allowance to ſix Souldiers is a diſh of Rice, and about a pound of bread to a Man; every fourth day they have ſix ounces of fleſh, and their drink is all out of the River of <hi>Giofiro</hi>: they may ſupply one another out of their pay or their plunder, but they muſt be ſure to keep touch with their Sutlers, and have a care of committing the leaſt inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards them. At firſt it was death for a <hi>Janizary</hi> to drink Wine, and they made it a point of Religion, becauſe of the Seditions which their drunkenneſs had produced; but of late, the ſeverity of that Law has been turned upon the Sutlers who furniſh them; and the <hi>Janizary</hi> eſcapes with fifty good blows upon the buttocks, inflicted punctually by the <hi>Oda Baſchi,</hi> or Lieutenant of the Company, with a good cudgel. When a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldier has done any thing that deſerves death, they dare not execute him publickly, but he is ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in private, which in my judgement argues a weakneſs in the Government and Authority of their Officers: But the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:94489:202"/>
look upon it as a reſpect to men of the Sword; for the whole Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but their conqueſt and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it is but ſuitable to the Dignity and Juſtice of their Monarch, to have their errours and offences concealed, and their perſons preſerved from publick infamy and diſgrace.</p>
            <p>I had alwayes hitherto a great curioſity to be prying into their Trenches, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the diſpoſition of their Works; but it fell now to my ſhare, and I could not avoid it. The danger was great, and death never ſo manifeſt to me as now. The being expoſed to the continual ſhooting from the Town, was the leaſt of my trouble; but the fear of being diſcovered by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and puniſhed as a ſpie, was a thing that ſtuck very cloſe to me, and made me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt repent my curioſity that had brought me to <hi>Candia.</hi> I repaired forthwith to my old Confident <hi>Oſman Chelebi,</hi> and told him how it ſtood, who ſmiling, told me, If I could ſecure my ſelf from the one, he would bring me off from the danger of the other.</p>
            <p>His Friends had ſolicited ſo effectually for his <hi>Timar,</hi> that it was time for him to think of doing ſomething extraordinary: Every <hi>Timariot</hi> is obliged to bring as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:94489:203"/>
men to the War, as he has times three three thouſand <hi>Aſpers</hi> in the revenue of his <hi>Timar,</hi> and thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r imployment was only to carry Earth, or be ſerviceable to their great Guns: <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſhare was to find four of theſe <hi>Gebelous:</hi> In complement I muſt needs make one of them, to ſave him that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. I did not at firſt conſider the thing, nor imagine I had been ſerving againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; if I had, I ſhould have made more ſcruple, and perhaps pretended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the caſe. I expected, that by the favour of ſome Officer of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I ſhould have been excuſed, if I had advanced about a hundred paces into the Trenches, when the Guards had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, which might have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great hazards, that time being the leaſt dangerous, for if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had ſallied to diſturb them, they would have had upon their hands the Troops that came off, as well as thoſe that went on to relieve them; but I reckoned without mine Hoſt.</p>
            <p>I attended <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> to the Tent of the <hi>Grand Engineer</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army called <hi>Iſouf Meymar Azem, Meymar</hi> being the title which they give to any Eminent
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:94489:203"/>
Engineer or Architect. We went with him to the Seraile of the <hi>Topigi Bachi,</hi> or Grand Maſter of their Artillery. This Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer (one of the moſt conſiderable in the Empire) was a poor Mariner at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> who lived upon ten or twelve pence a day, by croſſing the water betwixt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Pera:</hi> He put himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Officers of the Artillery, and paſſed with them into <hi>Candia,</hi> where the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> having diſplaced the <hi>Topigi</hi> upon ſome exception againſt him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this Mariner to be very handy and dexterous at removing and ordering the Cannon for the Batteries, advanced him to that Office, and made him <hi>Topigi Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> quite contrary to the practice in our Countries. Among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> a man of Birth and no Merit, ſhall be ſure to make his Fortune; among the <hi>Turks</hi> a man of Merit, let his Extraction be what it will, ſhall be ſure to be preferred.</p>
            <p>With the <hi>Topigi Bachi</hi> we found a great number of <hi>Topigilers</hi> or Cannoneers and <hi>Gebegilers,</hi> or people that have care of keeping the Arms, and preparing their Fire-works; to be ſhort, every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be imployed, they clapped a Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at my back, and a Mattock into my hand, and thought they did me a great
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94489:204"/>
deal of honour, for of three hundred <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, Timars,</hi> and <hi>Gebelous</hi> that were wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Orders, I was the firſt that was provided: <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> himſelf put on the ſame harneſs, and being to furniſh three more <hi>Gebelours,</hi> he picked out three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable <hi>Greeks,</hi> who for ſix <hi>Aſpers</hi> a piece, ſuffered themſelves to be tied by the legs with a thick Cord (like Pigs leading to the Market) for fear they ſhould eſcape into the Town, which they do as often as they can. I had been tied with the reſt, but that <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> undertook for my Fidelity, which turned much to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; for the <hi>Meymar</hi> believing me well affected thereupon, did me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put me among thoſe who were to throw the Grenadoes, and at that time were appointed to run up to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> Works, and pull away their bags of Wool and Earth, wherewith they had faced their Redoubts; and this was to be done in haſte, when the Enemy was hotteſt a firing; to coxe me, they told me by this means I ſhould have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be one of the firſt that ſhould cut off the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> heads; and indeed of fifty heads that were brought off, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty were cut off by thoſe Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado men; and they perſwaded me more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94489:204"/>
that two heads wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d do my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and make my Fortune for ever. Then it was I began to repent me of my forwardneſs, and I vowed ſolemnly to God Almighty, that if I went on with theſe Grenadeers, I would if poſſible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape into the Town, and loſe my life there to expiate my impious curioſity: In order to my Grenadierſhip, they had taken my Scuttle off my back, and put a linnen bagg full of Grenadoes about my ſhoulders like a ſcarff; but it came into my mind to tell them, that I feared I was not dexterous enough for that ſervice, and deſired that they would rather put me among thoſe who were to pull down the Paliſadoes; for, leſt I ſhould render my ſelf ſuſpected, I thought it not ſit to decline one ſervice, and recommend my ſelf to another that was not ſo dangerous; yet I had my reaſon, for that time was not altogether proper for pulling down Paliſadoes; the beſt time for that being after a rain, when faſtning ropes to them, they can looſen them with more eaſe; or elſe in a great wind, by firing Bavins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: To gratifie my requeſt they let me alone with my Scuttle and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock, and away I marched with a Raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Renegado, who, during our attaque,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:94489:205"/>
had orders to run away into the Town, and inform himſelf of its condition. They had given him his Leſſon, as <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> told me, and directed him to tell ſtrange ſtories out of the Camp, to make him the more credible to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He had inſtructions to tell them, That the <hi>Vizir</hi> inraged at the cowardize of his Troops, had killed three Officers with his own hand; that they were almoſt ſtarved in the Camp, the Soldiers mutining every day, and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> reſolved to cut off the <hi>Vizir</hi>'s head, if the Town were not taken in a month; and that as a mark of his diſpleaſure to the <hi>Grand Vizir,</hi> he had ſent to him to deliver a rich <hi>Veſt</hi> and a <hi>Sabre</hi> that he had given him not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; by ſuch ſtories as theſe they too often delude the poor <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way we met a party of <hi>Gionoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> or Voluntiers, who follow the Army at their own charges in hopes by ſome great action to merit a <hi>Timar,</hi> which is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recompence the <hi>Vizir</hi> beſtows upon ſuch perſons; but then they muſt wait for a vacancy, and they will be ſure to have an eye upon them. As we paſſed them we heard two or three of theſe <hi>Gionoullous,</hi> ſeeing our <hi>Ziams</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> marching upon ſervice, wiſh good luck to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:94489:205"/>
Muſquets, that they might make room for them; and indeed thoſe <hi>Timariots</hi> are never drawn out for an attaque, but the <hi>Ginoullous</hi> ſend their prayers along with them, that they may never return.</p>
            <p>We paſſed on to the firſt Trenches which the <hi>Turks</hi> had made upon the Rock, for having brought their Approaches ſo far, they could not any way ſecure themſelves but by bringing Earth from other places. When I ſaw their Trenches, I was amazed to think how the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> had deſcribed them: 'Tis true, they are not made ſo me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically as ours, with lines parallel to the front of the place beſieged. The way of the <hi>Turks</hi> is to advance as much as they can, and every forty paces to make an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow or little turning, which yet does not hinder their line. Their Intrenchments or Approaches are twice as broad as ours, which at the bottom are at moſt but ſeven or nine foot; whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> Trenches, when the ground will permit, are fifteen or ſixteen foot wide, that the Troops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſuſtain the Pioneers, may make a large front the better to repel the Salleys of the Garriſon. One thing I obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that is practiſed among us, They never begin to poſt their Soldiers in the Trenches till they have brought their
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94489:206"/>
approaches to the Counter-ſcarpe; for till they be advanced thither their Troops are lodged in the Redoubts, or places of Arms. Their places of Arms are open behind like ours, for the better drawing themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Battalia to repulſe a Salley. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts are generally faced with Stone: Their Trenches are made with Blindes, and their Blinds are made with thick pieces of Timber covered over with Faggots, and Earth upon them to ſhelter the Pioneers while they are at work.</p>
            <p>We drew out about fifty or ſixty Pioneers to repair a battery which the Canon from the Town had beaten down. I ſaw ſome of their Guns there that carried ſix and twenty pound Bullet. From this Platform it was, that looking towards their works, I ſaw as it were a Foreſt of Paliſado's that frighted me exceedingly: Imagine you ſaw a great Battalion of Pikes, with their Pikes advanced; their works were ſet as thick with Paliſado's, whereas in ſome places, the Paliſado's in the oppoſite works were ten foot aſunder. The ground had been blown up a hundred times by the Mines of one ſide or the other. In ſhort there was not one foot to ſpare, but immediately ſome Trench or other was thrown up in it; either a <hi>Bonnette,</hi> a <hi>Caponniere,</hi> or an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtature,</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:94489:206"/>
and that you may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with thoſe terms, being a ſort of works almoſt quite unknown in <hi>France,</hi> I ſhall explain them as follows. The <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette</hi> is a kind of Ravelin ſet round with Paliſado's; 'tis filled three foot thick with Earth to cover them from ſhot, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ditch. The <hi>Anteſtatures</hi> are little Traverſes or Retrenchments thrown up in haſte with bags of Earth, or <hi>Paliſado</hi>'s in ſome place that they cannot keep entire, but the Enemy having poſſeſſed themſelves of one part they would willingly preſerve the reſt.</p>
            <p>In ſpight of the danger I was in, I could not but admire that prodigious ground where more than once or twice ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men had been imployed a month to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to force a ſingle man back but four yards. No ground in the world did ever coſt ſo dear, though it were a Mine of Gold. The poſſeſſion of four Fathoms of ground in <hi>Candia,</hi> had been in diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty years, and gained at laſt with Rivers of blood, and many times the beſt blood in <hi>Europe.</hi> But I was taken from my contemplations to work in a Gallery that was to be carried on to the very wall of the Town. A Gallery is a way under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:94489:207"/>
carried on under the Enemies works for the paſſage of the Miner when he goes to prepare the Chamber of the Mine, with intention to blow up ſome work.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Galleries</hi> of both parties do often meet, and then they who can drive out the other, either with ſire or ſmoke, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of both, and the vanquiſhed muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. We no ſooner ſtruck a ſtroke with our Mattocks, but we clap'd our Ears to the ground to liſten whether the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not at work as well as we; for many times both ſides are working not above a foot from one another. At ſome times, and in ſome places the Pioneers for fear of being heard, have been glad to looſen the Earth with their Nails, or work it out with the point of their Knives. If any Mine be near, 'tis immediately ſprung, to blow up the Pioneers, and oftentimes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Earth deceiving the Engineer that cauſes it to be blown up, falls back upon thoſe who gave fire to the Mine, and the great art is to make them evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
            <p>In the little time I was digging there, I met more bones and carkaſes of men than ſhovels-full of earth; Sometimes I digged
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94489:207"/>
a man up from under my feet, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had I digged there but one hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I might have found him alive, and had him begg'd of me to pull him out. I muſt confeſs I had at that time great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours upon me, and being perceived by a young <hi>Turk</hi> that had been uſed to the Trade, I was laught at for my pains. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame occaſion he had many times leaped into the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Galleries, and brought away ſeveral of their Heads: He told our Camerades aloud that I was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Swords of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that he ſaw me three or four times put my hand to my neck to feel whether my head was not cut off. I opened my Eyes as well as my Ears to inform my ſelf whether the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were not at work near me, and to ſpeak truth, for the ſecurity of my head I found an obligation upon me to have a care how I ſlept in that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>At length the Mine being fitted, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to ſee it play; when we came forth of the Gallery we ſaw ſeveral <hi>Janizaries</hi> laughing to ſee us in that condition: There is a mortal hatred betwixt the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> and the <hi>Timariots,</hi> for the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> being never imployed but at handy-ſtrokes,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:94489:208"/>
have them in contempt who are imployed in the Mines. <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> was not a perſon that would be abuſed, and therefore ſeeing one of the <hi>Janizaries</hi> deriding him, told him, You are a happy man, for I have digg'd you a hole to hide your ſelf in. Another <hi>Timariot</hi> that was not commanded along with us, but expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us when we came off, at the end of the Gallery, came to congratulate with one of his friends, and embracing him, demanded, Do you come back empty handed? have you made your fortune upon the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and brought ever a head along with you? Yes one, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his friend) and that is my own, which I aſſure you was in no little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be imagined how much the <hi>Janizaries</hi> deſpiſe the <hi>Timariots,</hi> and all the <hi>Spahi</hi> in general. They call them in deriſion <hi>Sinek,</hi> which is as much as Flies, and this the <hi>Spahi</hi> are forced to indure, becauſe of the authority and ſtrict union among thoſe ſort of people: The nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name that the <hi>Spahi</hi> and <hi>Timariots</hi> give the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> is <hi>Toſlouk,</hi> or Buskins, becauſe they wear ſuch kind of things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:94489:208"/>
their Legs, but then they will be ſure to be the ſtronger, or they will never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to provoke them.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that we gave fire to our Mine, the beſieged ſprung two of their own: It was a diſmal ſpectacle to behold the Men and the Earth thrown up pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly into the Air, and the ſmoke being but little, gave us that lamentable convenience. Some of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were blown alive into the Trenches of the <hi>Turks</hi>; and ſome of the <hi>Turks</hi> waſted into the Ditch, others upon the Ramparts of the Town with their Arms in their Hands. It was like a horrible ſhower of fleſh to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſeparated Members come down, whilſt others were bruiſed and blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout from one ſide to another. We ran with all ſpeed to diſingage ſuch as were buried alive; ſome we found only fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any hurt. They ſhew me an <hi>Azappe,</hi> or one of their <hi>Perdu's,</hi> who had been twice digged out of the ground; but all were not ſo happy, for ſome of them were half buried, ſtuck faſt from the Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle downwards, and cried out with all their might, but they had as good have been quite under ground, for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:94489:209"/>
ran out and chopped off their heads.</p>
            <p>The effect of theſe three Mines was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have blown up ſome of the Guards; to have deſtroyed ſome Works; and in ſome meaſure inlarged the Breaches. The quantity of Powder required for a Mine, is fifteen, ſixteen, ſometimes Twenty, and Five and Twenty Barrels, according to the weight and thickneſs of the ground they would blow up. The <hi>Venetians</hi> to blow up the <hi>Placca</hi> made uſe of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Barrels, and they were no more than was neceſſary, being to blow up a Rock of Two and Twenty foot thick.</p>
            <p>It was in my power to have learned the conſtruction of their <hi>ſuperficial Furnaces</hi> as they called them in <hi>Candia</hi> where only they are in uſe; but I had not that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, and indeed I found I had had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too much. <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> came to Complement me at my coming out of the Works; and to cajole me, told me I had done wonders. That it was taken notice of by the <hi>Turks,</hi> that I was to value my ſelf much upon their approbation: That I ſhould doubtleſs have the honour to be
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:94489:209"/>
continued, and be by degrees infallibly advanced to ſome imployment more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy my addreſs. He told me moreover, that there was a deſign on foot, to commit the conduct and firing of one of their <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Furnaces</hi> to me; and the manner of thoſe Furnaces is thus. Three or four Bombes or Fire-balls are ſhut up cloſe in a Wooden Box, and the Box conveyed as near the Enemies Work as poſſible; when 'tis as near as you can get, you hide it in the ground, and cover it over with earth. There is nothing in the world better, nor quicker at ruining an Approach: There is no great difficulty to give fire to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be done with a Saucidge (as they call them) or a Train, at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you pleaſe. The great danger is in placing the Box, which though done for the moſt part in the night, does not make it altogether ſafe; for the Engineer is obliged to have a ſpecial care of his head. <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> preſented me with one of them, but God knows how joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I received it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Engineers have no ſooner invented a new way, either for their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications or Fire-works, but the <hi>Meymars</hi>

have preſent advertiſement by ſome of the Renegado's from the Town. The ſtories they have told of him in the Camp, have not only diſcovered but recommended to the eſtimation of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Inventions and Experiments of the <hi>Chevalier Verneda,</hi> who commands all the Engineers in the Gariſon; and the addreſs and dexterity of <hi>Giovine</hi> who is excellent at Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines. I found it was not true (though I had often been told it) that there were certain well diſciplined Troops of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Service. At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege indeed, the <hi>Turks</hi> being willing to have wheedled the <hi>Greek</hi> Nobleſs that belonged to the Iſle of <hi>Sfacciottes,</hi> did promiſe them free exerciſe of their Religion if they would ſerve againſt the <hi>Venetian</hi>; but they were ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Propoſal, that to ſhow their deteſtation, during the firſt years of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Invaſion, they made the <hi>Turks</hi> ſenſible of their indignation and courage, by many atchievements againſt them. Of this Iſland of <hi>Sfacciottes</hi> were the famous Colonels, <hi>Zymbi, Balzamo,</hi> and <hi>Calamo,</hi> of whom the <hi>Caloger</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> had given ſo fair a character, and of whoſe bravery I may perhaps give you a relation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

Many of the Inhabitants were Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>Italians,</hi> from whence their Fore-fathers had been invited by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperours into the ſaid Iſland after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation made in it by the <hi>Sarazens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt needs confeſs I have ſlept better than I did the twelfth of <hi>May</hi> at Night; I fancied my ſelf called every moment to go away with my ſuperficial Furnace, and ſee it do execution: I had no maw to the Service, I found my Conſcience not ſo good proof againſt the remorſes I felt for having ſerved againſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and if you will have the truth, perhaps there was ſome little mixture of fear.</p>
            <p>But the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> in the morning beyond my expectation, <hi>Oſman Chelebi</hi> having left me three hours before, came back again to me in great haſte, and told me he had a requeſt to me that I muſt not deny him: I thought of nothing but that I had been to go along with him upon ſervice, to enter ſome Breach, or ſpring ſome Mine with him; but he told me I muſt needs do him the favour to return to <hi>Emporion</hi> for him, for the <hi>Grand
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:94489:211"/>
Vizer</hi> had given him a very good <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> in thoſe parts; he himſelf being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to quit the ſervice, was conſtrained to deſire the courteſie of me to carry his Letters of Proviſion to his Father in Law, and to preſs him to take poſſeſſion of the <hi>Timar,</hi> by turning out a perſon who by <hi>ſurprize</hi> had got a Grant of it from the <hi>Beglerbey</hi> of <hi>Romulia</hi>; My Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits began immediately to revive: He needed no ſuch fine language to perſwade me, I offered my ſelf with the greateſt willingneſs imaginable, not ſo much as ſtraining a complement ſo far as to let him know how much pain and trouble it would be to me, to leave him behind: He gave me his diſpatches under the hand and ſeal of the <hi>Vizer</hi>'s <hi>Caima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Caimacan</hi> is an Officer conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, has a ſhare in the Civil Affairs, and manages them in part. In all <hi>Turkie</hi> there are never but three contemporary <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macans,</hi> and ſometimes but two: One is conſtantly Reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other alwayes attends the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and if the <hi>Grand Vizer</hi> be remote from the Court, he has another with him;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:94489:211"/>
but when he returns to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Court, that <hi>Caimacan</hi> is ſuſpended. The <hi>Grand Vizer</hi>'s <hi>Caimacan</hi> was like a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, or Preſident of the Council, and at that time had the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency of the Army in <hi>Candia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Saique</hi> being in ten dayes time to depart from <hi>Fraskia,</hi> it was reſolved I ſhould take that opportunity to paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Greece,</hi> ſo that as it pleaſed God, I ſate ſtill in the Camp all the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> not troubled with the fatigues or dangers of the Mattock and Scuttle; and <hi>Oſman</hi> hired ſome of the <hi>Azappes</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Pioneers to diſcharge the Duty that was upon him in reſpect of his <hi>Timar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening one of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> running to us out of the Town, brought News that one of our <hi>Bombes</hi> falling into the Baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of Saint <hi>Andre</hi> had killed the <hi>Magnifico Cornaro Proveditor General</hi> for the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> a Perſon, who being the very Soul of their Army, gave the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the greateſt occaſion of Conſternation that they had hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and the <hi>Turks</hi> on the other ſide, that their Joy might hold ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94489:212"/>
with the ſadneſs of their Enemy, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified it by their continual Salvo's both from their Cannon and Small-ſhot. It was above a Twelvemonth ſince the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> had Summoned the Town. Upon this accident he cauſed a White Flag to be hung out, and ſent them a Summons; but the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> repoſing ſtill upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Marqueſs <hi>de Saint Andre,</hi> by their great Firing gave him to underſtand that they were not yet reduced to Terms of Capitulation: Whereupon for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of his Camp, the <hi>Vizer</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be ſpread abroad, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected within three or four dayes an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from <hi>Venice</hi> to beg Peace upon his knee; adding, that <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf was Tumultuous and full of Factions upon the protraction of the War; and that the People being ruined and exhauſt with inſupportable Taxes, were ready upon the firſt opportunity to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the protection of the <hi>Turks:</hi> This was the great Artifice of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the common diſcourſe and belief of his whole Army.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I departed from the Camp the 21. of <hi>May,</hi> with a Paſs-port from
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94489:212"/>
the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> and Letters from <hi>Oſman Chelebi:</hi> About midnight I arrived at <hi>Fraskia,</hi> where I embarked in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Saique,</hi> and left the Coaſt full of Horſemen, who at that time kept bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more exact Guards than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon expectation of a deſcent by the Troops of the League, and the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes: They had News already that their ſeveral Fleets were come out, ſome from <hi>Thoulon,</hi> ſome from <hi>Civita-Vecchia,</hi> and ſome from <hi>Malta</hi>; and the Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes had made the Camp ring with the names of the Generaliſſimo <hi>Vincenzo Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiglioſi,</hi> of the Duke <hi>de Beaufort,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Navailles,</hi> the <hi>Comte de Vivonne,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier Acarigi</hi> General of the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi>; So that 'tis an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to believe the <hi>Turks</hi> are ignorant of the very particulars of our Affairs, when it is their intereſt to know them: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſels which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed daily in carrying over Men and Ammunition to <hi>Canea,</hi> do tell them all our <hi>deſigns</hi>: 'Tis true, by an effect of their great courage and prudence, the <hi>Turks</hi> do not ſeem to regard it; yet they have their conſtant Intelligences, and make preparations privately againſt them;
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:94489:213"/>
and ſometimes 'tis poſſible they are abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are: however let their reports or aſſurances as to this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching great action be what it will, God grant there may be a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betwixt the Commanders of the ſeveral Nations which make up the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours expected; If there be, it may pleaſe God they may proſper, if otherwiſe, there is great danger they will miſcarry.</p>
