         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You haue here set dovvne before you, not only the rules and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the olde auncient husbandes, as vvell Greekes as Latines, vvhose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry orders (for the most part) at this day vve obserue, and from vvhom (yf vve vvyl confesse the trueth) vve haue borrovved the best knovvledge &amp; skill, that our skilfullest husbandes haue: but also haue ioyned herevvithall, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and husbandry of our ovvne husbandes of England, as farre as eyther myne ovvne obseruations, or the experience of sundry my freendes vvoulde suffer me. And though I haue dealt vvith many, both Graines, Plantes, and Trees, that are yet strangers and vnknovven vnto vs, I doo no vvhit doubt, but that vvith good diligence and husbandry, they may in short time so be denisend and made acquainted vvith ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nothing lesse, though I woulde be very glad you should not so hastily forsake the Court, nor ridde your selfe from the affayres of the common wealth. You know we are not borne to liue to our selues, nor at our owne pleasures: but for our countrey, our common weale and state whereto we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. There can not be a woorse thing, then for a man to suffer his countrey forsaken, to come into the handes of villanous persons, and to reioyce with him selfe, that being out of Gunshot, he hath left the hurlie burlie of gonernment. And though <hi>Cato</hi> had no

               <p>I graunt you, as long as yeeres and strength wyll beare it, wee are bound to serue in our vocation: but as you your selfe are driuen to confesse, there is sometime a reasonable cause of geuing ouer. <hi>Lucullus</hi> is highly commended,<note place="margin">

The desyre of bearing rule in a common weale, is to be moderated with a certaine bounded modestie, specially in this age of ours, when Courtes are subiect to suche enuies, hatreds, flatteries, slaunders, couetous and ambitious desyres, and where no place is left for vertuousnesse and christian simplicitie.

When my Seruantes are all set to woorke, and euery man as busie as may be, I get me into my Closet to serue GOD, and to reade the holy Scriptures: (for this order I alwayes keepe, to appoint mee selfe euery day my taske, in reading some part eyther of the old Testament or of the newe): that doone, I write or reade such thinges as I thinke most needefull, or dispatche what businesse so euer I haue in my house, or with Sutars abrode. A litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner I walke abrode, if it be faire, eyther in my Garden, or in the Feeldes, if it be foule, in my Galerie: when I come in, I finde an Egge, a Thick, a peece of Rid, or a peece of Ueale, Fishe, Butter, and suche like, as my Foldes, my Yarde, or my Dayrie and Fishpondes wyl yeelde, sometime a Sallet, or such fruites as the Garden or Orchard dooth beare: whiche victuals without any charges my wyfe prouideth me, wherewith I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mee selfe aswell, as yf I had the dayntiest dishe in Europe. I neuer lightly sit aboue one houre at my meate: after dinner I passe the tyme with talking with my wyfe, my seruantes, or yf I haue any, with my ghestes: I rise and walke about my ground, where I viewe my woorkemen, my pastures, my medowes, my corne, and my cattel. When I am in the Countrey, I goe euery day, yf the weather be good, and no other great businesse, about my grounde: if not euery day, at the least once in two or three dayes: as often as I come to the Citie from the Countrey, I doo the like, to vnderstand howe my ground is husbanded, and what is doone, what vndoone: neither doo I euer goe about it, but some good commeth of my trauayle.

               <p>It may be, yet others doo counsayle, in no case to set your house neere a Marshe, or a great Riuer: for the Fennes and Marshes in the heate of the yeere, doo send foorth pestilent and deadly dampes, and a great number of venemous Creatures: which dying, for lacke of their olde moystoure, infecteth the ayre, and breedeth sundry and strange diseases. <hi>Homer</hi> affyrmeth very truely, that the ayre whiche in the mornyng commeth from the Riuer, is very vnholsome and daungerous: and therefore yf the house must needes be built neere a Riuer, they would haue suche heede taken, as the Riuer rather stande on the backside of the house, then before it: and that the frunt of the house be turned from the hurtfull and vnholsome wyndes, and placed towardes the healthiest quarters. Sins all waters commonly with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishe vapours in Sommer, and stincking colde mystes in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except they be well purged with holsome Windes, doo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect both man and beast with pestilence: best is it therefore in good and healthy places, to set the house toward the East, or the South, and in suspected ayres to place them agaynst the North. From the Sea it is good to be as farre as may be, because the windes that blowe from the Sea, are vnholsome, and the space lying betwixt you and it, yeeldes alwayes a lothsome ayre. You must beware besides, that you see not your house by any great hie way, least you be molested with passingers, and troubled often tymes with more ghestes then you would haue.</p>

But you maruayle what I meane by suche a long preamble, surely I am the longer in this matter, because you should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reason of building of my house. For whereas there are sundry purposes of building, and some build for pleasure, some for wantonnesse, and some for necessitie, I thought it good to resyte the mindes of the olde wryters, concerning the building of a house. And when as euerie one will not suffer suche curiositie as they require in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> placing of a house, some building vpon Riuers, some without or within the Marshe walles, who can not shunne the neighbourhood of the Riuer or the Sea, some in Lakes, some in Wooddes, and some building vpon mountaynes, are driuen to supply the defect of nature with arte &amp; industrie, I mee selfe syth I can by no meanes auoyde the neerenesse of the Riuer, do seeke as much as in mee lyes, to turne away the discomodities: and because I feele the discomoditie of the rysing of the flooddes, I haue set my house in this place without the bankes, and mounted it as hie as I could: and least the rage of the water, and force of the yce should beare it away, I haue planted round about it great trees: and that I might shun the dampes of the ground, and the blastes of vnholsome windes, I haue turned my doores and my windowes to the holsomest quarters.</p>

I doo not enquire whether he haue been brought vp ciuilly or deyntely, but I woulde haue him a hard fellowe, brought vp from his childehood to labour, and one that were throughly well skilled, of a meane age, that he be not vnwylling to woorke for youth, nor vnable to crauayle for age. I woulde haue him haue some skil in Carpentrie, that if there happened to be any thing broken about his Stables, his Cartes, or any other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4163:18"/>
his instrumentes, he might speedely mend them, and that he coulde mend Walles and Hedges. I woulde haue him also not vnskilful in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diseases of cattell: such a one as hath been brought vp with skilful husbandes, wyll prooue meetest to haue charge. For there be a great number, that though they be skilfull ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in their profession, yet haue they not gouernment in them: but eyther vsing to much sharpnesse, or to muche gentlenesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes suche as be vnder them, doo hinder the profite of their maister, and therefore I woulde haue a Bayliffe well tryed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be taken: neither is it onely to be sought, whether he be skilfull in this craft, but whether he be trustie and louing to his maister, without whiche, he is not woorth a rushe, though his skill be neuer so great. And cheefely, he must be skilfull in this, to know what worke is meetest for euery man: for some woorkes require strength more then skill, and others, otherwyse. And therefore in appointing of these, he ought to haue great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good discretion, which he can not haue, except he haue good skill. Therefore a Bayliffe is as well to be taught as a Smith, or a Carpenter: and the knowledge of husbandry is greater and of more difficultie. Wherefore I marueyle, that in this so necessarie an occupation, there are found so fewe maisters and prentices.</p>

               <p>Your question is good, I wyll shewe you, though very few haue taught what belongeth to a husband in all things, neither shall you finde many skilfull in euery point. Therefore he that shall be a Baylie, must be taught by degrees, he must fyrst begin when he is a childe,<note place="margin">

               <p>As I saide at the fyrst, his best age is betwixt thirtie and threescore: for the flames of lustie youth beginning to abate, he wyll not be so hotte in his wooing: for whyle he folowes that game, he wyll haue no minde but of his minion, neither shal any reward be so welcome vnto him, as the fruite of his fancie, nor any greefe so great to him, as the fayling of his desire. If he once passe threescore, he waxeth slouthfull and vnable to labour. For I had rather haue the woorke of a painefull and diligent Bayliffe, then the seruice of a great number of slouthful lubbers: as he that had rather haue a Lion captaine ouer Hartes, then a Hart cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouer Lions. This must cheefely be looked vnto (sins early going to woorke is a great matter) that the Bailiffe be a good riser, and that, supplying his maisters place, he may be the fyrst vp in the mornyng, and the last that goeth to bedde, and that he see the doores fast locked, and euery man in bedde, that the cattel haue meate yenough, and be well littured, that he set forward, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of the yeere, suche as doo loyter in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that he him selfe goe lustely before, that he suffer no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is day to lagge behinde, but that they folowe the Bayliffe lustely with a courage, as yf he were their captaine in a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe: and that he vse sundry deuises to cheare them vp in their labour, sometime as it were to helpe him that fainteth, to take his toole out of his hand, and labour lustely before him. And as a carefull shepheard earlie carying out his sheepe, and bringyng them home late, looketh that he leaue none of his flocke behinde him: so likewyse ought a good Bailiffe to carrie out his men, and to haue good regard ouer them. If any of them happen to be hurt or sicke, let him looke to the dressing of them, and yf they be very sicke, to carrie them to the sicke folkes lodging, and to see that they be well ordered: and to that vse haue I built yonder house that you see, remooued from the other buildinges, that the sicke may be had thyther and looked vnto, specially yf their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4163:19"/>
be contagious, lest other should be infected. It is the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters duetie to haue such regarde of the health of his seruauntes, and to haue such care of them, that their sicknesse may be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by good medicines and good looking to: as to see that theyr meate and drinke be wholsome and good, and geuen in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: beside, that the Bailiffe eate his meate with them, and not by him selfe, whereby it shalbe the better ordered. And because Phisitians are not alwayes at hand in the Countrey, it behoueth to vse such remedies as experience hath taught, and such as haue holpen others of like diseases. Those that labour in the Sunne (because the Sunne hurteth the body and the vaynes) theyr diet must be the thinner, that they make not to great meales, but eate litle and often: this order keepeth them in health, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth digestion. Some doo vse to geue Woormewood wine, or potage made of Woormewood. It is very necessarie for them sometimes to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There must be heede taken, that they drinke not when they be hotte, nor lye vppon the colde ground: yf their water be not good, it must be wel purified. It is very good also to let them drinke Barly water. We must remember that seruantes be men: besides, such good looking to, wyll breede a greater good wyll and duetie, and lightly they wyl serue the faythfuller and better when they haue their health, whiche haue had good cherishing in their sicknesse: and besides (which is not so well obserued in greater gouernours) the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe must beware that he deale not to cruelly, nor to gently with them, that he alwayes make much of those that be diligent and painefull, that he be not to hastie with the woorser sort, that they may rather reuerence him for his seueritie, then hate him for his crueltie, whiche he shall easely bring to passe, yf he rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that they offende not, then after their offence to late to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe them. For there is none so good a bridle for an euil disposed person, as to let him alwayes be occupied. So that <hi>Catoes</hi> saying herein is most true, that men in dooing nothing, learne to doo euyll. Let them haue their allowance and their meate in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, let them alwayes feede togeather in one place, and the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe with them, that he may be an example to them of all thrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

Also yf it be wette or weepyng ground, or subiect vnto other inconueniences, and suche grounde also, according to the nature of the soyle, is good or euyl. In some Countreys stonie grounde is altogeather barren, specially for Corne and Fruite. In other places agayne, they vse stones in the manuring and bettring of their lande, as in certayne places of Arden is to be seene. <hi>Theophrascus</hi> wryteth, that the <hi>Corynths</hi> dyd cast away all the stones out of the Feeldes of <hi>Sarragosa,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made the ground the woorse, when, the stones being away and the Countrey hot, there was no succour left to defend the ground from the extreame heate of the Sunne. In other places in stonie and hilly groundes Otes doo prosper well. In lyke sort, in all Countreys we must regarde the layre of the Countrey, and the nature of the seede that we sowe: for Grauell in some places is cast vppon the ground in steade of doung, and some thinges pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per best in grauelie groundes.

It is also something to the purpose, whether the grauell be white, redde, or yellowe: besides, some grounde dooth deceaue both with colour and qualitie. In some Countreys the blacke mould is onely esteemed: in others, the fat redde mould is thought best. In Englande, the chalkie grounde beareth good corne, and pastures very well. In some places the thicke and the clammie ground is most fruitefull. In al these it is to be learned, what is best for the hill ground, what for the valley, what for the tylled, what for the leye grounde, what the moyst seggie grounde requires, and what the drye and barraine. Also in planting, what ground is best for Uines, what for other trees, what delightes in drie ground, what in moyst ground. <hi>Virgil</hi> commendeth a mellowe ground that is fatte, and wyll soone be resolued, for such ground is tylled with smalest charge and labour: the next, is that whiche

the fyrst point of husbandry, to be to prepare the grounde well, the seconde, to plowe it well, and the thirde, to doung it well. Of plowing and turnyng vp the grounde, the fashion is diuers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the nature of euery soyle &amp; countrey. All great feeldes are tylled with the Plowe and the Share, the lesser with the Spade. The Plowes are of sundry fashions, accordyng to the diuersitie of Countreys, some single, some double, some with wheeles, some without. The partes of the Plowe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The partes of the plow.</hi>
                  </note> are the Tayle, the Shelfe, the Beame, the Foote, the Coulter, the Share, the Wheeles, and the Staffe. The Share, is that which fyrst cuttes the way for the Coulter, that afterwards turnes vp the Forowe. Where the ground is light, they vse only a small Share. In Liff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande they haue for their Plowe nothing but a Forke. In <hi>Syria,</hi> where they can not goe very deepe, they vse (as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> writes) very little Plowes. <hi>Plinie</hi> wryteth, that wheeles for Plowes were deuised by the Frenchemen, and called <hi>Plugrat,</hi> a Germaine name, which corruptly is printed <hi>Planarati.</hi> In diuers places where the grounde is stiffe, they haue a litle wyng on the ryght syde of the Coulter, whiche wyng is to be remooued to whiche syde you list: with the Rodde or Staffe well poynted, the plowman maketh cleane his Coulter. When you woorke, your Oxen must be yoked euen togeather, that they may drawe more handsomely with heads at libertie, and lesse hurt to their neckes. This kinde of yoking is better liked of many, then to be yoked by the hornes:<note place="margin">

Where Horses may be vsed, their vse is more commodious for the Plowe, and the fewer of them the better: for many Horses drawe too hastyly, and make too large Furrowes, which is not good: whereby we see the grounde to be excellently well plowed in Gelderland,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:4163:26"/>
must be the greater and the stronger, that it may goe the deeper: for yf the crust of the earth be turned vp very brode, it remayneth still hole, whereby neither the weedes are killed, nor the ground can be well harrowed. The Furrowe ought not to exceede one hundred and twentie foote in length, for yf it doo, as <hi>Columella</hi> sayth, it is hurtfull to the beastes, because they are to muche wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried withall: but this rule, where the feeldes are large, is not in many places regarded, as in the Countrey of Gulicke, where the feeldes are great, their Furrowes are drawen very long. You must not plowe in wette weather, nor wette ground, nor when after a long drouthe a little rayne falling, hath but wette the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, and not gone deepe. If it be too wette when it is plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it dooth no good that yeere. You must therefore haue a regard to the temperature of your season, that it be neither to drye, nor to wette: for, too muche moysture maketh it to durtie, and too great drynesse maketh that it wyll neuer woorke well: for eyther the hardnesse of the Earth resisteth the Plowe, or yf it doo enter, it breakes it not small yenough, but turneth vp great flakes, hurtful to the next plowing. For though the land be as riche as may be, yet yf you goe any deapth,<note place="margin">

Where you haue plowed in a drye season, it is good to haue some moysture in your second stirring, whiche moistning the grounde, shall make your labour the lighter. Where the grounde is riche, and hath long borne water, it is to be stirred againe when the weather waxeth warme, and when the weedes are full growen, and haue their seedes in their toppe, whiche being plowed so thicke, as you can scarse see where the Coulter hath gone, vtterly killeth and destroyeth the weedes: besides, through many stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes, your Fallowe is brought to so fine a moulde, as it shall neede very little or no harrowing at all when you sowe it: for the old Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore with vs, we vse to begin to plowe about the middest of Marche: but in sandy and light grounde, they vse to plowe in the middest of Winter, yf the season wyll suffer, <hi>Plinie</hi> is of opinion, that stiffe ground also should then be stirred. A slendar and leuell ground, subiect to the water, would be fyrst plowed in the ende of August, and stirred againe in September, and prepared for sowyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the twelfth of Marche. The light hilly ground, is not to be broken vp in Sommer, but about the Ralendes of September: for yf it be broken vp afore, being barren and without iuyce, it is burnt vp with the Sunne, and hath no goodnesse remayning in it. Wette ground, some would haue broken vp after the Ides of April, whiche being plowed at that time, shoulde be stirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne about the tenth of Iune, and after againe, about the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendes of September, according to <hi>Columellaes</hi> minde. But those that are skilfull in husbandry agree, that after the tenth of Iune, without great store of rayne, you shall not plowe: for yf the yeere be wette, there is nothing to the contrary but you may plowe in Iuly. In the meane time, beware that you deale not with ground ouerwette, as I gaue you warnyng before.</p>

               <p>After long rest, or the fyrst dounging, eyther Barley or Wheate is to be sowen: but Wheate, though it require good ground, yet yf the ground be to riche where it is sowen, it wyll growe to ranke, and lye leadge vpon the grounde. And therefore vppon suche grounde, it is best to sowe your Wheate after a crop of Barley, Pease, or Buck, and after your Wheate crop, to sowe it with Rye: and then againe (yf the grounde waxe not poore) with Barley. In very riche grounde, immediatly after the geathering of Rape seede, plowe it presently for Bucke, whereby you may haue two Croppes in one yeere. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Cabegged Rape sowen after Rye, maketh two haruestes in one yeere.

After it is sowen, it putteth out a great company of small rootes, and appeareth at the fyrst wy or blade: it hath sundry stalkes, but suche as can not branche all the Winter, as other Winter Corne is, it is nourished in blade: when the Spring draweth on, it beginneth to spindle: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the thirde or fourth ioynt thereof, commeth out the eare, which fyrst appeareth enclosed in the blade, it flowreth the fourth or fyfth day after: yf it growe to rancke at the fyrst, it is eaten downe with cattel, or in some place mowed: it is after weeded, it flowres about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tenth of Iune, sooner or later, as the yeere falles out, euen at one time almost with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uine, two noble floures with comfortable sauour flourishing at once. <hi>Varro</hi> affyrmeth, that the Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the flowre is gone, the grayne begins to swel, and in foure or fyue dayes after to ripe. The blade of the Wheate is something like a Sedge, but narrower then the Barley: the Spindel, Stalke, or Strawe thereof, is smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and gentler, and not so brittle as of Barley. It is closed in many coates. The stalke that beareth the eare is higher then that of Barley, the eare groweth more vpryghe and farther from the blade, the chaffe is softer, sweeter, and more full of iuyce, the eare of Wheate is out of order and vneuen, as well of the Pollard as of the hearded, where as Barley hath his eare of iust number and in perfect order.

It must be sowed after the third plowing as Wheate &amp; harrowed much after the same sort, the stalke or steale thereof, is smaller then the Wheate stalke, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and stronger, his care hanging downewardes, and therefore more subiect to blasting, because it receiueth and keepeth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that falles whyle it flowreth, and suffereth the violence of mystes and frostes: the strawe thereof is gentle and flaxible, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for Uines and coueringes of houses.

The other sort is called <hi>Distichon,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the eare but two rankes or orders only. Agayne, there is one kinde of it to be sowed in Winter, an other for Sommer. The Winter Barley is of better yeeld, but it is soone hurt, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with much wette and frostes folowyng. There is nothyng more hurtfull to Winter Corne, specially Barley, Rape seede, and Rye, then the wette of Winter, nipped with often frostes, and after a warme thawe to be presently frozen agayne: both the sortes of Barley require grounde that is very riche. Winter Barley after two or three plowinges, is to be sowed in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Sommer Barley in March, or April, after twyse plowing: and many times, necessitie forcing, after once plowing: in the sowing, you must occupie more seede by halfe, then in sowyng of Wheate: it requires a mellowe and a fatte ground, and therfore

The good and the riche grounde hath no neede of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowyng, the Hay being muche better that groweth of the selfe goodnesse of the grounde, then that whiche is forced by waters: whiche sometime notwithstandyng is needefull, yf the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the grounde requireth it: for in badde and noughtie grounde, good Meddowe may be made, if it lye to be ouerflowen: but then must the grounde neither lye hollowe, nor in hilles, lest the one of them keepe the waters vppon it to long, and the other presently let it soorth agayne. Therefyre lyeth the grounde best, that lyeth leuelest, which suffereth not the water to remayne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long, nor auoydeth it too soone. If in suche grounde it chaunce to stand ouerlong, it may be auorded with water streame at your pleasure: for both ouerplus, and the want of water are alike hurtfull vnto Meddowes. It is very handsome, where drye and barrayne grounde lyeth so by the Riuer, as the water may be let in by Trenches when you lyst: in fine, the occupying of Pasture groundes require more care then trauayle. First, that we suffer not Busshes, Thornes, nor great Weedes, to ouergrowe them, but to destroy some of them, as Brembles, Bryers, Bulrusshes, and Sedges in the ende of Sommer, and the other that be Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Weedes, as Sowthystell, and all other Thystels, in the Spring. You must take heede of Swyne, that spoyle and turne vp the grounde ilfauouredly, and all other Cattell: except it be in hard and drye weather, for otherwyse they gult and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4163:49"/>
Februarie, the Moone encreasing, and the stones, stickes, and suche baggage as lye scattered abrode, are to be throwen out soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later, as the grounde is. There are some Meddowes that with long lying, are ouer growen with Mosse, whiche the old husbands were woout to remedie with casting of certaine seedes abrode, or with laying on of doung, specially Pigeons doung: but nothing is so good for this purpose, as often to cast asshes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it, for that destroyeth Mosse out of hand. Notwithstanding, these are but troublesome remedies. The best and certainest is to plowe it: for the grounde after his long rest, will beare goodly Corne. But after you haue plowed it, it wyll scarse recouer his olde estate againe for Pasture or Meddowe in three or foure yeeres. When you meane to let your ground lye againe for Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe or Pasture, your best is to sowe it with Oates, and to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the grounde euen and leuell, and to hurle out all the stones and suche thinges as may hurt the Sythe: for Oates is a great breeder of Grasse. Some doo cast Hey seede, geathered from the Heyloaft or the racks, ouer the grounde before they harrowe it. Others agayne, when their Meddowes haue lyen long, sowe Beanes vpon them, or Rape seede, or Millet, and the yeere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wheate: and the thirde yeere they let them lye againe for Meddowe or Pasture. You must beware, that whyle the ground is loose and soft, you let not in the water, for the force of the water wyll washe away the earth from the rootes of the Grasse, and wyll not suffer them to growe togeather: neither must you (for the like daunger) suffer Cattell to come vppon it, except in the seconde yeere Goates, or Sheepe, or suche like, after you haue mowed it, and that yf the season be very drye. The thirde yeere you may put on your greater sort of Cattell againe, and yf the grounde be hilly and barrayne, you may doung the highest part of it in Februarie, as I saide before, casting on it some Hey seede: for the higher part being mended, the rayne or water that comes to it, wyll carry downe some part of the richenesse to the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. as I saide before, when I spake of the manuring of eara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounde. But yf you wyl lay in newe grounde for Meddowe, and that you may haue your choyse, take such as is ritche, dewye, leuell, or a little hanging, or choose suche as valley, where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4163:49"/>
can neither lye long, nor runne away to fast: neither is the rancke Grasse alwayes a signe of good grounde: for what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer Grasse is there saith <hi>Plinie,</hi> then is in Germanie, and yet you shall there haue sand within a little of the vpper part. Neither is it alway a watrie grounde where the Grasse growes hie, for the very Mountaines in Sycherland yeeld great and hie Grasse for Cattell. The Pastures that lyes by the Lakes of <hi>Dumone</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri</hi> and <hi>Hungry</hi> are but selender, nor about the Rhine, specially at his falling into the Sea about Holland, as likewyse in Frislande and Flaunders. <hi>Caesar Vopiscus,</hi> the Feeldes of <hi>Roscius</hi> were the principal of Italie, where the Grasse would so soone growe, as it woulde hide a staffe in a day. You may make good Meddowe of any grounde, so it may be watred. Your Meddowes are to be purged in September and October, and to be ridde of all Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, Brambles, and great foule Weedes, and al thinges els that annoy them: then after that it hath often been stirred, and with many times plowing made fine, the stones cast away, and the cloddes in euery place broken, you must doung it well with freshe doung, the Moone encreasing. Let them be kept from gulling and trampling of Cattel. The Mouldhilles &amp; dounging of Horse and Bullockes, must with your Spade be cast abroade, whiche yf they remaine, would eyther be harberours of Antes and suche like Uermine, or els breeders of hurtful and vnprofitable weedes: your Meddowes must be laide in towardes Marche, and kept from Cattell, and made very cleane: yf they be not ritche, they must be mended with doung, whiche must be laide on, the Moone encreasing, and the newer the doung be, the better it is, and the more Grasse it makes: whiche must be laide vpon the toppe of the highest of the grounde, that the goodnesse may runne to the bottome. The best hearbe for Pasture or Meddowe, is the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foyle or Clauer: the next is sweete Grasse: the woorst as <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, is Russhes, Fearne, and Horsetayle.</p>

               <p>Almost in the like same sort, some do vse short Sythes, mowing it with one hand: but we here doo vse the common great Sythe, mowing with both our handes, as I saide before, that Oates, and Barley, and suche other like Corne was mowed: whiche Sythes we vse to sharpe with Whetstones, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of Wood dressed with Sande. The Grasse being cutte, must be well tedded and turned in the Sommer, and not cocked till it be drye: and yf it chaunce to be wette with rayne, it must not be turned, till the vpper part be dryed. There is a measure to be vsed in making of it, that it be not had in too drie, nor to greene. The one sort, yf the iuyce be dryed vp, serueth only for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the other (too greene and moyst) yf it be carryed into the Loft, rotteth, and the vapour being ouerheated, falleth on fyre and burneth. And yf so be the rayne chaunce to fall vpon the Grasse that is newe cut downe, yf it be not stirred, it takes not so muche harme: but yf it be once turned, you must still be stirring of it, otherwyse it will rotte. Therefore the vppermost part before it be turned, must be well dryed with the Sunne and the Winde: when it is dryed, we lay it in windrowes, and then make it vp in Cockes, and after that in Moowes, which must be sharpe and piked in the toppe, the better to defend it from the rayne: whiche yf it doo not fall, yet is it good so to doo, that they may sweate in the saide Moowes, and digest what so euer moysture is in it. And therefore good husbandes doo not lay it vp in their Loftes, till suche time as it hath sweat in the Feelde. Grasse is commonly mowed twyse a yeere, in May or Iune, and againe after Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest: the first mowing is counted the best.

A well ordered peeece of lande is helde deare, and yeeldes no great encrease, and therefore is neither so pleasant nor so profitable, as that which by good husbandry may be made better. <hi>Cato</hi> woulde haue two thinges to be obserued in bying of lande, the goodnesse of the ground, and the holsomenesse of the ayre: of whiche two, yf eyther be lacking, whosoeuer dooth bye it, he iudgeth him mad, and meete to be sent to Bedlem: for none that is well in his wittes, wyll bestowe cost vppon barraine grounde, nor hazarde him selfe for a little riche grounde, to be alwayes subiect to pestilentiall diseases: for where a man must deale with the Deuil, there is not onely his commoditie, but his life doubtfull, and rather his death then his gayne certaine.

And <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporteth, that king <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as great a prince as he was, woulde plant with his owne handes, and sette Trees in his Orchardes, in suche order, as it seemed an earthly paradise. <hi>Qu. Curtius</hi> writeth of <hi>Abdolominus,</hi> that for his great vertue, of a poore Gardner, came to be king of the <hi>Sidonians.</hi> And surely, not vnwoorthyly is this part of husbandry esteemed, seeing it doth not alonely bring great pleasure, but also is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable for the maintenaunce of household, and the sparing of charges, ministring to the husband dayly foode and sufficient sustenaunce without cost. For when (as <hi>Columella</hi> sayth) in the olde time the people liued more temperately, and the poore at more libertie fedde of fleshe and milke, and suche thinges as the ground and foldes yeelded: but in the latter age when ryotte and daintinesse began to come in, and the wealthyer sort to esteeme no fare but costly, and farre fetched, not content with meane dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but coueting such thinges as were of greatest price, the poore people as not able to beare the charges, were banished from the costlier eates, and driuen to content them selues with the basest

foode. And hereof sprang at the fyrst the planting of Orchardes, and making of Gardens, wherewith the poorest creature that was, might store his Kitchin, and haue his victuals alwayes at hand, the Orchard and Garden seruing for his Shambles, with a great deale more commendable &amp; hurtlesse dyet. Herein were the olde husbandes very careful,<note place="margin">

As for fleshe, it was rather lothed then vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. Only Orchardes and Gardens did chiefely please them, because the fruites that they yeelde, needed no fyre for the dressing of them, but spared wood, being alwayes of them selues redy dressed, easie of digestion, and nothing burdensome to the stomacke: and some of them seruing also to pouder or preserue withal, as good marchandize at home, as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth, not driuing men to seeke Pepper as farre as Indie. Of <hi>Lucrin,</hi> I the Oysters not regarde, as the Poet sayth. And therefore to make them of more woorthynesse, and that for their common profyte they shoulde not be the lesse regarded, there were diuers noble men of the house of <hi>Valerius,</hi> that tooke their surnames of Lettuse, and were not ashamed to be named Lettismen.<note place="margin">

The ordring of Gardens is diuers, for some are made by the Manour houses, some in the Suburbes, some in

the Citie, where so euer they be, yf the place wyll suffer, they must be made as neare to the house as may be: but so, as they be as farre from the Barnes as you can, for the chaffe or dust blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them, and eyther subiect to the Doung heape, whereby it may be made riche, or els in some very good grounde that hath some small Brooke runnyng by it, or yf it haue none suche, some Well or Condite, whereby it may be watred. An excellent plotte for the purpose is that which declineth a little, and hath certaine gutters of water running through diuers partes therof: for Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens must alwayes be to be easily watred, yf not, with some run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng streame, some Pompe is to be made, or Kettell, Myll, or suche like,<note place="margin">

If you can not thus haue water, you must make some standing Pond at the vpper part of the ground, that may receyue and conteyne such water as falles from aboue, wherewith ye may water your Garden in the extreame heate of the Sommer: but where neither the nature of the soyle, nor conueiance by Conduite, or Pompe, or running streame is to be had, you haue no other helpe but the rayne water of Winter, which yf you also haue not, then must you delue &amp; lay your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den three or foure foote deepe: which being so ordered, wyll well be able to abide what so euer droughth doo happen. This is also to be regarded, that in Gardens that are destitute of water, you so order them into seuerall partes, that what part you wyll occupie in Winter, may lye toward the South, and that which shal serue you for Sommer, may lye towardes the North. In a Garden, as in the choyse of Corne grounde, you must looke whether the goodnesse of the ground be not hindered by the vnskilfulnesse of hym that hath occupied it. You must also make choyse of your water, of whiche the best as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth) are the coldest, and such as be sweete to drinke: the woorst, that comes from Ponds, or is brought in by trenches, because they bring with them the

Nowe for enclosures, there are sundry kindes, some making earth in mould doo counterfeite Brickwalles: others make them of lime and stones, some others of stones laide one vpon an other in heapes, casting a ditche for water rounde about them, whiche kinde <hi>Palladius</hi> forbiddes to followe, because it wyll drawe out the moysture from the Garden, except it be in marrishe grounde. Other make their fence with the seedes and settes of Thorne: some make them of mudde walles couered with strawe or heath, <hi>Varro</hi> maketh mention of foure kindes of enclosure, the fyrst naturall, the second wylde, the thirde souldierly, the fourth, of Carpenters woorke. The fyrst and naturall is the quickset Hedge, being set of young Thornes, whiche once well growen, regardeth neyther fyre nor other hurt. The seconde is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hedge made of dead wood, wel staked and thicke plasshed, or raylde. The third the Souldiers fortefying, is a deepe Ditch with a rampier: but the Ditche must be so made, as it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue al the water that comes from aboue, or falles into it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vaumure must be so steepe, that it may not easily be climed.

This kinde of fence is to be made, where the ground lyes neare the hie way, or buts vpon the Riuer, of which sort I shal haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to speake more hereafter.

               <p>Of the sundry sortes of ground, and of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of them, because you in your describing of Corne ground before haue sufficiently spoken, I doo not thinke it needefull for me to repeate it. Againe, it is yenough to me to adde onely this, that the ground ought not to be too riche nor too leane, but fatte and mellowe, which bringeth foorth a small kinde of Grasse lyke heares: such ground requires least labour, the stiffe and the riche ground asketh greater paines about it, but dooth recompence it agayne with his fruitefulnesse. The stiffe, leane, and cold ground, is not to be medled with, as <hi>Columella</hi> wryteth in appoynting good ground for Gardens.

Many thinges may be sowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these seasons, and yet doo very well. All Garden hearbes are commonly sowen before the tenth of Iune, suche thinges as you would not haue seede, you may sowe after this time.

These are sowed about March, or about Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and as <hi>Columella</hi> sayth, doo come eyther of the seede, or of the slippe: some of the Roote, some of the Stalke, some of the Leafe, some of the Clot, some of the Head, some of both: others of the Barke, others of the Pith: some, both of the seede and the slippe, as Rue, wylde Marierum, and Basyl, this they cutte of, when it comes to be a handfull hye: others growe both of the Seede and the Roote, as Onyons, Garlyke, and suche lyke. And although al thing wyll growe of their seedes, yet this they say, Rue wyll not doo: for it very seeldome springes, therefore they rather set the slippes.

The weedes that growe, must be well plucked away, after the fourtieth day they come vp as it were to one roote, and tangled togeather, the rootes haue sundry long threedes, which they call the Sponge. In ground that is drye, the seedes are to be set deepe, and well tempered with doung. In wette groundes on the other side, they are to be set shallowe in toppe of the borders, lest the moysture destroy them. The fyrst yeere you must breake of the stalkes that growe, for yf you plucke them vp by the rootes, the whole settes wyll folowe, which are to be preserued for two yeere with dounging and weeding. All the yeeres after, you must not geather them in the stalke, but pull them from the roote, that the rootes being opened may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spring, which except you doo, you hurt the spring. Him that you meane to keepe for feede, you must in no wyse meddle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, after, burne vp the busshes, and in Winter doung well the rootes with doung and ashes, they are planted also of the rootes, which after two yeeres you must remooue into a warme and wel dounged grounde. The trenches where you meane to set them, must stand a foote a sunder, and a shaftman in depthe, wherein you must so lay your Sponges (as being couered) they may best growe: bnt in the spring before they come vp, you must loose the earth with a little Forke, to cause them the better to spring, and
<pb facs="tcp:4163:59"/>
to make the rootes the greater. <hi>Cato</hi> woulde haue you to take them, but so, as you hurt not the rootes, &amp; after to pull the plant from the roote: for yf you otherwyse breake it, the roote wyl dye, and come to nothing.

Some thinke, that the fyrst yeere it is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to doo any thing to the plant, but onely to weede it. From the rootes, which they call the sponges, there springeth fyrst cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne buddes with crompled knoppes, very good and pleasaunt for sallettes: whiche yf you suffer to growe, it straight bussheth foorth with braunches lyke Fennell, and at length growe to be prickely: after it hath flowred, it beareth a Berrie, fyrst greene, and when it is rype, redde. If you would haue Sallettes of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus</hi> al the yeere through: when you haue geathered the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, open the rootes that runne aloft by the grounde with dyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng, and you shall haue the rootes send foorth newe buddes out of hand.

The rootes or

There are redde Lillyes made so by arte, for they take the stalkes and rootes of the Lillye, and hang them in the smoke till they wyther, and when the knottes begyn to vncouer, they are layde in Marche in the lees of redde wine, tyl they be colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and then sette in the grounde with the lees powred about them, so wyll they come to be purple.

The broader and the wyder that you make your furrowes, the fayrer and more fruitfull wyl your trees be, and the fruite the better. Your furrowe must be made like an Ouen, or Furnace, wyder at the bottome then aboue, that the roote may spreade the better, and the colde in Winter, and the heate in Sommer, may the better be kept from it, and also in steepe groundes, the earth shall not so easily be washed away.

Some doo cut the poynt of theyr graffe three square, so as two sides are bare, and the other couered with his barke: and in that sort they vse to graffe in a stocke one against another, but it is thought best to graffe no more but one. When you haue thus set in your graffe in the stocke, plucke out the wedge: but here is a great carefulnesse, and heede to be vsed. And therefore, good grafters thinke it best to holde the graffe euen with both handes, least in the binding and pulling out of the wedge, the graffe be hurt, or stande vneuen. For auoydyng of whiche, some vse for to binde the stocke about, and after to put in the wedge, the bandes keeping it from openyng to wide.

Of that tree that you meane to graffe, chouse the youngest and the fayrest branches you can, and in them take the budde that is likeliest to growe, and marke it rounde about two inches square, so as the budde stand euen in the middest, and then with a sharpe knife cutte it rounde about, and flawe of the rynde, takyng good heede you hurt not the budde, and take out the peece.

                  </note> for <hi>Columella</hi> dooth counsell to sette the Uine in a wylde ground, rather then where Corne or Busshes haue growen: for as for olde Uineyardes, it is most certayne they are the woorst places of all other to sette newe in, because the ground is matted, and as it were netted with the remaynes of the olde rootes: neyther hath it lost the poyson of the rotten and olde stinkyng rootes, wherewith the soyle (glutted as it were with venime) is benommed. And therefore the wylde and vntyld ground is cheefely to be chosen, which though it be ouer growen with shrubbes and trees, may yet easily be ridde. If such wylde ground be not to be had, the best is the plaine cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion lande without trees: yf neyther suche a grounde, then the lyght and thinne busshie grounde, or Olyue grounde. The last and woorst (as I sayde) is the olde rotten Uineyard, which yf necessitie compell you to take, you must fyrst ridde the grounde of all the olde rotten rootes, and then couer it eyther with olde doung, or with the newest of any other kynde of manuryng: the rootes beyng thus digged vp, must be layde vp togeather, and burned. After must the ground be consydered, whether it be mellowe and gentle: it is thought to be good, that is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng greety and grauelly, and full of smal peebles, so that it be mingled with fatte mould withall, whiche yf it be not, is vtterly disalowed.

The lyke is to be done with all other trees. Of plantyng of Uines, there is two wayes, the one of the roote, the other of the branche, or spray: the roote is counted a great deale better then the branche or set, by reason of the forwardnesse, and vauntage that it hath, in that it hath alredy taken roote. The roote is set in stiffe ground, well digged and laboured, in a trenche of three foote, the set or spray, in a gentle and mellowe ground: in drye ground, it is neyther good to set the roote, nor the branche, in a drye season: it is best to plant in the fall of the leafe in a hotte season, and in a colde and moyst, in the spring: in much wet, you must set them thinner, in great dryeth, thicker: in what sort you shall make a store Garden for Uines, <hi>Palla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The rootes doo beare fruite the second yeere, or sooner: the settes, or branches, skarse in the thirde or fourth yeere, though in some places sooner. <hi>Didymus</hi> in <hi>Constantine,</hi> teacheth an easie and a redy way of plantyng the quicksette: whiche is, to take of a strong and ten yeere Uine, the longest and fayrest branch, that groweth lowest, a foote from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and laying it along in a trenche of a foote deapth, to couer it with earth the space of foure ioyntes, so that the remayne in the toppe, exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, you must geather your sette, not of the highest, nor the lowest, but from the middest of the Uine: the sette must be round smooth, full of knottes and ioyntes, and many littel burgeons. As soone as you haue cut it of, looke that you sette it: for better dooth it agree with the ground, and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner growe. If you are dryuen to keepe them, burie them in the ground eyther loose, or loosely bounde: and yf the tyme be long that you meane to keepe them, you must laye them in empty barelles, strawing earth vnder them, and vpon them, that the earth may lye round about them: and the barrel you must stop closely with clay, that there enter neyther wynde nor ayre, so shall you preserue them two monethes in their goodnesse. Such as are ouer drye, you must lay them in water .xxiiii. houres afore you sette them, and you must set two settes togeather, that though the one fayle, the other may take: and yf they both grow, you may take vp the lesser of them: you must not make a medley of sundry sortes, specially white and blacke togeather: but as <hi>Columella</hi> sayth, must sort them seuerally.

You must lay about them three or foure stones, and then rayse the earth, that it may equally with the doung be troden downe: for the stones keepeth the earth fyrme, and as I sayde before, cooleth the roote. Both the endes of the sette you must annoynt with Oxe doung, for the killyng of the woormes: as for the length, yf it be full of ioyntes, it may be the shorter, yf it haue fewe ioyntes, you must make it the longer, and yet not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedyng a foote in length,<note place="margin">

The trenches for Uines, <hi>Virgil</hi> woulde not haue very deepe: but deeper a great deale for trees. Such Uines as you meane shall runne vpon trees, you must plant three cubites distant from the tree: afterwardes, when they be well growen, and neede to be ioyned with the tree (whiche you shall perceyue by his thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) you shall lay it downe in length, and bury it, till it come within a foote of the tree, suffering the remaine to goe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nipping of all the buddes with your nayle, except one or two, that it may the better prosper, whiche when it is growen vp, you must ioyne by little and little to the tree, that it may rest vpon it: which part of the tree must be diligently proyned, and the springes and scyenses, that growe out of the roote, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Florentinus,</hi> be cut cleane away.

Yet must not your settes be too nearely cut, except they be very feeble: but the fyrst yeere they be set, they must be holpen with often digging, and pullyng of the leaues moonthly whyle they beare, that they may grow the better. <hi>Pamphilus</hi> in <hi>Constantine</hi> declareth the time of cuttyng, or proynyng, to begin in Februarie, or March, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiftienth of Februarie, tyll the twentieth of Marche: some (he sayth) thought good to cut them immediatly after the geathering of the Grapes, least by bleedyng in the spring, they loose theyr su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance: though being cut in the fall of the leafe, it springeth the sooner in the spring, and yf the cold of frost happen to come, it is spoyled. Therefore in colde countreys, it were better to proyne it a little, then to cut it throughly, that is, to suffer the principall springes, and branches to growe. Agayne, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary to cut them in the spring: the cuttes must be made with a very sharpe knife, that they may be smoothe, and that the water may not stand in them, to the engendring of wormes, and corruptyng of the Uine: you must cut them rounde, so wyl the cut be sooner growen out agayne: but <hi>Plinie</hi> woulde haue them slope wyse, for the better auoydyng of the water.

of December, tyll the Ides of Ianuarie: you must not touche your Uines with a knife, for <hi>Columella</hi> witnesseth, that Uines in Winter may not be cut. In cuttyng, remember well to cut it betwixt two ioynes, for yf you cut it in the ioynt, you spill it: let the cut be alwayes downeward, so shall it be safe both from sunne, and weather.

Of the second time, the opinions are sundry, for some suppose it best to plucke of the leaues and branches, as soone as it hath left flowring: others, when the fruite is full ripe. The super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous springes being young and tender, are to be taken away, that the Uine may be more at liberty, and through blowen with the winde. This geldyng, or cuttyng away the superfluous branches and leaues, is as needefull as the propping: for both

the fruite dooth prosper the better, and the propping the next yeere wyll be the handsomer, and the Uine wyll be the lesse full of galles: for that which is cut being greene and tender, dooth the sooner and the soundlyer recouer him selfe, and the Grape ripeth the better. Tenne dayes before the Uine beginnes to flowre, see that you gelde it in this sort: cut of all the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous branches, both on the toppe, and on the sides, but meddle not where the clusters growe, strike of the toppes of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for growing to ranke: suche Grapes as growe towardes the South, or the West, leaue them theyr branches to defend them from the heate of the Sunne: cut away most from the young Uine, for ouerburdning him. After the heate of the Sunne beginneth to fade, away with the leaues, for hindering the Grapes of there ryping: and whyle the Grape is a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, busie your selfe with digging about it. Suche Uines as with thicknesse of their leaues corrupteth their fruite, are to be rydde of theyr superfluous branches and leaues, a moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the geatheryng of your Grapes, that the winde may blowe the better through them: but the leaues that growe aloft in the very toppe, must not be medled with, but left as a defence, and shadowe agaynst the heate of the Sunne: but yf so be the end of Sommer be geuen to much rayne, and that the Grapes swell in greatnesse, then hardly plucke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaues from the top also.</p>

You must beside, before you set them, rubbe ouer both the toppe &amp; the foote, with doung ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ashes, and so set them deepe in the ground, coueryng them foure fyngers thicke with rotten mould. You may choose whether you wyll set them all vnder the grounde, or sette some part within the grounde, and suffer the rest to appeare aboue the grounde: those that be set all within the ground, neede not to be marked, but suche as shall stand with one part aboue the ground. <hi>Didymus</hi> would haue them so set, as they may appeare foure fingers aboue the ground, and then to make a little trench for the receauing of the water: and this maner of planting with the bowes, is of <hi>Didymus</hi> best liked.

Before you remoue it, marke the part that stood South with a peece of Oker, that you may set it in like maner againe. You must fyrst digge the trenched grounde with Mattockes, and after turne in stone plowed earth, and sowe it with Barley: yf there be any water standyng in them, you must let it out, and cast in a fewe small stones, and so settyng your settes, cast in a little doung. After the tenth of Iune, when the ground gapes with the heate of the Sunne, you must take heede, that the sunne pearce not through the cleftes to the roote. From the entryng of the Sunne into <hi>Libra,</hi> you must ridde the rootes of all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous springes: and yf the tree growe vpon the edge of a hill, you must with little gutters drawe away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> muddy water. The doung must be cast on at the fall of the leafe, that being ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Winter with the mould, it may keepe the rootes of the trees warme. The mother of oyle must be powred vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ones, &amp; the mosse must be cut of with an iron instrument, or els it wyll yeeld you no fruite. Also after certayne yeeres, you must cut and loppe your Olyue trees, for it is an old prouerbe: that who so ploweth his Olyue Garden, craueth fruite: who doung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, moweth fruite: who cutteth the trees, forceth fruite. In the Olyue tree, you shall sometime haue one branche more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant then his fellowes, whiche yf you cut not away, you discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage all the rest. The Olyue is also graffed in the wyld Olyue, specially betwixt the rynde and the wood, and by emplastring: others graffe it in the roote, and when it hath taken, they pull vp a parcell of the roote withall, and remooue it as they doo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plantes. Those Olyues that haue the thickest barkes, are graffed in the barke. The time of graffing them, is from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryng of the Sunne into <hi>Aries,</hi> and with some from the .xxii. of May, tyll the fyrst of Iune. The tyme of geathering of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyues, is when the greater part of half the fruite waxeth blacke,

and in fayre weather: the riper the Olyue is, the fatter wyll be the oyle. In geathering of Olyues, there is more cunnyng in making oyle, then in making wine: the lesser Olyues serue for oyle, the greater for meate. There is sundry sortes of oyle made of an Olyue, the fyrst of all is rawe, and pleasantest in taste: the fyrst streame that comes from the presse is best, and so in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

Of oyle, some part serueth for meate, and other for the sowpling of the body: and therefore as <hi>Varro</hi> sayth, it accompanieth his maister, not only to the Bath, but also to the Feelde, or where so euer he goeth. The Olyue whereof you make your oyle, must be taken from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground: and yf it be foule, must be washed: for the drying, three dayes is sufficient: yf it be frosty weather, they must be pressed the fourth day: euery fyrst heape must be put in earthen pottes, and oyle vessels, where with hard and rough stones they are grinded. The geathered Olyue, yf it lye to long in heapes, putrifieth by reason of heate, and makes vnsauery oyle. Mylles are more handsome for the makyng of oyle, then the Trough &amp; the Foote: for the Mylles may be handled with great discretion: the whole store may be raysed or let downe, according to the quantitie of the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, lest the stone which would marre the taste of the oyle, should be broken. The presses cheefely, and the oyle houses ought to be warme, for the speedyer runnyng of the oyle: which with colde would make the longer stay.

though some (as they say) haue had good successe in dooing it, after the entrance of the Sunne into <hi>Aries,</hi> as I haue sayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where I spake of implastring, and graffing.

In mountayne countreys, they must alwayes be set toward the South: it prospereth well yenough, so it be something holpen with the Sunne, neyther doo they refuse ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rough, or marrishe groundes. A leane and a barrayne soyle bringeth out woorme eaten, and fallyng fruite: the noysome woormes are destroyed with Hogges doung, mingled with mans vrine, and powred vpon the rootes.

tree be much watred with vrine, the fruite wylbe redde. Others agayne set vnder theyr trees Roses, thinking thereby to haue theyr Apples redde. Apple trees (as I saide before) must be set euery sort by them selues, as <hi>Columella</hi> biddeth, lest the small trees be hurt of the great, because they be not all of one growth, nor strength. Beside, you must set them very thinne, that they may haue roome to shoote out their branches: for yf you sette them thicke, they wyll neuer beare well, and therefore you must set them fourtie, or at the least thyrtie foote a sunder: the Apple declareth his ripenesse, by the blacknesse of his kernelles. They are geathered after the fourteenth of September, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, according to theyr kinde, and not before the Moone be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene dayes olde, in fayre weather, and in the after noone: those that fall from the tree, must be laide by them selues: it is better to pull them, then to shake them, lest they be brused in their falling.<note place="margin">

Apples are hurtfull to bearing cattel, so as the sauour causeth them to tyre, as <hi>Lucian</hi> in his asse witnesseth: the like is written of Peares, the remedy they say, is to let them eate some of the fruite afore. Of Apples, with certayne mylles for the purpose, they make a drinke called Cyder, and a smaly drinke beside with water, and the refuse of the Apples strayned: a good drinke to coole the thyrst of the poore labourer. A kynde of vinegre also they make of Crabbes, and sowre Apples, which lying in heape togeathe three or foure dayes, they afterwardes put into a Pipe, or Tunne, wherewith they mingle spring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or rayne water, and so is it suffered to stand close couered thyrtie dayes, and after taking out what vineger they neede, they put in agayne as much water.

               <p>Your motion is good: fyrst therefore, and generally, dounging and watring is needefull for fruite trees, a very fewe excepted: and herein heede must be taken, that you doo it not in the heate of the Sunne, and that it be neyther too newe, nor too olde: neither must it be laide close to the foote of the tree, but a little distance of, that the fatnesse of the doung may be druncke in of the roote. Pigeons doung, and Hogger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doung, doo also heale the hurtes or woundes of trees. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherewith we water them, must not be Fountayne water, or Wel water, yf other may be had, but drawen from some mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Lake, or standyng Poole. Moreoner, you must take heede, (as I also tolde you before) when we began to talke of plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an Orchard, that your trees stand a good distance a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when they are growen vp, they may haue roome ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to spreade, and that the small and tender, be not hurt of the greater, neyther by shadowe, nor dropping. Some woulde haue Pomegranate trees, and Myrtels, and Bays, set as thick togeather as may be, not passing mene foote a sunder: and likewyse Chery trees, Plome trees, Quinces, Apple trees, and Peare trees, thyrtie foote and moe a sunder: euery sort must stande by themselues, that (as I saide) the weaker be not hurt of the greater. The nature of the soyle, is herein most to be regarded: for the Hill requireth to haue them stand nearer togeather, in windy places you must set them the thicker. The Olyue (as <hi>Cato</hi> sayth) wyl haue fiue and twentie foote distance at the least. You must set your plantes in suche sort, as the tops be not hurt, or brused, nor the barke, or rynde flawed of: for the barke being taken away round about, killeth any kind of tree.

Yea the LORD of the whole world dooth call him selfe a shephearde. Since it appeareth by these examples, of what worthynesse keeping of cattell is, and how neare it is linked with tillage, I haue here thought good, after the entreating of tillage, Gardning, and Orchardes, to describe as breefely as I can, the order and maner of keeping of cattell: which skill though <hi>Varro</hi> deuideth only into three partes, I haue deuided into foure. In the first part I put the greate cattell for burden, as Horses, Asses, Mules, Camelles: in the second part the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sorte, as Sheepe, Goates, and Swyne: in the thyrd, such thinges as are belonging to the keeping and safegarde of Cattell, not for the proffit they yeelde of them selues, but for their necessary vse, as shepheardes dogges, and cattes: of these three partes in this third booke I entreate, of: the fourth I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the fourth booke. Hauing thus declared the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt keeping of cattell, and tillage, with the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and antiquitie thereof, I meane now to prosecute such thinges as are belonging to the same. I haue brought in the masters and keepers of euery kinde of Cattell, resting them selues vpon the hollyday in the greene grasse, &amp; the Sommers shadowe, euery one declaring his skill and knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his profession.

Some say it is best to cutt the mane of the mare that shalbe couered of the Asse, though others holde opinion that it shall abate her lust. The mares that bee with foale, must bee well looked vnto, and put in good pasture. And if thorow the colde of winter, pasture bee wanting, they must bee kept in the house, and neyther labored nor ias<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Being fiue moneths olde, when you bring them into howse, you must seede them with barley flowre and branne: at a tweluemoneth old, you must eyther put them into good pasture, or feede them with branne, chaffe, and hay. <hi>Varro</hi> will not haue you to weane them, till they be two yeeres old: and though I like not too soone weaning, yet wee vse comonly to weane them at fiue or six monethes old, and to let them runne in good pasture, which custome proueth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.

The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man would haue his Horse to proue, the better must he looke to his meate, for the good feeding (the country people say) is a great helpe to the goodnesse of the Horse. If the Horse be young (as I said before of Coltes) he must be fed with grasse, chaffe, and hay: if he be elder and mete to trauaile, his foode must be the dryer, as Chaffe, Barley, Oates, and Hay. Chaffe doth not so well nourish, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> drynesse, but it keepes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in good plight: and because hard meate is hardest of digestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is therefore to be geuen to those that labour. The stocke or studde, must be pastured in large pastures and marshes, as also vpon mountaines and hilly groundes, but euer well watred, not dry, rather champion then woddy, and rather soft sweete grasse, then hye and flaggy: if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pasture be too short, they sooner weare their foreteeth, &amp; are toothlesse before their full age.

               <p>As touching diseases in a Horse, it is better to preuent them by good heede taking, and (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> saith) to be more careful in keeping a Horse helthy, then when he is sicke to cure him: which health you shall continue with ease, yf you wyll obserue those thinges, touching his diet, his stable, and his labour, that I haue told you of before. Who so euer wyll haue a good Horse, and keepe him in good estate, must often times see him, come to him, handel him, and stroke him: for that both makes him gentill, and geues him a fayre coate: and be still mindfull of the olde prouerbe, the Maisters eye maketh a fatte Horse, and to be short, to haue him so still in his sight, as he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want his owne meate, then his Horse should: for he that neclecteth his Horse, neclecteth him selfe. To let him haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exercise, and to ryde him nowe and then (yf the weather be fayre) into the Feelde, wyl doo him great good: the morning is better to labour him in then the euenyng, neyther must you in Winter, or in Sommer ouerlabour him, for being in a sweat, and after taking colde, he falleth into daungerous diseases. And therefore remember what I sayde, that where so euer you haue laboured him, or rydden him, be sure you couer him with some cloth, and walke him softly, that he may be cold, before he eyther be suffered to eate, or drinke: when he is colde, he may be led to the water, and washed: so as when you bring him into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you lytter him well, and throwly rubbe him, and so geue him meate. If he be ouer trauayled, the only remedy is rest, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his sweating, to washe his mouth in Sommer with water and vineger, in Winter with brine: for the neclecting of these thinges, hath been the destruction of many a good Horse. Also, to powre into his mouth wine and oyle, in Sommer colde, in Winter warme (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> teacheth) and as we finde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, is very good: for it is commonly seene, that a tyred Horse (yf necessitie forceth a further iourney) with powring in a quart of good wine, wyll trauayle lustyly. You must not suffer
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4163:126"/>
your Horse to drinke after his iourney, tyll he be colde: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, yf he sweate not to extreamely, and be rydden soone after, it is not so daungerous: it is farre better to let him thyrst, then to geue him colde water yf he be hotte. If a Horse haue long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, he is not to be trauayled vpon the sudden, eyther in gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or long iourney, but to be laboured faire and softly at the fyrst. A Horse that is weery, or tyred, wylbe woonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freasshed, so as it woulde seeme he had neuer been trauayled, yf he may wallow him selfe eyther in the stable, or other dry place out of the wynde and rayne, and therefore <hi>Xenophon</hi> would haue neare vnto euery stable, a place meete for their wallowing, wherein after their iourneyes, they may tumble them selues: for in so dooing, they shewe they are in health, and refreashe them selues. You must looke diligently that they be well looked to at night, and that after their sweat, they be wel rubbed and curried, and that they be not disquieted when they should rest. In Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they would be clothed with Wollen for taking of cold, and in Sommer with Camias, to keepe them from flyes. You must beware, that you iourney them not long without staling, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue trauayled an houre, or such a thing, prouoke them to stale (by ryding them out of the way) into some place where sheepe haue dounged, or into some hie Grasse, Ferne, or Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which order was continually obserued, by the best dyeter of Horses that euer I knewe in England, one Henry King, who hauyng charge of that most woorthy Gentlemans Horses, syr Thomas Chalenour, caryed a fayre company of Geldinges from London, to the Court of Spayne, who notwithstandyng their long iourney through Fraunce, and the painefull passage of the <hi>Piremies,</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> skilfull diligence of their keeper, came thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in as good plight, as they came out of England. And yf so be you see he can not stale, or staleth with paine, you must bathe hym with bath appoynted for colde, that is, oyle mingled with wine powred vpon his loynes: also a Louse put into his yarde, or Sope put into his fundament, hath been seene to helpe him. If this doo not helpe, you must squirt in Hony boyled thinne with Salt into his yarde. Some woulde haue the licour of the lyme <hi>Bitumen</hi> squirted in: <hi>Aeliomus</hi> wryteth, that the Horse that
<pb facs="tcp:4163:127"/>
can not stale, is presently remedied, yf so be a mayde strike him vpon the face with her gyrdell, the feete (which is the cheefest matter in a Horse) you shall alwayes keepe sound: yf as I tould you afore, your stable be well paued with round stone, or well plancherd and kept cleane: which done, you must stop his hoofes with Cowe doung, or for want therof with Horse doung watred, and the legges must be often rubbed with a strawen wispe. To cause the hoofe to growe, or to repaire the broken hoofe, take of Garlicke heades seuen ounces, of Hearbegrace three hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulles, of Allome beaten and sifted, seuen ownces, of Barrowes grease very olde two powndes, mingle all these with a handfull of Asses doung, boyle them, and annoynt the hoofes therewith. After their iourney, see you searche their feete well, suffering no grauel, nor filth to remayne therein, you shal well refreashe their hoofes with the oyntment aforesayde. The ioyntes, or the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternes, woulde be well bathed after their trauaile with warme wine, or an egge or two would be thrust into their howfes, the legges them selues would be washed, with warme beere, or some like bath. If the Horse thrust out one of his feete, and stand not euen, it is a signe of some fault in the foote: the Horse halteth, eyther by reason of the spoyling of his hoofe in iourney, or by yll showing, or by vnholsome humours fallen downe, by long standing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stable, or by windgalles. If the fault be in the showing, strike vpon the head of euery nayle with the hammer, and when you perceiue him to shrinke, plucke out that nayle, or powre vpon the hoofe colde water, and that nayle that is fyrst dry, plucke out: yf it matter, squeese it out, and powre in Pitch well sodden with olde Swynes grease: you must also speedely open his hoofe belowe, that the matter (yf it be full of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may descend, least it breake out aboue the hoofe, and so cause a longer time of healing. The signes of it be, yf he holde vp his foote, which yf you doo pare him to the quicke, and where you perceiue it to looke blacke, open it, and let out the matter: if he be hurt inward, and standeth but on his toe, it sheweth the fault to be in his hoofe: but yf he treade equally with his foote, it declares the greefe to be some other where, then in his hoofe: yf in his haulting he bowe not his ioyntes, it is a signe the sore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4163:127"/>
is in the ioyntes. For al halting generally, mingle Hemp with the white of an egge, and stop the foote withall, and after clap on the showe: yf it be a wound, put herein the pouder of Oyster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shelles, and Uerdegrease to drye it vp, or the white of an egge, with Soote and Uineger. The Cratches (as they commonly call them) is a malady that happeneth betwixt the Pastornes and the Hoofe, in the manner of a skabbe, and is ingendred of the dampes of the stable, whyle he standeth wette legged: the remedy whereof, is all one with the paines, which is likewyse a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many times Horses are troubled with wormes, or bots, which you shal perceiue, yf they cast their looke vpon their belly, yf they wallow oftentimes, and strike their belly with their foote: the remedy, is Harts horne, Sauine beaten, and geuen him with a little vineger in a horne. <hi>Columella</hi> would haue you rake the Horse with your hand, and after that you haue plucked out the doung, to washe his funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with sea water, or brine. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aboue al other they say it excelleth, in the beginning to anoynt him with the fat of a Seale: yf it haue runne long, you must vse stronger medicines, as Lime, Brimstone, Tarre, olde Swynes grease, of eache a like quantitie, boyled togeather, and with a little oyle made in an oyntment: they vse to rubbe it also with the Soote of a Caldron.

In <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Barbary</hi> (where the ground is very light) they haue also their vse in plowing: and the fine Ladyes of the countrey doo ryde vpon Asses riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished: yea, they be very apt to be taught, so as at this day in <hi>Alcayre</hi> you shall haue them daunce very manerly, and keepe measure with their Musitian. <hi>Varro</hi> maketh mention of two sortes, one wylde, whereof in <hi>Phrigia</hi> and <hi>Lycaonia</hi> there are great store: the wylde Asses that are tamed, are passing good, specially for breede, &amp; they are easely broken: the other is tame, of which I meane to speake.

He that wyll haue a breede of Asses, must haue the male &amp; the female both of reasonable age, large bodyed, sounde, and of a good kind: the male must be at the least three yere old, for from three, tyll they be tenne, they be fyt for breeding: they bring foorth their Coltes sometimes at two yeeres and a halfe, but three yeeres is the best age: the female goeth as long with her burden as the Mare, and dischargeth in all respectes as she dooth: but she wyll not very well reteyne, except she be forced immediatly after the horsyng to runne about, she seldome brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth two. When she foaleth, she gets her into some darke place, and keepes her selfe from being seene. They wyll beare all their life time, whiche (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth) is thirtie yeeres: they are put to the Horse a little before the tenth of Iune, and beare euery other yeere: they bring foorth their Fole at the twelfth moneth.

The Asse so proportioned (as I haue declared) that you meane to appoynt for your Stallion, you must strayghtwayes take from his damme, &amp; put him to some Mare that hath a Colt sucking of her: you shall easely deceiue the Mare, by setting her in a darke place, remouing her owne Colt from her, and putting to her in steede therof the Asses Colt, which she wyll nurse as her owne. Afterwards, when the Mare hath been vsed to it a tenne dayes, she wyl continually after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time geue it sucke.

Of Bullockes, some are for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> drawght, some for the staull, and some for the payle: to what purpose so euer they serue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for labour, for milcking, or for feeding, it is best al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to chose such as are young, of lusty age, rather then those that are olde and barraine, the woordes of couenant in the olde time (as <hi>Varro</hi> saith) in selling of Bullocks, were these: doo you warrant these Bullockes, or Steeres, that you sell to be sound, of a sound heard, and without fault? The Butchers that bye for slaughter, and such as by for sacryfises, vse no worde of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantise: and though some Bullocks are chosen by their strength, some by the greatnesse of their body, yet the best commonly haue these properties: large, well knit, and sounde lyms, a long, a large, and deepe sided body, blacke horned, though in the colour there be no greate matter, yet some mislike the white for their tendernesse, which when <hi>Varro</hi> consenteth, who woulde haue them broade forheaded, great eyed and blacke, his eares rough and heary, his chawes to be large and wide, his lippes blackish, his necke well brawned, and thicke, his dewlappes large, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe from his necke to his knees, his showlders broade, his hyde not hard, or stubborne in feeling, his belly deape, his legges wel sette, full of synowes, and straight, rather short then long, the better to sustaine the weight of his body, his knees streight and great, his feete one farre from the other, not broade, nor turning in, but easely spreading, the heare of all his body thicke and short, his tayle long, and bigge heared. <hi>Palladius</hi> thincketh, the best time for bying of drawght Oxen, to be in March, when being bare, they can not easely hide their faultes, by the fraude of the seller, nor by reason of their weakenesse be to stubborne to be handled. It is best to bye them of your
<pb facs="tcp:4163:133"/>
neighbour, least the change of ayre and soyle hurt them: for the Bullocke that is brought vp nere home, is better then the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, because he is neyther troubled with change of ayre, water, nor pasture: yf you can not haue them neare you, bye them from some like country, or rather from a harder, and be well assured that you bye them euen matched, lest in their labour, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger spoyle the weaker. Looke besides that they be gentell, skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their labour, fearfull of the goade, and the driuer, not dreading any water, or bridge: great feeders, but softly, and not ouerhastyly: for such doo best digest their meate. In choosing of Bulle, or Kine, the very like signes are to be required, that the Bull differeth from the Oxe, in that he hath a more frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and fierce looke, shorter hornes, greater, and thicker neck so bigge, as it seemes the greatest parte of his body, his belly something gaunter, and meeter for Bulling of Kine. The Bull before he be suffered to goe with the Kine, must be well fedde with grasse, chaffe, or hay, and kept seuerally by him selfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must he goe to the Cowe, till the tenth of Iune. <hi>Varro</hi> woulde not suffer him before the rising of the <hi>Lira:</hi> but <hi>Aristotle</hi> woulde haue him all the reddring time to goe in pasture with the Kine. The Cowe likewyse would be hie of stature, and long bodied, hauing greate vdders, broade forheade, fayre hornes, and smoothe, and all other tokens almost that is required in the Bull, specially to be young: for when they passe twelue yeeres olde, they are not good for breede, but they liue many times farre longer if their pasture be good, &amp; they kept from diseases. The olde Cowe geueth more milke then the young, according to the country peoples prouerbs, olde Kine more milke, young Hennes more egges. Againe, vnder three yeeres olde, you may not suffer them to goe to Bull: yf they chaunce to be with Calfe before, you must put the Calfe from them, and milke them for three dayes after, least their vdders be sore, afterwardes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare milking. <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, that at a yeere olde they be fruitefull, but the breede wyll be little, as it happeneth in al too timely ingendringes. You must euery yeere in these beastes (as in all other) sort your stocke, that the olde that be barraine, or vnmeete for breeding, may be put away, solde, or remoued to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4163:133"/>
the Plowe: for when they be barraine (as <hi>Columella</hi> sayth) they wyll labour as well as Oxen, by reason they are dryed vp, but we vse commonly to fatte them: their age is knowen by the knottes and circles of their hornes, which <hi>Plinie</hi> marketh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse in Goates. The time for going to Bull, some take to be best in the midst of the spring: <hi>Palladius</hi> would haue it in Iuly, for so in the twelfth moneth she shal Calue, for so long she goeth with Calfe (as the common people say) a Cowe and a Quene haue both one time. In many places they desire to haue their Cowes goe to Bull a thirtie or fourtie dayes after the tenth of Iune, that they may Calue in March, or Aprill: they that would haue muche milke, so order the matter, as their Kine goe to Bull from the spring, to winter, whereby they alwayes milke some: at once bulling she conceaueth, yf the chaunce to fayle, she goeth to Bull againe within twentie dayes after: some say, yf so be the Bull come downe on the left side of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cowe, it wyll be a Cowe Calfe, yf on the right side, a Bull Calfe. The Greekes affirme, that yf you wyll haue a Bull Calfe, you must knitte the right stone of the Bull, and for a Cowe Calfe, the left: <hi>Varro</hi> saith, that yf you put the Cowe to the Bull immediatly after gelding, she conceaueth: <hi>Columella</hi> affirmeth fiftene Kine to be yenough for one Bull. I thinke he wyll well yenough serue twentie Kine, yf he be such a Bull as I described: yf you haue good store of pasture, you may let them goe to Bull euery yeere, but you must beware your Kine be not too fatte, for that wyll hinder their being with Calfe. The Cowe should when she is reddring, haue but short pasture, and the Bull his belly full: so shall neyther she be too fat, nor he vnlusty. If the Cowe wyl not take the Bull, you must stampe sea Onyons in water, and rubbe her vnder the tayle with it: yf the Bull be not lusty yenough about his businesse, take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peezell of a Stagge, burne it, and make it in pouder, and with a little wine and the pouder, bathe his stones, and his pezell withall, which wyll serue for the like purpose in all other beastes (as <hi>Quintillian</hi> sayth) his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is also stirred vp by the like odours that you speake of for your Horse. A Bul ought not to leape the Cowe aboue twyse in a day as some thinke, but we finde by experience, that he may
<pb facs="tcp:4163:134"/>
oftner. In some places they haue common Bulles, and common Boares to euery towne: a Bull wyll waxe furious at the sight of any redde thing, as the Elephant, and the Lion, whiche can not in no wyse abide the syght of any white thing. A Cowe wyll geue sucke to a straunge Calfe, but let not the Calues lye with them in the night, for feare of ouerlaying them. Some weane them at the first, and suckleth them with Milke, or Whaye, hauing a little Branne in it, or Flowre, wherewith they bring them vp, till they be able to feede. Whether you meane to reare them for breede, labour, or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you must let them want no store of good pasture: for though they be of neuer so great a breede, yet yf their pasture be scantie, they wyll neuer come to their full growth: for pasture makes the beast (as the countrey people say.) <hi>Mago,</hi> and the olde husbandes, woulde haue you to gelde them whyle they be very young, whiche order we likewyse obserue in cutting of them: and in the Spring, or at the fall of the leafe, when they be three monethes olde, or there about, we vse to gelde the Bull Calues, and spay the Cowe Calues, sowing vp the wounde, and annoyting it with freshe Batter. <hi>Columella</hi> woulde not haue them cutte, but their stones broken by little and little with an instrument, whiche kinde of gelding he best liketh, because in the little young ones, it is donne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bleeding: for when they be something growen vp, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cut them at two yeere olde, then at a yeere olde, which must be donne in the spring, or at the fall of the leafe, the Moone being in the wane: you must tye vp the Calfe to a frame, and before you cut him, you must fasten about the synowes, whereby the stones hang, a coople of smal stickes like a payne of tonges, and taking holde therewith, cut away the stones, so as a little of the vpper parts of them may remayne with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foresaid synows: for by this meanes you shal: not haz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You must vse them whyle they be yet young, to suffer to be handled, and stroked, and tyed vp to the Manger, that when they should come to be broken, they may be handled with more ease, and lesse daunger: but <hi>Columella</hi> forbiddes you to meddle with the breaking, or labouring of them, before three yeere old, and after fiue: for the one is too soone, the other too late. Those that you haue taken vp wylde, and be well framed, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned, accordyng to my paterne, you shall handle and breake in this sort. Fyrst of all, see that you haue a large roome, where the breaker may easily goe vp and downe, and out at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, without any daunger.

The feeding of this kind of cattel is diuers, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of Countreys: yf there be store of good pasture in the countrey, there is no foode to that: in countreys where wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth pasture, and specially in Winter, he must be kept in the Stal, and fed with such fodder as the countrey yeeldes. Where there are Tares to be had, it is the best feeding for them: and Hay is very good, Chaffe, and Coolestalkes with Chaffe and Hay, and chopt strawe sodde togeather in water, is very good feeding for Winter. In some places, they feede altogeather with newe threasshed strawe: in many places they geue them Lupines steeped in water, or Chiches, or Peson, mingled with Chaffe: besides, the branches, and leaues of Uines, the greene branches of Elme, Ashe, Poplar, and Holme: in Winter, when other greene bowes fayle, the Figge tree wyll serue, or the brousing of Okes, and Holly. Oxen are soone fatte in good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and with Wheate, Rapes, Apples, and Radishe: Oxen, or Kine, wyll be passing fatte where there wanteth pasture, by geuing them Meale mixt with Wheate, Chaffe, and Rapes, or Graynes. They wyll waxe the sooner fatte, in wasshing them with warme water, or (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth) by cutting their skinnes, and blowing in winde to their bellies with a Reede. <hi>Sotion</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that they wyll be fatte, yf when they are taken from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, you geue them the fyrst day Colwoortes chopt and stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in sharpe Uinegar, and afterwardes Chaffe, being well cleaned, and mingled with Wheate branne, for the space of fiue or sixe dayes, feeding them after with good store of fodder: in Winter you must feede them at the first Cockcrowing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne when the day begins to breake: in Sommer first at the breaking of the day, then at noone, and at night: in Sommer

you must water them twyse a day, three houres afore noone, and three houres after: in winter, once aday with warme water, which is also thought to be good for fruitefulnesse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lakes that are filled with Rayne water, are good for them. This kind of cattell desireth not cleane, or fayre water, but foule and pudled: yet it were better to geue them fayre wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Also, you must prouide them of warme pasturs for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in sommer, very coole: chiefely Mountaines where they may browse vpon the bushes, and picke vp a good liuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Woods: but in lowe groundes and neare the Riuer, Oxen are sooner fatted, and Kine geue a greater quantitie of Milke. In Sommer, they lye abroade all the nightes in many places: yea, in England you shall haue them fodred abrode all the Winter. Though they be able to abide cold, yet must you prouide them of large stalles, for the succouring of such as be great with Calfe. Your stables, or Oxstals, must stand dry, and be well floored, eyther with stone, grauaile, or sand: the stone will suffer no water to abide vpon it, the other will soone drinke it vp and dry it: both sortes must be layed slope, that the water may runne away, for rotting the groundsels, and marring their houses. Let them open toward the South, so shall they be the dryer, and the warmer: notwithstanding, let your windowes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen North and East, which being shutte in Winter, and open in Sommer, may geue a healthful ayre. In fine, as neare as can be, let the houses be neyther to hotte, nor to colde, and as dry as may be: <hi>Columella</hi> would haue two Oxhouses, one for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the other for the sommer both vncouered, but well and high walled, for keeping out of wyld beastes. The stalls would be eyght foote wyde, that they may haue roome yenough to lye in, that the Kine great with Calfe hurt not one the other, nor the stronger Oxe wrong the weaker: and that there may be roome for theyr keepers to come about them, and for yoking them. <hi>Vitrunius</hi> would haue the Oxehouse open towardes the East, and to be neare the fyre: for fyre is naturally beneficiall to cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, both for the drying vp of the infectiue dampes, and the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the cattel warme. Besides, by seeing of the fire, they are made gentler, and by the heate thereof, what cold they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the pastures, is expelled, and diuers inward diseases cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb facs="tcp:4163:136"/>
The houses must be seuered with diuers roomes, enclosed and racked, the racke must stand no higher then the Oxe may easely reach, and must haue such particions, as one beast begile not the other, whereto they must be well haltred and tyed, for hurting one the other: <hi>Cato</hi> would haue the particions lettised. Moreouer, it is to no purpose to feede them wel, except you also looke to the keeping of them in health, and sound, and therefore whether they be in house, or abroade, you must alwayes haue a speciall regard vnto them, and to ouerlooke them in the night, specially, yf there be any Kine amongest them with Calfe. And though it be needefull at all times to ouersee them, both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening, yet most needefull is it of all other times, to see to them in the spring, when you first put them to pasture: for at that time, by reason of their change of diet, both Oxen, Kine, and Hayfarres, are most in danger of sicknesse: in Winter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to looke to them, that they be not, for sparing of charges, kept so poore, as they be vtterly spoyled. And therefore you must spare no litter, specially when they come from labour, to rubbe them, and drye them, stroking them with your handes, and raysing the hyde from the fleshe, which wyll do them great good. In comming from worke, or out of the pasture, you must wash their feete wel with water, before you bring them into the house, that the durt and filth cleaning to them, breede no disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nor soften their hoofes. Beware of too much cold, or heate, for too much of either, filleth them with diseases. You must take heede they be not chaste, nor chafed vp and downe, specially in hotte weather, for that bringeth them to a Feauer, or causeth them to haue a Flixe. Take heede also, that there come ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Swyne, nor Poultry neare their stalles, for both of them with theyr dounging poysoneth the beast. The dounging of a sicke Swine doth breede the Pestilence, or Murraine amongest cattell. You must away with all manner of carryons, and bury them wel for infecting your cattell. If so be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Murraine chance to come amongst them, you must presently change the ayre, and seuer your cattell farre a sunder in diuers pastures, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the sound from the sicke, that they be not infected, not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them eyther to feede togeather,<note place="margin">

diuers kindes of it: in some Murraines, the cattell driuell and runne both at the nose and mouth, in others againe they be dry, and fall away more &amp; more: sometimes it comes in the ioyntes, and causeth them to halt before, or behind, sometime in theyr kidnes, and appeareth by the weakenesse of their hinder parts, wherein they seeme to haue great paine in theyr loynes. An o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind there is, that ryseth like a Farcine, with Pimples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the body, now appearing, and presently vanishing, and comming out in a newe place. An other sort, betwyxt the hyde and the fleshe, wherein the humor sweateth out in diuers parts of the body. Sometime it is like a Leprosie, when al the skinne is full of little pimples, and sometime a kind of madnesse, wherein they neyther heare, nor see so well as they were woont, though they looke fayre and fatte and lusty yenough. Euery one of these kindes, are contagious and infectiue, and therefore as soone as you perceaue them infected, you must presently put them a sunder for infecting the whole stocke, least you impute that to the wrath of GOD (as many fooles doo) which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth through your owne beastlynesse, and necligence. The common remedy (as <hi>Columella</hi> saith) is the rootes of <hi>Angellica,</hi> and sea Thistell mingled with Fenel seede, and with newe boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wine, Wheate flowre, and hotte water to be sprinckled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.

The hardnesse and crueltie of the colde Winter, dooth oftentimes beguile the shepheard, and destroyeth many of his flocke: whereof (presuming of their strengh in the ende of the Sommer) he had made no supply, and therfore <hi>Columella</hi> is of oppinion, that the age for breede ought not to be lesse then three yeere, nor aboue eyght, both because that neyther of the ages is meete to be kept: and also that whatsoeuer commeth of an olde stocke, hath lightly a smack of his olde parentes imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and proueth eyther to be barraine, or weake. The selfe same <hi>Columella</hi> woulde haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ewes to be put to the Ramme, after they had passed two yeere olde, &amp; the Ramme to be of fiue yeere olde, and after seuen, to decay. In many places at this day, they suffer both the kindes to breede, from two yeere olde, tyll niene: but before two yeeres, it is not good to put ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Ramme, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ewe to breede, although in most places they suffer the Ewes at a yeere old. The Ramme is put by his purpose, by the Wyckers, or Bulryshes, tyed to the Ewes tayle, but more commodiously, by going in seuerall pastures: howbeit, they are not commonly seuered, but sufferd to goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather. The Rammes that you would haue to serue your Ewes, must afore the blossoming, be kept in good pasture. for two monethes, whereby they may the better be able to doo their businesse: but in our countrey, we commonly suffer them to feede togeather. To encrease their lust, you shall geue them in their pasture, the blades of Onyons, or Knotte grasse: they rather couette the olde Ewes, then the young, because

During the time of their blossoming, they are to be watered in one place (as both <hi>Varro,</hi> &amp; <hi>Plinie</hi> affirme) because the change of water both discoloureth the wooll, &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth the Lambe.

The thunder, yf the Ewes goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, makes them cast their Lambes, and therefore it is good to let them goe with company, for auoyding that perrill: they goe with Lambe .150. dayes, or fiue monethes: such as are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde dammed, are feeble and weake, and such were of the old wrighters called <hi>Cordi</hi>: for the most part they bring but one Lambe a peece, yet oftentimes two, and yf they be well fedde, sixe at a time. It hath been seene in Gelderland, that fiue Ewes haue had in one yeere, fiue and twenty Lambes: it may seeme paraduenture to many vncredible, &amp; yet not greate marueyle, since they haue twyse a yere most times two, and sometime sixe at a time. The shepheard must be as careful as a midwyfe in the yeaning time, for this poore creature (though she be but a Sheepe) is as much tormented in her deliuery, as a shrew, and is oftentimes the more dangerously vexed, and payned in her lobour, in that she is altogeather without reason: and therfore it behoueth the shepheard to be skilfull in medcening of his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and so cunning a midwyfe withall, as yf neede require, he may helpe his Ewe, what danger soeuer happen. The Lambe

as soone as he is fallen, must be set on foote, and put to the dammes vdder, and oftentimes his mouth held open, the milke must be milked in, that he may learne to sucke: but before you doo this, you must be sure to milke out the fyrst milke called <hi>Colostra,</hi> whereof I wyll speake hereafter: for this, except some quantitie be drawen out, doth hurt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lambe: if the damme dye, you must suckle it with a horne: yf the Lambe wyll not of him selfe sucke, he must be put to it, and his lippes noynted with sweete Butter, and Swynes grease, and seasoned a little with sweete milke. As soone as they are lambed, they must be shutte vp togeather with their dammes, whereby both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> damme may cheerishe them, and they learne to know their dammes.

                  </note> are not in all places one, but varry, according to the disposition of the ayre, the cattell, and the countrey: the best way is to haue good regarde to the weather, as the Sheepe be not hurt by shearing in the colde, nor harmed by forbearing in the heate. In some places they haue two seasons in the yeere for shearing of their Sheepe: the fyrst season for their shearing, is eyther with the beginning of May, or els with the ending of April: the seconde season of theyr shearing, is about the beginning of September. Such as doo vse to sheare theyr Sheepe but once in the yeere, doo commonly appoynt for their season, the tenth of the moneth of Iune, about which time also such as do sheare twyse a yeere, doo sheare their Lambes. Three dayes before you sheare them, you must washe them well, and when they be full dry, you may sheare them: they doo not in all places sheare their Sheepe, but in some places (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth) pull them. The old hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes did account for the best wooll, the wooll of <hi>Puglia,</hi> and that which in Italy was called the Greeke fleese: the next in goodnesse they tooke to be the wooll of Italy: in the third place they esteemed the <hi>Milesian</hi> fleese: the wooll of <hi>Pullia</hi> is but short, and meete to be worne onely in ryding clokes. The wooll about <hi>Toranto,</hi> and <hi>Canas,</hi> is thought to be passing good: but the best at this day, is the wooll of Englande. The fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner your pasture is, the fyner (as it is thought) you shall haue your wooll. The wooll of suche sheepe as are slayne by the Woolfe, &amp; the garmentes made thereof (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith)
<pb facs="tcp:4163:147"/>
is aptest to breede Lyse. If you happen in the shearing to clip the skinne, you must foorthwith annoynt it with Tarre: when you haue shorne them, some thinke it good you annoynt them with the iuyce of sodden Lupines, Lees of olde Wine, and the dragges of Oyle made in an oyntment, and after three dayes to wash them (if it be neare you) in the sea, or yf the sea be farre of, with rayne water sodden with Salt. And being thus ordred, you shall not haue them to lose their wooll all the yeere, but to be healthy, and to carry a deepe and a fine fleese, and therfore <hi>Virgil</hi> biddes you,

                  <hi>Constantine</hi> out of <hi>Dydimus</hi> affirmeth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> skabbes of Sheepe are healed by washing them with Urine, and after annoynting them with Brimstone, and Oyle. The common shepheardes, when they perceiue a Sheepe to fall a rubbing, they strayght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes take him, and shedding the heare, doo seare the place with Tarre: others doo teache other remedies more hard to be come by, which are not for euery sheephard, nor euery countrey to vse. And yf the hole flocke be infected, it dooth many times so continew, as it shall be needfull to change houses, and (which in all other diseases) behoueth both countrey, and ayre. This on alonely medecine haue I alwayes proued, for the keeping in health of this cattell, to be most present, and soueraine: take the berries of Iuniper, beate them small, and sprincle them with Oates, and Salte, mingle them all togeather, and geue it your Sheepe, three or foure times in the yeere: for though they refuse to eate the Iuniper berries of them selues, yet for the desire of the Salt, and the Oates, they wyl easely take them altogether. If they be lowsie, or full of tickels, they vse to beate the rootes of Maple, and seething them in water, and opening the wooll with their fingers, they pouer the licour, so as from the ridge of the backe, it runne all ouer the body. Others vse the roote of Mandracke, being wel ware that they suffer them not to tast it. If they haue the feuer, you must let them blood in the heele, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Clees, whiche the Poete teacheth, saying:

                     <l>It easeth straight the flaming feuers payne,</l>

Some let them blood vnder the eyes, &amp; some behind the eares. The Fowle, a disease betwixt the Clees, is taken away with Tarre, Alome, Brimstone, and Uineger mingled togeather: or pouder of Uerdegrese put vppon it. The swelling betwixt the two Clawes, must be cut with great warinesse, lest you hap to

The hee Goate would be softer heared, and longer, his Necke short, his Throte Boll deeper, his Legges flesshy, his Eares great, and hanging: it is thought better to bye the whole flocke togeather, then to bye them seuerally.

The tyme when you shall suffer them to goe to rutte, is in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tume,</hi> a little before December, that at the comming of the spring, and blossoming of the trees, the young may be brought foorth.

As touching their breeding, you must in the ende of <hi>Autume</hi> seuer your hee Goates.

Theyr sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>Columella</hi> would haue to stand vpon a stony ground, or els to be paued, for this beast needeth nothing vnder him but a fewe bowes: when he lyeth abroade, the shepheard must often sweepe and make cleane their houses, not suffering any doung, or moysture, to remayne in them, that may be hurtfull to the flocke: for as I sayde before, they are seeldome without feuers, and much subiect to the pestilence. And whereas other cattel, when they haue the Murrayne amongst them, as soone as they be infected, beginne to languishe, and pine away: onely these Goates as soone as they be taken, though they be neuer so lusty to looke vpon, suddenly fall downe togeather, and dye as thicke as hayse: whiche disease dooth cheefely happen, by too muche ranknesse of pasture. And therefore as soone as you perceaue one or two of them fall downe, let the whole flocke blood with as much speede as you may, and suffer them not to feede all the day, but shutte them vp the foure middle houres of the day.

Where there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Woods, they must be fedde from the ground, wherin a marrishes to be preferred before a dry ground, that they may mousell in the marsh, digge vp woormes, wallowe in the myre, and toomble in the puddels of water, which in sommer is most needefull. They also hunt after rootes, specially Fearne rootes, and the rootes of Bullrushes, Rushes, and Sedges, beside good grasse well feedeth a Swyne, and Orchardes of Cheryes, Plomes, Apples, and Nuttes. And notwithstanding all this, the Barne, for you must feede them often by hand, when meate fayles abroade, and therfore you must preserue store of Acorns, in Cestornes in the water, or dryed vppon smoky Floores, also Beanes, Pease, and Tares must be geuen them, and not so much as Barly spared: for this kinde of feeding dooth make them fayre, and not onely fattes them, but geueth the fleshe a pleasant tast. When they are yet young and sucke, both they, and theyr dammes must be well fedde, they must be put to feede early in the mornyng afore the heate of the sunne, &amp; after kept in shadowy places, where there is good store of water. Afore they goe to pasture, they must be medecined, least the grasse

                  </note> that when certayne Rouers landing vppon the coast of Tuskan, and taking great numbers of them out of theyr styes, caried them aboord, the theeues hauing wayed vp their anker, and being vnder sayle, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Swine vpon the hearing of theyr kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers voyce, suddenly ran to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one side of the ship, &amp; ouerturned her, wherby (the Pirates drowned) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Swyne came safe to land to theyr maisters. As I haue here told you of the condicions of the Boare and the Sowe, and of theyr keeping, so wyll I nowe shewe you the maner of theyr breeding. The breming time is reckoned to be from winter, tyll the twelfth of March, so shall you haue them to farrowe in sommer: for the Sowe going foure monethes with pigge, farroweth in the fyfth. Shee is with pigge at the fyrst breming, but they vse to let them goe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Boare, because they soone miscarry. And if you wyl haue two farrowes in one yeere, you must put your Sowe to Boare in February, or Ianuary, that she may farrowe by April, or May, when as there is good pasture abroade, and milke is in his cheefe strength: and when they be weaned, they may well feede vpon strawe, and grottens, and after, the Sowe may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe agayne in the end of <hi>Autum</hi>: for <hi>Varro</hi> sayth, her farro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing times are so diuided for the nonce, as she may farrowe twyse a yeere, whyle she hath foure moneths to beare them, and two to feede them. As soone as they be with pigge, you must
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4163:154"/>
keepe the Boare from them: for with his vnrulinesse, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to cast. Young Swyne for breede, must not be lesse then a yeere old, as <hi>Varro</hi> would haue it: howbeit, they begin at eyght moneths, &amp; continue seuen yeeres. The Boare beginneth at eyght moneths, or sixe, and continueth wel foure yeeres, and after at three or foure yeeres old you may geld them, and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some would not haue you keepe vp aboue eyght, others not aboue sixe: not that the Sowe is able to keepe no more, but that she that keepeth more, sooner faileth. <hi>Varro</hi> reporteth, that the Sowe of <hi>Aeneas Lauinus,</hi> farrowed at one time thirtie white Pigges: but it is monstrous when she farroweth more then she hath pappes. Euery Sowe must haue her stye by her selfe when she hath farrowed, and not suffered to goe with the whole heard, as other cattel are, but little Cotes to be made for them, wherein they may be kept eyther farrowing, or with farrowe: for Swyne, yf they lye togeather in any number, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly yll manered, doo lye one vppon the other, whereby they hurt such as are with pigge. And therefore you must haue seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall styes where they may farrowe, and made hye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sowe can not geat out: for couered they must not be by no meanes, that the swyneheard may looke that the Sowe ouerlay none of them, &amp; to see what they want, that he may make it cleane, and as oft as he cleanseth it, he must straw sand, or such like, to drye vp the moysture: for though she be but a swynishe creature, yet loueth she to haue her chamber cleane. When she hath farro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, she requireth greater quantitie of meate, whereby she may geue the more milke, specially Barley steeped in water, or ground &amp; tempered with water. And yf you haue not good store of meate, your best is to sell the Pigges: so shall the damme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered of her burden, be sooner with farrowe agayne. Such as are farrowed in winter, are commonly poore &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, both because of the cold, &amp; that their dammes doo not lyke them for wanting of milke, &amp; biting their pappes. If the Sowe eate her pigs,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:4163:155"/>
They suffer not the Sowe to goe abroade in tenne dayes after her farrowing, except it be to drinke: after, they suffer her to go about the house, that she may the better geue milke. When the Pigges ware great, they desire to goe abroade with theyr dammes, at which time they are fedde by them selues aparte, to the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It behooueth the swyneheard to be carefull and diligent about his charge, that he haue in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory euery one of them, both old and young, that he consider euery farrow, and shute vp those that be great with Pigge, that they may farrowe in theyr Stye.

Yea <hi>Varro</hi> telles, that there was seene in <hi>Arcadia</hi> a Sowe so fatte, that she was not only vnable to ryse, but suffered a Mouse to make her nest in her body, and to lay her young there. The same <hi>Varro</hi> reporteth, that there was sent to <hi>Volumius</hi> a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of Rome, a peece of Porke of two ribs, that wayed three &amp; twentie pound: the thicknesse of which Sowe from the skinne to the ribbe, was one foote and three ynches. Your best is to put to fatting your Swyne of two or three yeeres olde: for yf they be younger, their growing wyll hynder their seedyng. To keepe your Bacon any long time, you must vse great diligence in the saltyng and drying of it, whereby you shall haue it both holsomer and sweeter, and besides to continue diuers yeeres to serue the turne, yf scarsitte happen. Your Hogge being in this sort fatted, you must shut vp, and not suffer him to drinke the day before you kyll him, whereby the fleshe wyl be the dryer. When you haue thus after his thyrst killed him, you shal eyther skalde hym with water, or with a flame made with strawe, or stickes, syng him: for the maner of such as flea him. I lyke not. After that, hangyng him vp by the heeles, you shall plucke out his bowels, and put them to dressing: his fleshe being cold &amp; hard, you shall lay vppon a table, and cutting out the head, the gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the fleetches, pouder them with salt, thrusting greate store thereof in euery place, specially where the bones be: that donne, put it into your pouldring tubbe, strowing salt yenough vnder it: some would haue you salt in the wane of the Moone. Before you pouder it, you must presse and drye out al the blood and the water. Some before they salt it, doo plucke out the bones, thinking it the best way for preseruing it, and to keepe it longest sweete. Others agayne doo not strayghtwayes put it into the pouldering tubbe, but doo leaue it vppon a table for ten dayes after, and then hang it vp in a pure ayre, to drye in the larde.

For the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of keeping of cattell hath a discipline, wherin a man must from his very Chyldehood be brought vp: and surely it is meete that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> husband, or Bayliffe, haue ben brought vp, or trayned in all these trades, and to come by degrees to his maisters pryze: As from a swyneheard, to a shepheard, from a shepheard, to a netheard, &amp;c. And most true it proueth in this that commeth to passe in all other gouernmentes, that such are best able to take charge of gouernment, that passing by degrees and offices, haue from being vnder gouernment, come to gouerne them selues: for though (where the flocke is but small, and feeding not farre of, is brought home euery day) Chyldren, and young folkes, are able to serue the turne: yet where the flockes be great, and must be kept night and day in Forestes, and wylde feeldes (as I sayd before) of the flockes that wintred in <hi>Appu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and sommered in the mountaynes of <hi>Kiete,</hi> here I say the shepheards must both be men of lusty age, strengh, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as also skilfull in that belongeth to theyr office: for ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old men, nor chyldren, are able to endure the hardnesse of clyming the hilles, nor the sharpnesse of the cold mountaynes, which they must alwayes doo that follow theyr flockes, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they that keepe Bullockes and Goates, that delight to feede vpon Rockes, and Clyues. You shal se on the mountaines of Swycherland, great &amp; goodly fellowes furnished in warlike maner to followe their heardes and flockes, and to lodge in the wylde desartes, farre from the company of men, and there also to make both Butter and Cheese; wherfore such as are meete to take charge in these places, must be light, swyft, &amp; well limmed, and not only wel able to followe their flockes, but if neede be, to
<pb facs="tcp:4163:158"/>
defend them from wyld and rauening beastes, to lyft great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to followe the chase, and to be good archers: in fine, such a one as <hi>Homer</hi> doth make his <hi>EVMEVS</hi> to be. And therefore the olde husbandes in hyring of a shepheard, did alwayes coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among others, that he should be sound of body and limme, and free from filching and theft. In <hi>Slauony,</hi> the heardsmen doo vse to haue theyr wyues abrode with them, as companions of theyr iourney to dresse their meate, &amp; such things as they neede: suche thinges as are for the health of his beastes, the shepheard must alwayes haue in a redynesse. <hi>Varro</hi> would haue him both for this purpose, &amp; for the better order of his reckoninges with his maister, to wryte and reade. Of the number of the heards men, how many euery flocke ought to haue, is to be measured by the countrey, and kinde of the cattell. The same <hi>Varro</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth for euery foure score Goates one shepheard, which <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> alloweth to a hundred, to euery fyftie Mares two men: in our countrey one shepheard suffiseth for a hundred, or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sheepe, yea many times for three hundred, and aboue, specially where they be euery day brought home.

Yea diuers of them haue been knowen after their maisters death, vppon great affection and loue, to famishe themselues, wherevpon the price of good Dogges grewe to be very great. It is written, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> gaue for one Dogge, eyght score poundes.

he is also a quarter maister in keeping of the cattell, and very needefull for the defence of them: specially Sheepe &amp; Goates, whiche would be soone destroyed by Woolfes, Foxes, Grayes, and other vermine, yf Dogges were not set to be their keepers.

Of Dogges that serue for profite, there are but three sortes: for of the fourth (which are but for pleasure) I make no account. One of the sortes, is such as by sent, or swiftnesse serue for the chase, and killing of wyld beastes: these, what maner of ones they should be, and how they should be ordred, <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Oppianus,</hi> in theyr <hi>Cynigetickes</hi> haue taught, and I in my last booke, where I shall speake of hunting, wyll declare.

For theyr age, they must neyther be Whelpes, nor too old: for the Whelpe can neyther defend him selfe, nor the flocke, where as yet the olde hath some vse about a house. If you haue a Whelpe (which age is better to be trayned, eyther for the house or the folde) you shall perceaue by his foote whether he wyll be great or no. His head must be great, smoothe, and ful of vaines, his eares great, and hanging, his ioyntes long, his forelegges shorter then his hinder, but very strayght and great, his clawes wyde, his nayles hard, his heele neyther fleshy nor to hard, the ridge of his backe not to much appearing, nor crooked, his ribs round and well knitte, his shoulder poyntes well distant, his buttockes fatte, and broade, and in all other parts (as I sayd) of the Bandogge before.

And yf so be the Bitch lacke milke, suckle them with the milke of a Goate, tyll they be foure moneths old. Lay vnderneath them in theyr kennels strawe and Chaffe, that they may lye warme: for they can not well away with cold. You must cut the tayles of the Whelpes, when they be sixe weekes old, in this maner, there is a sinnowe that runnes from the ridge of the backe, to the tippe of the tayle, which being held fast with a pyncer, and a little drawen out, you shall cut a sunder, wherby neyther the tayle shall growe to any foule length, nor the Dogge shall at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time after (as they say) be madde. They are thought to lift vp the legge when they pisse, at sixe moneths old, which is a signe of the perfectnesse of theyr strength. The feeding of both kindes is all one, they may be fedde with bones, porredge, and such like: in any wyse let them want no meate, for yf they doo, they wyll for hunger rauen abrode, and forsake both the house, and the flocke. <hi>Xenophon</hi> would haue you geue them Milke all the yeere long, and such foode as they shall feede with all theyr lyfe time, and no other thing: yf you feede them too full, it will breede (as he sayth) diseases in theyr legges, and rotte them within. Bread is theyr common meate, but <hi>Varro</hi> would haue it geuen eyther with Milke, or Whay, by vse wherof, they wyll neuer forsake their cattell. You may geue them beside, bread, with the broth of sodden bones, and the bones them selues broosed, which wyll make theyr teeth the sounder, and theyr mouthes and iawes wyder, and they wylbe the keener, by reason of the sweetenesse of the Marowe.

               <p>Well then with a good wyll I declare vnto you my knowledge, beginning first with those kindes that are most in vse: for amongst all other housholde Poultry, the cheefe place is due to the Corke and the Henne, that are beside so common, as the poorest wyddowe in the countrey is able to keepe them. In this Byrd there are three poyntes of naturall affection cheefely to be woondred at. The first, the great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse that they haue during the time of theyr sitting, wherin for the desire of hatching theyr young, they seeme to be carlesse of eyther meate or drinke. Secondly, that they beare such loue to them, as they sticke not to hazard theyr owne liues in the defence of them. And thirdly, that in the storme, great cold, or sicknesse, they preserue and nourish them vnder theyr winges, not making for the whyle any account of theyr owne selues. There is hereof a most sweete comparison in the Gospel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Sauiour <hi>CHRIST</hi> compareth him self to the Henne that gathereth her Chickins vnder her winges. And therefore, since these are common for euery man to haue, and that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes feede about the house, I thinke it best to beginne with them, and to tell you which are best to be liked, which to be brought vp, and which to be fatted.

After twentie dayes, you shall finde the Egges broken: and therefore the twentieth day, plucking away the shelles, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out the Chickin, you may commit them to the Henne. It is written, that Chickins haue been hatched by the continuall warmth of a womans bosome: beside, it hath been seene, that Egges being laide in an Ouen, or warme place, couered well with Strawe and Chaffe, hauing a little fire beside, and one to turne them continually, haue disclosed and broken at their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed time. <hi>Aristotle</hi> wryteth, that Egges put in warme vesselles, or couered with doung, wyl hatch of them selues. The number of the Egges that your Henne shall sitte vppon, some would haue to be odde, and not alwayes alike, but in Ianuarie and Februarie fifteene, and no more, in March nieneteene, and no lesse: which number you shall continue all the sommer, tyll September, or October, after which time it is to no purpose to breede any longer: for the Chickin, by reason of the colde wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and diseases, neuer prosper. Yea some be of opinion, that after the tenth, or twelfth of Iune, you shall neuer haue fayre broode, and that the best season for sitting, beginneth at the tenth of March. And herein you must alwayes be sure to haue the Moone encreasyng, from that she be tenne dayes olde, tyll fyfteene: for that is the best time to sitte in. And so must you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne dispose the time, as the hatching may fall out in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the Moone: for the iust time of hatching, there are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry opinions. <hi>Aristotle</hi> wryteth, that they are hatched in niene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, <hi>Varro</hi> (for Chickins) one and twentie dayes, or twentie dayes, for Peacocks and Geese, seuen and twentie dayes, and sometimes more: Ducks, in the like space to the Henne, specially yf they sitte night and day, allowing them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mornyng, and the euenyng to feede: whiche times they must of necessitie haue.

Egges are preserued in Winter, yf you keepe them in Chaffe, Straw, or Leuen, and in sommer, yf you couer them with Branne, or Wheate.

Others agayne couer them in Beanes, and some in Beane floure, and some in heapes of salt: but salte, as it suffereth not the Egges to corrupt, so it greatly deminisheth the substance of them.

They are kept in Marshes, Fennes, Lakes, &amp; Moorish commons: for to Corne ground, Medowes, and Pastures, it is a very hartful Foule: she biteth whatsoeuer young spring she may reache, &amp; what she once hath bitten, doth neuer lightly prosper againe. Besides, she stencheth the ground with her vnprofitable, or rather most hurtfull dounging: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I sayde) it is best to keepe them in Fennes, Lakes, and Marshes. If you haue store of such ground, you shall doo well to keepe them: for you can not well keepe them without good store of water and pasture. The Goose delighteth in such meate as is naturally moyst and colde, and shunneth naturally such thinges as are hurtfull for her, as the leafe of the Bay, and (as <hi>Alianus</hi> wryteth) the <hi>Oleander</hi>: the best and meetest time for them to breede in, is from the Kalends of March, to the tenth of Iune. They tread most commonly in the water, whyle they swymme in the Ryuers, or Fishponds. <hi>Columella</hi> would haue you keepe for euery Gander, three Geese, thinking by reason of theyr vnweldynesse, this number to suffise: within your courte, you must make them for theyr better safety, seuerall, and secrete pennes, in sundry partes thereof, where they may sitte &amp; breede. Some would haue the Goose roome framed in such order, as euery Goose may haue her place to her selfe: which, yf any man thinke too troublesome, he may make one sufficient wyde roome to serue them all.

After the last lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you shal suffer them to sitte, and marke euery ones Egges with a seuerall marke, that they may be sette vnder theyr owne Goose, for it is thought they wyll neuer hatch a strangers Egges, without she haue her owne vnder her. Of Goose Egs, as of Pehennes Egges, you shall (as I sayd before) neuer sette vnder a Henne aboue fiue, nor vnder three: but vnder the Goose you shall set at the least seuen, and at the most fifteene. You must keepe to lay vnder your Egges, the rootes of Nettles, which they say, preserueth them against the stinging of Nettels, which otherwyse many times killeth the Gosling, yf they sling them. The Egges wyll not be hatched yf the weather be cold, before the thyrtieth day, yf it be warme, in lesser time: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it for the most part, the Gosling is hatched the thirtieth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sitting. Some doo vse to set by the nestes, Barly steeped in water, or Malte, whereby the Goose shall not be forced to be any whyle absent from her Egges. When your Goslinges are come foorth, you shall for the fyrst tenne dayes feede them with the Goose in the nest. Afterwardes, when the weather is faire, you may suffer them to goe abrode, taking good heede that they be not stinged with Nettles, nor that you let them goe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd into the pastures: but to geue them afore they goe abrode the leaues of Endiue, or Lettuse chopt, to asswage their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for yf you put them a hungerd into the feelde, they straine and breake their owne neckes, with pulling at the tough and stubburne weedes, by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sudden starting backe againe of the weede. The Goslings of diuers broodes must not goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, nor be shutte vp togeather, for hurting one another. When they be foure monethes olde,<note place="margin">

If you geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ground Malt, &amp; wheate floure, you neede to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing, so you let them haue drinke yenough, and keepe them from going abrode. The Grekes did vse to put to two partes of ground Malt, foure partes of Bran, tempring it with water, letting them drinke thrise a day, &amp; at midnight.
<pb facs="tcp:4163:169"/>
If you would haue theyr Lyuers soft and tender, you shall mingle dry Figges well beaten with water, and making pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets thereof, cram them with it for the space of seuenteene, or twentie dayes. The Iewes at this day, being the skilfullest fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that be, doo vse a strange order in the fatting of them, wrapping the Goose in a linen Aporne, they hang her vp in a darke place, stopping her eares with Peason, or some other thing, that by neyther hearing, nor seeing of any thing, shee be not forced to stroggel, or crye: after, they geue her pellets of ground Malt, or Barly steeped in water thryse a day, setting by them water and grauell, by which maner of feeding, they make them so fatte, as the Lyuer many times commeth to be fiue pound in weyght. Whylest I was at the councell of <hi>Wormes,</hi> there was a Lyuer of a Goose brought me by a Iewe, that wayed foure pound. <hi>Plinie</hi> is also a witnesse, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lyuers of fatte Geese, affirming, that they wyll growe after they be out of the bodyes, being sprinckled with milke. The common order of fatting with our countrey people, is to shutte them vp in a darke, and a narrowe place, and to set before them Barly, or Beech wheate, geuing them water with a little Sand, or Grauel in theyr Troughes: and with this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they haue them fatte in fourteene dayes. After haruest, they wylbe fatte with the Grotten, or Stubble. They are plucked (as I sayd before) twyse in the yeere, in the spring, and in the fall of the leafe. Some vse to clippe them, but then theyr fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer growe so well: but yf you pull them, you shall haue them to come very fayre agayne: and this is yenough for a Goose. Duckes and Teales,<note place="margin">

                  </note> are to be ordered in like maner almost as the Goose, sauing that they delight more in waters, and marshes: and therefore you must force some Waters, Lakes, or Pooles, for them, wherevnto they may easely goe and swymme, and dyue at theyr pleasure. <hi>Columella</hi> would haue you haue a court for the nonce for them, where no cattell vse, and neare to the house, round about the which you shall buyld for them little handsome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pond, or Riuer, wherein (as I said) they may swym: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the water they can as euyll liue, as without the land. It is good also to haue neare vnto them, some good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, or meddowe, or to set about the Ponds or Riuers, such hearbes as they best like, as Clauer, Fenegreeke, Endyue, Lettise, and such other as they most delight in, and wherewith theyr young doo well feede: beside, you must geue them Otes, Barly, and other corne in water. There is nothing that they more loue then Acornes, nor that better fatteth them. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light wonderfully to be amongst Reedes and Sedges, wherin they may lye safe from rauenous Byrdes, but so, as there grow no great stalked weedes, that may hinder theyr swymming: for they delight greatly to play them selues in the water, and to striue who can swym fastest, when the weather is fayre and warme: for as they loue suche places where they may best pray vpon the creatures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, so are they much offended, if they be restrayned of their libertie in swymming. In Winter, when the waters be frozen, you must ply them sometimes with meate. They delight to make theyr nestes in some secrete Couert, but therein you must preuent them, and make their nestes in their owne lodging, or abrode, wel couered and closed with weedes: to which nest you must haue some litle sluce, or gut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They lay great store of Egges, wherewith as with Goose Egges, you may well feede your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. The Egges of Duckes and Geese, are kept in like sort as I told you of Hennes Egges: and beside in Bran, Wheate, or Ashes. They breede in the same season that Geese and other Foule doo, about March and April. And therefore where you keepe them, you must strawe stickes and strawes for them to make their nestes withal. Their Egges must be suffered to be hatched by themselues, or els remoued &amp; set vnder some Henne: for the Ducklinges that the Henne hatcheth, are thought to be gentler and tamer. You must take good heede, that the Egges whiche they laye, be not eaten and spoyled by Crowes and Pyes, whyle the damme is seeking abroade for meate. If so be
<pb facs="tcp:4163:170"/>
you haue Riuers, and Lakes for the purpose. It is best to let the dammes bring them vp, for when they be hatched, they wil liue very well vpon the water with theyr dammes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny charge at all: only taking good heede, that they be defended from Buzards, Rites, Crowes, and other like vermine: but so you vse them, as they wyl euery night come home to the house, for it is not good to let them be abrode in the night, for danger of losing them, and making them wylde. Yet hath it ben seene, that such as haue hatched abroade, haue afterwardes come home, and brought with them a great number at theyr tayles. When I was Embassador in England, it was told me by men of good credite, that there was in Scotland neare to the Sea, certayne trees, that yeerely brought foorth a fruite, that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Sea, became a kind of wylde Duckes, or rather Barnacles, which though it seemed strange vnto me, yet found I <hi>Aristotle</hi> a witnesse of the like, who wryteth, that the Riuer <hi>Hypanus</hi> in <hi>Scythia,</hi> bringeth foorth trees, whose leaues being somewhat larger then Maple leaues, whereof commeth a kind of foure footed Byrds.

The fleshe is very good and delicate, meete for noble mens tables, and wyll be long kept without corrupting, the Egges also be very pleasant, and good to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Hortensus</hi> they saye, was the fyrst that euer killed Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke for the table in Rome, as a newe dyshe at the Priestes feast.

His tayle falling euery yeere with the fall of the leafe, he mourneth, and creepeth in corners tyll it be sprong againe. They goe abroade, as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4163:170"/>
Hennes and Chickins doo, without a keeper, and get their owne liuinges. They be best kept in little Ilandes: for they flee neither hye, nor farre of. Some thinke it to be a spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and an enuious Bird, as the Goose to be shamefast, and that he deuoureth his owne doung, because he woulde haue no man receyue benefite by him. He liueth (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth) fiue and twentie yeeres: he breedeth at three yeeres olde, the Cocke hauing his feathers diuers coloured: he hatcheth in thirtie dayes, as the Goose dooth, &amp; layeth three times a yeere, yf his Egges be taken away and set vnder a Henne. You must looke, that those that you set vnder a Henne, be newe layd, and that the Henne from the first of the Moone, be set vppon niene Egges, fiue of the Peacocks, and foure of her owne. The tenth day after she hath sitte, take away the Hennes Egges, and put vnder the like number of freshe Hennes Egges. They must be turned, and therefore marked vppon one side. And see that you choose the greatest Hennes: for yf the Henne be little, you must take the lesser number of Egges, as three Pehennes Egges, and sixe Henne Egges. When they be hatched, you must as you doo with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Henne, let them alone: the first day afterwardes bring them out, and put them with the damme into a Pen, and feede them at the first with Barly floure sprinckled with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or pappe made of any other corne, and cooled.

After they be a moneth old, you may let them goe into the feeld and followe the Henne, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Henne with a long line, that she goe not to far abroade, but that the Chickin may come home in time. After the sixth moneth, you may geue them Barly, and bread: and after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth moneth, you may put them to roust in the house with the other Peacocks, not suffering them to sit vpon the ground, but vpon Pearches for taking of colde. And although when they waxe greate, they cheefely delight to sitte vppon the toppes of houses, and be as the Goose is, which are the best watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and also the best warnyng geuers in the nyght tyme: yet is it best for you to vse them to sitte vpon Pearches, in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

The Cocke, for the great lust that he hath of treade, breakes a sunder the Egges that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Henne, and therefore it is best to haue the Hennes to sit as secretly as may be: they also vse to beate and chase their owne Chickins, tyll they see them cressed vppon the head, taking them tyll then, to be none of their owne.

And therefore the Douehouses are commonly built with great cost and beautie in the toppes of Turrettes and Houses, from whence by narrowe grated wyndowes, they flee abrode to theyr feeding. Pigions (yf the countrey be for them) are fedde and maynteyned with little cost, feeding them selues all the yeere long with such meate as they finde abrode, except at such time as the ground is couered with Snowe, when as you must of necessitie helpe them with a little meate.

In Italy, there are of this sort, as bigge agayne as ours, and are nowe common in Flaunders.
<pb facs="tcp:4163:173"/>
An other sort is more familiar and tame, and something more large of body, with rough feete, and commonly of colour white, and sometime speckled and yellowysh: this kind is commonly kept in Cities and Townes, where the others can not be kept, and is fedde with meate at home, and because they are euer in danger of vermine, and rauening Byrdes, they are styll kept within doores, and alwayes fedde at home. This kind the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cal tame Pigions, or month Pigions, because they breede every moonth, saue in the dead of Winter. Both these sortes are wonderous fruiteful, breeding commonly eight times a yeere (yf the kind be good) yea sometimes tenne, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the houses for the other wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kind, because they conteyne great numbers, are buylt after a more handsome order, although vnder the eues of houses, and in steepels of Churches, you shall haue thousands breeding. <hi>Varro</hi> appoyntes the Douehouse to be buyld in this sort: a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie adioyning to the house, and well lofted and seeled aboue, with one little doore in it, and foure windowes, aunswering the foure quarters of the Heauen, which windowes must be well grated, so as they may geue light yenough, and keepe out ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Al the walles within must be fayre white limed, for with this colour is the Pigion woonderfully delighted: besides, it must be well pargetted and playstered without, specially about the windowes, so as neyther Mouse, Weesel, nor other vermine may enter: the windowes must be so placed, as they may let in the Sunne all the Winter, hauing a hole of sufficient wyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ouer agaynst them, well netted and tunnelled, in such sort, as the Pigions may easely flee out and in at, and yet not suffer any hurtfull byrd to enter: for the Pigion taketh great delight in flying nowe and then abroade, where after shee hath recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her selfe, shee commeth with ioy to her nest agayne: as on the otherside shee mourneth, yf shee be restrained of her liberty. Round about the walles within, you must haue little round holes, from the toppe to the bottome, wherein they may breede: <hi>Varro</hi> would haue them three handfulles in length, and ledged from hole to hole for them to walke vpon. Some thinke it best to make your holes of Lome, or Lime, and not of Bricke and Stone, as many doo, because of the warmth. There be some that buyld theyr Douehouses vppon pillers, in the midest of some Pond, or great Water, both because they delight in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and because they wyll haue them safe from vermine. The meate that they most delight in, is Tares, wylde Fytch, Pease, Wheate, Myllet: where these be not, you may geue them Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, specially in winter Rape seede, and Cocle: for by gathering and pecking vp these little seedes, they geat them selues a heate in cold weather.

from doung. And though <hi>Varro</hi> biddes you to sweepe and make cleane your Douehouses continually, and that the doung is good &amp; profitable for the feelde, yet seeing this kind of Foule dooth delight in places sprinckled with theyr owne doung, you shall not neede to be carefull in cleansing of it. Looke well that they be not frayde, or disquieted with Gunnes, or noyse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or other like, specially when they sitte: and yf you haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to goe into the house, see that you do it about noone time, when they be abroad a feeding, and be sure to knocke well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come in. Some say, that it wyll cause them to loue the house, and alure others to come thyther, yf you sprinckle them with Commyn, before they goe to feeding, or perfume the house with Sage, and Francensence. Some haue an other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for this purpose, and that is Potshards beaten small and searced, mingled with the hearbe Coast, and good old wine, and geuen vnto them. Others take Barly floure, sodden with drye Figges, and a part of Hony. <hi>Cardan</hi> teacheth this, as the best for this purpose, of Barly, or Myllet, of Comyn, of Cost, of <hi>Agnus Castus,</hi> of Hony, of old Lome, or Morter, of good Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kadell, boyle them al togeather, and make a stone of them to be set in the middest of a house. <hi>Tragus</hi> teacheth to take the rootes of the Thystel, and to boyle them with the pickle of Hearings. <hi>Constantine</hi> out of <hi>Didymus,</hi> wryteth of diuers other thinges for this purpose, which who so wyll, may trye. Looke well that they be not destroyed by the Hauke, or Buzard: the Hauke is a speciall enimie to this Bird, whose taking, <hi>Varro</hi> teacheth you in this maner: to lay a Pigion vppon the ground, and to sticke, bending closely ouer her, a couple of Lyme rods. There is a kinde of Hauke, that naturally is terrible to other Haukes, and preserueth the Pigion: the common people call it Castrel. <hi>Columella</hi> affirmeth, that yf you take the young Castrels, and preserue them euery one in earthen vesselles well couered and plastred all ouer, and hang them in the corners of the Doue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>house, it makes the Pigions haue such a loue to the house, as they wyll neuer forsake it. They haue many other aduersaries, Crowes, Dawes, and Owles, which all destroy the Pigions, specially when they breede. I founde of late in myne owne
<pb facs="tcp:4163:175"/>
Douehouse, an Owle sitting solemely in the nest vppon her Egges in the middest of all the Pigions, and hard by the house in an olde hollowe tree, I found peeces of young Pigions, that the Owles had brought to feede their young with: and though the Owle seeme to be greater then the Pigion, by reason of the thicknesse of her feathers, yet wyll they creepe in at as little a place as the Pigion wyll: so small and little is their bodyes, though they be bombased with feathers. Agaynst Weesels, Stoates, and suche like, <hi>Palladius</hi> woulde haue you hedge the Douehouse about with sharpe prickly branches voyd of leaues, as Gorse bryers, and such like, as they dare not passe through for pricking. <hi>Didymus</hi> and others, doo bidde you hang great branches of Rue all about the house, specially at the entrance of the doore, or to put wyld Rue vnder their wynges, or to sprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle them with Rue: for this hearbe (as they say) hath a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all force against suche hurtfull vermine.

The Noble men and Gentlemen of Rome, were woont to buyld about theyr houses fayre Fyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds, and many times satisfied herein theyr pleasure, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cost and expences, as <hi>M.

<pb facs="tcp:4163:177"/>
                  <hi>Varro</hi> maketh mencion of two sorts of Fishponds, the one of sweete water, the other salt, the one amongst the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where the springes feede them, and of great profite, the other neare to the Sea, where <hi>Neptune</hi> doth yeelde them both store of water and Fishe: for examples, may serue the Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds of <hi>Hortensius,</hi> whiche rather pleased the eye, then the purse. The best making of Pondes, is eyther by the sea, as <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who to let in the Sea into his ponds, made a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through the midest of a great hill, whereby he thought him selfe as great a Lorde of Fishe, as <hi>Neptune</hi> him selfe: or els to haue them feede from some great streame, or Riuer, that may bring in both water and Fish, which by Fludde or Sluse, may let in alwayes freshe water, not suffering the old to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, but alway refreshing it, and bringing more Fishe. The next in goodnesse, are those that are fedde with Pipes, or secrete passages vnder the ground, &amp; may be let out agayne by Sluse, which Sluses must so be made, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you lift, you may let the water into your Meddowes, to make them more fruitefull, as is to be scene in the countreys of the <hi>Swytches,</hi> and <hi>Heluetians,</hi> and in many other places. And therefore the waters (as I said) must be well enclosed with good Bayes, Bankes, and Wales, that they may be able to abide the rage of the fluddes and the water. The worst and last kind, is such as are made in Lakes, standing Pooles, and Rayne waters. These kind of pondes, though they be the worst, by reason of theyr vncleane stinking and corrupt water, yet where there is no better, are to be made account of: for though they be not the holsomest for keeping of Fishe, yet they yeelde some commoditie, and are most necessary about the house, eyther for watering of Cattell, keeping of Beefe and Duckes, and washing, and other like vses: but yf so be you can make them eyther by the Sea, or neare s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4163:177"/>

These Sluses or passages, you must make at the bottome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ponds, yf the place wyll so serue, that laying your leuell with the bottome of the Pond, you may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Sea, or Riuer, to lye seuen foote higher: for this <hi>Colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi> thinkes, wyll be a sufficient leuell for your Pond, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yenough for your Fishe. Howbeit, there is no doubt, the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the water comes from the Sea, the cooler it is, wherein the Fishes most delight. And yf so be the place where you meane to make your Pond lye leuell with the brym of the Sea, or the Riuer, you must dygge it nine foote deepe, and lay your currant within two foote of the toppe, and so order it as the water come in abundantly: for the olde water lying vnder the leuell of the Sea, wyll not out agayne, except a greater rage come in: but for the Pond that is subiect to the fludde and the ebbe, it is ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough yf it be but two foote deepe. In the bankes and sides of these Ponds, you must haue Busshes and Creeke holes, for the Fishe to hide them in from the heate of the Sunne: besides, old hollowe trees, and rootes of trees, are pleasant and delightfull harbours for Fishe. And yf you can hansomely conuay them, it is best to bring from the Sea, little Rockes with the weedes and all vppon them, and to place them in the middest of your Ponds, and to make a young Sea of them, that the Fishe may skarsly knowe of theyr imprisonment.

both at home, and abroade, is certaynely appoynted. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at the fyrst, within the compasse of threescore pase about the Hyues: and when the flowres there haue been sufficiently wrought, they send abroade their discouerers to finde out more foode. And when they fall all togeather to their businesse, some worke the flowers with theyr feete, others carry water with theyr mouthes, and droppes in theyr little fleeses: the young lusty fellowes labour abroade, the elder at home. Those that goe abroade, doo with theyr forelegges lade all theyr thighes, which nature for the nonce hath made roffe: thus being loaded, legges, head, backe and all, as much as they may beare, they returne home, where there wayghteth commonly three or four at the doore to vnloade them. Within all this whyle are some laying in order, some buylding, some making cleane, and some making ready theyr meate: for they feede not seuerally, for feare of veguiling one the other. They frame theyr houses arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse within the Hyues, with two passages, so as they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one way, and go out an other.

The best Hiues, are those that are made of Corke wicker, or ryndes of trees, because they keepe out both cold and heate: the next

Of these woodden Hiues, the best are those that are made of Figge tree, Pine, Ashe, and Walnutte, of suche length (as I tolde you) and a cubitte in bredth.

the old stagers are disposed to send abroade their Colonies, and therefore you shall by two tokens specially know, when the newe Princes with their people will abroade. The first, when as a day or two before they cluster and hang (specially in the euening) about the mouth of the Hiue, and seeme to shewe by their comming out, a great desire to be gone, and to haue a kingdome and countrey by them selues: which, if you prepare them at home, they content them selues very well with it. And if the keeper prouide not for them, taking them selues to be greatly iniured, they depart, and seeke a newe dwelling. To preuent this mischiefe, <hi>Columella</hi> wylles you to looke diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them in the spring time about eyght of the clocke, or at noone: after which houres, they commonly goe not a way, and to marke wel their going out, and comming in. The other signe is, that when they are reddy to flye, or going, they make a great humming and noyse, as souldiers redy to remoue theyr campe. At theyr first comming out, they lye aloft playing vp &amp; downe, as it were tarryng for their fellowes, tyll all theyr company come. Yea, many times the olde inhabitantes, being weery of theyr dwellinges, doo leaue theyr Hiues, which is perceyued when they come so out, as none remaine behind, and presently mount into the ayre, then must you fall to ringing of pannes and basons, to feare, or bring downe the runnawayes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amased with the greate and suddaine noise, doo eyther presently repaire to theyr olde Hiue, or els knitte them selues in swarme vpon the branch of some tree neare to the place: then must the keeper out of hand be reddy with a newe Hiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the purpose, and rubbed with such hearbes, as the Bee delightes in, or sprinckled with little droppes of Hony, (I haue seene in some places vsed Creame) and so shaking them into the Hiue, and couering them with a sheete: let him leaue them tyll the morning, and then set them in their place. He must (as I tolde you before) haue diuers newe Hiues in a redinesse to serue the turne withall.

Their anger is cheefely asswaged by the presence of those that vse to tend them, at whose comming they waxe wylder, being well acquainted with those that are their keepers. If there be two swarmes in one Hiue, and agreed togeather, they haue two sortes &amp; maner of Coames, euery swarme obseruing his owne order: but all the Coames so hang by the roffes of the Hyues and sides, as they touche not the ground where the Bees vse cheefely to walke, as I sayde before in theyr buylding of theyr Coames. The fashion of theyr Coames, is alwayes according to the fashion of theyr Hyues,<note place="margin">

                  </note> sometimes square, sometime round, sometime long as the Hyues are, in which they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned as in a moulde. <hi>Plinie</hi> wryteth, that there were Hony Coames found in Germany, of eyght foote in length, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be, you must not take them all out, but must vse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in taking of them. Amongst our people in the first, be haruest (yf I may so terme it) they vse with theyr crooked knife, to pare away no more but the empty celles, tyll they come to those that be full, taking good heede that they hurt them not: and this they doo in the spring. In the latter haruest, that is, at the end of Sommer, they take the Coames full of Hony, in such sort (as I tolde you) burning the old Bees, and alway kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and preseruing the young swarmes. In the first taking, when the Meddowes are full of flowres, they leaue the fift part of the Coames behind: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter haruest, when winter appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, they leaue a thyrd of the Coames for the sustenance of the Bee. But this quantitie can not certaynely be prescribed for all countreys, but must be measured according to the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or want of flowres. <hi>Dionysius Thaseus,</hi> thinketh good to leaue them a tenth of theyr Coames in the Sommer time, yf the Hyues be very full, otherwyse, according to the proportion: and yf they be empty, not to meddle with them. <hi>Plinie</hi> woulde not haue the Hony of the spring time (whiche he calleth flowre Hony) to be medled with all, but to be spared. Others leaue no Hony at all for them, because of the abundance of flowres that are then springing, which is the cheefe fundation of their Coames. Such as be skilfullest, doo leaue the Bees a twelfth part of theyr labour: and this they doo about a thirtie dayes
<pb facs="tcp:4163:188"/>
after the swarme, which they make an end of commonly in May. The olde and the corrupt Coames, are for the most part at this time taken away, and the sound, and such as are filled with Hony, left: in taking of the Hony at the latter time of the yeere, they vse to destroy the oldest stockes, to saue the charges of feeding of them. This driuing and gelding of Hyues, is not commonly vsed in the countrey, but they rather according to theyr custome, at the end of the yeere burne them, alleging for theyr aucthoritie an olde englishe prouerbe of theyr owne. <hi>Dryue Bees, and loose Bees: burne Bees, and haue Bees: and in some places they drowne them.</hi> When you haue thus spoyled your Hyues, you shall carry all your Coames into some handsome place, where you meane to make your Hony, and stoppe vp all the holes and creuisses of the walles and wyndowes, as close as you may: for the Bees wylbe very busie to recouer the pray. Your Hyues being thus driuen, yf there be any ill placed Coames at the entry, you shall alter them, and place them in good order, so as the toppes stand downeward, so when you next geld them, you shall easlyer take out the olde Coames, and leaue the newe, and the Wax shalbe the newer: which the older it is, the worse it is. When so euer you take out your Coames, looke that you strayne out the Hony the same day, whyle they are hotte and newe. The Hony that you take at the full of the Moone (as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth) yeeldeth most, and the fayrer the day is, the thicker it is. The Coames being taken out, let them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be warmed then heated, least by ouer heating them, you strayne out the Wax with the Hony: afterward, put them into a good strong bagge, and with a presse, or other instrument made for the purpose, or with a wycker baskette, presse out the Hony, but see that before you presse it, you seuer from it suche Coames, as haue in them young Bees, called with some Grubbes, or any redde or rusty drosse: for these with theyr euill iuyce corrupt the Hony. When the Hony is this strayned out, it is put into earthen vessels, and suffered to stand vncouered a fewe dayes tyll it haue wrought, and cast vp a loft all his drags, which you must often skim of with a little sticke: but in many places they are not so curious, but iumble alltogeather, and so

                  </note> though the breeding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring of Bees, is very doubtfull with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> neither dare he after his long disputacions, affirme any certaintie thereof: sometime he resiteth the opinions of others, some thinking that they are ingendred by coppulation, the Drone being the male, and the Bee the feemale: Other saying, that they bring foorth young, but doo not ingender, but that they geather their young ones, but from whence, they knowe not. Some say, from the flowres of <hi>Marioram</hi>: some, from the flowres of the Reede: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the Olyue flowres, because when soeuer there is great plenty of Olyues, there is also great swarmes of Bees. There are againe, that thinke the Drones to be so geathered, and the Bees to be bredde only of the kinges: and a little after, he sayth, The young are best bredde, when the Hony is made, they labour with theyr legges the Wax, and with their mouth they cast out the Hony into the celles, and hauing layd theyr young, they sitte vpon them as byrdes doo. The little Worme, or Grubbe, being thus hatched while he is small, lyeth crump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp in the Coame: afterward, sprawleth abroade by his owne force, and falleth to feeding, cleauing so to the Coame, as he seemeth to be tyed.

Beside, they be greater, as though their bodies were purposely framed for generation: and they punishe the Drones. It is not very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the children shoulde punishe the parentes, therefore the Bees are not ingendred of Drones. Besides, it is a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Bees are ingendred without copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that their broode lyeth very small at the first, wrapped vp in the holes, or celles of their Coames, whereas al other Flies and Wormes, that are bredde by copulation, doo long ingender, and quickly lay, in greatnesse, according to the kind of the Worme. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The king is at the first, of a yellowish colour, as a chosen flowre, framed of the finest substance, neither is he bredde a worme, but with winges at the very first. The other common sort, when they begin to haue fashion, are called Nimphes, as the Drones, the <hi>Sireus,</hi> and the <hi>Cepheus,</hi> whose heads, yf any man chaunce to pull of, they serue as a delicate foode to the breeders. After a little time, they powre into them foode, and sitte vppon them (making a great noyse as it is thought, to procure a heate necessarie for their hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) till breaking a sunder the filmes that encloseth euery one of them like an Egge, the whole broode commeth foorth. <hi>Plinie</hi> addeth, that this was seene and obserued at Rome, in a Hiue made of latterne hornes: the whole broode is finished in fiue and fourtie dayes. As soone as they are brought out, they are taught to trauaile straightwayes with their dames, the young people wayting presently vppon their young king. There are sundry kinges bredde for failing, and when they come to age, by common consent, the foulest and vntowardest of them are destroyed.

Afterward, the house beeing deepe strawed with Tyme, and the Bullocke laide vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his backe, the doores and the wyndowes must be close shut vp, and so plaistred, as there can no ayre enter. Three weekes after, the wyndowes must be opened on euery side, saue where the winde bloweth strongest, and the light and the ayre let in: when it hath been wel cooled and refreshed, the windowes must be shut vp againe, and made as close as before: and being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the eleuenth day after, you shall finde the house ful of Bees, and nothing left of the Oxe, saue the hornes, the heare, and the bones: they holde opinion besides, that the kinges are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the braine, and the other Bees, of the body.</p>

First, to take out all the rotten and corrupt Coames, and to geue them freshe meate, and after, to perfume them with smoke. It is good also to put to a decayed Hiue, a newe swarme, as I saide before. Many times, they dye of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease that they call the great deuouring, which happeneth when they haue made so much Wax, as they thinke they shal be able to fill, and afterwardes, by storme and tempest, many of them be destroyed, so that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remaine suffiseth not to fill the Coames, whereby the empty partes of the Coames becommeth rotten, and so by little and little infecteth both the Hony, and the Bees. For which the only remedy is, eyther to put in a newe swarme to fill vp the celles, or yf you haue no such swarmes, to cut away part of the Coames before they come to be nought, which you must doo with a very sharpe knife, for feare of displacing the rest of the Coames. A cause beside many times of the death of the Bees, is theyr too much prosperitie, as when there are diuers yeeres great abundance of flowres, and the Bees so busie in theyr feeding, that they forget theyr breeding, who ouerwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying themselues with trauaile, they dye, not leauing any brood behind them.

               <p>I have great store in deede of it, but that I forgat to tell you of it, it is knowen so commonly, as I neede not to discribe it vnto you: whosoeuer is troubled with breaking of wind, and weakenesse of stomacke, and those whose stomackes retaine not their meate, or whosoeuer feeles a sowre belching from his stomacke, and is therewith often troubled, let them continually vse <hi>Betony,</hi> eyther the hearbe and flowre boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Wine, or the water distilled, or the Conserue (as they cal it) of the flowres. And yf so be you lacke the Conserue, or the water you may vse the dry hearbe in powder, eyther by it selfe, or with Hony: women that are troubled with the mother, may vse this hearbe for their remedie. To be short, the flowre, leafe, and roote of <hi>Betony</hi> sodden &amp; drunke, or howsoeuer you wyll, in Electuarie, Conserue, Sirope, Potion, or Pouder, as you list to take it, is singuler good in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diseases of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> stomacke, liuer, spleen, kydneyes, and bladder, it freeth the Matrice from obstruction, and draweth from thence all hurtful moystures. For consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Loonges, Coughes, Dropsies, continuall and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifyed Feuars, proceeding from the stomacke, boyle the leaues and flowres of <hi>Betony</hi> in Honyed water, and you shal haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent helpe. Thus haue I shewed you what kind of hearbes I haue planted about my Bees, to the ende they should haue foode at hand of the sweetest, and the holsomest: I haue shewed you also the vertues of the hearbe, the flowre, and the water, that you may vse for your owne commoditie: only this warning I geue you, that you doo not distill them, as the vnskilful doo, in stilles of Lead, Tinne, and Brasse, which poysoneth and spoyleth the water, but in Glasse Stils, set in some vessel of water vpon the fyre, wherby your water shalbe most perfect and holsome. The difference of these two distillinges, appeareth plaine: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Wormewood, which yf you distil in your common Styl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latories, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water commeth out sweete, hauing gotten a corrupt qualitie by the nature &amp; corruption of the mettal: whereas, yf you do it in Stils made of Glasse, looking that the Glasses be wel closed round about, your water shal haue the very taste, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and propertie of the hearbe. With these Glasse Stils you

may so order your fire, as you may draw out of euery hearbe, the water, spirit, oyle, and salt, to the great comfort of sicke and diseased persons. I set besides, great plentie of Sauery, Heath, Tamariske, &amp; without the Beeyard, Broome, in whose flowres the Bee much delighteth. I keepe you here peraduenture too long in so small a matter.
