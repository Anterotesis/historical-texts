            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Beholde what noble things are come to ruine great:</l>
               <l>When fruites are rype, thou well doest know, then are they pluct to eate:</l>
               <l>The sinne is very rype, the bankes doe ouer flowe:</l>
               <l>The tyme wyll come when thou shalt be, like these be brought as lowe.</l>
               <l>If thou doe not repent, when mercy standes in gate:</l>
               <l>I feare me when thou wouldest fayne, that it will be to late.</l>
               <l>Take tyme while tyme doth giue, a laysure for the same:</l>
               <l>Remember well that tyme hath féete, and she is nothing lame.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5789:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Before long haire she hath, behinde she quite is polde:</l>

               <l>Not foure Monthes fully past, since these were lyke to thée:</l>
               <l>And now thearth hath gaped so wyde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that swallowed vp they be.</l>
               <l>What was the cause right well, the scripture vs doth showe:</l>
               <l>It was the very sinnes of them, that brought those townes so lowe.</l>
               <l>Thy sinnes do more abounde, what filth is not in thée:</l>
               <l>Why shouldst not thou be swallowed like as all these Castelles be?</l>
               <l>But that the mighty God of his abundaunt grace:</l>
               <l>Doth yet in mercy graunt to thée, somewhat of longer space.</l>
               <l>Consider howe he fierce, of late hath delt with thée:</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:5789:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bicause these Castelles and thy selfe, after might warned be.</l>
               <l>And now bycause nothing, could make them to repent:</l>
               <l>From thée he did transport to them, his grieuous punishment.</l>
               <l>Thy warning could not serue, ne yet theirs could serue thée:</l>
               <l>Well now for their refusall great, swallowed vp they bée.</l>
               <l>Amend my country still, I thée desire and pray:</l>
               <l>For I a member of thy state, were loth thou shouldst decay.</l>
               <l>Beholde thy louing Lorde, his sworde is in his hande:</l>
               <l>Thée to the earth to fling in yre what can his force withstande:</l>
               <l>Can mighty gates of brasse, can Castels strongly builte:</l>
               <l>His force withstande? his very breath, these Castels quite hath spilte.</l>
               <l>No meane there is in déede, that can his plagues withstande:</l>
               <l>But onely this repentance may, by mercy stay his hande.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5789:7"/>Repent in tyme therfore, to God for mercy cry:</l>
               <l>Which when thou doest his mighty hand he stayeth by and by.</l>
               <l>For thus he playne doth say, when sinners shall relente:</l>
               <l>And turne from sinne, I euen then lykewise my selfe repente.</l>
               <l>Of all the plagues which I vpon them thought to bring:</l>
               <l>Lo here the mercy great I say, of our most heauenly king:</l>
               <l>Their sinnes Ill quite forgette, if they will turne to me:</l>
               <l>I will remember them no more, though thousandes that there be.</l>
               <l>Remember <hi>Niniuie,</hi> how that when god had sente:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> the Prophet vnto them, they straight wayes did repent.</l>
               <l>Whereof did come that God, his wrath did still restrayne:</l>
               <l>Repent therefore in tyme I say, so mayst thou styll remayne.</l>
