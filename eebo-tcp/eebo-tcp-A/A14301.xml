            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BY the former Discourse it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the <hi>Well-being and Health of Mans Body consists in obseruing the Golden Meane, which is Temperance in our Dyet,</hi> that is, cating and drinking no more, then the Stomacke can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest, and that thereby the functions of the Minde bee not hindered nor made ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure by the excessiue <hi>Quantity.</hi> For this reason, and because <hi>Study</hi> and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now to finde out this Measure, I confesse it a great difficulty by reason of the dinersities of mens Constitutions, Yeares, and Strength: For that <hi>Measure,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11825:14"/>
with an o'de man, cannot square well with a young man, nor that of the strong man with the weake.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chollericke</hi> must haue his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differing from the <hi>Flegmaticke.</hi> These haue euery one a stomacke repugnant to one anothers nature: How then shall wee compose an exact Measure to reconcile these repugnances? Necessity requires vs to lookeafter this <hi>Soueraigne good,</hi> for the health of the Body and Soule; but Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and our longing wills can hardly consent to be limitted. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, naturall reason bids vs to proserue Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, although wee smart a little to enioy the more content.</p>
               <p>Let vs then search out what proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meate and drink will serue a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature; the which the easier to find, we must obserue these Rules. First, if one takes into his body ordinarily so much meate and drinke, that after the meale he feeles himselfe more heauy, sleepy, and lesse capable to conceiue matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge, Sermons, or any kinde of Study, then hee was before his meale, let him rest assuredly, that hee hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Measure wee looke for. For
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11825:14"/>
                  <hi>it is not fit to feede and please the vegetatiue and sensuall part so much, that thereby the noblest part be offended, which is the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and reasonable Faculty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee must consider, that out of the aboundance of meates, which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into our Bodies, there will arise Vapouis from the Stomacke vp to the Head, which will darken the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and also store of Humours and Blood ingendred in the Liuer, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt, and Veines, which will inflame vpwards, and helpe with the former Vapours to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud the cleare Rayes of Reason and Wisdome, which they would neuer do, if a man had not exceeded the lawfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. O how much are they deceiued, who feeling themselues feeble in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, runne speedily to Breake-fast, as though Nature languished for want of meate, when as in very deede their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse proceedes from the aboundance of Humours congested and gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which by their ouer-much moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture haue stuft the Musckles and the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, and stopt the passages of the spirits, so that the <hi>Scuruy</hi> and other Diseases creepe in by reason of those

Obstructions and Oppilations. The like abuse some commit in their mornings draughts, which indeede is the chiefe cause of the Dropsies, Gouts, Coughes, and other moyst sicknesses.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man must not suddainely thinke to meete with this <hi>Measure,</hi> but by little and little by degrees hee must leaue of his former course of <hi>Dyet,</hi> and all by leasure proceede by diminishing his wounted fare, vntill hee arriues to that <hi>Quantity,</hi> that after his meale hee feeles none of the aboue named impediments to grieue his Head, or to hinder the Functions of his Minde.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although a certayne <hi>set quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> cannot rightly be prescribed by reason of the different natures of meates, and of the ages of men, yet notwithstanding it is lately tryed by experience, that for <hi>olde Persons,</hi> or for such as approach neere vnto it, or for some that feare some incurable sicknesse, twelue, thirteene, or foureteene <hi>Ounces of meate will serue a man for a day, accounting Bread, Flesh, Egges, or any such solid meate, and so many Ounces or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more of drinke.</hi> This measure I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe onely to aged persons, the sickely,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11825:15"/>

               <p>Fourthly, as for the <hi>Quality</hi> of the meats, there is no great heed to be taken so that they exceede not in the quantity, if the meate distaste not the Appetite, and that the due measure be obserued. Among al the sorts of meates which we eate, those are commended, which are of least putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For wee see, that <hi>Fish and Flesh will taint sooner then Pulse or Corne.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rice, Bread,</hi> or such as are made of them will agree best with Nature, for by experience it is sound, that the chiefe cause of the small Pockes, &amp;c. comes of the eating of flesh too soone.</p>
               <p>They which haue practised this <hi>Dyet,</hi> do highly commend Panades, or Gruell, which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Panat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fifth Rule, for asmuch as all the difficulty for the obseruing of this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure proceedes of <hi>sensuall appetite,</hi> and that this sensuall appetite springs of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of <hi>Imagination,</hi> whereby varieties of meates are conceiued to bee very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the sences, wee must doe our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to correct this <hi>depraued Imagination.</hi> For the correcting whereof, two things among others are chiefly to bee regarded First, that we with-draw our selues from the sight of such prouoaking and <hi>enticing dainties,</hi> as we read <hi>Epaminonda</hi> that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Theban</hi> did, who being inuited to a friends house, and seeing the Table too fully replenished with delicacies, departed suddainly away.

Secondly, when wee are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for manners sake to stay and behold such vaine Varieties, that wee imagine them not to be in very deede so delightfull, faire, and wholesome, as in outward shew they seeme to be, but that they are deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full baites to catch and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This <hi>Dyet composed of Bread</hi> is pure, simple, not subiect to Corruption, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nourishments be. And therefore I

                  </gap>gmaticke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which indeede are the ingendring causes of all diseases. It bridles and keeps all the Humours in such an equall temper, that none shall offend eyther in <hi>Quantity,</hi> or in <hi>Quality:</hi> for indeede <hi>all our sicknesses proceed from Repletion,</hi> sauing some few which proceede of Famine, in taking more sustenance then Nature requires, or the Stomacke can well digest. For mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation whereof, we see, that <hi>all Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are cured by Euacuations.</hi> Blood letting is vsed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:11825:19"/>
taken to free the Body of that insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable load of filthy matter, which by <hi>Gluttony</hi> was ingendred. Nor will one Purge sustice. But before an ordinary sicknesse be remooued, the <hi>Apothecary</hi> must minister many Nauseatiue and bitter Potions able to weary the strongest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For at the first, the first Region, as <hi>Physitians</hi> call it, must be purged; that is, the Guts and entrailes. Secondly, the Liuer. And lastly, the Veines must bee emptied of their watrish Humors and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.</p>
               <p>And it is holden for certaine, that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery two yeares there is such store of ill humors and excrements ingendred in the Body, that a Vessell of one hundred Ounces wil scarce contayne them.</p>
               <p>These humours being let alone, will corrupt in processe of time, and wil cause a man to fall into some deadly sicknesse. And commonly, most people, which dye in their Beds, before they arriue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of old age, doe perish by these ouer-abounding Humors, which they heaped within them through their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue Feasts and Belly-cheere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second Commodity,</hi> that comes by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11825:20"/>
this orderly <hi>Dyet</hi> is, that it doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defend a man from those superfluous Humors within the Body, but likewise it fortifieth him agaynst outward Causes; for hee which hath his Body pure with temperate humors, shall easier endure the ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The reason is, because very little fluxe of any offending humor can fall into the wounded part, which in other bodies is wont to inflame; yea, and sometime it will cause a griping Convulsion, or a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, by the superfluity or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued quality of the Humours, wherewith the naturall moysture is corrupted.

If a man dyes by reason of eyther of the two former wayes, there must ensue a great commotion in Nature, and therefore he feeles extraordinary grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But by the third manner of dissolution a man feeles no paine at all, because the Temperature is all by leasure dissolued from within him, and because the gentle moysture, which feedes the Body, becomes wasted together with the naturall heate at the same instant, when the Soule departes.

Heere hence it comes to passe, that they, which obserue a sparing <hi>Dyet</hi> are watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, circumspect, prouident, and sound of Iudgement: Whatsoeuer spirituall or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall exercise they take in hand, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly excell in that kinde of knowledge, which they undertake.

               <p>For it pleaseth <hi>God</hi> oftentimes to send or infuse messages to confirme his seruants in their constant courses. As I remember in the <hi>Booke of Martyres</hi> a Holy man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes to be brought to the Stake for the <hi>Faiths</hi> sake, the night before complayned to one <hi>Austin</hi> his Friend, that since his Imprisonment hee had no secret enco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11825:24"/>
somewhat loath to dye. But the next day as hee was lead towards the Stake to be burned, hee met the sayd <hi>Austin</hi> by the way, to whom this Good man cryed out with great ioy, laying his hand on his heart: <hi>O Austin, Austin, he is come, he is come;</hi> meaning, the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> of whose absence hee had bewayled the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but there may bee many <hi>Saints</hi> here in our dayes, but surely they take not the right course to make their <hi>Election sure,</hi> if they mortifie not their Bodies sometimes, when rebellious Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are like to breake out into combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, or else that they be endowed with this powerfull vertue of Abstinence, as I doe heere prescribe. Nor are they to bee counted perfect <hi>Diuines,</hi> which can only discourse of Diuinity, Preach eloquent Sermons, or dispute of profound Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but <hi>Hee is the true Messenger of God, who liues according to our Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And in what outward seruice can a man draw neerer vnto them, then in <hi>Sobriety,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:11825:25"/>
and Abstinence? For, as <hi>Faith is the inward ground of the Spirituall building of GODS Church:</hi> So <hi>Abstinence,</hi> I hold to bee after a sort, the secondary and outward foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this great structure, aswell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it remooues those lets, which might preiudice our vnderstanding, as also because by it wee meete with many singular good helpes to prepare the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Minde to bee more cleare and ready to embrace that course of Life, which best pleaseth our <hi>Creaetor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, as <hi>Lessius</hi> writes, <hi>Seeing that our proceeding or Progresse in Spirituall maet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe depend vpon the vse of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that intellect, which is infused in the Soule, and vppon Faith, which resides in this Understanding, wee cannot loue that which is good or prosite in that Loue; nor hate that which is euill, or grow in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of that euill, except it bee first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and discussed in the Vnderstanding, to stirre vp and mooue our Affections for that Vertuous purpose.</hi>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:11825:42"/>
For sometimes the <hi>Scuruy</hi> is ingendred of outward Causes, and sometimes from within the Body, or from both. And therefore they that dwell neere the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> where the North-east Windes rage, are most subiect to this infirmity. Before the sayd <hi>Lord</hi> euer beganne his <hi>Plantation,</hi> he cannot deny, but I aduised him to erect his Habitation in the bottome of the <hi>Bay</hi> at <hi>Aquafort,</hi> two leagues distant from that <hi>Place,</hi> which for ought I heare, is not much to be discommended, and more into the Land, where my people had wintred two yeares before, and found no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience. Nay, his Lordship himselfe suspected the place; sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> his Letters hee complayned that vnlesse hee might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to me for the assignment of both those places out of my <hi>Grant,</hi> he was in a manner disheartned to plante on that Coast, by reason of the Easterly Windes, which with the Mountaynes of Ice float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Estotiland,</hi> and other Northerne Countries towards <hi>New-found land,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that Easterly shore exceeding cold. Yet notwithstanding, his Lordship beeing perswaded by some, which had more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the gainefull <hi>Trade of Fishing,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:11825:42"/>
then in the Scituation of a commodious Seate for the Wintring of his new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, bestowed all his charge of building at <hi>Fertland,</hi> the coldest harbour of the Land, where those furious Windes and Icy Mountaynes doe play, and beate the greatest part of the Yeare. Whereas, if hee had built eyther at <hi>Aquafort,</hi> or in the <hi>Westerly part in the Bay of Placentia,</hi> which hath aboue 50. miles ouer-land, betwixt it and that Easterne shore, his enterprize had suceeeded most luckily: And so this of <hi>Fertland,</hi> might haue serued well for his profit in the <hi>Fishing,</hi> and also for a pleasant Summer dwelling.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Tanfield,</hi> vnder the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the Lord Vicount <hi>Faulkland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued two yeares, but three leagues more Southward at <hi>Renooz,</hi> and did well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in which place likewise my <hi>Colony</hi> remayned one Winter without any such mortall accidents. But all <hi>Winters,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, are not alike in that Country, no more then they are here with vs in <hi>Europe.</hi> Yea and here too in the same paralell, the season differs. Who will imagine, that wee in <hi>Wales</hi> haue lesse Snow and Frosts then <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Essex?</hi> And yet by experience
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11825:43"/>
wee finde it so, whereof the very cause proceeds from the Easterne windes, whose rigorous force before they arriue ouer land into our <hi>Westerne parts,</hi> cannot but be much broken and abated.</p>
               <p>Besides these <hi>Winds, snows,</hi> and <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sts,</hi> the Scuruy is ingendred by earing of those meates which are of corrupted iuice, raw, cold, salted, or of ill nourishment, which breede grosse blood and melancholly. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which I reckon Bacon, Fish, Beanes, Pease, &amp;c. And among Drinkes, I ranke all strong liquors whatsoeuer, specially, if they be taken in Frosty weather, when the Stomacke ouer abounds with heate, and consequently at that time most subiect to infiamations, which, when the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> comes, will certainely breake out into some dangerous disease.</p>
               <p>Do but obserue how the Sap of Plants and Hearbes in Frosty seasons descends downe to the Roote, as to the last refuge and helpe in Nature? The which Plants if we should refresh with Chalke or Lime, well may they flourish for a little while, but their Fruite and themselues are of no continuance. The like I may say of such, as by strong liquors doe conceiue, that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11825:43"/>
they fortisie and comfort their stomackes in cold weather, when as indeed they get but a sparkling heate like a blast, that will quickly extinguish: From hence arise the Scuruy, Catarrhes, Rhumes, Coughs, Feuers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But leauing these Causes, I will proceed to the <hi>Cure</hi> of this fatall sicknesse, which now a dayes prooues a stumbling stone to the wisest Physitians, by reason of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold symptomes and infirmities which accompany it, able to deceiue <hi>Aesculapius</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p>First, let the party, that feares or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects himselfe tainted, change or ayre his apparrell, putting on cleane shifts and linnen.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let him sleepe in boorded Roomes, and if hee bee able, to haue his Chamber Wainscotted, or well dryed of those dampish sauours, which stone or earthen walls are wont to euaporate and breath out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let him beate and burne one Acre of Land round about his dwelling.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let him eate those meats, which are tender, light of digestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that will not be soone corrupted, chiefly fresh meats with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11825:44"/>
dited sauce, but moderately, and without excesse.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, let him often vse the expressions of Currans, Prunes, or Reasins, or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunis, or some of these in broath made with <hi>Manna, Cassia, Tama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ind,</hi> or <hi>Seene.</hi> For these will loosen the Belly by their moysture and slippery faculty, whose whayish humours the <hi>Melt</hi> or <hi>Spleene</hi> is accustomed to steale away, and so by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it selfe great and bigge to impouerish and infeeble the rest of the Members.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, for an exquisite <hi>Purgation</hi> after a Glister, or Preparatiue first vsed, which might be of <hi>Oximel.</hi> with some of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Expressions, let him take of the roote of <hi>Rheubarbe,</hi> or <hi>Mechoacan</hi> three dragmes, <hi>Hermodactilis</hi> two dragms, <hi>Turbith</hi> three dragmes, an ounce of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredium,</hi> two scruples of Cinnamon and Ginger, three pound of Sugar. Of this Purgation, let the party take one ounce, or sixe dragmes at a time.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, after these Purgations, which must be taken euery day, or euery second day, while it lasteth, let him vse bathes made of Brimstone or Branne once a weeke to attenuate the skinne, whereby
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11825:44"/>
the Vapours of the Body may the easier exhale out. But for twelue houres after bathing hee must not stirre out of doores. Whosoeuer will vse these Obseruations, not neglecting those, which I haue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deliuered in the former <hi>Sections,</hi> as <hi>Antiscorbutica,</hi> to preuent the <hi>Seuruy,</hi> hee may rest assuredly not to become infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now for the poorer sort, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are not able to prouide themselues of the premisses, they may eyther purge themselues with those <hi>Pils</hi> called <hi>Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogon</hi> in the precedent <hi>Section</hi> described, or take three graines of <hi>Stibium</hi> in a cup of Beere steeped and beaten to powder, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery second day for a weeke together. And to preuent the <hi>Scuruy,</hi> wee haue tryed in <hi>New-found land,</hi> that the tops and leaues of Turneps, or Radish being boyled, is a soueraigne helpe. And also that Neetle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seede, and Hony, with a little Wormwood is expedient.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Goose-dung being mixed with Meale and Butter, will serue for a <hi>Pultes</hi> to the tumours or outward griefes, caused through this sicknesse to abate the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11825:45"/>
inflammations, and the spots, and vlcers; yea, and if their stomackes could away with the loathsome taste with a few <hi>cloues</hi> in drinke, it will cure the <hi>Scuruy</hi> sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely, as they in <hi>Zealand</hi> haue often tryed.</p>

               <p>But there is one Sicknesse more, which rightly may be stiled the Northerre Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, crept among vs within these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares, the sinne of Drunkennesse, brought hither out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> which beares such sway, that few merite the name of Gallants, or sociable Creatures, vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, that they shall not vexe their Neighbours with Law-suites, vntill they be released and become new men: Or else, that they shall stand as persons Out-lawed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Excommunicated out of true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Society.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, and because Seruants in most of our Gentries Houses are also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Pestilent abhomination, it were fit, that they build new Cellars neere their Parlours, where their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Eye might curbe them, if they meete not with sober Butlers to restraine them.</p>
               <p>In these latter times people are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so besotted with this abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vice, that no Admonition can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle to with-draw them from it: Whereas in times past the very sight of a Drunkard was as rare as a Goblins; Yea, and if it chanced that any one were but seene reeling in the Streetes, the very Boyes would whoote, and laugh him to scorne, vntill such time as the Magistrate or the Gouernour came, and brought him to the Stockes, or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to prison.</p>
               <p>But now it is growne so common, that they account it a glorious Act,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11825:52"/>
and the Musick must play while the health goes round.</p>
               <p>It is recorded, that the godly <hi>Mouica</hi> the mother of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> beeing but once vpbrayded by a Seruant in the house, that she loued the Wine bottle, she took it for such a disgrace, that neuer after shee dranke one drop of Wine more, as long as shee liued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Platerus</hi> makes mention in his practize of Physicke, that hee knew a Noble-man who being diseased of the Goute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his Physitian that his drinking of Wine and strong Liquor had caused his infirmity, he made a vowe neuer to drink any such Liquor more, which hee religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously kept, and in the stead thereof drank nothing but small Cider, or Veriuice. Whereby he was quite cured of the Gout, without any other Medicine.</p>
               <p>The like I haue heard of an Hydropicke person, who hauing experimented, that drinke produced and augmented his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, hee resolued neuer to drinke more, but contenting himselfe with Broathes, and the like moyst suppings, hee was neuer after-wards troubled with the Dropsie.</p>

To draw our <hi>Newlanders Cure</hi> now to a Period, let mee intreate all them, which haue any feeling of Sobriety, and of the necessity, wherein our Christian Common wealth stands at this present time, to lay aside their captious Criticismes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping censures, together with their need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Feasts, and in good earnest to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace my Counsell in some measure, if they cannot as yet apply their wills to the stint, which is heere prescribed. I know the impediment proceedes of Custome, and this Custome can hardly bee altered, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Spirit of God will co-operate,) without some offence to concupiscence. Such is the lamentable obstinacy of many hare-brain'd worldlings now a dayes, that Parents cannot without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with-draw their owne Bowels from following their boone Companions, and roaring Gallants, whose conuersation but for a few dayes they haue frequented. How much harder then is it to diswade men from those prouocations, which from their Childe-hood they haue continued?
