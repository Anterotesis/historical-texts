            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A COMMENTARY VP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON THE EPISTLE OF S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> to PHILEMON.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Epistle hath beene que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, as well as others, yea, above others. There were some in St. <hi>Chrysostomes,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, that would have it to be quite wiped out of the sacred Canon; two motives indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to it: the brevitie of it for the manner; the levitie of it for the matter.</p>
            <p>A short thing, not worth the reading: then away with the LORDS prayer: with some of the small Prophets, <hi>Abdie, Nabum, Sephonie.</hi> Who art thou that despisest the day of small things? <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.10. There was a little Citie, and a wise poore man in it. So here is a little Epistle: and a wise poore man in it,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9.14.</note> namely <hi>Onesimus,</hi> whom God made rich in faith, and in the graces of the spirit. Our little Sister, sayes the Church, must not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; He that made the <hi>Camell</hi> and the <hi>Elephant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 8.8.</note> made the <hi>Ant</hi> and the <hi>Bee</hi> too: The same <hi>God</hi> is Author of little Epistles, as well as of great, they be all <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, inspired from above by God: God made <hi>Pella</hi> as well as <hi>Hierusalem. Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar,</hi> is it not a little one? Let my soule fly thither and live: this Epistle is but a little one, yet fly hither and your soule shall live; Ye shall find much heavenly foode in it: the shorter the way is, the sooner it may be gone: the shorter the Epistle is, the sooner it may be read: therefore read it to the comfort and instruction of you all.</p>
            <p>The second thing that displeased them, was the levitie of it, for the matter of the Epistle: trifling things are handled in it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:12681:16"/>1. It was written <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for one man: that good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard left 99. sheepe in the Wildernesse and sought up one.<note place="margin">Luk. 15.4.</note> One soule is to bee saved,<note place="margin">Iac. 1.20.</note> being more worth than a world. One man is Gods Image, and our brother: therefore not to be neglected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For a base man. 1. A servant, CHRIST tooke on him the forme of a servant.<note place="margin">Philip. 2.7. Gal. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>In saeculo</hi> there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Master and a servant; <hi>In Christo equall.</hi> CHRIST died for servants as well as for masters. <hi>Saul</hi> sought his fathers Asses: and should not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seeke up Gods servant? 2. A <hi>fugitive:</hi> the prodigall sonne was a <hi>fugitive,</hi> yet his father embraced him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reduced him <hi>à fugâ,</hi> from his flight, and caused him to flie to Christ with the wing of faith, he lost his earthly master and found an heavenly master, as <hi>Saul</hi> seeking Asses lighted on a kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A thiefe, he stole from his Master, I but he did not continue a thiefe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a blasphemer and a persecutour, the good thiefe was with CHRIST in Paradise: the young man which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> commended to the Bishop became a thiefe, a master thiefe: yet Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> went to him in his owne person, and reduced him to CHRIST againe: this thiefe became a good Spirituall thiefe, one of those that did <hi>rapere regnum Caelorum:</hi> therefore this Historie is worth the reading.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.13. Luk. 9.52.</note>2. There be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in it, matters of small importance: as Verse 22. he is sollicitous for his lodging: so he is for his cloake: and <hi>Christ</hi> sent messengers to provide a lodging for him, therefore away with the Gospell of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and the 2. to <hi>Timothie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Epistle is to be considered. 1. The gate or entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it. 2. The house it selfe, or substance of the Epistle Verse 4. An entrance is made into it by a wise, a Christian, a loving, an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent salutation, where. 1. The persons concurring in it. 2. The blessings wished in it. 3. The persons are saluting, or saluted: the person saluting is described by his owne name: by his masters badge or Liverie.</p>
            <p>His name is <hi>Paul,</hi> his Hebrew name was <hi>Saul:</hi> he was an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> King <hi>Saul</hi> and hee were of one Tribe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> is a little name: and being the Apostle of the Gentiles hee takes most delight in that. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> supposeth he tooke this name of <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the <hi>proconsull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> 
               <hi>tanquam à primo ecclesiae spolio,</hi> as of the first spoile among the Gentiles, which he tooke out of the Devils mouth: as <hi>Scipio</hi> was called <hi>Africanus</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> which he subdued, and <hi>Metellus Creticus,</hi> Creete which he conquered: so he was called <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> whom he converted.</p>
            <p>There may be some probabilitie of it, but Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is rather to be embraced.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm</hi> 42. <hi>de Ver. Apost.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Paulus. i. e. modicus, pusillus: de Saulo Paulus, de superbo modicus immò minimus,</hi> as he interprets his owne name, <hi>minimus apostolorum,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> l5.9. It is <hi>nomen hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatis</hi> a name of humilitie; in that we must all be <hi>Pauls,</hi> having a base and lowly opinion of our selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:12681:16"/>In the next place he is described by his masters badge or livery: not the Apostle of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> but the prisoner of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which is greater <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there can bee no greater thing to glorie of than this.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrys.</hi>
               </note> Some may be the Apostles of IESUS CHRIST, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, yet not the prisoner of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> the Apostles themselves gloried in this,<note place="margin">Act. 5.41.</note> that they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>He uses this title to mollifie the heart of <hi>Philemon,</hi> and to make it more inclinable to his suit for <hi>Onesimus:</hi> hee must needs have an heart of iron, that denies the request of a poore prisoner, and the prisoner of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>There bee <hi>vincti diaboli, &amp; vincti Iesu Christi. Zedekiah</hi> was a prisoner, bound in chaines by the King of <hi>Babel.</hi> He was impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for rebellion, not for religion; <hi>Barabbas</hi> was a famous prisoner, as we say <hi>famosum scortum.</hi> He was against Christ, not for Christ. The good thiefe on the Crosse was a prisoner, yet not for Christ, but for his owne evill deeds; we receive worthie of that we have done;<note place="margin">Luk. 23.41.</note> though Christ in mercy had compassion on him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iesuits</hi> have alwayes boasted of their bonds, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and martyrdome, as they did in <hi>Wisbich</hi> Castle, in <hi>Fremingam</hi> Castle, and in other places they were <hi>vincti Papae, non Christi:</hi> The Popes, not Christs prisoners. All <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> dayes, all KING <hi>Iames</hi> his dayes, all <hi>King</hi> CHARLES his dayes never any was imprisoned or put to death simplie for Religion; if they could have kept their fingers out of treason, they might have kept their neckes out of the halter. I would they would listen to that of <hi>Cyprian, ardeant licet flammis,</hi>

               </note> what though they give their bodies to be burnt, though they be cast to Wild beasts, <hi>non erit illa fidei Corona, sed paena perfidiae; non religiosae virtutis exitus gloriosus, sed desperatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis interitus</hi>; that is, not the Crowne of Faith, but the punishment of perfidiousnesse; not the glorious end of religious vertue, but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable destruction of desperation.</p>

               <hi>Catharinus</hi> being himselfe a Bishop, is not afraid to say, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon vir saecularis,</hi> a secular man, shall rise up in judgement against us the Prelates of the Church, who had turned his house into a Church. A worthie patterne for all to imitate! There is much crying for reformation: let every man reforme himselfe, and every house-holder his familie: then soone would there be an happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Church and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>We have had the persons in the salutation: there remaines now the matter of it: which conteines in it three things. <hi>Donum, dato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, mediatorem,</hi> the gift, the giver, the Mediatour. The gift is double; <hi>primum &amp; ultimum:</hi> the first, which is grace: the last, which is peace: the one is <hi>causa &amp; fons bonorum,</hi> the cause and fountaine of all good things: the other <hi>finis &amp; perfectio bonorum,</hi> the end and perfection of them all.</p>
            <p>Grace first, the undeserved love and favour of God. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are out of favour with him: the children of wrath. All have sinned, and all stand in need of the favour of God.</p>
            <p>It is a sweet thing to have the favour of Princes, yet that is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> had <hi>Davids</hi> favour: but he was wounde out of favour. <hi>Athanasius</hi> had the favour of <hi>Constantine,</hi> but he lost it. 1. God is immutable, not so much as a shadow of turning in him. 2. They can pleasure us but with fading things: God with durable. 3. They dye: God lives for ever. 4. They can doe us no pleasure, when we be dead: God can, for all live to him: he can raise us up
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12681:19"/>
againe, and set us in heavenly places with Christ; let us all sue for his favour.</p>
            <p>The next is peace, flowing from the other. 1. All kinde of prosperitie, especially the peace of Conscience, that surpasseth all.</p>
            <p>There is the worlds peace, that worldlings have: their eyes sticke out by reason of fatnesse: they are not in trouble as other men, they have more than heart can wish: they dye, and that peace dyes with them.</p>
            <p>There is CHRISTS peace:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> being justified by faith wee have peace with God, through IESUS CHRIST our LORD. That is the comfortable peace indeede; Is it peace, <hi>Iehu,</hi> said <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram?</hi> What peace, when as the Witchcrafts and Adulteries of thy Mother <hi>Iezebel,</hi> are yet in great number?

            <p>CHRIST is the Conduct pipe, whereby all blessings are conveyed to us: he is the heyre of all; we Coheyres by him: hee is primarily beloved; we secondarily, in him and for him. As the oyntment powred on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, went downe to his beard and the skirts of his garment: So the oyle of gladnesse powred on Christ our head, came downe from him to us all: we have nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, he is to be magnified for all.</p>

The excellent graces wherewith GOD had adorned him: where there is 1. <hi>Fama bonorum,</hi> the report of them. 2. <hi>enumeratio bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> an enumeration of them. 3. <hi>Objecta eorum,</hi> the objects of them.</p>
               <p>For the fame or report, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heard of them: an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hearing, from <hi>Phrygia</hi> to Rome, sayes <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things that are wont to be carried in the Wagon of fame; bad and good: the one swiftly, the other slowly: the one lamely, the other lustily: of the one we shall heare all, and more than all: and scant halfe of the other; as it fell out in the Wisedome of <hi>Salomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What did he heare? His love and faith: where is hope then? <hi>tanquam media in ijs intelligitur,</hi> sayes <hi>Aquin.</hi> as a midle vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both, it is comprehended in both.<note place="margin">Bern. <hi>in Psal.</hi> 91. <hi>Ser.</hi> 10.</note> These three in a golden chaine are linked together: faith sayes, <hi>parata sunt mihi magna</hi>; great things are prepared for me: hope sayes, <hi>mihi servantur mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> great things are reserved for me: love sayes, <hi>curro ad illa magna</hi>; I make hast to those great things.</p>
               <p>But why hath' love the precedencie? Love is the daughter; faith the mother: and must the daughter bee placed above the Mother? It is so: 1. Because it is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> drift in this whole Epistle, to procure PHILEMONS love to <hi>Onesimus.</hi> 2. Because love is <hi>Notior Nobis,</hi> better knowne to us then faith, which is more hid and secret.</p>
               <p>These are illustrated by their objects; CHRIST and the Saints. The Papists refer both to both objects: whereupon they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre. As we love God and the Saints too: So we must believe in God and in the Saints too: yet diversely; in God <hi>principaliter,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; in the Saints <hi>consequenter,</hi> consequently.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:12681:22"/>There is no consequence in this argument: for God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to love all; but he hath not commanded us to believe in all: that hee hath reserved as a regall prerogative to himselfe; and his glory he will not give to another. He sayes, owe nothing to any man, save love: but he doth not say, owe nothing to any man, save to believe in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here the Apostle speakes of living Saints, to whom <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> extended his liberalitie: now the Papists will not have us to believe in living Saints, but in dead Saints: therefore this place makes not for them.</p>

               <p>As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heard of PHILEMONS faith and love: So it were to be wished, that all the world might ring of our faith and love: these be necessary for all Christians: faith in the first place; love in the second: <hi>nec palmes sine vite, nec virtus sine fide:</hi> there can be no branch without the Vine;<note place="margin">Bern. <hi>in Cant. Ser.</hi> 30.</note> no vertue, no not love without faith. Faith makes a Christian, love makes and showes a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. No CHRIST, no heaven; no faith, no CHRIST. Faith is the hand that layes hold on CHRIST. The high <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> gave a strait charge,<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. ult.</note> that if any knew where CHRIST

Would yee faine take him, sayes <hi>Augustine?</hi> I will tell you where he is,<note place="margin">In Ioh. <hi>tract.</hi> 50.</note> and how yee may take him. He is in heaven, there ye may take him. <hi>Sed quomodo mittam manum in Coelum, ut ibi sedentem capiam?</hi> How shall I send my hand into heaven, to take him? <hi>mitte fidem, &amp; tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti.</hi> Send thy faith thither, and thou hast taken him. By faith we apprehend him and all his benefits: by faith we put on CHRIST as a garment, wherewith our sinnes are covered from the sight of God: and as <hi>Iacob</hi> got the blessing in the clothes of his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so doe we get heaven, clothed with Christ;<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.1.</note> like the Woman clothed with the Sun.</p>
               <p>CHRIST dwelleth in our hearts by faith. O happie house,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.17.</note> where the Sonne of God dwelleth! Faith is the victory,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.4. Rom. 8.37.</note> whereby we overcome the world: we are more than Conquerours through him, that hath loved us. Insomuch that we may take up that trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant song; <hi>O death where is thy sting?</hi> Hell, <hi>where is thy victory? the strength of death is sinne: the strength of sin is the Law: but thankes be to God through Iesus Christ,</hi> that hath delivered us from you all. By Faith <hi>Moses</hi> saw him which is invisible!<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.27.</note> by faith wee see the joyes of heaven, and Christ standing at the right hand of GOD, ready to receive us into them: he that believeth, hath eternall life;<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. ult.</note> he is as it were in heaven already: therefore let us be suiters to God, because faith is the gift of GOD, to bestow it where it is not, and to encrease it, where it is: yea let us all pray for the faith of Iob; <hi>though thou kill me, I will believe in thee.</hi>

               <p>It is an axiome with the Papists, that <hi>faith</hi> may be without love:<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>In ep.

               <p>But a justifying faith cannot; he that is perswaded of the love of God towards him in Christ, <hi>God so loved the world, &amp;c.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but love the brethren, and members of Christ.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.1.</note>

                  <hi>and have not love; I am as sounding brasse, and as a tinkling Cymball: though I had the gift of Prophecie, and knew all secrets and all knowledge; If I had all faith, that I could remove mountaines, and had not love; I were nothing: Though I feede the poore with all my goods, and giue my body to be burned, and have not love; it profiteth me nothing.</hi> So though I talke of Religion with a silver, yea with an Angelicall tongue; though I goe (which is the glory of many) to never so many Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, heare Sermons, receive Communions, and have not love; I am nothing.</p>

                  <hi>I beseech thee:</hi> he repeats the word againe.</p>
               <p>Not for thy servant, but for my Sonne.</p>
               <p>What Sonne? Not <hi>Adoptatus,</hi> but <hi>Genitus</hi>; not adopted, but begotten. Where? Not in a pulpit in the Church, but in a prison, where I am in bonds. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then was <hi>Onesimus</hi> his father: not naturall, but spirituall: and we are more beholden to our Spirituall, then to our naturall fathers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They beget us of a woman: these of the Church, which is the spouse of CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They beget us of mortall seed, therfore we dye: these of the immortall seed of the word of GOD, whereby wee live for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They beget us to a temporall life: these to an eternall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They to the miseries of the world: these to the joyes of the world to come. Therefore let us love them, <hi>let us have them in singular love for their workes sake.</hi> As <hi>Alexander</hi> professed, he was more beholden to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> then <hi>Philip:</hi> the one gave him <hi>esse,</hi> being, the other his <hi>benè esse,</hi> his well being. Yet this is little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of.</p>
               <p>On the other side, our spirituall children should be as deare, yea dearer to us,<note place="margin">Amb. <hi>Offic. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> then our naturall: <hi>non minùs vos diligo, quos in Evangelio genui, quàm si ex conjugio suscepissem</hi>; I love you no lesse, whom I have begotten by the Gospell, then if I had begotten you in marriage. 1. The love of grace must be more vehement than the love of nature. 2. Our naturall children are to abide with us but for a time: those for ever.</p>

                  </note>The place where he begat him, is not to be pretermitted: <hi>in his bonds:</hi> which <hi>Hierom</hi> wonders at: <hi>tenetur in carcere, vinculis stringitur; squalore corporis, charorum separatione, paenalibus tenebris coarctatur:</hi> hee is kept in prison, bound in chaines, he is molested

with unsavoury smels, yea even with the ill usage of his owne body, with separation from friends, with the darkenesse of the prisons: yet now hee preaches, now he labours to convert soules to Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> begate the Gaoler in prison. CHRIST begate the thiefe on the Crosse, in the midst of all his paines. And shall not we that beat libertie, strive to winne many unto CHRIST, that we may say with the Prophet, <hi>Here am I, and the Children that thou hast given me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when did he beget this sonne of his? when he was <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>aged: Ideo<expan>

Because he begate him in his old age. So did Saint <hi>Paul O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesimus.</hi> What was <hi>Onesimus</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> begate? A servant, a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, and a thiefe too: yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> disdained not to preach to him. God hath his chosen among all: among harlots, as <hi>Rahab:</hi> among Publicans, as <hi>Zacheus:</hi> among the Pharisees, as <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> among Persecutors, as <hi>Paul:</hi> among thieves, as the young man whom S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> recalled: among poore distressed servants,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus:</hi> therefore let us preach to all.</p>
               <p>The other thing on the part of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> is his happy change. Where is to be considered. 1. What he was. 2. What he is: hee was <hi>to thee unprofitable,</hi> in being unfaithfull in thy service, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyning from thee: but now is profitable to thee, and mee: to thee; <hi>pro te orando,</hi> by praying for thee: to mee; <hi>mihi ministrando,</hi>

               <p>There must be an alteration in us all. <hi>Such were some of you:</hi>

               <p n="2">2 Here it is apparant, that debts are to be paid. Rather than <hi>Philemon</hi> should bee unpaid, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will pay him: a matter of greater moment than we are aware of. 1. It must be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our living and maintenance. When the Prophet had made a bountifull provision of Oile for the poore Widdow,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 4.7.</note> he gives her this charge; go sell the Oile, pay them thou art in debt unto; and live thou and thy children of the rest. We may not live, wee, and our children, on that, which is another mans: that is an unlawfull living, and Gods blessing cannot be expected on it. 2. GOD will have his owne worship to give place unto it; <hi>I will have mercy, not sacrifice.</hi> We may not sacrifice to GOD of that which is another mans. The <hi>Athenians</hi> came to <hi>Phocion</hi> for money towards a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne sacrifice; to whom he returned this answer: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. It were a shame for me to give to you, and not to pay this man, (pointing out his creditor) that which I owe him. GOD will have thee to serve him with thine owne, not with that which is other mens: yet small reckoning is made of it. We goe a borrowing with <hi>Asahels</hi> feet: a paying with <hi>Mephibosheths.

               <p>They are content to goe so farre with <hi>Pilate,</hi> as to acknowledge their hand writing; what I have written, I have written: but they will not say, what I have written, I will performe.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was of another minde; as he gave him his hand for the payment, so he gives him his heart and faithfull promise to pay it: <hi>I will repay it.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>These be they that send commendations to him, whom he dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies with this Title: my <hi>Fellow-labourers,</hi> or <hi>Fellow-workemen</hi>: Some in the calling of Christianity: some in the calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry too. Both are workes, both are labours. <hi>Nomen Christiani est nomen operis,</hi> sayes S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the office of a Bishop,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.1.</note> desires a <hi>worthy worke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here a common place of salutations doth not only salute us, but inviteth us unto it. In Greeke, saluting is a kinde of imbracing; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because whom we salute we embrace with the armes of love: or at the least pretend it. In Latine, <hi>Salutare est salutem op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare,</hi> to salute, is to wish health and prosperity to the parties whom we salute.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> are not onely unchristian, but uncivill also to condemne salutations.<note place="margin">2 Reg. 4.29.</note> Indeed, <hi>Elisha</hi> willed his man, that if he met
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:12681:37"/>
with any, he should not salute him:<note place="margin">Luk. 10.4.</note> and CHRIST charges his Disciples to salute none by the way.<note place="margin">Iudic. 6.12. Luk. 1.28.</note> Those were in matters of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary importance, which required great expedition: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we may, and ought to salute.</p>
               <p>Angels salute. The Lord is with thee thou valiant man, sayes hee to <hi>Gideon:</hi> hayle <hi>Mary</hi> freely beloved, sayes <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Blessed <hi>Virgin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CHRIST would not have his Apostles to be so unmannerly,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.12.</note> to goe into an house, and not to salute it: he himselfe salutes after his resurrection: <hi>peace be unto you. Saul</hi> went forth to meet <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24.36. 1 Sam. 13.10.</note> and saluted him. Though <hi>Nabal</hi> was a churle and a foole too, yet <hi>David</hi> would not deale so foolishly with him, as not to salute him.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus shall you say,</hi> for salutation. There is a sweet eccho of saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betweene <hi>Boaz</hi> and his reapers: <hi>the Lord be with you,</hi> sayes he:<note place="margin">Ruth. 2.4. 1 Sam. 30.21</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord blesse thee,</hi> say they. <hi>David</hi> saluted his souldiers. The greatest thinke no scorne to salute the meanest.</p>
               <p>I but whom must we salute? All. We must love all, pray for all, even for our very enemies. Now saluting is nothing else save an intimation of love, a kind of praying and well wishing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must salute all. I but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gives us other counsell:<note place="margin">Ioh. ep. 2. v. 10</note> If any come to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not to house, neither bid him God speed: We must not vouchsafe him a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We must distinguish betweene gods enemies and our owne: if they be notorious, open professed adversaries to CHRIST, as those were, we ought not to afford them a kind salutation: nay if an Angell from heaven should preach any other doctrine,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> we should hold him accursed. But if they be secret adversaries and unknowne, it is not impiety to salute them. Some are so rigid that they will not salute a stranger, because they know not whereabout he goes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is repugnant to charity. Love thinketh not evill:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.5. v. 7.</note> it belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all things. It is greater charity in things doubtfull to believe the best, then the worst.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Aristotle,</hi> being reproved for giving an almes to a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, answered, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Laert.</hi>
                  </note> I had compassion of the man, not of his manners: so wee salute the man, not his life; we bid the man, God speed, not his actions.</p>
               <p>But how are we to salute? 1. For the externall manner, by word of mouth, or by writing. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> omits salutations in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one of his <hi>Epistles:</hi> but in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. he is most plentifull in them: So is <hi>Ignatius.</hi>

               <p>Commendations are requisite in our letters, if they bee not made commendations, matters of course not greatly regarded.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

The end of salutations is, the preservation of love,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.49 1 Cor. 16.20.</note> which by all good meanes had need to bee maintained by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and a demonstration of the respect we have one of another.</p>

               <p>THe last branch of the conclusion is, a Valediction or fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well: hee takes his leave with a short, yet a sweet prayer: where, 1. There is the substance of it, then the sealing of it. In the substance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Res optata,</hi> the thing wished or prayed for, which is grace, love, mercy, favour. Grace must be <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of every worke. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> began with it, and he ends with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Cujus sit gratia,</hi> whose grace it is: of our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> which hath brought us into grace and love with God, who before were his enemies and out of grace: which hath graciously redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from sinne, death, hell and damnation; and hath opened to us the doores of the kingdome of heaven.</p>

            <head>A COMMENTARY VPON THE EPISTLE OF S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> PAUL to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, the inscription of the Epistle. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the substance of it. In the Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there are foure things: 1. What it is which is written: 2. Who wrote it: 3. In what tongue he wrote it: 4. To whom it was written. Two of them are expressed, and two of them are necessarily to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>The thing written is an Epistle, that which is sent. If wee cannot goe to men, and speake to them by word of mouth, we may send a Letter to them, and speake to them by writing. The Author of this Epistle, at this time could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently goe to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> therefore he writeth to them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, who wrote it: there is great controversie about that: some, and those very learned and godly men, will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that this is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Because it wanteth S. <hi>Pauls</hi> hand and seale,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 3.17.</note> The salutation of me <hi>Paul,</hi> with my owne hands, this I write in all my Epistles. S. <hi>Paul</hi> is wont to put his name to all his Epistles; this hath not St. <hi>Pauls</hi> name, neither in the beginning nor in the ending; neither in the forehead, nor in the foot. Therefore it is none of S. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that is easily answered. In wisdome, hee concealed his name, <hi>Quia fuit Iudaeis exosum, etiam ad fidem conversis</hi>; if they had seene his name, they would have hurled away his Epistle, because they tooke him to be an enemie to the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They cannot be induced to thinke that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this Epistle,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> because he puts himselfe in the Catalogue of them that were the Apostles Schollers: whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> is wont to stand upon his credit and reputation in that behalfe; that he learned nothing of any man; that he was nothing inferiour to the chiefe of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>But either he may speake that by way of rhetoricall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, usuall with Orators and Divines too, to assume that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12681:39"/>
which is proper to them to whom he speaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. yet hee did not thinke that he and the Corinthians should live till that change, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ad nostrum tempus.</hi> So that for modesty sake he may include himselfe: that hee speakes in the person of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Iewes, to whom the Gospell was confirmed by the Apostles miracles, and the receiving of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost: or else (which is the soundest answer) he doth not affirme that he learned his doctrine from the Apostles, but that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him by the Apostles miracles: and so without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, it might bee ratified by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe. But I thinke though it be not much materiall, it may be evinced by strong arguments to be writtten by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is as cleare as the noone day, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.1.</note>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the same people that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did, but Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wrote both his Epistles to the Hebrewes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to them. Now either that writing of his is fallen to the ground, which is not like, so small an Epistle as that to <hi>Philemon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reserved, or else this is the Epistle, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> avoucheth he wrote to the Hebrewes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inscription in all Greeke copies, save one, beareth the name of <hi>Paul.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The phrases used in this Epistle are cousin Germanes to them that are in other of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles: especially in those to the <hi>Rom: Philip.</hi> and <hi>Coloss.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath in other of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles as lofty phrases as any be in this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The method is alike: for as in the rest of his Epistles. 1. He unfoldeth the doctrine of salvation purchased by CHRIST: and then exhorteth to a godly life: so he doth in this.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All the Greeke Fathers with one voyce acknowledge it to be <hi>Pauls. Clem. Alexand. Chrys. Theoph. Basil. Theodoret</hi> and the rest: yea and though the Latine Church for a time repelled this Epistle, yet the chiefest of the Latine Fathers, as <hi>Augustine, Hierome, Ambrose</hi> confesse it to be <hi>Pauls.</hi> That of <hi>Athanasius</hi> is most famous: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>—since the Gospell of CHRIST hath beene published to the world, this hath beene received for <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle. So that, though the matter be not weighty, it seemes most probable to be Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi> Whosoever was the pipe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to us, the Holy Ghost, as appeareth by the heavenly doctrine conteined in it, was the fountaine from whence it was derived: therefore let it be reverently embraced by all.</p>
            <p>The third question is, in what tongue it was written. Some are of opinion, in Hebrew, and afterwards translated into Greeke by <hi>Luke, Barnabas</hi> or <hi>Clemens:</hi> but it seemes that it was never written in Hebrew.</p>
            <p>If S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other had written this in the Hebrew tongue, he would not have cited the testimonies of the old Testament out of the 70. but out of the Hebrew text: yet it is a common thing with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12681:39"/>
the writer of this Epistle, to alleadge the testimonies of the Old Testament out of the 70. interpreters: therefore undoubtedly hee wrote in Greeke, not in Hebrew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though he wrote to the Romans, which at that time were Lords of all the world, yet he wrote not in the Latine, but in the Greeke tongue to them: because the Latine tongue was inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the compasse of a few regions, and the Greeke was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of all nations: for that cause the Apostles wrote in Greek, and not in the peculiar tongue of any nation.</p>
            <p>Though he wrote to the Hebrews, yet he would not write in the Hebrew tongue, but in the Greeke, that all the world might reape benefit by it, as well as them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If he had written in Hebrew, it is not like the Church should have beene deprived of the originall fountaine: By all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was written in the Greeke tongue.</p>
            <p>The last thing to bee discussed is the persons to whom it was written.</p>
            <p>The name of Hebrewes was more generall then the name of Iewes, for that flowed from one tribe, the tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> they were called Iewes: but from whom had they the name of Hebrewes? Many both old and new wryters affirme, of Heber, that is mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.21.</p>
            <p>Yet it seemeth not to be so.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This title of these Hebrewes is no where adscribed to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or his posterity, but it is often applyed to <hi>Abram</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
            <p>One told <hi>Abram</hi> the Hebrew;<note place="margin">Gen. 14.13.39, 17.43, 32.</note> why hast thou brought this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew to mock me, saies <hi>Potiphars</hi> Wife of <hi>Ioseph?</hi> It is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to eate with the Hebrewes. <hi>Abram</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity are called Hebrews: we do not read that Heber and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny were. It comes rather from <hi>Abram,</hi> then from Heber.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Iewes boast often that they are <hi>Abrams</hi> seed, never that they were Hebers seed. <hi>Abram</hi> was their father, not Heber.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In their owne tongue they be called <hi>(gnibrim) transeuntes,</hi> of <hi>gnabar,</hi> because <hi>Abram</hi> their father passed over the river out of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> into <hi>Canaan.</hi> So that they have their appellation from <hi>Abram,</hi> not from Heber: as of <hi>Iudah</hi> they were called <hi>Iudaei</hi>; so of <hi>Abram Hebraei:</hi> for <hi>Aleph</hi> is a gutturall. Thus yee see of whom they had the name of Hebrewes.</p>
            <p>To them was this Epistle written, and in them to us that bee English men, and to all Christian people in the world: that which I say to you, sayes CHRIST, I say to all, watch:<note place="margin">Mark. 13.37.</note> So that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Hebrews, he writeth to us all: therefore let us all with reverence attend to it.</p>
            <p>So much of the inscription. Now let us come to the substance of the Epistle. It is divided, as all others, into two parts. 1. The doctrine of Christianity which wee are to learne. 2. The life of Christians which we are to live.</p>

               </list>
               <p>For the matter of the doctrine, it was dispensed to them at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, divided into many parts: that is the nature of the Greek word. It was given them by piece meale, now a part, then a part. They had one part of it in <hi>Adams</hi> time, another in <hi>Noahs:</hi> one in <hi>Abrahams,</hi> an other in <hi>Moses</hi> time: one in <hi>Davids</hi> time, another in <hi>Ieremies, Isaiah</hi>'s, and the rest of the Prophets. It was parcelled out to them, as the capacity of the people in sundry times did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: but we have the doctrine of salvation at one lump propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us, in one whole and entyre Summe. Thus God hath dealt more graciously and bountifully with us. They had one flower now, and another anon: we have all the flowers in Gods garden sweetly smelling all at once in our nostrills. They had now a loafe and then a loafe: now a draught and then a draught of the Lords Wine: the whole <hi>Magazen</hi> of God Almighty is opened to us. Then how thankfull ought we to be to God above them? And how carefull should we be to enrich our selves with these heavenly wares, that may freely enter the whole store-house of the Lord of hoasts?</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the manner: God delivered his will to them after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse manners; to <hi>Abraham</hi> by Angels, in the shape of men; to <hi>Moses</hi> in a bush and a cloud; to <hi>Samuel</hi> in a dreame; to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in visions: by the oracles and answers of the Priests, in a soft winde,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12681:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to <hi>Elias,</hi> by thunder, &amp;c. To us he hath delivered his will in one manner, by the sweet and comfortable voice, by the powerfull and majesticall voice of his owne Sonne: never man spake as he, which taught in the streets of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and of <hi>Iudea</hi> in his owne person, and after his resurrection and ascension, he sent his Apostles abroad, as his Legats and Deputies into all the world. This one manner, farre surpassed all the manners, whereby <hi>God</hi> spake to them. Those were darke and obscure; this plaine: many of those were terrible to the hearers, insomuch, as they ranne to <hi>Moses</hi> and desired that he might speake to them, not <hi>God,</hi> lest they died; this was a most milde and amiable manner; <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavie laden, &amp;c.</hi> He stood with unfolded armes ready to imbrace them; he spread forth his wings as a loving Hen, to gather all as chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. We are to magnifie <hi>God</hi> for this one manner whereby he now speaketh to us. Variety doth delight, yet it is not alwayes the best. The World was in best case, when they had but one Tongue, Speech and Language. Variety of tongues in respect of the Originall, was but a curse on mankinde: and it is far better now with the Church, since Almighty <hi>God</hi> began to speake to us after one manner by his Sonne, than when he spake after so diverse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners under the Law. Therefore let us be thankfull for it, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the voice of his Sonne.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For the time; he spake to them in old time, in the first and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest age of the world; he speakes to us in a new time, when all are made new by our Saviour CHRIST. It was said by them of old times, sayes CHRIST, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21.27. But I say to you, this new time wherin all things are made greene, fresh and flourishing by our SAVIOUR CHRIST, is far more excellent than that old time of the world.</p>

                  </gap>: GOD spake in them, moving their hearts and tongues, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.21. The Prophesie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of GOD spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. It is not you that speake, but the spirit of your Father which speaketh in you: not in those alone that wrote, but in all from <hi>Adam, Ier.</hi> 7.25. whereof some were of the bloud-royall, as <hi>Isaiah.</hi> Some of the Priests, as <hi>Ieremie.</hi> Some of the common people, as <hi>Amos.</hi> GOD spake in them to the Fathers, not in the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> alone, but in all. But our estate is farre more excellent: he spake to them by the Prophets, which indeed were rare and singular men, worthy to be had in high price and estimation: yet not worthy to be named with CHRIST by whom he speaketh to us.</p>
               <p>They were men; <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom <hi>God</hi> speaks to us, is GOD and Man: they were wise, could foretell things to come, aptly and pithily interpret the Word of GOD, yet all their wisdome and knowledge was borrowed; <hi>Christ</hi> was wise of himselfe, clad with

his owne feathers; they mortall and corruptible, dust and ashes; CHRIST never saw corruption, but abideth for ever and ever; they were servants in the House of <hi>God; Christ</hi> is the Sonne, yea, the <hi>Lord</hi> and owner of the house. Therefore wonderfully hath <hi>God</hi> honoured us in the time of the Gospell, above them in the time of the Law. If a King should speake to us by one of his Privie Councell, it is much: but if he speak to us by his sonne and heire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the Crowne, it is a greater dignity.

               <p>In this the Old and New Testament are equall; <hi>God</hi> is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them both. <hi>God</hi> spake by the Prophets then, and he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now by his Ministers. The word of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the burthen of the <hi>Lord,</hi>

                  <p>WE have seene the estate of them in the time of the Law. Now let us take a view of our condition under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</p>
                  <p>Theirs were the first dayes; ours be the last. In those that were the first dayes, some new Doctrine was daily to be expected: but in these last dayes, GOD hath opened to us his whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, there is no mint of any new Doctrine to be looked for; now nothing but the second comming of our SAVIOUR CHRIST is to be expected, which hath revealed the whole will of his Father to us. If an Angel from Heaven preach any other Doctrine, than that which wee have received in these last dayes, let him bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In the last dayes there is greatest aboundance of knowledge. <hi>In the last dayes I will powre out my Spirit on all flesh.</hi>

Therefore if we be ignorant, our condemnation shall be the greater: as GOD knowes, a number of ignorant persons are in this glorious light of the Gospell; yea, in those Towns where the Candle of <hi>Gods</hi> Word hath shined brightly, these many yeares together. The preaching of the Word is a well of water, but we will not come with our buckets to fetch water at this Well: or if we doe, we come with riven buckets, the water runs out by and by.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 These last dayes wherein we live, are the most dangerous: sinne overfloweth with a full streame.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1.</note> In the last dayes perillous times shall come. Never did sin shew her selfe with such a brazen face as it doth now: Men now stick not to set themselves against the Word of GOD it selfe, to call the authority of the Scripture in question, whether all things be true in it or not? To band them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the Preachers, if not openly, yet secretly, and to pull downe, if possible, the Church it selfe: these be the last times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live; GOD keepe us in them by his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Seeing they be the last dayes, let us not be so much in love with them. Will any be bestowing great cost on his house the last day, when he is to goe out of it? These are the last dayes of the world, wherein we are ready to be turned out of the house of this world: therefore let us not be inflamed too much with the love of it. In the first dayes, when they entred first into the farme of the world, they might be merry and jocund: we live in the last dayes, when we cannot have long to tarry in it, therefore let us not be glewed and wedded to it: let us use this world as if we used it not,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31.</note> for the fashion of this world fadeth away in these last dayes: let us so live, that whensoever <hi>Christ</hi> comes to judgement, we may meet him joyfully in the Ayre, and be translated with him into his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory.</p>

                     <hi>Spoken unto us.</hi>] 1. To the Apostles first, that saw and heard him; then to all Christians. [<hi>His</hi>] must be understood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37. But last of all he sent unto them his Son: <hi>[in his Sonne,] Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulnesse of the Godhead, bodily.</hi>

                  <p>The which Sonne, speaketh to us by his Ministers to the worlds end: they had servants to speake to them, but <hi>God</hi> hath spoken to us by his Son; yet even his Son is little regarded. Many of the Pharisies knew him to be the Son of <hi>God,</hi> this is the Heire, yet they said, come let us kill him. I am perswaded, if CHRIST were now alive, and preached many yeeres together in this Towne, yet there be some so maliciously set against the Word, and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, that they could finde in their hearts to kill him. <hi>Hee that heareth you, heareth me:</hi> and he that goeth about to kill them, goes about to kill CHRIST too: What a vile age doe we live in?</p>
                  <p>What manner of Son? not adopted, but naturall:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Heire. The Son is the Fathers Heire: he hath a right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to all his Fathers goods and lands: when his Father is dead, he hath the same power, lordship, and authority over all, that his Father had. So <hi>Christ, Psa.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.15. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.10. Yet <hi>God</hi> his Father never dieth: He is Heire as <hi>God</hi> and Man, the King and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the <hi>Church,</hi>

                     <hi>God</hi> appointed Him, He did not intrude Himselfe: He was not appointed Heire, because being in time made, He deserved it by His holy life; as <hi>Photinus</hi> said, not only Heire in time, but with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before all times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of all.</hi>] Of all persons as well as of all things. CHRIST hath a right to all: he that taketh away any thing bequeathed to the Heire, by the Will and Testament of his Father, robs the Heire, and is guilty of theft: if we goe about to take any thing away from CHRIST, we rob Him: our soules and bodies are <hi>Christs,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not keepe them away from Him, but consecrate them wholly to him.</p>

Gal. 4.7.</note>2 We are Heires by Him: the poorest man that beleeves in <hi>Christ,</hi> is an Heire, though he have scant a place to hide his head in, nor a good meales meat all the week long. <hi>Christ</hi> Himselfe was Heire of all when He breathed on the Earth, yet He was hungry, thirsty, had no money in His purse; when the receivers of tribute came, He had not an house to dwell in: then He had a right to all, though He had fruition of little. So is it with us. Men are wont to make much of them that be Heires to great Personages: the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are Heires, not of Men, but of <hi>God</hi>; not of transitory Lordships, or fading Kingdomes in this world, but of a Kingdome that cannot be shaken in the world to come: make much of them. If we see the Heire of a Noble man, we reverence him; especially if he be the Kings Heire. Good Christians are the Heires of the King of Kings, therefore have them in high price and estimation: but the world knowes not these Heires, therefore she makes no reckoning of them.

                  <p>The Tabernacle was of <hi>Bezaleels</hi> making, that was furnished with all skill and wisedome, therefore the more regarded by the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi> the Temple was of <hi>Salomons</hi> making, the wisest man that ever was, therefore in that respect more honoured by the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>A picture of <hi>Apelles</hi> making would be in great request: The world is the glorious worke-man-ship of God Almighty, therefore to be admired of us all. If a stranger be in a boat on the Thames, he cannot but wonder at the brave buildings that be scituate on it: shall we passe through this famous frame, and superexcellent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this world set up by God himselfe, and not wonder at the wisedome, power and goodnesse of God, that made it? Wee see what a goodly coate the earth hath: <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his royalty was not so clothed as it: we see the Sunne in the firmament, the Moone, the Starres GOD Almighty his Candles, birds of the ayre, beasts of the field, fishes of the Sea, the admirable worke of our owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; yet they doe not make us almost to thinke of GOD. The Gentiles had no booke but this to looke upon, yet it left them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse. Let us all behold GOD, even in the creation of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the world be a worthy worke, and that of GODS making, yet let us not admire it too much: as there was a time when it was set up; so there is a time when it shall be pulled downe. The Disciples stood gazing on the Temple wondring at the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of it;<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> but CHRIST told them that one stone should not be left upon another: So the time shall come, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, when the whole world shall passe away with a noise,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.12.</note> the elements melt like fire: therefore let us not be too much in love with this world: Let us lay up treasure especially in the heavenly Ierusalem that abideth for ever. This world is but an Inne, wherein we take up
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12681:45"/>
a nights lodging. If thou commest to an Inne, be it never so faire, wilt thou alwayes continue there? Nay, thou wilt leave the Inne, and make hast to thy house, though it bee nothing so beautifull as the Inne. Remember that this world is but an Inne, be it never so goodly a piece of worke, hasten to that house, that is made without hands, eternall in the heavens. <hi>Plato</hi> sayd that the world had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but should have no ending, that is confuted by <hi>Aristotle</hi> his Scholler. If it had a beginning, it must have an end too, that cannot be avoyded. Therefore he to make it eternall, would have it to be without both, wherein he bewrayed his ignorance of God and his word.</p>

                  <p>THe former might seeme by participation and similitude to be adscribed to Christians: we are the Sonnes of GOD and heyres of GOD:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.14.</note> you are the light of the world, sayes CHRIST. Therefore here hee ascendeth higher, shewing that CHRIST is of the same nature and essence with GOD: as the brightnesse of the Sunne is of the same essence with the Sunne, and as the brightnesse proceedeth from the Sun; so <hi>Christ</hi> is of the same essence with the Father, and proceedeth from the Father, as the brightnesse from the Sunne: he is <hi>lux de luce:</hi> and as we know the Sunne by his brightnesse; so the Father by <hi>Christ.</hi>

                     <hi>And the expresse image of his person.</hi> The former did shew that CHRIST was of the same nature with the Father: but this, that he further resembleth the person of the Father; every Sonne is of the same nature and essence that his Father is of; but every Sonne is not like the person of his Father, in stature, countenance, voice, gesture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas there is nothing in the person of the father, but it is expressed in lively colours in CHRIST: not a painted forme, but an engraven forme. As if a mans picture were taken in brasse or Waxe; all the lineaments of his face, hands, and the rest of the parts of the body might evidently be seene in it: he that beholdeth the one, beholdeth the other, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Io.</hi> 14.9. the eternity of the God-head, his wisedome, power, justice and goodnesse may be seene in CHRIST. This is the third argument to prove the deity of CHRIST, and it is drawne from the identity of the divine essence: Hee, that is the brightnesse of Gods glory, and engraven forme of his person is GOD: but CHRIST is the brightnesse of GODS glory, and engraven forme of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
                  <p>He shewes him in the fourth place to be God by the worke of preservation. He that beareth up the world by the mighty power of his providence, is God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Isai.</hi> 46.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Cap.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 11. but <hi>Christ</hi> beareth up the world by the power of his providence. <hi>Ergo,</hi> hee beareth it up, else it would fall. Some say that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ruling all things. Yet the metaphor is significant, <hi>Christ</hi> beareth up all things in heaven and earth. There were two pillars that bere up the house, where <hi>Sampson</hi> played, and the <hi>Philistims</hi> were assembled together: but <hi>Christ</hi> is the only pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that beareth up the house of the world.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poets</hi> write much of one <hi>Atlas,</hi> that bore up the heavens with his shoulders: but our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> is the true <hi>Atlas</hi> that beareth up heaven and earth.</p>
                  <p>As he made the world, so he beares up the world, and keepeth it up from falling. If it were not for him; the Sunne, Moone, Stars, and all the host of heaven would fall to the ground: if it were not for him, the birds of the ayre, the fishes of the Sea, the beasts of the field would drop away in a moment: the earth would sinke downe under our feet, the Sea would overflow his bankes and drowne us all. Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> beares up all: in regard of their nature he beareth up the Devils themselves, and all his instruments in the world: he does not beare them out in their wickednesse, but hee beareth up their essence. In him <hi>all live, breath and have their being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particularly, in love and mercy he beareth up his children, and the members of <hi>Christ</hi>; as a father beareth his Sonne,<note place="margin">Deut. 1.31. Isai. 46.3.</note> and taketh him up into his armes, so doth he those whom he hath adopted in <hi>Christ:</hi> Nay, as a mother beareth the infant,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.11.</note> so doth he us; as an Eagle fluttereth about her young ones, so the Lord bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us on his wings. This may bee a singular comfort to us all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12681:46"/>
wheresoever we be, on the water or on the land, in the day or night, though we be among the thickest of our enemies, nay among De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; yet the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> beareth us in his hands, <hi>and none can take us out of his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This should cause us all to stand in aw of him, to be afraid to displease him. Will any be so madde as to make holes in the ship that beareth them? Will any hew downe the pillars that beare up the house? Shall a child scratch out the eyes of the nurse that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him? Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> beares us up all: therfore let us not like rebels fight against him by our sinnes: let us please him, all that we can,<note place="margin">Acts 12.20.</note> by whom wee are borne up. They of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> sought <hi>Herods</hi> favour, because their land was nourished by him: all men throughout the wide compasse of the world are nourished by our Saviour Christ. The breath would quickly be out of the nostrills of us all, if it were not for him. <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> Noblemen, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Merchants, Clothiers, Rich and Poore depend upon him: if he take away his hand, we are all gone. Therefore let us serve him with all our might, that beareth us up with his mighty word. It is not our riches, our Silver and Gold, our Sheep and Oxen, that can beare us up: then the rich man would never have dyed. It is Christ that upholdeth us all. Let us all therefore feare and reverence him: wee especially that be his Ministers, of whom he hath such a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, being the watchman and keeper. Let us above all others glorifie this GOD that beareth us up by the hand of his power and mercy.</p>
                  <p>The fifth argument to prove the deity of <hi>Christ</hi> is drawn from the worke of redemption. He that hath purged us from our sins, is God. But <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is spoken of whole <hi>Christ:</hi> His humanity was the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cause of this purgation; his deity the efficient. We are purged by the word, as by an instrument applying this to us; and by the Sacrament of Baptisme sealing it up in our hearts, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.26. but by the bloud of <hi>Christ Meritoriè, Acts</hi> 20.28. by the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne body, and the shedding of his owne bloud; not by an Angell, not by the co-operation of our merits with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>Not of His owne, for He knew no sin: but ours, that are bred, borne, and brought up in sin: of all our sinnes He hath not left one unpurged.</p>
                  <p>Not by our selves, nor by Angels. Here the slie and nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the Iesuits is taken away, which they invented of late to make us beleeve, that by the Doctrine of Merits they derogate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the glory of CHRIST. Indeed they say, that we may make satisfaction for sin and merit Heaven: yet it is not we that doe it, but Christ by us: not our workes simply in themselves, but as dyed in the bloud of CHRIST. Our merits are <hi>Christs</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and therefore they may deserve Heaven. I but <hi>Christ</hi> hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our sins by Himselfe, not by our selves: he hath done it by his
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12681:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
owne bloud immediately, not mediately by our workes dyed in His bloud: therefore that is a meere delusion to mock the World withall.</p>
                  <p>This is a singular benefit, that we receive from <hi>Christ</hi> a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all our sins. Sin is an heavie load and importable burthen: a man had better have a mountaine than one sin hang on Him. Hence it is, that they cry, <hi>O ye hils fall on us.</hi> In what a pittifull taking was <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he felt the horrour of his sin not purged, by the Lord Iesus! How did he houle and cry, <hi>I have sinned</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— and at length, tooke a rope and hanged himselfe? There is no torment to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin: this is in a manner the only hell: though we be never so rich, have never so many bags of gold and silver, lye on beds of downe, have never so many friends and Physitions about us; yet if the worme of conscience lye gnawing on us for our sins, our mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, adulteries, drunkennesse, &amp;c. That we have no hope that <hi>Christ</hi> died for them; in what miserable case are we? The Hypocrite would give 1000. Rams, 10000. Rivers of Oile, the fruit of his body for his soule: as a man that is dangerously sick would give any thing for health: so a man that is oppressed with the burthen of his sins, would give any thing that they were removed.</p>
                  <p>Now CHRIST IESUS alone hath purged us from our sins. Apply this purgation to thy selfe by the hand of a true and a lively faith, and then thou art a happy man: if CHRIST had not purged us from sin, we had fried in hell for ever. Therefore let us magnifie the Lambe that was killed for us, and give prayses to him for ever. <hi>Worthy is the Lambe who hath purged us from our sinnes, to receive power and riches, and wisdome, and strength, and honour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 5.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and glory, and blessing.</hi> Againe, hath <hi>Christ</hi> purged us from our sinnes, and shall we tumble in them? Hath the Physitian purged thy body and made thee whole, and wilt thou by ill diet make thy selfe sick? <hi>Christ</hi> the heavenly Physitian hath purged us from sin that made us sick to death, and shall we run into sin againe? O that men would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually consider of this great benefit, the purging of our sins by <hi>Christ</hi>! Who hath purged us? not an Angell, but the Son of <hi>God:</hi> with what hath He purged us, not with the bloud of Martyrs, but with His owne bloud: to what end hath He purged us? not that like swine we should still wallow in the myre of our sinnes, but that we should be an holy Nation, a royall Priest-hood, a peculiar people to Himselfe, zealous of good workes. Therefore as CHRIST hath purged us from our sins, so let us hurle away our sins, and have nothing to doe with them, least we crucifie againe <hi>the Lord of life.</hi> That proverb is knowne to us all; <hi>the Hogge to the myre:</hi> a <hi>Hogge</hi> is washed cleane and faire, he runs into the myre againe: what a filthy sight is that? So it is for one whom <hi>Christ</hi> hath purged from sin, to returne to them againe: <hi>a Dogge to his vomit.</hi> Who can abide to see a Dogge take up that which he hath cast out of his belly? and a loathsome sight it is to see men daily, yea hourely to take up the Vomit of their old sins againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:12681:47"/>How hath <hi>Christ</hi> purged us from sin, when as sin still remaineth in us all? <hi>If we say we have no sin, we deceave our selvs, &amp;c.</hi> The answer is easie: there is in sin, <hi>materia &amp; forma</hi>; the matter still remaines to exercise us withall; but the guilt that is, the forme of sin, which gave an <hi>esse</hi> to it, that is taken away by Christ. In so much as we may say, <hi>death where is thy sting, hell where is thy victory? the strength of death is sin; but thankes be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixth and last Argument to prove the deity of Christ, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from His exaltation: which is fitly inferred upon the former humiliation. He that sitteth on the right hand of the Majesty on high, is GOD: but CHRIST sitteth on the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on high. <hi>Ergo.</hi> He doth not say, standeth: that belongs to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and inferiors: but he sitteth. Kings, Senatours, Iudges sit when they heare causes.</p>
                  <p>He sits, not at the commandement or appointment of another, but of Himselfe: He knowes His place, and takes it: not at the left hand, but, which is higher, at the right hand: His fathers equall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Regia majestas,</hi> the Kings Majesty is more magnificent then to say the King. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Scrutator majestatis opprimetur à gloria. Heb.</hi> 8.1. <hi>We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> could not purge our sinnes but by dying: He was faine to shed His bloud and to dye for us: yet He rose againe, ascended into Heaven, and fitteth on the right hand of the Majesty on high. Out of this we have two notable comforts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 If Christ sitteth above in the highest places, then he beholdeth all things here below. A man, that is upon the top of some high Tower, may see farre: and Christ being in the high Steeple and Tower of Heaven, can see all things on the earth. He that is upon the top of an high Tower, may see men, but he cannot discerne who they bee: Christ sees them, and discernes them too. If the wicked bee laying of plots and snares against His Children, <hi>Christ</hi> being in Heaven sees them, and in due time will overthrow them: <hi>and He that sitteth in Heaven, laugheth them to scorne.</hi> This is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular comfort, that our Head, King and defender is in Heaven, and hath equall Power, Glory and Majesty with God. If thou hast a friend in the Court, that sits daily by the King, and is in favour with him, wilt thou care for any in England? we have a friend that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the right hand of God, and hath all power in Heaven and earth; therefore let us feare nothing; he will keepe us, none shall doe us any harme, but it shall all turne to our good in the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As Christ sitteth in the heavens: so we shall one day sit there with Him.<note place="margin">Luk. 13.29.</note> 
                     <hi>Many shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit downe in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 10.28.</note> Yee shall sit on the twelve Seates and Iudge the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> Which is not spoken of all the Apostles; for <hi>Iudas</hi> never sate there: nor yet of the Apostles onely, but of all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:12681:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christians: <hi>Know yee not that wee shall judge the World?</hi> wee shall one day <hi>sit in Heavenly places with Christ:</hi> wee sit there already in our head, but we shall likewise sit there in our owne persons with our head. Let this comfort us against all the calamities of this life: here the children of God are oftentimes made the wickeds foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stooles, they sit on them and tread on them: no reckoning is made of a godly man. A rich man that is a common drunkard and whore-master shall be more esteemed of by many then a godly poore man. Here they sit as forlorne persons, none regards them. Many times they sit weeping and wayling, for their sinnes, for their children, for crosses in goods, in bodies, in good name; the wicked deriding them, jesting at them, making songs of them in the Ale-houses: but let this comfort us against them all; how contemptible soever we sit here, wee shall sit with CHRIST IESUS, though not in that degree of glory, yet in the same kingdome of glory with him for ever.</p>

                  <p>Divine worship is proper to God. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. CHRIST must be worshipped. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He is God. 2. The Angels must wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Him; therefore they are inferiour to Him. Not some, but all: the highest of them all. God alone is to be worshipped: <hi>thou shalt worship the Lord thy God?</hi> There is a civill and humane worship, that may bee ascribed to men. So <hi>Abraham</hi> worshipped the <hi>Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites</hi> in bowing himselfe to them: So <hi>Iacob</hi> worshipped <hi>Esau</hi> in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him seven times. Thus the Subject may be said to worship the Prince, when he kneeles to him in token of reverence: thus the Husband is said to honour the Wife as the weaker vessell, which is counted a kinde of worship: but divine worship is proper to God alone. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were worthy men, yet would not bee worshipped by the Lycaonians; when they were about to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to them, as if they were Gods, they rent their clothes, and would none of it. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a famous Apostle, yet he would not bee worshipped: nay the Angels themselves refuse divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>Reve.</hi> 19.10. none but God must have a divine worship given to Him.</p>
                  <p>Then how sharply are the Papists to be reproved, that worship the images of our <hi>Lady</hi> and other Saints? Nay what a presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man is the <hi>Pope,</hi> that will have Kinges and Princes fall at his feete?</p>
                  <p>He takes on him to command the Angells of Paradise: even they also must worship him. They pray to images, they offer to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they expect ayd and Succour from them. What could they doe more to God Himselfe? They praise their Idols for benefits received. Christ is worshipped, and that by the Angells, the highest creatures of all: therefore He is God. 1. Laud and magnifie Him, subject your selves to Him, as to your Lord and Master, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him for your King. So they doe in the Apocal. <hi>they cast downe their crownes at his feet,</hi> they sing praises to him Day and Night.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Angels worship Christ, shall not we men that be dust and ashes worship Him? If the Lords of the Privie Councell stand bare to the King, shall not we silly men of the Country doe it? The Angels that dwell in the Court of Heaven with God, worship Christ: and shall not we on earth doe it? Let us worship Him, and Him alone: let us not worship our gold and silver, as Covetous men doe, and come within compasse of Idolatry: let us not worship our pleasures as Epicures doe, and make their bellies God: but let us worship Christ as the Angels doe. If thou lovest any thing more then Christ, if thou fearest any above Christ, if thou trustest to any more then to Christ, thou art not a right worshipper of the

Lord Iesus. We worship Christ with our lips, we have His Name in our mouth; but we worship Him not with our hearts and lives. A great number of Christians are like the Souldiers that sate a Crowne of thornes on <hi>Christs</hi> head, put a reede in stead of a Scepter into His hand, cloathed Him with a purple garment, and in the end did nothing but mocke Him. So wee talke gloriously of CHRIST, and of His Kingdome; in words wee professe Him to be our King; but wee doe not worship Him in truth and sincerity, and serve Him in holinesse and righteousnesse, as we ought to doe.</p>

                     <hi>Hath anointed thee</hi>—Hereby hee is distinguished from GOD the Father: as <hi>Genesis</hi> 19.24. GOD the Father anointed him, in respect of his humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With the oyle of gladnesse:</hi> with the graces of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which make the hearts of the faithfull glad and cheerefull to every good worke; as they that were anointed in the time of the law, were made the fitter to those businesses which GOD injoyned to them. Further, because they made CHRIST glad to powre downe those graces on his Church: IESUS rejoyced in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>We are <hi>Christs</hi> fellowes, as men; as members of his body, and as his brethren, we are anoynted: touch not mine anoynted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105.15. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.

                  </p>
                  <p>Who be those that are <hi>Christs</hi> fellowes? Surely the faithfull: wee are his servants and fellowes too. The head is above all the members of the body, yet the head and members are fellowes: the husband hath a superioritie over the Wife, yet the man and the Wife are fellowes: <hi>Christ</hi> is our Husband, we by his grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are his Wife; therefore his fellowes: the eldest Sonne and heyre to a Nobleman hath many prerogatives above the rest of his brethren; yet in that they be brethren, the Sonnes of one Father, they are all fellowes. So CHRIST our elder brother is above us: yet because wee are his brethren, wee may bee termed his fellowes.</p>
                  <p>By this oyle of gladnesse is meant nothing else, save the graces of the spirit. <hi>The oyntment shall teach you,</hi> sayes <hi>Iohn:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.27.</note> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is this oyle or oyntment. Where we have many observations and instructions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the oyle that we have comes from God: we have no grace but it is of him: the uprightnesse of <hi>Noah,</hi> meekenesse of <hi>Moses,</hi> zeale of <hi>Phineas,</hi> sincerity of <hi>David,</hi> the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> the hope of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the wonderfull faith of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that spake with tongues more than all, the courage of <hi>Peter,</hi> all is of God: it is he that anointed us
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12681:51"/>
with his holy oyle; therefore let us be proud of no gift, but use all in feare and trembling to the glory of the giver.</p>
                  <p>There is one that bestowes precious oyle on thee, with that thou anointest thy face, and hast a cheerefull looke; thou art not to praise thy selfe, but him, that gave thee the oyle: all our spirituall oyle comes out of Gods shop; therefore let us magnifie him for all: if hee anointed <hi>Christ,</hi> much more us: hee was anoynted with this oyle as he was man; otherwise as he was God, he had all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of himselfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If <hi>Christ</hi> were anointed above his fellowes, then his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes also are anointed, though not in that measure hee was: wee have a little Crewse full of oyle; but he hath a great Pot full of it: yet every Christian must have some oyle, else he is a Christian in name, not in deed.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is, that we are called Christians of <hi>Christ,</hi> because wee are anointed as he was: but none may be called <hi>Iesuits</hi> of <hi>Iesus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no <hi>Saviour</hi> beside him: wee may communicate with him in the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> but not in the name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> and if we be <hi>Christs</hi> members, we must have some oyle, as well as our head. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profited in the study of the law above his fellowes: therefore his fellowes profited something. CHRIST was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed above us: therefore wee must bee anointed too. If thou hast no knowledge in the will of God, no faith, no zeale, hope, meekenesse, patience, thou art no Christian: therefore let us intreat the LORD to anoynt us with this oyle dayly more and more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Oyle was a token of consecration in the time of the law. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and all the Kings by oyle were consecrated to the Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> and set apart to an holy use: <hi>Iacob</hi> powred oyle on the pillar whereof he was purposed to make an altar to the Lord. So we by this heavenly oyle of the spirit, are dedicated to God, <hi>as a royall Priest-hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, zealous of good workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Oyle gives a sweet taste to the meat: whereupon God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that on the meat offering should be powred oyle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense:<note place="margin">Levi. 2.1.</note> oyle for the tast, and incense for the smell. So this spirituall oyle of Gods graces makes us a sweet and pleasant meat to the Lord: the wicked he will spew out of his mouth; but in us, that are seasoned with the oyle of the spirit, he takes singular delight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Oyle supples the wounds that be in a mans bodie. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane powred oyle into the wounds of the man, that lay halfe dead, by the high way side: so the oyle of the spirit supples us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wounds of sinne, a certaine perswasion being setled in our hearts of the love of God towards us in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Oyle makes a man nimble: therefore wrastlers in all ages were wont to anoint themselves with oyle, that they might bestirre their joynts the better: So the graces of the spirit make us more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Gods service, to wrastle with great alacritie with Satan and all the enemies of our salvation.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:12681:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>5. Oyle keepes the body Soluble, and is a meanes to purge it from many grosse humours: So the graces of the spirit clense us from many sinnes, which are the corruptions of the soule.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Oyle swims aloft above all other things, it will have the preeminence above all liquid things: So the oyle of the Spirit car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us aloft, makes us to have our conversation in heaven.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Oyle makes the lampe to burne: the five foolish Virgins went to buy oyle for their lamps. So the oyle of the Spirit makes us to continue burning in zeale and all good workes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Oyle makes a man chearefull: <hi>he hath given him oyle to make him a cheerefull countenance:</hi> when men would looke cheerefully, they annoint their faces with oyle. So the graces of the spirit infuse unspeakable cheerfulnesse into the faithfull: for this cause it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the oyle of gladnesse: none so merry, none so cheerfull, as they that bee anoynted with this oyle.<note place="margin">Act. 8.3.</note> There was great joy in <hi>Samaria</hi> when this oyle came to the City, when the <hi>Gospell</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was planted among them.

                  <p>All the faithfull have some of this oyle: but <hi>Christ</hi> is anointed

with it above us all. <hi>Semper excipio Platonem,</hi> said hee; So when we talke of rare and excellent men, we must say, we alwayes except our <hi>Saviour Christ. Noah</hi> was a famous man, <hi>Abraham</hi> a notable man; <hi>Moses, David, Salomon,</hi> were of great renowne; <hi>Peter, Paul, Thomas</hi> were adorned with singular graces: yet <hi>Christ</hi> is many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above them.<note place="margin">Prov. 31.29.</note> As he sayes of a good huswife, <hi>many women have done valiantly, but thou surmountest them all:</hi> So though many of GODS children were beautified with the oyle of the spirit; yet CHRIST surmounts them all: he is <hi>annointed above his fellowes:</hi> they were as starres, he as the Sunne. Therefore let us all doe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him: we are Saints, but he is <hi>Sanctus Sanctorum,</hi> and <hi>of his fulnesse we all receive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The principall scope of the place is this. CHRIST is above all, above all men, above all Angels, above all creatures whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Which must needs bee a pillar of singular comfort for us to leane upon, that the King and protectour of the Church is the high, mighty and eternall God: all stoope to him. Let Satan spew out the Sea of his malice against us: let his instruments rage never so much: let the cruell and bloud thirstie Iesuits be continually plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against us, as out of all question they are never idle; yet let us not be dismayed: CHRIST our head and keeper is above all: he hath all power in heaven and earth; hee sits in the high tower of heaven, sees all their doings and laughs them to scorne. This doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine concerning the deity of CHRIST, in the pressing whereof the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is so large and ample, is not lightly to bee passed over: let us all apply it to our owne hearts, that it may bee a bultwarke to us in the time of need, that seeing he is God blessed above all for ever and ever, so we may boldly put our trust in him in this world, count our selves safe under the shadow of his wings, and reigne with him in the world to come.</p>

                     <hi>Io.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am, Io.</hi> 8.58. CHRIST is the beginning of the world who was before it had a beginning.</p>

                     <hi>Layd the foundation of the earth:</hi> made it firme, sure and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, so as it cannot be moved: contrary to those Philosophers, that are of opinion, that the heavens stand still, and the earth moveth, though it cannot be discerned with the eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the heavens,</hi> i. all the heavens: the firmament and the ayre; <hi>are the workes of thy hands:</hi> it is a metaphor borrowed from Carpenters and Masons; else God hath no hands.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST in setting up the building of the world observed an other order then earthly Artificers. When they goe about to build, they lay the foundation first, and set on the roofe afterwards, for they cannot build otherwise: but this celestiall builder made the roofe first, and the foundation afterwards:<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> first he spread forth the heavens as the roofe, and afterwards laid the foundation of the earth: which was a lively demonstration of his unspeakable power.</p>
                  <p>Heaven and earth is the workemanship of CHRIST, the high and eternall God. In that respect it should be admired by us all: if thou haddest a picture of <hi>Apelles</hi> making, that famous and renowned Painter, wouldest thou not often looke upon it? The world is the admirable picture of God Almighty, in whom the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all wisedome is hidde: therefore let us behold it with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If the Tabernacle were now to bee seene which was of <hi>Aholiabs</hi> and <hi>Bezaleels</hi> making, or if the goodly Temple that was of <hi>Salomons</hi> setting up, were now to bee seene, we would runne and ride many a mile to take a view of it. The frame of the world set up by the wise, high and eternall God, surpasses them all, yet we goe through it, we looke upon it, and it never carries us to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the wisedome and power of GOD. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so common and ordinary a sight. They that come first to London, and looke on <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> upon the faire Tombes, and costly ornaments that be in them, are ravished with the sight of them: but if they have beene there long, they passe by them and regard them not.</p>
                  <p>So is it with us: because we see the Sunne, Moone, and Stars, the glorious curtaine of the heaven, the birds of the ayre, fishes of the Sea, beasts of the field, the goodly coate of the earth dayly, which is better arrayed than <hi>Salomon</hi> was in all his royaltie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are common, they are not esteemed of us. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they be the handy worke of God, a glasse wherein we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the everlasting God-head, and in that respect; let us view di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and bee brought to the knowledge, the feare and love of God by it, that hath made all these things for our sakes.</p>

Let us use it, as if we used it not: and let us long for that day, when both the heavens and the earth, and we our selves likewise shall be changed and be translated with CHRIST into the kingdome of glory: the heavens are most fitly resembled to a garment.

Here wee may see, that the name of a Minister is an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> the Magistrate is a Minister, the Angels are Ministers, CHRIST himselfe was a Minister,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> even the Minister of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, when hee lived on the earth. Some prophane fellowes there be, that thinke basely in their hearts, and speake irreverently of the Ministers. I tell you, it is an Angelicall name, an high and magnificent title. Is it not an honourable office to serve the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Queene?</hi> We that be the Ministers, are servants to <hi>Christ</hi> the King of Kings, and to his Church the Lambes Wife: therefore thinke highly of us, because of our office. Is it a grace to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to be called Ministers, and shall it be a disgrace to us? Nay, we will glory in it, and shame shall light on them that contemne the Ministers of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whose Ministers are the Angels? They be our Ministers, they Minister for our sakes: and what be we in comparison of the Angels? They are spirits, we flesh and bloud: they holy, wee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy: they immortall, we mortall: they in heaven, we on earth; yet they be our Ministers: they Minister to CHRIST, as to their Lord and Master: to us, as to their fellow servants. But what an honour is this to wretched and sinfull man, that the Angels should be his Ministers? As if the King should command an honourable Lord of his privy Counsel to waite on a poore man in the Country, to conduct him from the Court to his owne house: the Angels are of Gods Court in heaven, and see his face continually. Wee are sillie wormes on earth: yet the Lord hath appointed them to attend on us, to be our nurses, <hi>to carry us in their armes, that wee dash not our foot against a stone.</hi> Let us praise and magnifie God, that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided such keepers for us: <hi>What is man, O Lord, that thou regardest him? thou hast made him a little lower,</hi> nay, a little higher than the Angels. The Angels are our Ministers: but we are not the Angels Ministers. This is thy gracious goodnesse towards us, thy name be blessed for it for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Whether he have appointed to every one of us a particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell or not, let us not be too curious in the discussing of it: this is comfortable for us, that wee have many Angels to Minister to us: <hi>Their Angels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 18.10.</note> saies CHRIST of those that believe in him, not their Angell: not one Angell, but many carryed <hi>Lazarus</hi> his soule into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What an unspeakable comfort is this for us? What a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of defence against Satan and his Angels? The Devill compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the earth to and fro, hee walkes up and downe like a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devoure: and there be many 1000s of devils: there were a legion in one man. These by Gods permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion raise up tempests, stirre up extraordinary windes, blow downe houses, Nay, if God did not bridle them, they would quickly teare us all in pieces: but let this be our castle to flye unto: as there be bad Angels to hurt us; so there be good Angels to defend us. There were Charrets and horse-men of fire round about <hi>Elisha:</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12681:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Angels of <hi>God,</hi> though we cannot see them with our eyes, pitch their Tents round about us: these be stronger than the Devill and his angels, because they never sinned, and have <hi>God</hi> on their side. In the time of Popery the people were much deluded with the walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of spirits, they durst not go through a Church-yard in the night for feare of them. Sundry are afraid of Fairies and of ill spirits, that haunt their houses: no doubt but the evill angels are busie in all places, yet let us feare none of them all: we are guarded with the celestiall guard of holy Angels, that are able to protect us from them all; especially, Christ Iesus is on our side, which is above all Angels; he sits at <hi>Gods</hi> right-hand, hath all power in heaven and earth, he will preserve us from all dangers in this life, and bring us to his everlasting Kingdome in the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Seeing that God hath ordained the Angels to be ministring-spirits, for our sakes, which undoubtedly looke carefully to their charge, seldome or never are they absent from us, some or other are present with us continually: Let us do nothing that may grieve these Heavenly Spirits:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.10.</note> let the Women be covered because of the Angels. So let not us sweare and blaspheme the Name of <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. because of the Angels. Men would blush to commit filthinesse in the presence of an honourable Personage; the Angels are alwayes present with us; therefore, even in respect of them, let us absteine from sin.</p>

                  </gap>, more aboundantly. We should abound more in hearing, attention, and practice, than they did, in the time of the Law: we should excell them by a more rare and singular attention:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12681:58"/>
for though the things are the same: yet the party is not the same, by whom they are delivered.</p>
               <p>It is not enough to heare Sermons every weeke, which is good and commendable, but we must yeeld a diligent attention to the things that we heare: we especially now in the time of the Gospell when <hi>God</hi> speaketh to us by his owne Son. The people were bound to heare attentively in the time of the Law, when the Prophets of God spake to them: but much more are we, when the Son of <hi>God,</hi> the Prince of Prophets, the Prophet of the Prophets speakes to us. All <hi>Samaria</hi> gave heed to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that bewitched them,<note place="margin">Acts 8.10.</note> and lead them to the Divell: and shall not we give heed to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that labours to carry us to Heaven? Doe not onely heare, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that which ye heare.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.18.</note> Take heed how ye heare, whether loosely or carefully, profitably or unprofitably. <hi>Lydia</hi> attended to the things that <hi>Paul</hi> spake. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. We must not only heare the Preacher, but attend to the things which he uttereth. An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant doth not only take the dug into his mouth, but he sucketh at it, and that with greedinesse. So we must not onely lye at the big of the Word, but we must suck sweet doctrines and heavenly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from it. The ground that receives not the seed into it, will never be fruitfull, if it lye aloft and be not hidden in the bowels of the earth, it can never yeeld fruit: so when the seed of the Word is sowne, if we doe not marke it and lay it up in our hearts, hide it within us, as <hi>David</hi> did; the birds of the Ayre, that is, the divels that flie up and downe in the Church, will pick it up and run away with it. Therefore let us diligently give heed to the things which we heare: hearing is good, and they be commended that heare, yet that is not sufficient; a diligent attendance must be given to that which we heare. When Christ reades a Divinity Lecture to us, we that be his Schollers must attend to it. It is said of the people, that they hung on <hi>Christ,</hi> watching the words that came from his mouth, ready to receive them before they came: so with all care and diligence we must hang on the Preacher; marke his words, and be ready to receive them into our eares and hearts, even before they are delivered; so eager should we be of the Word.</p>
               <p>Especially now in the time of the Gospell: what attention is there in the Starre-Chamber, when the Lords of the Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell speake? But if either the Prince or the King himselfe make an Oration, then there is wonderfull attention. In the time of the Law the Prophets spake, which indeed were of <hi>Gods</hi> counsell, by whom <hi>God</hi> revealed his will to the people: but now the Prince of peace, the everlasting Counsellor, the Kings owne Sonne, that lay in his owne bosome, in whom all the treasures of wisdome are hid, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us. Therefore let us listen with all diligence to the things which he speaketh.</p>
               <p>And how doth Christ now speak? Not daily from Heaven, as he did to <hi>Saul:</hi> but by the mouth of his Ambassadours. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me:</hi> will ye have an experience of Christ that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12681:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speaketh in me? <hi>Christ</hi> spake in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached; and hee speakes in us when we preach. The Pearle is precious though it be in an earthen vessell, that brings it to you: therefore receive it with all reverence. We ought more diligently to give heed to the things which we heare, and yet we are more negligent in hearing, than they were in time past: an egregious fault! Let it be amended by us all.</p>
               <p>The reason is taken, 1. From the danger: lest we be as wet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which blotteth out the words and letters that are written in it, so as they cannot be read:<note place="margin">Psal. 68.2.</note> or lest we perish <hi>as water that runneth over and is spilt on the ground,</hi> as wax that melteth away before the fire. The words following seeme to ratifie this interpretation, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Chrysostome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ne praeterfluamus:</hi> lest we run by, or run over: lest we be like to Sieves and Vessels full of holes, out of which the water runneth out immediately, so soone as it is powred in: as he said in <hi>Terence, Plenus sum rimarum, huc et illuc diffluo:</hi> lest we runne by, as water doth by a way, and stayeth not. So lest we passe by the celestiall doctrine propounded to us, and regard it not, we must dwell upon the things which we heare, by a serious meditation, and not flow (like water) from one thing to another.</p>
               <p>We must let the Word slip at no time, though we have never such weighty businesse: <hi>One thing is necessary.</hi> This one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is to be preferred before all others: never let a Sermon slip from you without some profit. I, but how shall we keep them from slipping away? There be foure things to hold the Word from slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from us?</p>
               <p n="1">1 A meditation in that which wee have heard: <hi>blessed is the man that meditateth in the Law of God.</hi> When thou hast heard a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, take some time to meditate in it, that thou mayest imprint it on thy memory.</p>
               <p>This is a common fault among us. The word of <hi>God</hi> preached to us passeth away as water on a stony Rock. When we are once out of the Church, we never thinke on it againe: therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell though it slip away from us.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. thing to hold it, is conference with others. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that travelled to <hi>Emaus,</hi> conferred together:<note place="margin">Luke 24.14.</note> the <hi>Bereans</hi> that came from S. <hi>Paul</hi> his Sermon tooke their Bibles and conferred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Sermon: <hi>many eyes see more than one:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.11.</note> that which one hath forgotten, another may remember. Therefore let Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans recount the things they have heard, and that repetition will be as a naile to fasten the things they heard.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. is prayer. Our corporall meat will not thrive, except GOD blesse it: therefore they that have any feare of GOD, have grace before and after meales: no more can the food of our soules doe us good without the blessing of <hi>God</hi> upon it: therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to pray both when we come to Church, and goe from Church, that he would send us good speed, &amp; blesse his word to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:12681:59"/>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is a care to practise that which we have heard. This is the digesting of our spirituall meat, and the converting of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our substance. Many heare, but few care to practise that which they heare: it is never our owne truly and indeed, till it be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: that will make us grow up as perfect men in CHRIST IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS. We heare swearing reproved; yet we sweare still: drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse inveighed against; yet we are drunke still: envie and malice controlled; yet malicious still, yea, against the Preachers, that are as Gods arme to pull us out of our sins: a manifest argument that we hold not that, which wee heare, but suffer it without fruit to slip from us. Shall a Childe be put to a Nurse, that hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of milke and bee never a whit the fatter for it? Has <hi>God</hi> sent you many spirituall Nurses, that in great plenty have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the sincere milke of the Word to you (and are you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit the better for it?

               <p>Doth a man sit at a table well furnished every day, and yet is he leane and in no good plight?

Whereas, if the words be examined in the Originall, they imply no such matter. <hi>Stephen</hi> sayes not, that they received the Law by the Ministery of Angels, but among the Orders or Rankes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that is, the Angels, by whom the fearefull Trumpet was sounded, as a celestiall Guard and Armie attending upon God at the present time, which gave the Law to the people: and in the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> it is, among the Angels by the hand of a Mediator: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the word spoken by Angels, is not meant the Law, but any doctrine or admonition whatsoever, which God sent to man by Angels in the Old Testament.

                  <p>The first Sermon hee made was in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where hee was brought up: from thence he went up to Ierusalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> CHRIST was a Preacher, and shall we thinke basely of Preachers? Was it not an high office, which the Sonne of GOD will take on him? CHRIST would not be a King, be refused that: then what wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are they that will rayle on Preachers, gibe and jest at them;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12681:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make songs of them? Reverence the Preachers, seeing CHRIST Himselfe was a Preacher.</p>
                  <p>And was confirmed unto us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some expound it thus: and after them that heard it of <hi>Christ:</hi> it was confirmed to me, that is, after it was preached by CHRIST, and the first Apostles that heard him on the earth, it was confirmed to me also as a later Apostle, yet one that heard and saw CHRIST from heaven: rather, <hi>Paul</hi> in modesty and humilitie puts himselfe in the number of the common Saints and Christians,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.8 9.</note> to whom the Gospell was confirmed by the miracles of the Apostles, or by the Apostles that heard <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, he doth not speake here of his doctrine, as if he received that from the Apostles: but that hee was confirmed in the truth of the Gospell by the miracles of the Apostles, which was no dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him.</p>
                  <p>This is the strongest argument: to perswade some, that this is none of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is wont to stand stiffely on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Apostle-ship: hee had his doctrine not from men, but God: he was not inferiour to the chiefest Apostles: whereas the Author of this Epistle was one of the Apostles Schollers; he had the doctrine of the Gospell not at the first hand, but at the second.</p>
                  <p>This may be answered diverse kinde of wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Both these may well bee applyed to Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> the LORD IESUS first preached the Gospell to him from heaven, when he called him, and he was confirmed in it by <hi>Ananias.</hi>

                  <p>But now since the famous miracles of CHRIST Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ascension into heaven, of the sending of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> of the spreading of the Gospell over all the world, we must not still curiously gape after miracles: that is reproved, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.48. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.8. To the law and the testimonie, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8.20. the people must resort.</p>
                  <p>The glory of miracles with the Papists is a note of the <hi>Church</hi>: and they bragge much of their miracles: they have one thousand miracles to our one. <hi>Bernard</hi> the Monke restored sight to a blind man. <hi>Dominicus</hi> raised up three from the dead, <hi>Antoninus</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Franciscus Xavorius</hi> the Iesuite cured many dumbe, lame and blind in <hi>India.</hi> As for us, we have no miracles: therefore ours is not the Church. What of all this?<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.41.</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> wrought never a miracle, yet he was a good Preacher sent from God.</p>
                  <p>But for the determination of this point. In some sence we will not deny but that miracles may be notes of the Church: but here we must distinguish of notes and of miracles too. One true note of the Church, is the sound preaching of the Word. where that is to beget men, and women to CHRIST, there is the Church: yet miracles may bee an ornament to the Church, a confirmation of it in the truth of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>But what miracles?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not forged or counterfeit, as the miracles of the Papists be, their jugling being brought to light, and detected to all the world: but true miracles, wrought by the finger of GOD. not lying wonders, with the which <hi>Antichrist</hi> should come and delude the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not new miracles, that came yesterday out of the mint, but the old and ancient miracles of CHRIST and his Apostles are a demonstration of the Church and of the truth of the Gospell: that the Gospell might be carryed more speedily throughout the world miracles were requisite at the beginning, but now no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of them.</p>
                  <p>A wicked and crooked generation seeketh a signe. <hi>Herod</hi> would faine see CHRIST, that he might see some miracle done by him. Let us not now gape after new miracles: the miracles wherewith God honoured the Gospell at the first, were sufficient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it to all posterity.</p>
                  <p>The rich man in Hell would faine have had a miracle for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his brethren. <hi>Lazarus</hi> must be sent from the dead to them: but it was answered him, they have <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12681:62"/>
is enough: if we will not believe for the preaching of the word, all the miracles in the world will not save us.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Gospell at this day has many miracles, though they be not observed: men are metamorphosed and changed by it: of proud, they become humble; of Devills, Saints: men are raised from the death of sinne by it; they that were blind in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of CHRIST, are come to a cleere sight in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: they that were lame and could not walke in the way to the kingdome of heaven, are made to runne cheerfully in it: they that were dumbe and could not speake for CHRIST, are made to speake wisely and boldly in his quarrell.</p>
                  <p>These are excellent miracles, which might procure an estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospell in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Now for so much as the LORD honoured the Gospell with so many miracles, let us yeeld a reverent attention to it, and not neglect so great salvation, which with so many great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miracles hath beene so much graced by GOD; let us lay it up in our hearts, let us frame our lives according to it, that wee may feele the power and comfort of it in our hearts, and be saved eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by CHRIST in the world to come.</p>

It may have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the words going before; for he doth all things according to his owne will, in regard whereof he hath subjected the whole world to his Sonne, not to the Angels.</p>
                  <p>It is rather a patheticall introduction of the maine conclusion: which still he keepeth in mind, and prefixeth as a firme foundation; the adversaries with all their cunning are not able to shake: say what they will, yet <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God</hi>: for he hath subjected the world to him. As <hi>for the Lord:</hi> they deliver that first as the ground of all.</p>
                  <p>What is meant by the world to come?</p>
                  <p>Some expound it of that time and part of the world that is to come, since the publike preaching of the Gospell, till <hi>Christs</hi> second comming. In the former time of the world, while the Law was in force, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Angels seemed to beare sway, by whom the law was delivered: but the world to come in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell God hath subjected to <hi>Christ,</hi> not to the Angels. Others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it of the world to come, after the day of judgement. In this world the Angels seeme to have rule, they be the governours of the world, Satan is the Prince of the world: but in the world to come, the Angels shall have nothing to do:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> that shall be wholly subject to <hi>Christ</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Apostles meaning seemes to be more generall: the whole world both present and to come is subject to CHRIST: he hath all power in heaven and earth, and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20.21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12681:63"/>
and the Apostle alleadgeth out of the Psalme, <hi>Verse</hi> 8. that all things are put in subjection under him.</p>
                  <p>The world in generall is said to come, in respect of CHRIST, which was from all eternity: CHRIST was alwayes the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <hi>Iehovah. Before Abraham was, I Am:</hi> but the world in time was to come. Now this world to come with all things, with all creatures contained in it, above and beneath, hath the LORD sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to CHRIST, not to the Angels: <hi>ergo,</hi> he is God above the Angels and all other creatures. Thus our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is said to come in regard of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. So the world is said to come in respect of CHRIST, that went before the world.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>world to come</hi> is meant the whole company of Gods elect, that shall be gathered together in the life to come: the which is termed <hi>the world to come,</hi> because both the number and perfection of them is to come: the whole number not yet being accomplished in this world, nor having aspired to perfection.</p>
                  <p>This agreeth with that which went before: if we neglect so great salvation which is reposed for us in the world to come: the which world, God hath subdued to <hi>Christ,</hi> that he may be the <hi>King</hi> of the Church and reigne for ever.</p>
                  <p>Whereof we speake in this our treatise, shewing that all things are subject to <hi>Christ:</hi> who is not only superiour to the Angels, as he is God alone; but even as he is God and man, the mediatour of the Church.</p>

                  <p>Many now a dayes take a pride in quoting the very Chapter and Verse. S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not so scrupulous: no more were the ancient Fathers: they thought it sufficient to cite Scripture, oftentimes not naming the Book, out of the which the testimony was desumed. And indeed it was a long time before the Scripture was sorted into Chapters: of late yeeres was it divided into verses. Let us be sure to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Here you have an admiration of <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse towards man. <hi>What is man? Aenosh,</hi> of <hi>Anash, indoluit, aegrotavit,</hi> a receptacle of all miseries: or of <hi>[Nashash] oblivisci:</hi> he hath forgotten thee; yet thou hast not forgotten him: or, <hi>the son of Adam,</hi> the progeny and off-spring of man: what a vile and contemptible thing, of no worth, of no value? In respect of his originall, he is dust; for the course of his life on the face of the earth, he is subject to all griefes, sorrowes, sicknesses, diseases, a continuall sinner against thee: for his end, he is wormes-meat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That thou once mindest him:</hi> that thou hast such a fatherly care over him: that thou carriest him in thy remembrance: that thou hast written him in thy Table-bookes, and art mindfull continually to doe him good? <hi>Non vacat exiguis rebus adesse Iovi,</hi> said the Poet.</p>

                  <p>Forsomuch as this Psalme is applyed to the <hi>Messiah</hi> by our <hi>Saviour Christ, Mat.</hi> 21.16. and by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. the Author of this Epistle doth directly apply it to him in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Sundry learned and godly men apply it first and principally to our <hi>Saviour Christ:</hi> but I see not how that can be: shall wee say of CHRIST, <hi>What is he, that God should be mindfull of him?</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son in whom he is well pleased, that never did any thing amisse, that never transgressed his Commandement: though hee bee a man as wee are, yet hee is an unspotted man, separate from sinners, higher than the heavens: as hee is man, so he is GOD too; and shall we say of him, <hi>What is he, that God should visit him?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What is man?</hi> He doth not speake of man in his first creation: he retained that estate but a while: therefore he would rather have deplored, than admired it. He doth not speak of man as he is after his fall, for in that respect he is most miserable, not glorious: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must needs speake of man, as he is ingraffed into <hi>Christ</hi> by whom he is advanced to wonderfull and unspeakable glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is man?</hi> Not onely considered in his first creation, but even in his renovation: what is the best man that ever was? What is <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob?</hi> What is <hi>Moses, David, Peter, Paul?</hi> What is the holiest man on the face of the earth, that <hi>God</hi> should have any respect to him? by creation indeed he is the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>God,</hi> the image of <hi>God</hi> Almighty; yet for all that, in respect of his originall, he was taken out of the ground: he is but a peece of earth, since the fall, he is a masse of sin: though he be regenerate, and by faith ingraffed into Christ, yet still he hath sin in him, and must dye. Therefore what is this man, that thou shouldest powre downe so many blessings on him? That the Sun, Moone, and Stars, should give him light? That the birds of the Ayre, fishes of the Sea, the beasts of the field should be his meat? That he should walke as a King on the earth? especially that thou shouldest send thy only Son to dye for him, make him a member of his body, and provide an everlasting kingdome for him in the life to come? What is vile, wretched, sinfull, corrupted man, that thou shouldest be so farre mindfull of him? Protect him with the shield of thy fauours from all dangers? That thou shouldest vouchsafe him thy word and Sacraments? That thou shouldest give him thy holy Spirit to helpe him to pray, and to comfort him in all miseries?</p>
                  <p>We should not be like the <hi>Peacock</hi> spreading forth our golden feathers, and say within our selves, what goodly men be we? wee ought to thinke basely of our selves: what are we that <hi>God</hi> should regard us?</p>

Yet we are wont to vaunt of our selves: doe ye not know who I am? Doest thou not consider to whom thou speakest? yes, very well. I speake to dust and ashes. Let no high conceit of our selves enter into our minds: let us thinke basely of our selves: <hi>What am I, O Lord,</hi> that thou shouldest give me the least thing in the world? A drop of drinke, a crust of bread, an hole to hide my head in, especially that thou shouldest give me thine only Son, and together with him all things that be good?</p>
                  <p>What is any man in the world? Art thou a rich man? God can puffe away thy riches and make thee poore: Art thou a wise man? God can take away thy senses and make thee a foole: art thou a beautifull man? God can send the pox and many diseases

to take away thy beauty: art thou a strong man? <hi>God</hi> can send sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and make thee weak: art thou a Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord? yet thy breath is in Gods hand. This night he can take away thy soule from thee, and what art thou then? therefore let us all have an humble opinion of our selves: let us cast downe our selves at <hi>Gods</hi> feet, and say, <hi>What are we, O Lord,</hi> that thou art mindfull of us, that thou so graciously visitest us, especially with thy everlasting mercies in <hi>Christ Iesus?</hi>

                  <p>The Angels are glorious creatures: and when we speake of an excellent man, we call him an Angell, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.9. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.15.</p>
                  <p>There is not much ods betweene the Angels and us: they are immortall wholly; we immortall in part: they have no sin, because they never fell; we that are ingrafted into <hi>Christ</hi> have sin within us, yet it is covered with the garment of <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnesse, so that it is not imputed to us.</p>
                  <p>They have a rule and dominion under GOD in the world; whereupon they are called, <hi>principalities, powers, thrones, dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> and wee have a rule in the world too, all things through CHRIST being subjected to us: they are in heaven, and behold the face of God: So wee one day shall be in heaven and like the Angels: they are endewed with wisedome, knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; So are we, though we come short of them by many a mile: they are our brethren and fellow servants: in sundry things, there is not much difference betweene them and us. We are but a little inferiour to them: we have massie, heavy, sinfull, corruptible bodies: So have not they. They tooke to them true bodies for a time, but those bodies were no essentiall parts of them, they were not personally united to them, as ours are.

How doe wee forget our selves? Hath GOD made us but a little inferiour to the Angels, and shall we live like bruit beasts, and give over our selves to all uncleannesse? How doe we disgrace that worthy estate whereunto God hath advanced us? As we draw neere to the Angels any kinde of wayes, so let us, so farre as is possible, lead an angelicall life with the Angels in this world, that we may remaine with them in the world to come.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 He answers it by a distinction of submission, or subjection. The one is externall, conspicuous to the eye of the world: the other internall, seene by the eye of faith. <hi>Christ</hi>'s kingdome is not of this world; it is not temporall, but spirituall: all things are subdued to him, though he suffer his enemies for the triall and exercise of his children to tyrannize over them for a time. A Beareheard may have a Beare under his rule and authority, though he suffer him now and then to range abroad: so hath Christ the Devill. <hi>Yet we see Iesus, that was made a little lower than the Angels, through the suffering of death, to be crowned with glory and honor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words, [<hi>Through the suffering of death,</hi>] may be referred to that which goes before, or followes after: after he had suffered death, he was crowned with glory, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p>But rather refer them to the former: he was made a little lower than the Angels through suffering of death. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12681:66"/>
Angels: not at the time he lived upon the earth; for <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. The Angels Ministred to him as servants to their Lord. But in his Passion, and Death, the Deity withdrew his power, and the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was left alone: then he was lower than the Angels: the Angels are immortall, and dye not; Christ was mortall, and died: in that respect he was inferior to them.</p>
                  <p>But he was afterwards exalted to all glory and dignity, placed at the right hand of God, and so superior to the Angels.</p>
                  <p>We that are the faithfull, see him crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; in that he raised up himselfe from the dead, ascended into heaven in a cloud in the sight of his Disciples, the Angels attending on him; in that <hi>Stephen</hi> saw him sitting at the right-hand of God; in that he sent downe the Holy Ghost from heaven, and by a few simple men to look to, through the preaching of the Gospell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all the world. We may all see him crowned with glory and honour. Thus he is higher than the Angels, though through the suffering of death, he was for a time lower than they: Christ truly suffered death, not phantastically, in a phantasticall body, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Apollinarists</hi> dreamed; he felt and indured the bitter pangs of death.</p>
                  <p>Which is illustrated by two causes, the efficient, and finall: the efficient, is the grace, love, and mercy of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. the finall, that as much as lay in <hi>Christ,</hi> all men might be saved.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST's death was sufficient for all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. effectuall only to them that beleeve, <hi>Isay</hi> 9.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. Physick is offered to many sicke Patients, that may doe them good, if they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: but many are so froward that they will none of it: the fault why they doe not recover, is not in the physicke, nor in the Physitian, but in themselves: so CHRIST offers the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne medicine of salvation, purchased by his death, to all: but some reject it, and will not beleeve it can save them. It is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for all those that be sanctified, that be his brethren, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is said, that <hi>Christ</hi> tasted death, therein he dealt as the Physitian doth: he needs not the physike prepared for his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; yet the better to induce them to take it, he tastes of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before their eyes. So death belonged not to <hi>Christ,</hi> because he had no sinne: yet he would taste of it, that we might be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to taste and drink of that cup. The Metaphor must not be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed too farre: as if <hi>Christ</hi> did but sip and taste of the cup of death; as a man tastes vinegar, but drinkes not of it: for he swallowed it up quite, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54.</p>
                  <p>It is a borrowed speech. Death is resembled to a cup whereof CHRIST did taste: <hi>let this cup passe from me.</hi> This hath reference to the time that hee continued in death, not to the sharpenesse of his death.</p>
                  <p>They that taste of a thing, tarry not long at it, their lips are quickly removed from it: so CHRIST did not continue long
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12681:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in death, not past three dayes and three nights: hee did but tast as it were of it, and so away: yet he truly dyed, and it was a most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taste to him.</p>
                  <p>Thus the tasting of death was no dishonour, but an honour to <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By it hee brought many to eternall life: for all that hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels, and all other creatures whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST hath tasted of death before us: therefore let not us that be Christians, be too much afraid of death. There is a potion brought to a sicke Patient, which the eye loathes, and the mouth distasts. The poore sick man is loath to drinke of it, the Physitian takes it into his hand, tasts of it before his eyes: by that he is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to receive it: so is it with us, death is a sowre cup, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhorreth: we are all unwilling naturally to drink of it; but for so much as <hi>Christ</hi> our loving and heavenly Physitian hath tasted of it before hand, let us not be afraid of it. The godliest men in the world cannot but in some measure feare death; <hi>Christ</hi> feared it, <hi>Et non est fortior miles quàm Imperator:</hi> yet let this be as Sugar to sweeten this bitter Cup to us; CHRIST tasted of it, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it: so shall wee doe by his vertue and power. As after the receit of a purgation, the body is the better, more sound than before: so after we have drunk this bitter Cup, of Death, both in soule and body we shall be the better, farre more glorious than before: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be willing, whensoever it shall seeme good to the Lord for us to taste it.</p>
                  <p>All of us should have died eternally: <hi>At what time thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye,</hi> both thou, and all thy posterity. Wee should have trodden the Winepresse of GOD's wrath, and beene tormented with the Devill and his angels, in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone for ever: but CHRIST hath tasted death for us all.</p>
                  <p>O the wonderfull and unspeakable love of <hi>Christ</hi>! as if a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Traytors were going to the Scaffold to be executed; the Kings Sonne should step forth to dye for them: what an admirable thing were that! We by nature are enemies to <hi>God,</hi> traytors to his Majestie: the Son of the King of Kings comes from heaven and dies for us. Is not this to be admired of us all? scarce will any dye for a righteous man; we were unholy, unrighteous, defiled with the scab of sin, in soule and body; yet the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> died for us. Life is sweet: who will dye for his friend? but will any dye for his enemy? The consideration of the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> should occupie our mindes continually: we should ever be thinking of it: it should cause us to be alwayes singing of that song, <hi>Worthy is the Lambe that was killed for us, to receive all honour, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why did <hi>Christ</hi> tast death for us? what moved <hi>God</hi> to send his Son to dye for us? Surely his owne grace, mercy, and favour: eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Well, you have affirmed Christ to be God, above the Angels, and all other creatures, and that his suffering of death was no derogation from the glory of his Deity, but a declaration of Gods grace and mercy to mankinde by his death, to preserve men from death eternall: but seeing hee was GOD, what need was there that hee should become man, suffer afflictions, and dye? Hee might have saved men by the power of his Deity, yea, even by his bare and naked word, whereby he made all things at the first.</p>
                  <p>Answer: indeed, GOD being omnipotent might have saved mankinde (if it had seemed good to him) by some other meanes than by the incarnation and death of his Son: yet this seemed to be the most fit and convenient meanes; that as man by sin had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death, so by the death of a man he should be redeemed from sin and death. The necessity of <hi>Christs</hi> incarnation, he proves, first from the end of it: He that by suffering for men, was to bring men to salvation, must be man: <hi>Christ</hi> by suffering for men, was to bring men to salvation: <hi>ergo,</hi> Christ was to bring many to glory. This he could not do but by afflictions, and namely by death it selfe: for the Crosse must goe before the Crowne: therefore it was requisite that in our humane nature he should first suffer.</p>
                  <p>It became: this was most comely, fit and convenient for him: namely, that <hi>God, ver.</hi> 9. which so graciously gave his <hi>Son</hi> for us, that is, <hi>God the Father,</hi> by whose grace and mercy Christ died for us.</p>
                  <p>It became him for the better illustration of his owneglory; for a more lively demonstration of his mercy and justice to the world; of his mercy in not sparing his owne Son, but giving him up to the death for us: of his justice, in punishing the sins of the world so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely in his owne Son.</p>

                  <p>Furthermore, as all things are by GOD, so all for him: all serve his holy will and blessed pleasure; some unwillingly, some willingly. GOD makes Satan and his instruments to be for him, whether they will or no: but the faithfull are willingly for him, and serve him with all cheerefulnesse. Let us remember, that wee our selves and all that we have, is for God: he made us, he redeemed us with the bloud of his Sonne; therefore we are his, not our owne: our wit, wealth, honour, worship, learning, our soules, our bodies, our eyes, tongues, hands, feete, all are for him: with all that wee have we must glorifie him.<note place="margin">Psal. 12.</note>

                  <p n="1">1 Here we see that CHRIST could not bring us to heaven, without innumerable afflictions, which our sinnes had deserved: he himselfe knew no sin; but he was afflicted for our sins.

a long while together. Thus was this innocent Lambe killed, and pittifully handled for our sakes. Our sins were the causes of all: <hi>He bore our infirmities, and hee was wounded for our transgressions.</hi> These were the knives that cut the throat of this Lambe; and yet shall we take delight in sin? CHRIST went through all these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, for our drunkennesse, uncleannesse, covetousnes, pride, &amp;c. yet shall we lye wallowing in these sins? the consideration of the manifold afflictions that <hi>Christ</hi> suffered for sin, should cause sin to be odious and loathsome to us all.</p>

                  <p>ANother reason, why it became <hi>Christ</hi> to be man: it is taken from the impurity of our nature. Men had sinned, and were destitute of the grace of <hi>God:</hi> they were by nature impure and unholy, conceived, borne, brought up in sin: now it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary they should be sanctified, made cleane, and holy.

                  <p>The High Priest that sanctified the people in the time of the Law, and the people sanctified by him were both of one Father, namely <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Israelites; so <hi>Christ</hi> that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth us, and we that be sanctified by him, are of one, <gap reason="foreign">

God the Father by the Son, God the Son by the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by himselfe: but Christ, as the Mediator of the Church, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth it. As the ointment came from <hi>Aarons</hi> head downe to the skirts of his garment: so the spirituall oile of holinesse, comes from <hi>Christ</hi> the Head, to us, that be his members.

                  <p>This doth give us to understand, that by nature we are unholy and un-sanctified, conceived, borne, and brought forth in sinne, the children of Gods wrath. <hi>In us,</hi> that is, <hi>in our flesh dwels no good thing.</hi> Being considered in our selves, we are Idolaters, Whoremongers, Wantons, Raylers, Drunkards, ready to be carried into all impiety.

                  <p>If CHRIST and we are all of one, much more are we among our selves.</p>
                  <p>A King and a beggar are of one: a rich man and a poore man are of one: a faire and beautifull man or woman, and they that want beauty are of one: we descended all of <hi>Adam,</hi> and were taken out of the dust of the ground: therefore let us not insult one over another. GOD for a season hath advanced one above another, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate above the Subject, the Father above the Son, the Rich man above the poore man, and every one is to be honoured according to that place, whereunto God hath exalted him: yet if we look back to our originall, to the stocke from whence we are taken, we are all of one. The Wax that hath the print of the Kings seale on it, is the same in substance with the waxe that hath the print of the seale of a meane man: yet it is honoured, in that the Kings seale is set on it: So we are all of one weake and waxie nature: save that it pleaseth God to set a more honourable print upon one, then on another. Therefore let us not thinke highly of ourselves, and contemne our brethren, but submitte to them of low degree, using the greatnesse that GOD hath given us, to the glory of the Giver. Seest thou a poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> full of sores, desirous to bee refreshed with the crumbes that fall from rich mens bordes?

                     <item>4.

                  <p>Is it not a shame that the Kings brother should bee a common drunkard, whoremaster, or such like? Doth not the King take himselfe disgraced by it? And shall wee that are <hi>Brethren</hi> to the King of Kings, take such courses, as that great ignominie should redound to CHRIST by it? As hee is not ashamed to call us brethren, so let us doe nothing that may pull a shame on him and his Gospell.</p>

Can a brother that is a wealthie man, of faire revenewes, and ample possessions, see any of his brethren goe a begging? will hee not rather receive him to his owne house, and set him at his table? CHRIST which is the Lord of heaven and earth, is our brother: therefore let us feare no want, so long as wee feare him. This may be a comfort to us in all our calamities; that CHRIST and we are <hi>brethren.</hi>

                  <p>Hee that trusteth to another, is inferiour to him, to whom hee trusts: the party whom he makes his pillar to leane upon, is superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him, greater than he: CHRIST trusted in GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: therefore in respect of his humanity, he is inferiour to the Father.</p>
                  <p>These words, whether deduced out of <hi>Isai.</hi> 12.2. or out of <hi>Psalme</hi> 18.2. are fitly applyed to CHRIST. <hi>Chasah, I will flye to him, as to a strong tower and Castle.</hi> That song in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> is sung by the whole Church, and so consequently by CHRIST the head of the Church.

the fury of his adversaries, <hi>hee would trust in God,</hi> of whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hee had comfortable experience by his deliverance from the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> as in the title: yet being a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee speaketh also of him. Sundry things in that Psalme cannot be applyed to <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Verse</hi> 43. and that, <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Whereas at the passion of <hi>Christ</hi> the earth quaked.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> in his bitter agony in the garden, trusted in <hi>God:</hi> and when he hung on the crosse, he knew that though <hi>God</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to forsake him for a time, yet hee would deliver him out of all, and assume him into his kingdome: thus he still put his trust in GOD.</p>
                  <p>If he did trust in God in all calamities, from whom the Deitie was never separated; much more ought we miserable men in all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, trust in God. <hi>Some trust in Charets, and some in Horses: but let us remember the name of the Lord our God, and trust in him. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be he that maketh flesh his arme.</hi> Let us not put our trust in riches, though our barnes be never so full of corne, our coffers of gold and silver. Let us not trust in our strength, in the multitude of our men, in our walled townes and defenced castles. Let us not put our trust in the fortitude of this good yland, that is compassed about with the Seas. Let us not put our trust in our friends. When we be sicke, let us not put our trust in the Physitions, as <hi>Asa</hi> did: not trust in our pollicie, as <hi>Achitophel:</hi> but let us alwayes in all difficulties <hi>put our trust in</hi> GOD, hee is able and willing to plucke us out of all dangers.</p>
                  <p>Hee delivered the <hi>Israelites</hi> from the red Sea: <hi>Daniel</hi> from the the Lions: <hi>Peter</hi> from the fury of <hi>Herod.</hi> Hee can and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us from all the devils of hell: the gates of hell shall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile against us.</p>
                  <p>Happy are they that put their trust in him: he is a sure friend that will never faile them.</p>
                  <p>The fourth argument to prove the humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> is taken from the relatives. The Father and the children are of one nature: <hi>Christ</hi> is the Father, we his children. <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is at large amplified by the Apostle.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that makes himselfe equall with the rest of the faithfull, and of the servants and children of God, is a man as they be: but <hi>Christ</hi> makes himselfe equall with the rest of the faithfull, of the servants and children of God. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hee that receiveth children as a gift from God, is inferiour to GOD, that gave him these children: but CHRIST receiveth children as a gift from GOD: <hi>ergo,</hi> he is inferiour to GOD: which cannot be but in respect of his humanity. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is man as well as GOD.</p>
                  <p>He produces an other testimony, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.18. That this testimony is to be applyed to the Messiah, is evident by many places in that <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> where he is called <hi>Immanuel.</hi> 2. That <hi>v.</hi> 14. is expounded of <hi>Christ</hi> in sundry places of the New Testament, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.

3. Though this was true in the Prophet himselfe, and in his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet it is verified likewise of Christ, of whom the Prophet was a Type.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Behold,</hi>] this argues his prompt and ready obedience, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe to the Lord: so <hi>Christ</hi> was obedient to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> even to the death, yea, of the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>children</hi> are meant servants, followers, attendants upon any, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.25. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.5. by them are signified the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which as children and servants waited on <hi>Christ,</hi> and attended to his voice, as children doe to the voice of their Father.</p>
                  <p>All the faithfull in the world, by whose ministery soever turned, are <hi>Christs</hi> children: he the chiefe Father; we secondarily: they are his children principally; ours instrumentally. It is CHRIST that begets us, though not now in his owne person, yet by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Preachers, who are our Fathers under Christ, and we their Children. GOD the Father gave him those children. 1. By the administration of baptisme: 2. Then by the working of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the powerfull preaching of his word: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9.6. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.29.</p>
                  <p>Properly to speake, they are given to no Prophet nor Minister, but to <hi>Christ</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>That they be as signes and wonders, agreeth well to <hi>Christ,</hi> and all the faithfull. Christ was despised, &amp; so are we, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. to 14. S. <hi>Paul</hi> might have had more pregnant testimonies for the confirmation of <hi>Christs</hi> humanity, than these be; yet he made choice of these, partly because peradventure they were applied by the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> themselves to the <hi>Messiah:</hi> partly because these set forth to us, the mercy of <hi>God</hi> towards us, and our honour and dignity, that we should be Christ's brethren, that he and we should be in a manner equall, coupled together in one yoke.</p>
                  <p>This is true in the Prophets and in CHRIST too: the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word have children given them of the Lord. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in their time had their children: the Apostles theirs: and we ours. Saint <hi>Paul begat Onesimus</hi> in his bonds. GOD gave <hi>Lydia</hi> as a child to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in opening her heart, and causing her to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Yea, many Nations were given to S. <hi>Paul.</hi> GOD gave those three thousand soules as a great company of children to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And the Lord by the ministry of the Word gives us children at this present day. You are our children; and therefore you ought to love and honour us. What childe will raile on his Father? they be Bastards that endeavour to pluck out their Parents eyes: yet some doe on the Ministers, their spirituall fathers.</p>
                  <p>This also may be affirmed of <hi>Christ</hi>; he is our brother, and our father too, he is the right and proper father of the faithfull, whom he begetteth by the word of truth: and they that are truly begotten by the word, are <hi>Christs</hi> children, whom the Father gave to him from all eternity, before all times, and whom in time he giveth to him daily, by the preaching of the Gospell to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:12681:72"/>1 We have not these children of our selves, simply by our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, be it never so powerfull: It is GOD that gives them to us.

A Father rejoyces in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; so may and doe Preachers in their Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is no Father but will protect his Children, as much as lieth in him: hee will bee content to take a blow in defence of his Childe: and doe ye think that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our spirituall Father will not defend us? A Hen hides her Chickens under her wings against the Kite: and <hi>Christ</hi> will shrowd us under the wings of his power and providence against Satan and all enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 What Father will see his childe want, being a man of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? CHRIST that is the LORD of all the world, <hi>The Earth is his, and the fulnesse thereof,</hi> will not suffer us that be his children to want the thing that is good. Because Wine is hurtfull for young children, it inflames their bloud, which is hot of it selfe, a wise Father will not give his childe Wine, yet he loves him well enough: so because GOD our heavenly Father oftentimes sees wealth, honour, ease, to bee hurtfull for his children, to drowne them in the pit of perdition, he keepes them away from them: but let us assure our selves of this, he will deny us that be his children, nothing that is good for the salvation of our soules.</p>
                  <p>As we are the children of CHRIST, so let us walke worthy of such a Father. <hi>You are of your Father the Divell,</hi> sayes <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Pharisees, for the workes of your Father ye will doe.</hi> A fearefull thing to call CHRIST Father, and to doe as the Devill bids us. A childe must doe the commandement of his Father: and if we be CHRIST's children, we must doe as he will have us. CHRIST would not have us sweare: therefore let us not rend Gods name in peeces by swearing: Christ would have us to be sober and temperate in the use of his creatures; therefore let gluttony and drunkennesse be avoided by us: let us shew our selves to be the dutifull children of Christ in this life, that we may have the inheritance prepared for children in the life to come.</p>

A spirit hath not flesh and bone, as yee see mee have: He was the fruit of his mothers wombe, made of a woman: hee names that part of our nature, which is visible, the other also being included, namely the soule, which quickned this flesh and bloud. But here is the difference.</p>
                  <list>

                  <p>Here we have a lively description of man: he is but flesh and bloud, which is weake, fraile and subject to many miseries. A knife may easily cut it, the heate scorch it, the cold benumme it: it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to thirst, hunger, faintnesse, wearinesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All flesh is as grasse. <hi>With them is an arme of flesh, with us is God.</hi> We are not steele, yron,<note place="margin">Isai. 40.6.</note> brasse: but flesh and bloud.

                  <p>The fowles of the ayre, the beasts of the field, are flesh and bloud too: yea theirs excells ours. 1. Their flesh and bloud is clothed at their first entrance: ours naked. 2.

The meanes for the vanquishing of the Devill, sinne and death, was his owne death. As the brazen Serpent was lifted up, and by looking on it the <hi>Israelites</hi> were delivered from the fierie Serpents: So Christ was lifted on the crosse; and we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by looking on him with the eye of faith.

As <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> by his owne death, vanquished the <hi>Philistims, Iud.</hi> 16.30. So CHRIST <hi>by his death overcame death, and destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devill:</hi> and that with his owne sword.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, that he might weaken the Devill, diminish his force, or give him a wound, but destroy him. So that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.31.</p>
                  <p>Not death alone, but the Devill too, the LORD of death. The Devill by carrying men into sinne, had power also to carry them into death: <hi>the wages of sinne is death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. First hee entises men to sin, and then he hath power and autoritie from God, to give them the wages they have deserved, that is death: thus he has the power of death as a thiefe and murderer.</p>
                  <p>Not to hold us in suspence, he names him the Devill, who compasses the earth to and fro, ranging up and downe like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, seeking whom he may devoure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p>There be three that have the power of death: God, Man and the Devill.</p>

                  <p>NOw he comes to the second end of <hi>Christs</hi> incarnation and death, <hi>that hee might deliver us from the divels hands: non liberaretur humanum genus, nisi sermo Dei factus esset hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus,</hi> August.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deliver them:</hi> set them free, quaking at the cogitation of death, in regard of eternall damnation which it brought with it for their innumerable sinnes, whereof their owne consciences accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them.</p>
                  <p>Deliverance is a comfortable thing, most welcome unto all: Galley-slaves and Prisoners are glad to heare of their deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Not some, but all: so many as imbrace his deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Not onely those which were bound, but subject to bondage: that had willingly subjected themselves to the Devill: which had bound themselves apprentises to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. The Indentures were made betweene them and the devill: we will serve thee, thou shalt be our Master: this was our estate.</p>
                  <p>Why were we subject to him? what kept us in subjection? the feare of death all our life time: they were subject to bondage, that is, to the stroake of death, which they expected every moment. The devill threatned death to us all our life time, every houre: being sinners, we might looke for death every moment: not onely for a temporall death, but for an eternall in hell-fire. Death is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: we quaked at the mention of death: this kept us in bondage to the devill.</p>
                  <p>A miserable condition! but <hi>Christ</hi> hath delivered us out of it: he hath taken away the feare of death, that made us to shake, the fetter, wherewith the Devill kept us bound. Now death is but a sleepe, a passage to a better life: yea, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Basil</hi> speakes. Thus he hath rescued us out of the divels clawes, and made us free, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.36. The devill, sin, and death, are left still <hi>ad agonem,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise us withall, as <hi>Antagonists</hi> to wrastle withall: but the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through Christ is ours. We sin, we dye; and <hi>the devill like a roaring Lion, walkes up and downe, seeking how to devoure us:</hi> but none of these shall be able to prevaile over us. Sinne, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, yet it doth not reigne in us. 2. The guilt and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is taken away, so that it shall not condemne us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. The sting of death is gone. <hi>O death where is thy sting? Cogitur, non abesse, sed non obesse:</hi> hence the servants of God have wished for it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved, &amp;c.</hi> Neither can it separate us from the love of God in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> The malice of Satan, that shall turne to our good. GOD may suffer him to tempt and assault us; he <hi>walkes up and downe like a roaring Lion.</hi> 1. That wee should not be secure. 2. To stir us up to pray: but, 1. we are no longer in his jurisdiction. 2. we shall be conquerors over him, <hi>God will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12681:74"/>
tread him under our feet, Rom.</hi> 16.20. and <hi>will give us an issue with the temptation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. Satan may plot against us, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. but <hi>God</hi> will confound him: he may make us sin, but he cannot make us continue in sin. Sin, the Divell, and Death, are three of the mightiest enemies that we have: all these are destroyed by <hi>Christ</hi> for us: therefore let us be thankefull to <hi>Christ,</hi> that hath wrought for us so great and gracious a deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Let us not stand in an immoderate feare of death. <hi>Death is a Serpent without a sting.</hi> Though he gripe us, yet he cannot hurt us. <hi>Damocles</hi> the <hi>Parasite</hi> extolled the magnificence of <hi>Dyonisius,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that there was not an happier man in the world than he; wilt thou have a taste of my happinesse? I: he caused him to be set in a chaire of state, the Table furnished with all delicates, singing-men and women making melodie with voices and Instruments, noble attendants to wait on him: but therewithall he commanded a sharp naked sword to be hung over his head, by a slender Horse-haire; the which he espying, tooke no pleasure in that Paradise, but besought him earnestly to take him out of his happinesse againe. So though we have the world at will, though we be Gentlemen, &amp;c. yet the sword of death hanging over our heads continually, must needs quaile the courage of the greatest Gallant.</p>
                  <l>O quàm pulchrum esset dominantibus hic dominari,</l>
                  <l>Si mors non posset dominantibus insidiari!</l>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye:</hi> when, and how suddenly we know not: our breath may be stopped on the sudden, as <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians, Luc.</hi> 12.20. We are all obnoxious to the feare of death: but <hi>Christ</hi> hath delivered us from a slavish feare of it.</p>

                  <p>HEre you have the amplification of it, by the comparison of a more excellent nature refused by him: the Angels far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe us, yet <hi>he tooke not on him their nature, but ours.</hi>

                  <p>Not the <hi>seed</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> but of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because the promise was made to him, <hi>In thy seed shall all Nations of the earth bee blessed.</hi>

                  <p>If he should have taken on him the nature of Angels; it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the good Angels, or the bad. The good needed it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they never fell: as for the evill Angels, there was no such reason, because they sinned in a more high degree than men. 1. They sinned of themselves without the instigation of any: man fell by the subtile provocation of the Serpent. 2. They sinned in heaven, in the Court of the King of Kings: we sinned on earth, which is his footstoole. 3. They were indued with more excellent gifts, of wisdome, knowledge, and understanding: we are but babes and children to them. 4. They were only of a spiritual essence, they had

no flesh to intise them to sin, as we have: but the greatest of all is his owne goodnesse, and mercy, <hi>Isai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. Both had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Angels, and men. Why was Christ made a man to dye for men, and not an Angell, to redeeme Angels, from everlasting death? because it was his owne good will and pleasure, his singular love to mankinde. Let us therefore magnifie him for it, from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation.</p>
                  <p>Some, as <hi>Augustine</hi> observeth, tooke occasion from hence to be proud and insolent. See, <hi>Christ</hi> tooke on him our nature, not the Angels: therefore we are exalted above Angels: we have just cause to thinke highly of our selves. As if a sick man should boast: the Physitian came to my house, not to my neighbours; therefore, I am a better man than my neighbour: the reason why <hi>Christ</hi> tooke on him thy nature, not the Angels, was because thou wert sick of sin: so were not the good Angels.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, it is a preferment to us, that <hi>Christ</hi> should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume our nature to his, our corruptible nature, to his incorruptible: as if a King should take the patcht cloake of a beggar, and annex it to his royall cloake, decked with Pearles, and precious Stones. Now as <hi>Christ</hi> hath honoured our nature in becomming man: so let not us men dishonour our owne nature by drunkennesse, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, covetousnesse, nor by wrangling and contending one with another. <hi>Christ</hi> hath graced our nature, let not us disgrace it.</p>

                  <p>He was like to us, in all the faculties and members of soule and body. He had the same affections that we have, yet unstained with sin.

GOD and man were fallen out, <hi>Christ</hi> made us friends. God was displeased with us, he pacified his wrath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: which the Father by an audible voice witnessed from heaven; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> How? <hi>by the bloud of his Crosse,</hi> which was <hi>Gods</hi> bloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>We were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious bloud of Christ, as of a Lambe without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish and without spot.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19.</p>

                  <p>As CHRIST was like to us in nature, so hee was tempted as we are. <hi>Saepius ipse miser, miseris succurrere dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.</hi> Art thou tempted, whether thou art the child of GOD or not? A shrowd temptation, wherewith the best men and women are sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! So was CHRIST: <hi>If thou beest the Sonne of God:</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill calls it into question, and would have had CHRIST to doubt of it. Art thou tempted with povertie, with want of things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for this life? So Was Christ; from his Cradle to his grave: he was borne in a stable, laid in a cratch, had not an hole to hide his head in; he had no money in his purse, but was faine to send to the Sea for some: he kept his Passeover in an other mans chamber, was buryed in an other mans grave. Art thou tempted with malevolent tongues, with some that are ever rayling on thee? So was <hi>Christ:</hi> hee was termed a Wine bibber, a glutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Art thou tempted with sicknesse, the toothach, the headach, the cholike, the gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We never read that <hi>Christ</hi> was sicke, because he had no sinne in him, yet being clothed with our nature, hee knowes what belongs to paine, and will succour us in all our distresses.</p>
                  <p>Art thou persecuted? <hi>Herod</hi> sought his life, as soone as he was borne. A rich man that hath a good fire continually in his house, a table furnished with all delicates, that lyes soft on a bed of dowlne, he cannot so well pitty a poore man, as one poore man may doe another.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST being rich would become poore: he would bee a man, that he might the better pittie us that be men: that he might be a mercifull high Priest to us all: and shall we be unmercifull one to another? <hi>As the elect of God, put on bowels of mercy, Col.</hi> 3.12. We have a mercifull high Priest; Let us be mercifull one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a token of a wicked man, of a reprobate, to be unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as that rich glutton was, that saw <hi>Lazarus</hi> dayly at his gates, and would have no compassion on him. True Christians are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, as <hi>Christ</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudas</hi> came howling to the high Priests and Pharises; <hi>Oh I have sinned in betraying innocent bloud:</hi> what is that to us, say they? See thou to that: So, such a neighbour is sicke in the Towne, such a one is mourning for the death of his Children, his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a poore man hath neither meat nor firing, nothing to relieve himselfe and his Children withall: what is that to us? A lamentable thing! There is a thorne in the foot that paines it, and makes it to swell: shall the head and hands say, what is that to us? We are members one of another, and we have an head that is pittifull to us. Let us be pittifull one to another, that <hi>Christ</hi> may have pittie and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on us, both in this world, and in that which is to come.</p>

As by the sound of a Trumpet the people were called together in the time of the Law: so the Word is the silver Trumpet sounding in our eares, whereby we are called to the Kingdome of Heaven. Blessed are they that be partakers of this calling. Such are we in <hi>England</hi> at this present day, if we had eyes to see it, and hearts to consider it. But GOD cals, and we refuse to come: wisdome hath made ready her Feast, she shath sent her maids into the streets to call us to her banquet, but we passe not for it. The King made a Supper for his Son, sent and invited many to it, but they made excuses and came not: so GOD calleth us continually; but some sit at home in their houses, some ride abroad, &amp;c. when <hi>God</hi> cals them to his kingdome. As we are partakers of the heavenly vocation, so let us make a precious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, that we may be called out of the kingdome of darknesse, into the kingdome of light, and remaine with Christ for ever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Consider:</hi> not lightly, as they that doe not minde the thing they looke upon: their eyes are upon it, but their minde is on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter: doe not you so, but let your minde be wholly fixed on him: look on him with the sharpe eye of your minde: consider, that in him <hi>All the treasures of wisdome lye hid:</hi> he is a rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Store-house, in whom ye may finde all the Pearles and Iewels of wholesome doctrine: in him there is salvation, and in no other, therefore all other teachers set aside, listen to him. When the Iudge of an Assises gives the charge, all that be in the shire-house, especially they that bee of the great Inquest, consider seriously what is spoken. When a <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Timothie</hi> standeth in the Pulpit, <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the Iudge of the whole World, gives a charge by his Ministery, and shall not we deeply consider it? When the King makes a speech in the Parliament-house, the whole House considers earnestly what he sayes: CHRIST IESUS the King of Kings, speakes to us in the Ministry of the Word, yet few consider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things that be spoken. The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> considered <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> well, all that he spake or did. Behold, here is a greater than <hi>Salomon: Salomon</hi> is but a foole to him. Therefore let us diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider what he sayes. If they were matters of no moment, we were not to be blamed, though we did not consider them: but being of such weight as they bee, touching the eternall salvation of our soules, what mad-men be we, that we consider them no better? If one should talke to us of gold and silver, we would consider what he sayes: <hi>Christ</hi> speakes to us of that, which surpasseth all the silver in the World, yet we regard him not. Let us consider him now, that hee may consider of us hereafter, when hee comes with his holy Angels.</p>

                     <hi>Moses</hi> in the estimation of the Iewes, was the most rare and famous Prophet, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.28.

                  <p>CHRIST is more glorious than the whole house, then all in the Church of God: therefore more glorious than <hi>Moses,</hi> a piece of the house.</p>
                  <p>The reddition is more significant. The builder of the house, in all mens judgement is to bee preferred before the house, hee is of greater estimation then the house: for his wisdome, wealth and power in building of it.</p>

                  <p>Mervaile not, though I said, the Church is built; for every house must be built of some: the Church is an house, even the house of the living GOD: therefore it must be built. By whom? Not by a mortall man, but by the immortall GOD, which is <hi>Iesus Christ. Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. is the foundation, in respect of doctrine: hee is the materiall and efficient cause of the building. An house consisting of many stones and pieces of wood, must have an artificer to put them together: so the Church consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Iewes and Gentiles, of all people in the world, must be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, by the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>The force of the Article is not to be omitted: all those things whereof wee entreate, appertaining to the Church the house of GOD.</p>
                  <p>It is true that CHRIST built all things in the world, as well as in the Church: but that is impertinent to the scope of the place: therefore it is fittest to restraine the universall particle to that which we have in hand.</p>

                  <p>The Sonne and heire hath greater preheminence in the house, then any servant. <hi>Christ</hi> is the Sonne, <hi>Moses</hi> the servant.</p>

The Sonne, especially the eldest Son and heire, is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced in the house then any servant.<note place="margin">Mark. 12.6.</note> I will send my Sonne, it may be they will reverence him. <hi>Moses</hi> being a worthy servant in the house, was greatly honoured in his time: but CHRIST is honoured in all ages.

                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.35.</note>2. The servant abideth not in the house for ever: there is change of servants almost every yeere. <hi>Moses</hi> was in the militant Church but for a time, hee served out his yeeres and went away: CHRIST tarryeth in the Church for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The servant waiteth on his Master, he sitteth not at the same boord with his Master, as the Sonne doth. So <hi>Moses</hi> was attendant on GOD: but CHRIST sitteth at the right hand of GOD as equall in Majesty with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The servant may look for his wages: but he hath no right, no title to the goods that bee in the house, as the Sonne hath. So <hi>Moses</hi> as a servant had his wages of <hi>Gods</hi> mercie, that is, eternall life: but <hi>Christ</hi> hath right to the Church, it is his possession.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A servant may bee faithfull in some measure, but not so faithfull as the Son, whose the house is, and all things in the house: wherefore <hi>Christ</hi> farre excelleth <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <p>He was no coozening and deceitfull Merchant, but faithfull in all the house of GOD, committed to his charge: but how? As a servant, not as <hi>Lord</hi> of the house.

                  <p>Wherein did his service consist? in bearing witnesse to <hi>Christ.</hi> Which hereafter should be published in all Ages concerning <hi>Christ</hi> to the people, as they were able to conceive of those heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. <hi>Moses</hi> prophesied of CHRIST, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. and <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. he wrote of CHRIST, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.46. he instituted many types and figures of our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi>; as the Paschall Lambe, the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent, &amp;c.

Gospell: this was one speciall peece of service that he did. So the Apostles were CHRIST's witnesses: and so be the preachers at this day.</p>
                  <p>Here we may behold the antiquity of the Gospell: it is at least, as old as <hi>Moses,</hi> which was the first Writer that we read of. The <hi>Athenians</hi> thought it to be a new doctrine. Yet it is as ancient as <hi>Moses</hi>; nay, as <hi>Adam:</hi> for the doctrine of the Gospell was in Paradise.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 There is no man, especially if he dwell in an house, and it be his owne, but will bestow needfull reparations on it: and do you think <hi>God</hi> will suffer his house to lye unrepaired? nay, being Gods house, we shall want nothing for soule or body.

One speciall quality of a good house is to be firme, and stable: if it be a tottering house, ready to shake in every wind and tempest, a man will have small joy to dwell in it: even so, we that be the house of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> must not be wavering and inconstant, but we must stand sure, and hold fast the graces we have received. There be two things which we must hold fast; faith and hope: the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that we have by faith, to come into the presence of God, to whom we have accesse by Christ, apprehended by faith: and by vertue whereof we may boldly call <hi>God</hi> Father, and open our minds freely to him: that is the nature of the word.</p>
                  <p>Vnto faith must be annexed hope: faith makes a Christian, hope nourishes and susteines a Christian: we must hold both fast.</p>
                  <p>As we have begun to put our trust in Christ, so we must make him our pillar to leane upon continually: as we have begun to hope for eternall happinesse purchased by Christ, so we must still stand in a stedfast expectation of it. Though persecution arise for the Gospell, though we be clapt up into prison, banished out of our country, though we be put to the fire for the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet let us not cast away our hope, let us not deny Christ, and sleepe in an whole skin: let not the pleasures and profits of this world carry us away from Christ: though death it selfe come, yet let us trust in him. We are wont to be hold-fasts in our money, none shall easily get that from us: but let us chiefly be hold-fasts in the Pearles and graces of the Spirit. Whatsoever comes, let us hold faith and hope fast: let Houses and Lands, Wife and Children, yea, our owne life goe, rather than them. Thus if we hold the confidence that we have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12681:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in CHRIST, and the rejoycing of our hope to the end, we shall be <hi>Gods</hi> houses in this life, and be received up into that house which is made without hands in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>He doth not simply say, (<hi>hope,</hi>) but <hi>the rejoycing of the hope,</hi> the glorying of hope. Satan and his instruments goe about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw our hope, and mocke at it. It is a goodly thing I warrant you, which you hope for? What fooles are you, in hope of an imaginarie kingdome hereafter, to deprive your selves of so many pleasures in this life? bee wiser than so: A bird in the hand is better than two in the bush. Take your pleasure whyle you be here, and hope not, yee cannot tell for what.</p>
                  <p>To that hee opposeth this glorying and rejoycing. Yea,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.2.</note> boast of your hope, even before your enemies faces, what excellent things are reposed for you, and rejoyce in this hope, as if you had the kingdome of heaven already.</p>
                  <p>Not as if these did make us the house of GOD: but by these wee shall have an assurance to our selves, that we are the house of GOD.</p>
                  <p>A Father sayes to his Sonne, if thou wilt be no Ale-house hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but doe as I will have thee, thou shalt be my Sonne: this doth not make him his Sonne; for he was his Sonne before: but it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures him to be his Sonne. A Captaine sayes to his souldier, if thou wilt play the man, and not shrinke in the wetting, thou shalt be my Souldier, yet hee was his Souldier before: so here, if yee hold fast faith and hope, ye shall be my house; that is, all the world shall see indeede that you are my house; not for a while, but to the end: So as neither we faint in persecution, nor in the time of pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity bee drowned in the pleasures and profits of this world. Be faithfull to the end: <hi>he that continueth to the end shall be saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second argument is desumed from the testimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the allegation of the testimony, first a charge, not to shut up their eares and hearts against this worthie and heavenly Prophet, but to entertaine him with all reverence. Secondly, a strengthning of the charge by an argument, which he disputeth by the example of their fathers.</p>
                  <p>Where, first the sinne of their fathers: then the punishment of the sinne. Their sin is set downe, first generally; then particularly, with the circumstances belonging to it; of the place where it was committed, the persons by whom, the nature and quality of the sin: amplified by the meanes they had to call from it, the time how long they continued in this sinne.</p>
                  <p>The punishment is double. 1. GODS wrath and displeasure. 2. A definitive sentence proceeding from it, an exclusion of them out of his rest.</p>

                  <p>SEeing we have such a rare and excellent Prophet, as is not as a servant, but as the Sonne in the house of GOD, let us attend to him: and for so much as faith makes us to be of this house, and hope is as a pillar for the susteining of us in it; let us beware of infidelity, that pulls downe the house, and shuts up the doore against this Prophet, that he cannot enter in into us.</p>
                  <p>Now because hee was to make a commemoration of the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse and contumacie of the ancient <hi>Israelites,</hi> which in time rejected this Prophet, and would not heare him; very wisely for offending of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he delivers it in the words of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> rather then of his owne.

                  <p>The Author of this Epistle was not ignorant, that <hi>David</hi> was the penman or Authour of this Psalme: for he himselfe affirmeth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.7. yet he doth not say, as <hi>David</hi> speaketh, but as the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> saith: whereby he gives us to understand; that the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the third person in the glorious Trinity speaketh in the Scriptures: the whole Scripture is given by inspiration of <hi>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. this heavenly spirit did breath them into those worthy instruments, which he used:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. ult.</note>

This then is the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the sacred Scripture above other wrytings. In other books men speake: but in this God speaketh. In other writings, <hi>Tullie, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Plato, Aristotle, Plutarch</hi> speaketh, who indeed were wise and learned men: but in the bookes of holy Scripture the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speaketh, which is the fountaine of all wisdome.

The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speaketh in the bookes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> of the Psalmes, of the Prophets, in the bookes of the New Testament: yet such is the blindnesse of our understanding, and the corruption of our nature, that we preferre humanity before Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the writing of men before the writings of God, the Moone before the Sunne: wee had rather be reading of humane Authors, then of these heavenly books, wherein the HOLY GHOST spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to us.</p>

                  <p>He hardned the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.30. GOD hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not only <hi>permissivè,</hi> but also <hi>activè:</hi> the LORD hath a kinde of act in it, his providence is in it. <hi>He gave up the Gentiles unto their owne lusts, Rom.</hi> 1.24.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee sendeth the wicked strong delusions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve lies.</hi> He did not only suffer <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart to be hardned, but he hardned it indeed: How? Not <hi>infundendo malitiam,</hi> by infusing evill into our hearts, for they be as pots full of all impiety already: GOD needs not, nay GOD cannot, it is repugnant to his nature, to put any evill into us: yet hee doth not harden onely <hi>subtrahendo gratiam,</hi> though that bee one meanes; but by having an operation in the action: yet so as he is free from the least imputation of sinne. As hardnesse of heart comes from GOD, it is a punishment of sin, of our former contempt of his grace and mercie offered to us: as it proceedeth from our selves, it is a sinne, yea an horrible sinne.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we first contemne that grace which should soften our hearts, and then God hardens them.</p>
                  <p>We our selves, properly to speake, are the hardners of our own hearts. GOD gives us his sacred word as a trumpet to waken us out of sinne, he sends us his Ministers and Preachers, as bells to toll us to the kingdome of heaven: they will us in GODS name to believe in CHRIST, to forsake our sinnes, be they never so neere or deere unto us: we for all that, harden our hearts, that those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly admonitions cannot enter into them. Let God say what hee will, let him preach by his Embassadours; we will still continue in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12681:82"/>
unbeliefe and dwell in our sinnes: we say with them in the Gospell, <hi>we will not have this man to reigne over us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 19.14.</note> Sinne shall be our King, Lord and Master. CHRIST IESUS shall not rule us by his word and Spirit. This is the hardnesse of heart that is in us by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Oh Hierusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yee would not? Matth.</hi> 23.37. The LORD sent his Prophets early and late: 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. and in <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.12. there is a wonderfull example to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>This hardnes of heart reigneth exceedingly at this present day, yea even in those townes where there is most plentifull preaching. Therefore let us intreat the LORD <hi>to give us a new heart, to take from us this heart of stone, and give us an heart of flesh:</hi> let us desire him, by the dew of his spirit to mollifie our hearts, that the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrines, exhortations and admonitions delivered to us, may sinke deepely into our hearts, and make a conversion of us: that our hearts may melt, as <hi>Iosiah's</hi> did at the hearing of the law. Nothing can enter into that which is hard: if the ground be hard, it cannot receive the seede: if the Waxe be hard, it cannot take the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any seale: and so long as our hearts remaine hard, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the immortall seed of the word, nor the print of the Spirit, which is GODS seale. Wherefore let us be suiters to God, to soften our hearts daily more and more. Above all evills, the Lord deliver us from hardnesse of heart, for that is the ready way to hell. When yee be at Sermons, harden not your hearts against the vices, that are reproved, but tremble at the word of GOD, bee grieved for your sins, open the doores of your hearts to the <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> which standeth knocking at them with the hammer of his word, that he may come and suppe with you in this life, and you dine and suppe with him in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>From this hardnesse of heart he disswadeth them, by the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement of God, that fell upon their fathers for it: which he propounds first generally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the provocation. Hebr. (Meribah:)</hi> in the chiding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, when the fathers chode and contended with <hi>Moses:</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls an exacerbation or provocation, because God by that was provoked to anger, in so much as he became very bitter in words and deeds towards the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

                  <p>Doe not you dance after that Pipe, and walke according as they did.</p>

                     <hi>Temptation. Hebr. (Massah,)</hi> which is expounded afterwards.</p>
                  <p>It is a question among interpreters, to what place of the Old Testament Saint <hi>Paul</hi> heere alludeth. Some referre it to that, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. Where after the returne of the Spies they despaired of entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and murmured against GOD and <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others, to that. <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. where water came out of the rock: whereas before, they murmured for want of water. There may be some allusion to both places: for the one place hath her name of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12681:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the contending, and tempting, and is called, (<hi>Massah</hi> and <hi>Meribah</hi>;) and in the other place is contained the forme of the oath that God used.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, it were fittest to expound it generally of the stubborne and contumelious behaviour of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, then of any one particular temptation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because he names no particular place, but the wildernesse in generall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because the tempting he speaketh of here, lasted the whole forty yeeres.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word, (<hi>day,</hi>) is often taken in Scripture not for any set and prescript time, but for an indefinite time, a continuance of time, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 25.5. all the time that the temptation lasteth, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 50.15.

                  <p>The Father of lights must bee preferred before the fathers of darknesse: the Father of heaven before the fathers on earth. If we delight in antiquity, let us do as the ancient of dayes prescribeth us: let us not dote with our fathers, and goe to hell with our fathers.</p>
                  <p>Children must bee content to heare of their fathers sinnes, for the better avoyding of them.

                  <p>The quality of their sinne, was a tempting and proving of him: <hi>probaverunt:</hi> that is <hi>causâ curiositatis exquisiverunt an possem facere: Num.</hi> 11.18.</p>
                  <p>God is tempted diverse wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If having meanes, we neglect them, fondly flying to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed providence of GOD: if CHRIST having a paire of staires to come downe by, should have cast himselfe downe from the pinnacle of the Temple, he had tempted GOD. Many that be sicke, would faine be well, but they are resolute to use no physicke: many would gladly fare well, have sufficient for themselves, their Wives and Children, but they will not labour, nor take paines: that is a tempting of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men tempt God, when having had evident proofe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest experience of his wisedome, power, mercy, and goodnesse; yet if they be driven into any streights, and see no present meanes to come out, then they murmure against God, despaire of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are ready to exclaime against God. This was the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> fault: and thus often times they tempted <hi>God</hi> in the wildernesse. If they wanted water to quench their thirst withall; then they must needs dye, <hi>God</hi> was not able to provide them water.</p>
                  <p>If they wanted bread; So they did likewise, and in a pelting chafe were ready to stone <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Then they would back againe to <hi>Aegypt</hi>; then they wished themselves dead: as if the same <hi>God,</hi> that had miraculously beyond the expectation of men provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them heretofore, was not able to doe so still. So when some told them of the walled townes that were in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12681:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the mighty Gyants that were in the Country in comparison of whom they were but Grasse-hoppers; then they brake forth into this exclamation; God is not able to bring us into this land; wee and our Children shall perish in this wildernesse.</p>
                  <p>They had seene with what a strong hand God had brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> how miraculously he divided the red Sea, that the waters stood as a wall on both sides till they safely passed over: yet for all that, when they were in any difficulty, then God was no body, of no power or willingnesse to doe for them. This was a vile tempting of God, which highly displeased him.</p>
                  <p>But there is no reason, why we should thus tempt <hi>God,</hi> casting off the hope and confidence we have in him. He is subject to no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; <hi>yesterday and to day the same for ever.</hi> Men may change, but <hi>God</hi> changes not: a man may be strong to day, and weake to morrow; whole to day, and sick to morrow; rich now, and poore afterwards: alive now, and dead a while after: a man may love us this houre, and hate us the next, as <hi>Amnon</hi> did his sister: therefore we may make a question of the helpe of man. But <hi>God</hi> is one and the same conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>not a shadow of turning in him:</hi> his arme is never shortned, the welspring of his mercy and goodnesse is never dryed up.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in all distresses let us trust in him, though all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes fayle us: in sicknesse and health, in poverty and wealth, in death and life, let him be our pillar to leane upon. The Prince that would not believe the plenty, that GOD had promised, was troden to death, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 7.17. and the carkasses of these men that thus tempted God, fell in the wildernesse: therefore let us beware of incredultie. As Faith is the best vertue: so infidelitie is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vice. CHRIST could doe nothing among his owne kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, because of their unbeliefe. Shall any thing bee impossible with God? Indeed, that which he wills not, that he cannot doe: it is his will that CHRIST in respect of his humanity should be in heaven, till the day of judgement: therefore he cannot doe this, make his body to be here on the earth. The Papists set Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency on the tainters, and stretch it too farre, as some bad clothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers deale with cloath.</p>
                  <p>But if God have once given us his faithfull promise to doe this or that, let us believe it, though all the world say nay to it. God had promised to bring them into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though there were never so many blockes in the way, they should have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on this promise. So God hath promised us the kingdome of heaven: <hi>feare not little flocke, it is your Fathers pleasure to give you the kingdome, Luke</hi> 12.32. though now and then through weakenesse we fall into sinne, though Satan and his instruments rage, though we be sicke, dye, be buryed, our bodyes consumed to dust and ashes, yet let us certainely know wee shall have this kingdome.</p>
                  <p>This is amplified by an excellent meanes which they had to pull them out of this infidelity: which was a continuall view and contemplation of the wonderfull workes of God: although they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12681:84"/>
saw my workes, in the <hi>Hebr.</hi> they saw the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> drowned in the red Sea, and themselves safely walking through it, they saw the cloudy pillar, conducting them day and night; water gushing out of a stonie rocke; Manna descending from heaven, that the clothes on their backes and shooes on their feet did not waxe old many yeares together, they might have felt with their hands the power and goodnesse of GOD protecting them; yet they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him: whereas the sight of Gods former workes should strengthen our faith in all future calamities. That use did <hi>David</hi> make of the workes of GOD. The LORD delivered mee from the clawes of the <hi>Beare,</hi> and pawes of the Lion: therefore hee will deliver mee from this <hi>Philistim.</hi> GOD was gracious to mee in such a sicknesse: therefore hee will be in this. GOD provided for mee when I was a child and could not shift for my selfe: therefore hee will provide for me being a man growne. GOD preserved mee in such a plague and pestilence, therefore I will depend on him still: when I was in such an extremity, GOD helped me; therefore he will helpe me still. God delivered England in the yeare one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred eightie eight, therefore if England serve him, hee will deliver it still.</p>
                  <p>When Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the mirrour of the world, was taken away, we looked for a wofull day; yet God gave us a joyfull day after it: therefore alwayes let us trust to him: let the sight of his wonderfull workes dayly before our eyes, be as oyle to nourish the lampe of our faith, that it never dye.</p>
                  <p>The last circumstance appertaining to this sinne, is the time how long it continued, they tempted and proved him 40. yeares, though they saw his workes. These words in the <hi>Hebr.</hi> are coupled with that which followeth: 40. <hi>yeares was I grieved with that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Yet there is no jarre betweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> for these two are convertible, and depend the one on the other.</p>
                  <p>They be both true: they tempted God 40. yeares, and he was grieved with them 40. yeares. If they tempted him 40. yeares, then he must needs be grieved with them: and if God was grieved with them 40. yeares, then they tempted him so long, so that the one cannot be separated from the other.</p>
                  <p>They dwelt in this sinne a long time, and would not bee plucked out of it.</p>

                  <p>Least it should seeme to be a griefe or anger without reason, he shewes the equity of it: they were a blind, ignorant and perverse people, that would not heare mee; therefore I was worthily grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with them.</p>
                  <p>They are a vagrant and wandring people, straying out of the way. He doth not say, they have erred; but erre: continually er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: ever.

                     <hi>Wayes,</hi> that is my lawes and commandements. These bee the wayes wherein wee ought to walke: or, <hi>my workes: quia per ea ad nos venit,</hi> to impart his benefits to us, and to open himselfe to us. They had meanes enough to come to the knowledge of my wayes: my servant <hi>Moses</hi> and others were ever teaching of them, but they willingly continued ignorant, and would not know my wayes. For this cause I have cast them off; this is that corruption which is in us all by nature: an ignorance of the will of God, that carries us from Gods wayes to the Devils wayes, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is in men a double ignorance: the one is <hi>simplex &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita,</hi> the other is <hi>composita &amp; affectata.</hi> All by nature erre and are drowned in ignorance. <hi>Paul</hi> saw at <hi>Athens</hi> an inscription on an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>ignoto deo:</hi> but many of them, if God send the candle of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge amongst them, skip for joy, and imbrace it with both armes.

Such were many of these <hi>Israelites,</hi> they would not know the wayes of God. A fearefull thing to live in the Church where God is preached, and not to know him.</p>

The sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of these imprecations, doth argue that they should bee sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome used by us. So did <hi>Abram, Gen.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Christ, Mar.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.44. whereas we in our anger cannot containe our selves, but furious speeches come by and by out of our mouthes. If I be not even with him, I pray God I may sinke where I stand, never enter into the kingdome of heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We should not be so rash in producing of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God,</hi> as ye see, <hi>sweares,</hi> so may wee doe: if we could keepe our selves within those limits, that he did.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God sweares seldome: the Scripture doth not bring him in swearing often: at every word, as we doe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God sweares, it is by himselfe, by no creature: wee sweare by bloud, wounds, fire, bread, cheese, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a matter of weight that makes God sweare: he doth not sweare upon every trifling occasion, as wee doe: it was a matter of importance that made him sweare now, even the establishing of his justice, that men should beware how they provoke him by their sinnes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God sweares not rashly in heat and choller, as wee doe: if our bloud be stirred, then wee sweare vengeably. Though it be here said, <hi>hee sware in his wrath,</hi> yet it was a just and advised anger; not a cholericke furie, as ours is.</p>
                  <p>There bee two things that make God sweare: the one is the confirmation of his mercie, and gracious promises to his Children; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                  <p>The other is the strengthning of his justice, and threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked; as in this place: and let us beware when God sweares. If the King doe not only say, such a man shall dye, but sweares to it, then there is little hope of life for him. God hath not only said but sworne, that all contemners of his word, that harden their hearts against it, shall perish eternally. Therefore there is no dallying, let us looke to it.</p>
                  <p>An horrible sinne that wrings an oath from God.</p>
                  <p>It is called, <hi>his rest,</hi> because he in his eternall counsell prepared
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12681:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it for them, and promised it to them long agoe: and it was he that brought them into that rest.</p>
                  <p>This rest is double. 1. The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which is called a rest in regard of their continuall toyles and turmoyles in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where they were alwayes molested with flitting up and down: but when they came into this land, they should <hi>rest.</hi> Heere they rested under their Vines and Figtrees: hence it hath the name of <hi>rest.</hi> 2. By it also is meant the Kingdome of Heaven, where wee shall <hi>rest with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob for ever.</hi> Now were all they that dyed in the wildernesse, excluded from that rest too? no. <hi>Moses</hi> never came into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> yet he came into the Kingdome of Heaven. I dare not say, that all that were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the flood, went to hell; nor, that all were deprived of the celestiall <hi>Canaan,</hi> that missed of the earthly: but the wicked persisting in their sinnes without repentance, undoubtedly lost both.</p>
                  <p>The cause why they were deprived of this rest, was their stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne contempt of God, in his Servant <hi>Moses</hi> speaking to them from time to time. He perswaded them by a true and lively faith to depend upon God, assuring them, that as he had promised them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> so, what difficulty soever came, he would one day put them into a peacefull possession of the Land: but they would not beleeve it: when any thing crossed them, then they would goe to <hi>Aegypt</hi> againe. Therefore let us take off that sinne, that we be not partakers with them of the punishment. As <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>behold a greater than Salomon is heere:</hi> So say I of the ministery of the Gospell, <hi>a greater than Moses is heere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the ancient <hi>Israelites</hi> lost the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and some of them the Celestiall <hi>Canaan</hi> too, for despising <hi>Moses,</hi> and for murmuring against him and grieving him: how shall we escape that contemne <hi>Christ,</hi> the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, which is so farre greater than <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Sonne and heire of the house, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the servant in the house?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> spake by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles in their time, and he speaketh by us, which are His Ambassadours at this day: therefore harden not your hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his preaching, least he shut you out of his rest, but reverently embrace his preaching, let <hi>Christ</hi> enter into your hearts by His Word and Spirit; that ye may have rest and peace of conscience in this life; and be received up into his everlasting rest where ye shall never be molested any more, in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the application of the former testimony: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 1. A naration of the use, that we are to make of it. 2. A further declaration or exposition of it, <hi>à</hi> 16. to the end. In the use. 1. An admonition. 2. A reason. In the admonition. 1. A disswasion from the poyson of infidelity, that was the bane and destruction of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> 2. A perswasion to a mutuall exhorting and stirring up one of an other: which may be a counter-poyson against infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12681:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If any in the time of the Law have beene punished for any sin, let us take heede of that sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whereas the Apostle chargeth us especially to take heede of an evill and unfaithfull heart; it gives us to understand, that every Christian is to looke most carefully to his heart. It is good to set a watch over our eyes, hands, feete, tongues, but chiefely for to set a watch over our hearts: <hi>Keep thy heart with diligence, omni custodia.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> The heart carries all the body, as the great wheele in a clocke doth the whole clocke: therefore let us all have an eye to it, that it bee in good temper. <hi>Out of the heart come Murders, Adulterie,</hi> all kinde of mischiefes: therefore let us take heede to our hearts. It is a folly to goe about to stop the streame, if the fountaine remaine unstopped. A beautifull apple is not worth a straw, if it be rotten at the Core. The roote of the tree is especially regarded by every good husband, that there be no wormes in it: otherwise it is a folly to looke to the branches. Let us that be Christians, sift and examine our hearts, let us labour to purge and clense them: especially, let us take heede, that the worme of infidelity, which will cause us to depart from <hi>God,</hi> be not breeding in them.</p>
                  <p>That is the maine point that he aymeth at. Infidelity is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sin. As faith is the greatest vertue: so infidelity is the greatest vice. <hi>Christ</hi> could doe nothing among His owne brethren, for their unbeliefe sake: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi> Infidelity is a barre to keepe out <hi>Gods</hi> blessings. Our Saviour after His Resurrection reproved the eleven Apostles, for their infidelity. <hi>Marke</hi> 16.14. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> shall rebuke the world of sin, because they did not believe in <hi>Christ: Iohn</hi> 16.9. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were cut off for their infidelity, and we that bee Christians stand by faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. The noble man that would not believe <hi>Gods</hi> promise, was trodden under feet in the gate: 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 7.17. The ancient <hi>Israelites</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> brought with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty arme out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> perished in the wildernesse for their infidelity, and never set a foote into the promised land. Therefore take heed, there be not in any of you an unfaithfull heart: shall we not believe <hi>God?</hi> shall we make him a lyer? hath he said it, and shall He not do it? Let us not upon the sight of every difficulty murmure against <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, and cast away the hope wee have in His mercy and power; but let us at all times, and in all extremities trust in Him.</p>
                  <p>Let us never depart from <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> which is the high and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did.

There is no name under heaven, whereby we can be saved, but the name and power of <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore let us not depart from <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> to circumcision and other <hi>Iewish</hi> ceremonies, to seeke salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the observation of the law: but as wee have begun to fight as Souldiers under <hi>Christs</hi> banner; so let us continue fighting to the end.

                  <p>NOw as a Sovereigne remedy against infidelity and hardnesse of heart, he prescribeth a mutuall exhortation unto them, that will be as a trumpet singing in our eares, to keepe us out of the sleepe of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Call one to another,</hi> as Souldiers doe in the battell. Still hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the same metaphor. As souldiers when they be in the fight and conflict, call one to another, saying, ô be of good cheere, play the men, start not aside, cleave to your company, be not afrayd of enemy, the victory shall be ours: So we, that be CHRIST's Souldiers, must stirre up and provoke one another. Cast not off your confidence that ye have in CHRIST, let neither Satan, nor any of his instruments pull you from <hi>Christ,</hi> the author and finisher of your salvation; be not faint hearted, but hold out to the end.</p>
                  <p>This mutuall exhortation one of another is amplified three kind of wayes: 1. By the time, when it is to be performed. 2. By the occasion, which is not to be neglected. 3. By the end, for the which it is worthy to be practised. The time, when, is not once or twise, but, <hi>daily.</hi> 1. We are forgetfull of heavenly matters: therefore we have need to be put in mind of them every day. 2. We are dull and slow in practise of them, lazie horses that will scarcely go, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must be put forward with the spurre of dayly exhortation. As <hi>Christ</hi> sayd concerning the forgiving of our brother, that wee must forgive him 77. times: so it may be affirmed of the exhorting of our brethren, we must exhort them 77. times: we must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exhorting them. Many thinke if they have called on their brethren once or twice to pray, to goe to Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have done their duty. I have told him of it often, I will speake no more to him of it: I but thou must exhort him <hi>every day.</hi> That which is not effected to day, may be effected to morrow: <hi>gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed sape cadendo.</hi> Therefore exhort him every day: if thou doest no good on him, yet he is left without excuse, and thy reward is with <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 To this duty of <hi>exhortation</hi> he stirreth us up, by the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time, which he wishes us to lay hold of. What is this day? Some interpret it of the time of the Gospell, which hath the name of day, in regard of the great light that is in it: whereas the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12681:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time of the Law may be compared to the night in comparison of it. But I take that to be curious. Others expound this day to be the whole course of our life, which in respect of the brevity of it is termed by one <hi>Diecula.</hi> While our life lasteth, which is but short; let us exhort one another. That is good counsell; yet I take it not to be the direct meaning of the place. By <hi>day</hi> he meaneth that gracious time wherein <hi>God</hi> stretcheth forth his armes to us in the ministery of his Word, to call us unto his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>We are to take the opportunity offered to us, and not let it slip: <hi>walke, while yee have the light,</hi> while our peace lasteth: that we may conveniently goe one to another, while we have the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, whereby we may learne how to exhort one another; while GOD speaketh unto us by His ambassadours, from whose mouth we may have instructions for a wise execution of this duty: while the candle of truth shineth among us, let us be carefull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another, in these peaceable dayes, in this flourishing time of the Gospell; let this Christian duty be performed by us all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third is the danger that will ensue, if exhortation be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>hardnesse of heart</hi> will grow, and so our brethren shall bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable. The which hardnesse of heart is amplified by the efficient cause of it, the deceitfulnesse of sinne, carrying us like a thiefe out of the way and leading us to destruction, that is the nature of the word.</p>
                  <p>There be many to <hi>deceive</hi> us. 1. We <hi>deceive</hi> our selves.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.8. 2. The Divell that sly serpent <hi>deceiveth</hi> us. 3. Sin <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth</hi> us: and that she doth three kind of wayes. 1. by putting on the visard of vertue. Adultery is but a tricke of youth: a sweet sin that may easily bee borne withall: covetousnesse is but thrift and good husbandry, every man must have a care of his owne estate: swearing is the part of a Gentleman, of a generous and heroicall spirit; they be nice fellowes base minded men, that will not sweare, there is no life in them: drunkennesse is good fellowship, they be misers that wil not spend a penny in an Ale-house, we mault-men are the only companions in the world. Thus we are coosened by sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sinne <hi>deceiveth</hi> us by shrouding it selfe under the coate of <hi>Gods</hi> mercy. But let us not be so afrayd of sin. <hi>God</hi> is mercifull, he will wincke at such light sinnes as these be; we shall never be called into GODS counting house for them: whereas he is a severe punisher of sin, even in his owne children.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Sinne <hi>deceiveth</hi> us by custome in sinning. Many sins at the first we were afrayd to commit, our consciences checked us for them: but in processe of time being inured to them, we commit them without feare or shame. A custome in sinning makes sin at the length seeme to be no sin. The children of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being used to stripes, had no feeling of stripes: and after we have beene used to sin, we have no sence or feeling of sin. Thus especially we come to be hardned through the deceitfulnesse of sin, our owne consciences feared up with an hot iron. Therefore for the avoyding
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12681:88"/>
of this, <hi>let us exhort one an other dayly,</hi> that the fire and heat of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may cause our hearts to melt, and so keepe us from being <hi>hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhortation,</hi> if it be used in time, will be as a trumpet to waken our selves and others out of sin. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> went from towne to towne, <hi>exhorting the brethren. Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>Exhort one an other, and edifie one another.</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.11. <hi>have compassion on some, putting difference: and others save, with feare pulling them out of the fire. Iude, verse</hi> 22.23. But alas this duty is neglected: every one for himselfe, and <hi>God</hi> for us all. <hi>Am I my brothers Keeper?</hi> I will looke to my owne soule as well as I can, what have I to doe with my brothers soule? Let not us that be Christians, have such a thought in us. Let us as the Scripture willeth us, <hi>exhort one an other dayly,</hi> labour to preserve one an other from being <hi>hardned through the deceitfulnesse of sin,</hi> and let us be as Bells to toll one another to the Kingdome of Heaven, that we and our brethren glorifying CHRIST in this world, may be glorified with Him in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>THe reason of the Caveat is taken from the common estate and condition of Christians: which is illustrated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition carefully to be observed by them.</p>
                  <p>They that are partakers of one Christ, and of one Saviour, ought to have a care of the Salvation one of an other, and labour by the cable-rope of <hi>exhortation</hi> to pull one an other out of sin: but we that professe the Gospell are partakers of one Christ: therefore <hi>let us exhort one another,</hi> and save one an others soule.</p>
                  <p>One member must respect an other. If the foote be ready to fall into a ditch, the hand must pull it up. We are members of the same body, whereof Christ is Head; therefore we should keep one an other from the pit of sin. They that be brethren, that have one Father and Mother, should be jealous of the good estate one of an other. We are brethren in Christ, he is the elder brother to us all: therefore let us have a tender care of the salvation one of an other. As we are partakers of Christ, so let us participate the grace which we receive from Christ, one to another. They that passe not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their brethren sinke or swim, goe to heaven or to hell, doe argue that they have no portion in Christ: for if they had, the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Christians would be deare unto them. <hi>Let us exhort one an other daily,</hi> because we are partakers of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Here likewise wee behold the singular dignity of Christians: they are partakers of <hi>Christ:</hi> they are <hi>Christ</hi>'s partners and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. There is a mutuall participation betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and us: he partakes with us of flesh and bloud, he takes the load of our sinnes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12681:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on his back and beares them for us: and we partake with him in all his benefits. There is nothing that <hi>Christ</hi> hath, but we have part of it: his wisedome, holinesse, his righteousnesse is ours; yea his kingdome is ours. We are heyres, yea coheyres with him of his kingdome. As the man at the day of marriage sayes to his Wife, with all my worldly goods I thee endow: so the Lord Iesus our Husband, that in mercy hath married us to himselfe, endoweth us with all his goods: by reason whereof being poore of our selves and worth nothing, we become exceeding rich. <hi>Christ</hi> is ours, death, life, the world is ours. O unspeakable prerogative vouchsafed to dust and ashes. Let us walke worthy of this honour whereunto we are advanced: being <hi>Christs</hi> partners, let us not be the Devils part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Let us not partake with the Devill in sinne, in blaspheming the name of GOD, contemning of his Word, in pride, malice and other abominations: but as we be partakers of <hi>Christ,</hi> so let us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of <hi>Christs</hi> vertue. Let us be holy as he is holy; humble, as he is humble: let us contemne this world with all the vaine pleasures that bee in it, as hee did. What fellowship is there betweene CHRIST and <hi>Belial?</hi> If CHRIST be ours, let not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell be ours.</p>
                  <p>This is good newes: we are partakers of CHRIST, therefore we may sleepe soundly on both Eares, we need take thought for nothing? Not so: such a thought cannot be incident into <hi>Christs</hi> partners; for we be partakers of <hi>Christ, if we hold,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>I do not deny, but it is a good sence: yet without any circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution or violence offred to the words, it may fitly be translated, <hi>if wee hold fast the beginning of the subsistence and being that we have in him.</hi> For <hi>Hypostasis</hi> most properly doth signifie <hi>a subsistence,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the etymologie of the word.</p>
                  <p>If as we have begun by faith to have a being in <hi>Christ</hi>; so wee hold fast this our being to the end, <hi>growing up daily in him, till wee come to a perfect age in Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christians must not needlesly doubt of their salvation. Why doubtest thou, ô man of little faith? as <hi>Christ</hi> hath promised to us a kingdome, so hee will undoubtedly performe his promise: for there is not in him a shadow of turning. We must say with <hi>Paul,</hi> I am perswaded, neither life nor death shall bee able to separate us from the love of CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Yet we must distinguish between faith and presumption. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must not set all at six and seven: <hi>be not high minded, but feare. Blessed is the man that feareth alwayes.</hi> A Child may feare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please his father, and yet not doubt of his fathers love.</p>
                  <p>As we have begun in <hi>Christ</hi> so let us continue in him. Yee are they that have continued with me in my temptations, therefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point

When they heard, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to anger: therefore take heede how yee heare: if ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the messengers, by whom God speaketh, if ye regard not their word, God will be mightily offended with you.</p>
                  <p>They made God bitter against them.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore whereas he saies <hi>some,</hi> not all, it teaches us that the word of God is never without some fruite: some or other profit by it. The thorny ground, the stony, the ground by the high way side received not the seed, yet some good ground received it, and brought forth fruit. When the booke of the Law was read, the hearts of all that heard it, were not hardned. <hi>Iosiahs</hi> heart melted at it. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the assembly at Athens, the wise and learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers mocked at Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached <hi>Christ,</hi> and the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: yet some believed at his Sermon, as <hi>Dionysius:</hi> amongst the women to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> spake, one <hi>Lydia</hi> believed. Let this encourage us that be <hi>Christs</hi> Ambassadours: our labour is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fruitlesse, we shall carry some sheaves or others into the barne of the Kingdome of heaven. Though many in a towne, where the word is preached, provoke <hi>God</hi> to anger, they heare, and regard it not: yet some there be in whom we may rejoyce; and though there were none, yet our reward is with <hi>God.</hi> A fisherman is to bee commended for his painefulnesse in his calling, though he get never a fish: So God will reward us His Spirituall fishermen: though we should not catch one fish in the net of the Gospell; yet for the most part there be some in the worst towne that is, that profit by the ministery of the Word: these some though they be few, shall be our crowne of rejoycing at the latter day. Againe, heere we see the estate of the Church militant: the bad are alwayes mingled with the good, Cockle and Corne in the field, chaffe and wheat in the barne floore. In this house there be earthen, and golden vessels. In the Church triumphant no uncleane thing; <hi>all dogs, enchanters, &amp;c.</hi> stand without, and are not admitted in: but in the militant Church, there be many dogs, prophane persons, as <hi>Esau</hi> was: there is a <hi>Cain,</hi> as well as an <hi>Abel</hi>; a <hi>Saul,</hi> as a <hi>David</hi>; an <hi>Ishmael,</hi> as an <hi>Isaac</hi>; a <hi>Iudas,</hi> as a <hi>Peter</hi>; neither let us be discouraged at it.</p>
                  <p>It hath been so from the beginning, and it shall be so till the day of judgment, when Christ shall come to purge this floore of his. <hi>Moses,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> used as his hand to carry them out of <hi>Aegypt.

               <p>IN the former <hi>Chapter</hi> he excited us to a reverend attention to <hi>Christ,</hi> the Doctor and Prophet of the Church, by a fearefull example of the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> that fell upon the ancient <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> for hardning their hearts against his voice and contemning him: for this cause they were excluded <hi>Gods</hi> rest.</p>
               <p>Now in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> he makes a more large and evident application of that example to us in the time of the Gospell, wishing us not to tread in the steps of the rebellious <hi>Iewes,</hi> least we drinke of the cup of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath, as they did.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Chapter</hi> divides it selfe into two branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The remainder of <hi>Christ</hi> his prophesie, to <hi>Verse</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A transition to his priesthood. In the remainder, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer example is applied to us.

An exhortation to a diligent studie to enter into that rest. Touching the former, 1. A propounding of the dehortation. 2.

                  <head>VERSE 1.</head>
                  <p>SEeing we have such a terrible example of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Israelites,</hi> which for their unbeliefe and contumacie were shut out of <hi>Gods</hi> rest: let us being subject to the like frailety, and as little able of our selves to stand as they, let us feare that we fall not as they did.</p>
                  <p>What is it; that we must feare?</p>
                  <p>Least any of us should seeme to come short of his rest: for there is no time to sin, and goe to hell, in our youth or elder age.</p>
                  <p>How? lest the promise being left, cast behinde our backe and not regarded: the cause of infidelity is a carelesse neglect of <hi>God</hi> his promise.</p>
                  <p>Where read we of any promise made of entring into his rest? we read of a commination or threatning, that some should not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it: but in the former testimony there was contained no promise. True: not directly, yet indirectly and by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: for if <hi>God</hi> sware that they should not enter, which disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, then a secret promise was included, that the faithfull and obedient should enter in: therefore let us feare, least forsaking this promise, of entring into his rest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Any of you.</hi> For I love you all, and would be loath that one of you should perish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeme:</hi> not simply say, be deprived. Some thinke the Apostle so speaketh, that he might not exasperate the <hi>Iewes:</hi> which would have taken it in great snuffe. Therefore he sayes, if any seeme— but that word may have his force. <hi>Seeme,</hi> and that worthily, even in the judgement of all the world, by neglecting so great salvation to be deprived.</p>
                  <p>To come short. The word is very significant. To be left behind. If among them that travell by the way, some being weary of the length and tediousnesse of the journey, slacke their pace, sit downe and will make no hast, the rest enter into the towne or City to the which they travell, but they are left behind. So if we goe not on cheerefully in the way, following <hi>God</hi> calling us, that leadeth us to the celestiall <hi>Canaan,</hi> we shall be left behind and not enter in, we shall come tardie, as the five foolish Virgins did: as fainting and loitering travellers are wont to doe, and so never come to the journeys end: therefore let us look to it, the danger is great.</p>
                  <p>In the substance of the dehortation is commended to us an holy and religious feare, which we must carry in our hands, for feare of falling. This feare is amplified by the object whereabout it must bee occupied, and the danger that will ensue, if wee let goe that feare.</p>
                  <p>Must we that be Christians feare? It may seeme not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:12681:92"/>For the determination of this yee must know, that there is a foure fold feare: <hi>mundanus, servilis, initialis, &amp; filialis.</hi> This filiall feare is not a boysterous winde to shake the pillar of the certeinty of the Salvation of <hi>Gods</hi> Children, which in respect of <hi>God</hi> our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is sure: <hi>our life is hid with God in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. yet in regard of our owne weakenesse and frailety, we must feare all the dayes of our life. Though a Souldier make sure of the victory, yet he must not rush into the battell unarmed, nor be carelesse of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he must feare the Pikes, Swords and Pellets of the enemy, and be carefull to avoyde them. Though a wayfaring man make sure to come home safe to his house, yet he must not be reachlesse, but feare in some sort the thieves that be in the way. They that be on the Sea, though they make no question of their safe arrival, yet they must not give themselves to sleeping and playing, let the ship drive whither it will; they must feare the waves, windes and tempests. A kinde and loving Wife doubts not of the good affection of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: yet she will feare him. So we neede not doubt of <hi>Gods</hi> love: he will doe his part:<note place="margin">Ephes. 5. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note> for <hi>whom He once loveth, he loveth to the end</hi>; yet we must feare him.</p>
                  <p>There bee two dangerous rockes, the one of doubt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire: the other of security and presumption. Though there is no reason to despaire, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. yet we must beware that we be not drowned in security, not give our selves to eating and drinking. I am sure I shall be saved, therefore I care not how I live. Christians must feare; in regard of our owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we must distrust our owne wit, policy, strength, and depend upon <hi>God</hi> alone, we may stand a great while, and yet fall in the end, as <hi>Adam, Noah, David, Salomon, Peter.</hi> In our selves we are as weake as water: therefore let us distrust our selves, and put all our trust in the living <hi>God.</hi> Againe, wee must feare in respect of the strength and policy of our enemies. We have many enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter withall, and those not weake, but potent.

                  <p>THE reason is deduced from a gracious benefit bestowed on us, as well as on them, which if it be rejected by us, as it was by them, will shut us out of heaven. It hath two parts, a <hi>par,</hi> and an <hi>impar.</hi> If they for not believing the Gospell were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of his rest, then the like may happen to us: for we are partakers of the Gospell as well as they: and for that cause let us feare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That is to be unfolded wherein they and we are alike. We
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12681:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are Gospelled as well as they: nay in that wee are advanced above them. <hi>Adam, Abraham, Iacob,</hi> had the Gospell <hi>velatum:</hi> to us it is <hi>revelatum.</hi> To them CHRIST was preached afarre off, to come, to us already come, <hi>a Virgin hath conceived.</hi> They had the Gospell by a servant which was <hi>Moses:</hi> we have it by the Sonne of <hi>God:</hi> they had it darkely and obscurely: we have it cleerely and plainely. They had the Moone light, and we the Sun light. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are the eyes that see that which we see.</hi> It was one and the same Gospell in the Old and New Testament: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.46. and 39. here is the imparity; the Word preached did not profite them, as it did us that believe.</p>
                  <p>The word of hearing. That word, which indeede above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words is to be heard, by the which faith commeth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17 <hi>Plato, Aristot. Seneca, Tullie, Augustine, Hieron. Irenaeus, Tertul. &amp;c.</hi> in time and place are to bee heard: but this word above all. This is a word meet to sound in our eares continually.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, <hi>which came not unto them,</hi> for it was preached to them: as we heard before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Profited them not,</hi> did them no good. The Gospell is a precious pearle, an unspeakeable blessing of <hi>God,</hi> yet all that are partakers of it are not saved. <hi>Iudas</hi> had the Gospell, yet it profited him not. <hi>Simon Magus, Hierusalem, &amp;c.</hi> The Sun is not comfortable to all. The most delicate fare doth not make all bodies fat. The raine doth not make all grounds fruitfull, neither doth the Word of <hi>God,</hi> though it be mighty in operation, profite all that partake of it. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. nay, it is the heaping up of a greater measure of condemnation to some through their own default: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.22. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> Therefore let us not trust to lying words, as they did, crying, <hi>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord:</hi> neither let us cry, <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, the Gospell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 7.4.</note> and thrust our selves under the figge leaves of a bare profession of it, but bring forth fruits worthy of the Gospell, that it be not taken from us and given to another nation.</p>
                  <p>Why did the Gospell doe them no good?</p>
                  <p>Because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it. It is a metaphor borrowed from <hi>liquid</hi> things. A physician prescribes to a man a cup of strong wine, but he wills him to mingle it with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, lest it fume into his braine and make him sicke: if he mingle it not, and temper it wel with Sugar, he hurts himself. So because they mingled not the wine of the word with the sweet Sugar of faith; it was their destruction, it turned them over even into hell.</p>
                  <p>It is fayth that makes the word profitable. For the procuring of an harvest, it is not enough to have ground, and seede cast into the ground, but raine must fall from heaven and bee mingled with the ground: So it is not sufficient to bring our selves as the ground to a Sermon, to have, the immortall seede of the word sowen in our hearts by GODS husbandmen, but there must be the drops of faith mingled with this seede to make it fruitfull.<note place="margin">Gen. 19.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Noah</hi> preached to the old world, yet they did not believe; <hi>Lot</hi> to his Sonnes in Law, but

hee seemed to them as a mocker: CHRIST to the Pharisees, but they derided him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.14. Let not us doe so: but rather tremble at the threatnings, believe the promises, and practise that which wee heare. And this faith will appeare by working, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13. it will worke a change and alteration in your whole man.</p>

                  <p>ON the other side, it profits us that believe, for we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his rest.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say <hi>shall,</hi> but <hi>doe.</hi> He that believeth in me, hath eternall life, he doth not see it a farre off, as <hi>Moses</hi> upon the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> viewed the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but <hi>enters:</hi> not, into the boyling lead of Purgatory, but into spirituall and everlasting <hi>rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As infidelity is the bar to keep out unbeleevers: So fidelity is the gate or doore whereby we may enter into heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28.</p>
                  <p>This may seeme to bee unfitly alleadged. By consequent it prooves that believers enter in: for if unbelievers doe not, then by the law of contraries, believers doe.</p>
                  <p>And if the former words be included in a parenthesis, these doe fitly follow as a confirmation of that, which was in the latter end of the former verse, it profited them not, because it was not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with faith. How prove you that? As he said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus it doth excellently well agree.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the dehortation hath beene propounded. Now hee comes to prevent an objection, that the Iewes might make, which was indeed the only shelter they had to flye unto. This rest that <hi>David</hi> speaketh of is the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which some of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers missed of, because they would not believe <hi>God.</hi> What is that to us? We believe in him, and are at this day of a long time seated in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> therefore we are none of those unbelievers: thou needest not to be so fearefull of us.</p>
                  <p>To that he answers, nay: this rest is a spirituall and an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rest: and that he prooves by two divine testimonies; one out of <hi>Genesis,</hi> about Gods Sabbath: the other out of the Psalme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited.</p>
                  <p>The rest of that Sabbath he introduceth by a narration of the cause, why <hi>God</hi> kept it. It is <hi>perobscurus locus,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, a defective speech, something must be supplyed.</p>
                  <p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is <hi>particula asseverantis,</hi> as well as <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santis,</hi> the workes being finished from the foundation of the world; this rest, that we speake of, was fore-signified.</p>
                  <p>Here we may behold the end, for the which <hi>God</hi> Himselfe kept a Sabbath; namely that we might perpetually commemorate the Creation of the world. The <hi>Lord</hi> might, if it had pleased Him, have made the world in a moment: yet he took sixe dayes to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12681:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
making of it, that we might deliberately consider of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workemanship: and then rested the seaventh day, making it a type of our eternall rest with him in heaven.</p>
                  <p>But here a question may be moved, whether all Gods workes were finished at the beginning of the world, whether all were made within the compasse of these sixe dayes, or not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What say you to the soules of men? Is there not a dayly creation of them? they come not <hi>ex traduce,</hi> they are not traduced and conveyed unto us by the seede of our Parents: for they are only the fathers of our bodies, not of our soules: and <hi>the spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to God that gave it: God</hi> makes soules every day:<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.9.</note> therefore all his workes were not finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
                  <p>The answer is easie. They were <hi>in specie,</hi> from the beginning, though <hi>numero</hi> they bee augmented every day. They were not all created at the first in heaven, and put dayly into bodies according unto <hi>Gods</hi> discretion and appointment; but God maketh them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: yet the same species, the same kinde of creature was from the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What shall wee say to Mules? It was a long time, many hundred yeeres before they came into the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.24.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Hebr. word is ambiguous: (<hi>Iemim</hi>) of (<hi>Iam</hi>) the Sea. Hee found waters, standing pooles in the wildernesse like to Seas, above the expectation of men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it be translated (Mules;) yet the meaning may be, hee was the first that found them in that countrie, whereas they might be in the world before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though they were invented by this man, yet the matter of them was made by <hi>God</hi> in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, what shall we say to those creatures that ryse of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction? they were <hi>materialiter &amp; potentialiter,</hi> though not <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter</hi> from the beginning. All things were either in <hi>materia</hi> or in <hi>specie</hi> from the beginning of the world. There were no houses, no ships, no Townes, nor Cities at the first: yet the matter whereof they be framed, was prepared to mans hand by <hi>God,</hi> and he gave man wisedome for the framing of them.</p>

                  <p>Now by that was prefigured that rest, when we shall rest with <hi>God</hi> in his kingdome.

                  <p>From the testimony cited in the former verse he reasons in this. They did not enter, therefore some others shall: for <hi>Gods</hi> promise shall take effect, and not fall to the ground.

                  <p>The Prerogative hath two branches: the 1. is the preaching and manifesting of this rest to them: 2. is the order of time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect whereof they were preferred before others.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12681:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
GOD and his promise: for that cause they never sate a foote into that rest.</p>
                  <p>Yet some there be that shal take possession of it: namely, they that believe in <hi>God: heaven and earth shall passe away, but not one jot of Gods word shall be unfulfilled.</hi> Though diverse regard it not, and thinke it to bee but a fooles Paradise, yet undoubtedly some shall have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There be first, that shall be last,</hi> sayes CHRIST. Many may have this priviledge, to have the Gospell first preached to them, and yet not be saved by the Gospell. <hi>Christ</hi> gave commandement, that his Apostles should beginne their preaching at Ierusalem.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.47. Act. 13.46.</note> 
                     <hi>The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is the power of God to salvation, to the Iew first</hi>—Yet <hi>easier for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus and Sydon at the day of judgement, then for many of them.</hi>

                  <p>We in England in this last age of this world have had the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell againe revealed unto us, before a number of places in the world, we even in these parts have had it a long time in most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full measure above and before sundry places in the land, yet let us not flatter our selves in that. Some of them that be still in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, may goe to heaven before us. Howsoever they that have the first offer, (which is a singular priviledge) regard it not, yet some out of all question shall have it. <hi>Many come from the east; and from the West, and shall set downe with Abraham, Isack and Iacob in the kingdome of heaven, and the children of the kingdome shall be cast out into outer darkenesse, Matth.</hi> 8.11.12.</p>
                  <p>Those that were first bidden to the marriage, would not come, they made excuses: yet the <hi>Lord</hi> sent into the high wayes and hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and his house at the length was filled. God is not tyed to any. If the first refuse, the last shall have it: therefore while this <hi>rest</hi> is preached to us, let us take hold of it, and not reject it; as the ancient <hi>Israelites</hi> did.</p>

                  <p>The ancient <hi>Israelites</hi> went very farre towards the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> In many things obedient to the voice of God, they journyed and stayed at his appointment; they had sent spies that viewed the Country.

                  <p>It is something to beginne well, to goe towards heaven; but that is not all. <hi>Lots</hi> wife went out of <hi>Sodome, Demas</hi> once embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe second reason to excite us to this study is taken from the power and Majesty of the Word, that commandeth this lesson to bee studied.

Therefore they were destroyed. So will GOD deale with us: for his Word is as mighty now as ever it was. This is that study which <hi>God</hi> in his Word injoyned to you, and hath often excited you thereunto: beware how yee contemne this Word. It is no dallying with edge tooles: this sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is sharper than any two edged sword, and will either open the soares of your soules, that they may bee healed, or, it will wound you to death everlasting: therefore despise it not, but as <hi>God</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you in his Word, so study to enter into his rest.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The nature of the Word is set downe: then illustrated and confirmed. For the nature, it hath two qualities.</p>
                  <p>Many things are lively, that are not mighty. There is life in a little child, but no great might in him: the Word is not so. As it is lively, so it is mighty. The Word of <hi>God</hi> is not a dead Word, it hath life in it. There is some wine and drink that is dead, we can feele no life in it, as it goes down our stomack: the Word of <hi>God</hi> is lively <hi>Aqua-vita,</hi> and no auditour but shall feele it to bee lively in him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to salvation or destruction. They are called lively Oracles by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7.38. There is life in it, it begets us to a Spirituall life in this world, and to an eternall in the world to come.</p>

                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:12681:99"/>It is also a mighty or powerfull Word, <hi>Ierome</hi> translates it <hi>evidens,</hi> as if he read it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> mighty. There are sundry potions that bee mighty in operation; purge mightily, and cary away a great deale of corruption out of the body: but none so as the word of <hi>God</hi>; it purgeth us from Idolatry, ignorance, superstition, prophanenesse, from swearing, cursing, and banning, from drunkennesse, fornication, and adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a mighty purger, and sweepes a great deale of filthinesse out of the soule, and if it purge thee not, it will kill thee; as a medicine, if not worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or downewards, it will kill the man; so the Word will migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily clense thee, or mightily confound thee.</p>

in operation?

The consideration hereof should cause us to have a reverent regard of the word of God, and to stand in awe of it. When ye come to a Sermon, ye come to a diligent and narrow Searcher that can lay open all the secret sins that ye have committed: your adulteries, oppressions, backbitings, and slanderings, thefts, your beastly drinking in Tavernes and Alehouses. <hi>Behold a man that hath told me all that ever I have done,</hi>

                  <p>A strange thing! there hath beene wonderfull plenty of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Land, yet small profiting by it, and why? because wee have not the reverent estimation of the word of God that we ought to have: we thinke too basely of it, we imagine it not to be of halfe the power it is.</p>

                  <p>The only difference is in the manner, not in the matter: he was tempted as we are; but not after the same sort: our temptations are mixed with sinne; his not: wee sinne in our afflictions; hee not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi>

None so gracious with <hi>God</hi> as hee: none hath reconciled us to <hi>God,</hi> but he: none loveth, nor tendereth us, as hee doth, having layd downe his life for us.

               <p>Not only every inferiour Priest, but every High Priest: the Highest of all was taken from among men. <hi>God</hi> taketh him by the hand, separateth him from among his brethren, and setteth him in a chaire of dignity above them all.</p>

               <p>All Ministers and Preachers are taken from among men: it did not seeme good to the wisedome of GOD to call Angels to this office.</p>
               <p>The Angell appeared to <hi>Philip,</hi> and sent him to instruct the <hi>Eunuch:</hi> but the Angell did not teach him himselfe.

So though the Preacher be a man, as others be, it may be a weake and poorer man: yet in regard of that office wherunto <hi>God</hi> hath exalted him to be his Ambassadour and steward, to be his arme to pull you up to the kingdome of heaven, hee is to bee reverenced by you all. <hi>God</hi> hath taken us from among men, to carry men into his owne kingdome: therefore love and honour us.</p>
               <p>To what use? For the salvation of men, <hi>God</hi> by a man will save men: not for himselfe alone, but for other men: he is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for beasts, for the building of houses, the tilling of ground, the making of Cloath; but to build up men to life everlasting, to breake up the fallow hearts of men, and to sow the immortall seed of the word in them.</p>
               <p>Not ordained for Angels, but for men: the good Angels need him not, the bad Angels shall have no benefite by him. He is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the saving of men, not of Angels: not for rich men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but also for poore: not onely to tell meane men of their duties, but great men too, whatsoever their authoritie bee in the world.</p>
               <p>So is the Magistrate ordained of <hi>God, Rom.</hi> 13.4. therefore the distinction followeth, in things that are to bee done with <hi>God:</hi> the one in <hi>temporalibus,</hi> the other in <hi>spiritualibus:</hi> the one is occupied about the goods, names and bodies of men: the other about the soules of men, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.17.</p>
               <p>The Ministers office is to preach the Word, to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the way to heaven, to pray for the people in the congregation, to carry their prayers to <hi>God,</hi> to celebrate the Sacraments: these be the lysts of the Minister.

               <p>The <hi>Iesuits</hi> will have a perpetuall Priest-hood to be heere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and ordained in this place. There must be Priests to the end of the world, to offer sacrifice for sinne: whereas, it is as cleare as the noone day, that this description is borrowed out of the law, to set forth the spirituall Priest-hood of <hi>Christ</hi> withall. The Apostle here teacheth us, not what must be in the time of the Gospell, but what was in the time of the law, applying it to <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An externall sacrifice propitiatory for sin (as they will have it) is injurious to the blessed and perfect sacrifice, which <hi>Christ</hi> offred on the Crosse for the sins of the world. All outward sacrifices for sinne must now cease, the bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> shed on the crosse having purged us from all sinne.</p>
               <p>Yet the Ministers of the Gospell have now some sacrifices to offer up: they bee either common with all Christians, or proper to their ministerie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They must offer up themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soules and bodies, as an holy sacrifice to <hi>God,</hi> as all Christians are bound to doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They must bee plentifull in the workes of mercie to their power, as other Christians are: for with such sacrifices GOD is well pleased.</p>
               <p>But there be other spirituall sacrifices, that are also proper to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To present the prayers of the people to <hi>God. Ezra</hi> praised the great <hi>God</hi> of heaven, and all the people said, <hi>Amen.</hi> So the Minister, as the mouth of the congregation, as a Spirituall Priest, must offer up the prayers of the people to <hi>God,</hi> and they in an holy zeale subscribe to him, saying, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We by the preaching of the Word doe sacrifice the people to <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>If any sinne on ignorance, or weakenesse; hee must have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on them.

A Minister must not have an heart of flint, but of oyle, ready to melt at the consideration of the infirmities of the people, and there is good cause why?

                  <p>Though we be never so wise, learned, or holy; yet let the best Preachers in the world remember, that they be men cloathed with the ragged Coate of infirmities, as others bee. Hence it is, that

               <p>BEfore, wee had Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> objurgation, that they were so great <hi>non proficients</hi> in the Schoole of <hi>Christ.</hi> Now follows an exhortation to pricke them forwards to greater perfection in Religion.</p>
               <p>Where, 1. The substance of the exhortation. 2. The pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and urging of it by foure arguments. 1. <hi>A ridiculo.</hi> 2. <hi>Ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo.</hi> 3. <hi>A Deo.</hi> 4. <hi>A periculo.</hi>

From a fearefull danger that will ensue; if upon a carelesse neglect, or contempt of the heavenly doctrine they stand at a stay, and goe not forward: by that meanes they may goe backeward, and at the length may fall into the sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it stands: them in hand, in feare and humility to aspire to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection dayly more and more.</p>

                  <p>THe exhortation hath two branches. 1. What they are to leave. 2. What they are to contend unto. 1. <hi>Terminus à quo.</hi> 2. <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing it is a shame, alwayes to be babes; let us as men growne, seeke after stronger meat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The principles</hi> .i. that which begins us and enters us into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, leaving that: How? Not casting it for ever behinde our backes: suffering it quite to slip out of our memories, never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it any more: we must remember even the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to our dying day, but wee must not insist in those, and set downe our staffe here, but as good travellours goe on forwards. As if one should say to a Grammer Scholler, leave thy Grammar and goe to <hi>Logick, Rhetoricke, Philosophie,</hi> to more deepe and profound points of learning; his meaning is, not that hee should leave his Grammar quite, and never thinke on it any more, but that he should passe from that to greater matters. As if one should say to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller going to London, that sits eating and drinking at Colchester: leave Colchester, and goe on to London: So leave this doctrine of the beginning of Christianity, leave your <hi>A. B. C.</hi> be not alwayes beginners, but proceede, till ye come to some maturity.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Let us goe on to perfection, with all cheerefulnesse and celerity.</hi> Both we that are the teachers, and you that are to be taught by us: that we may aspire to perfection dayly more and more.</p>
                  <p>Wee cannot goe of ourselves, we must be led, namely by the hand of GOD Almighty: as little Children cannot goe, unlesse their mothers and nurses lead them. Let us therefore intreat the <hi>Lord</hi> to lead us forward by the hand of his spirit to perfection day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more. Wee cannot climbe up to the highest staire of the ladder of perfection in this world: we must be climbing all the dayes of our life. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt into the third heaven: yet he professed he was not yet perfect. <hi>We know in part, we believe in part,</hi> and we must be as Schollers learning of our part, so long as we live. Though with <hi>Moses</hi> wee have beene brought up in all the learning of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> though wee bee as perfect Scribes in the law of GOD, as <hi>Ezra:</hi> as eloquent and mightie in Scripture as <hi>Apollos,</hi> though wee have as many tongues as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>spake with tongues more than they all did,</hi> yet wee must bee carryed on still to perfection: wee must be as Travellours, that are ever walking and going on and on, never resting till wee come to our journeys end, which will not bee till death it selfe shall come. Our SAVIOUR himselfe, as hee was a man, did grow up in wisedome; and shall any of us thinke our selves so wise that wee neede not to grow in wisedome? <hi>Let us all goe on forwards to perfection every day more and more.</hi>

                  <p>The first reason is taken from a ridiculous absurditie, set forth by a comparison.</p>

All men laugh at those builders that are alwayes laying the foundation, but never set up the Walls, lay on the roofe, tyle, and glaze the house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but every day are laying the foundation. Those bee foolish buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. So we that be Christians, must not always be laying the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of religion, but wee must build up ourselves as a glorious house to the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then hee sets downe the particular stones of this foundation, which wee must not ever bee laying: hee reckons up the chiefe points of the Christian catechisme, which all ought to have at their fingers ends, which it is a shame to be ever learning. Of these, some concerne this life; some, the life to come: they that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this life are private, or publike.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Repentance, which is illustrated by the things we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of.</p>
                  <p>There be living workes, which we doe when CHRIST li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in us; these are not to bee repented of, but to be practised by us: and there bee dead workes, which be sinnes, and are so called, 1. Because they come from dead men, that are dead in trespasses and sinnes. 2. Because they tend to death and destruction, <hi>the wages of sinne is death.</hi>

                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:12681:113"/>All sinnes are dead workes: covetousnesse, malice, pride, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenesse, uncleannesse, lying, swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are dead works: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us have nothing to doe with them. Men are afraid to touch dead bodies, or to come neere them, we flye away from a dead and stinking carkasse. Every sin is a dead carkasse, that sends up an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory smell into the nostrills of <hi>God:</hi> therefore let it be abhorred by us all: let us turne away our eyes and hearts too from all dead workes.</p>

                     </gap> mortification of sin, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification to newnesse of life, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Zacheus</hi> repented him, when he left his peeling and griping and became a liberall man, made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution to those whom hee had defrauded, and gave the one halfe of his goods to the poore. <hi>Peter</hi> repented of his denyall of <hi>Christ,</hi> when he did not only weepe bitterly for it, for a time, but stood in defence of <hi>Christ,</hi> to the very death. Then an adulterer repents of his adulterie, when hee leaves quite his Whores and harlots, and <hi>possesses his vessell in holinesse and honour.</hi> Repentance is a forsak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng of the sinne, and an imbracing of the contrary vertue.</p>
                  <p>It is not the laying aside of sinne for a time, as a man doth his Coate at night, and puts it on againe in the morning: but it is an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relinquishing of sin, a shaking of it off, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> did the viper, never resuming it againe.</p>
                  <p>It is not a changing of sin, but a putting away of sin. Then a man hath repented, when of an old creature, hee is made a new. It is not onely a sorrow for sinne, a weeping and howling for sinne, though these be good steps to repentance. <hi>Caine</hi> was grieved for his sinne. <hi>Esau</hi> howled for it. <hi>Iudas</hi> was pierced with the dart of sorrow for it: but it is an abandoning of the sinne.

Which doctrine of repentance in respect of practise ought to sound continually in the Pulpit, but not in respect of knowledge.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Power of <hi>God.</hi>

                     <item>4. The Resurrection of CHRIST.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the first; <hi>Idoneus est reficere, qui fecit:</hi> hee that made man at the first of the dust of the ground, can fetch him out of the ground againe when he is quite consumed to dust and ashes: hee that made an house, can set it up againe though it bee defaced. <hi>God</hi> made this body, the house of clay: therefore hee can erect it againe though pulled downe.</p>
                  <p>The second pillar is the Iustice of <hi>God.</hi> If there were no resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>God</hi> should bee unjust. The wicked flourish in this world, <hi>their eyes sticke out by reason of fatnesse: they have more than heart can wish: they are not in trouble as other men.

If there were no resurrection where this should be righted, that sentence of the Psalmist might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>verely there is</hi> no <hi>reward for the righteous: verily there is</hi> no <hi>God that judgeth in the earth.</hi>

                  <p>The fourth pillar is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth to Christians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>Christ is risen:</hi> therefore we shall ryse. <hi>As Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly: So Christ was three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth:</hi> on Thursday he kept his Maundy, he eate the Passeover and supper with his Disciples: on good Friday he suffered and was crucified: all Saturday being the Iewes Sabbath, he lay in the earth: on Sunday morning, the first day of the weeke, the <hi>Lords</hi> day, the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> rose triumphantly from the dead; and this is the day of his resurrection: on this day hee rose victoriously from the dead. <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made, let us rejoyce and hee glad in it:</hi> for <hi>Christs</hi> resurrection is a pledge of ours.

                  <p>It is called <hi>eternall judgement.</hi> 1. Because it is of things eternall, eternall life or eternall death. 2. Because the sentence of that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eternall, the force and power thereof remaines ever, both to the elect and reprobate: they all goe eternally to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Iudge. 3.

                  <p>Oh that the cogitation of this judgement were deeply fixed in the harts of us all! A great number, even in the lap of the Church, laugh at it in the closet of their hearts: the Preachers talke much of a generall judgement that shall be after this life but if <hi>God</hi> let us alone till that day, we shall doe well enough.

The Iudge is our SAVIOUR, our elder brother, our head, our husband to whom we are married: therefore we may lift up our heads at that day, because our redemption is at hand; we may rejoyce at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, for we shal sit on the bench with him and judge the world, and reigne with him for ever.</p>

Repentance is the gate whereby wee must enter into heaven; the very doore and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is denyed to them: therefore no mervaile though the house bee denyed to them. If they could repent, they might bee saved: <hi>for at what time soever a sinner repenteth of his sinnes from the bottome of his heart, the Lord will blot them out of his remembrance.</hi> But it is impossible for them to repent: their hearts are hardened. <hi>And thou according to the hardnesse of thy heart that cannot Repent, treasurest up to thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath, Romans</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>They have cast off GOD, and GOD hath, cast off them: they may have an horror in the Conscience for their sinnes, they may peradventure weepe, howle and cry for them: yet they doe not repent. They are not pierced with true sorrow for sinne, they grieve for the fearefull, and endlesse torments which they are to sustaine for their sinnes, but grieve not for sinne, as it is sinne: they are grieved, that they are fallen into the hands of GOD as a judge, but are not sorrowfull that they have offended him as a Father. For any other sinne GOD may give Repentance unto men: but for this hee will not. Oh horrible sinne! GOD may give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for all other sinnes: yet hee is not bound to doe it. The King may pardon burglarie, or for breaking into an house, yet hee is not bound to it. So GOD may give men Repentance for thefts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, adulteries, drunkennesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet none can challenge this at his hands. Therefore let none presume to commit any sinne whatsoever in hope of Repentance: this is no good argument, no sound conclusion in Divinitie; they that sinne against the HOLY GHOST cannot repent, therefore they that fall into any other sin, may repent at their pleasure: a man is not sure to have Repentance for foolish idle words, for wicked and uncleane thoughts: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou mayest bee stricken with the dart of sudden death, while thou art sinning: therefore let not the hope of Repentance bee as a loadestone to draw thee to sinne: Repentance is a singular thing, that will open the lap of <hi>Gods</hi> mercie and the doores of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven too. <hi>Manasseh</hi> had beene a monstrous Idolater,

There were some that crucified CHRIST the <hi>Lord</hi> of life, being prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts for it, were imbraced in the armes of mercy: the Prodigall Son that had spent all his substance on harlots, yet when he came to his father with that dolefull and penitent voice, <hi>I have sinned against heaven and before thee</hi>—his father fell on his neck and kissed him: but they that sinne against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and therefore can have no mercy, neither in this life nor in that which is to come: O fearefull sinne! the <hi>Lord</hi> in mercy keepe us all from it.</p>

                  <p>It is one thing for a ground to bring forth bad corne, an other thing to bring forth <hi>bryars:</hi> Cockle, darnel and weeds are hurtfull: but <hi>thornes and bryars</hi> are worst of all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They cumber the ground; if they were away, some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing might spring in their roome.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. They pricke those that handle them, and make the bloud runne about their fingers: so the wicked doe not only hinder the growth of good things, but they pricke both <hi>God</hi> and men. <hi>As the Canaanites were as pricks in the Israelites sides, and thornes in their eyes</hi>; So are these to <hi>God</hi> and his Children: they raile on good men, and are ready to doe them all the mischiefe they can. As <hi>Ahab hated Micajah</hi>; so doe they: they cannot abide sober and good men: their hatred stayes not here, but it is converted against <hi>God</hi> himselfe, <hi>they set their mouthes against heaven,</hi> they rayle on <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Gospell, they blaspheme the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> they persequute the truth to the end: If they doe it on ignorance, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did, who thus professeth of himselfe, <hi>I was a blasphemer, a persequutor and injurious,</hi>

                     <hi>but I did it ignorantly,</hi> and therefore hee sinned not against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; If they do it on weaknes, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>who cursed and swore he knew not Christ</hi>; it is a grievous sinne; yet not the sinne against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> An <hi>Eunomian</hi> or <hi>Macedonian,</hi> that deny the deity of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> may repent and be received into mercy. <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liani</hi> or <hi>Patripussiani</hi> that <hi>oppugne</hi> his person, may also repent and bee forgiven: but if they doe it on malice, then they commit that sinne, that cannot bee forgiven in this world, nor that which is to come: these bee the <hi>thornes and bryars</hi> which the Apostle pointeth out in this place.</p>
                  <p>Such a cursed <hi>earth bringing forth thornes and bryars</hi> were some of the Pharisees: they could say of CHRIST, <hi>this is the heyre</hi>; yet they said, <hi>let us kill him.</hi> Such a <hi>thorne</hi> was Alexander the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-smith, which resisted Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching very soare: hee set his feet against Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> feete, hee resisted not his person, but his preaching: not sleightly, but vehemently with might and maine. Such a <hi>thorne</hi> was <hi>Iulian,</hi> sirnamed the Apostata, that fell quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: hee was baptized into the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> hee was a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of the Gospell, and that a zealous one, as it seemeth: he was a publike Reader in the Church of <hi>Nicomedia:</hi> who so forward as he? yet afterwards hee proved a vile pricking <hi>thorne:</hi> hee washed away baptisme with bloud in contempt of it, he abjured <hi>Christ,</hi> and sacrificed to the Gods of the Gentiles, he scoffed at Christianity, mocking them that would believe in a crucified God. If they came to have wrongs righted, he sent them away with a flouting speech; why, your Master bids you put up wrongs, <hi>turne the other check when you be smitten.</hi> To the last gaspe he spewed out his malice against <hi>Christ:</hi> taking the arrow out of his side, that gave him his deaths wound, he tooke the bloud into his hand, hurled it up into the ayre; crying, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the preventing of it, let us bring forth good fruit answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the raine that falleth on us: let us take heed of the staires that may carry us headlong into the sinne against the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> let us not bee patrons and defenders of bad men and evill actions, against the light of our conscience: that is a step to this fearefull sin.

A qualification of it, by the mitigation of the harshnesse of his former speech: that is, a fearefull piece of earth, which thou hast mentioned, that brings forth bryars and thornes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doest thou take us to be such a ground?</p>

                  <p>The things that bee in them are starke naught, but <hi>wee perswade our selves most excellent things of you.</hi> They are reprobates, but we are perswaded that you are the elect Children of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a goodly commendation, may some say: as if a man seeing a company going to execution should say to one that stands by him, I am perswaded that thou art a better man then these.</p>
                  <p>I, but this is a good perswasion; there are but two sorts of

people, godly, and wicked reprobates; now being perswaded that they are better then the reprobate, he is perswaded they be elect: and what greater perswasion can there be then that? therefore hee addeth, <hi>such things as accompany salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> reades it <hi>cohaerentia saluti: ad Crescen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as have salvation:</hi> we are perswaded you are in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that shall be saved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His perswasion is propounded, then strengthened against that which might seeme to overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>Though, we have somwhat sharpely chidden you, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a fearefull example of vile and wicked apostates: a father may set before the eyes of his child thieves, murderers, drunkards, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, and yet be perswaded that his child is none of them: only he doth it to warne him, not to treade in their steps: so, as a loving Father I have told you of these men, yet <hi>I am perswaded better if you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Preacher must not alwayes be inveighing against the faults, weaknesses and imperfections that bee among the people, hee must sometimes speak kindly and lovingly to them, manifesting the good opinion he hath of them: they are the fathers of the people, they must bee wise and discreet fathers: they must neither bee like to <hi>David,</hi> that never reproved <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and said to him, <hi>why doest thou so?</hi> neither like the contentious woman in the Proverbs, <hi>as the continuall droppings of the raine,</hi> ever scolding with the people: they must play the part of the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> that after Wine which made the wound to smart, powred in oyle, for the suppling of it. So wee must sometimes come with the sharpe wine of reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: sometimes againe with the oyle of consolation. Before, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> came with salt and vinegar, when hee spake of the reprobate earth; now hee comes with hony and sugar, <hi>but we are perswaded better things of you. Generosus animus magis ducitur, quàm trahitur,</hi> sweet and comfortable words will prevaile more with some, then rough and hard speeches: both in wisedome must be used by <hi>Gods</hi> steward: severity and lenitie must be tempered together, if by any meanes we may save the people committed to our charge. Before, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> like an hard father chode sharply: now hee stroakes them on the head againe, saying, <hi>wee are perswaded better things of you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must have a good and charitable opinion of them, that sit in the lap of the Church, that subject themselves to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Word, though there bee some defects and blemishes in them. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> judged all in the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> to be the elect Children of <hi>God, Phil.</hi> 1.7. We must not be too lavish or too strict in our judgment: some have such large consciences, as that they are perswaded too well of all, that all in the end shall bee saved, yea, even the Devills themselves: that was the dotage of <hi>Origen.</hi> And some at this day cannot bee perswaded, that any shall be damned: the lappe of their charity is too wide; and others is too narrow.</p>

                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:12681:122"/>They are scant perswaded well of any, but of themselves: they thanke <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Pharisee, they are not as other men:</hi> all others are naught, and they only are good: but except there appeare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest tokens of reprobation, except they take an apparant bad course, and the very high way to hell, we must perswade our selves, that they may appertaine to the number of <hi>Gods</hi> faithfull and elect Children: wee are perswaded of our owne salvation <hi>judicio fidei,</hi> and we may be perswaded of the salvation of others, <hi>scientia cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis:</hi> wee must not bee too rash in our sentence, as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> against Saint <hi>Paul, doubtlesse this man is a murderer.</hi> Such a one hath these and these faults, doubtlesse he is the child of the Devill: if they prosesse the Gospell and have any godly care to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, though there be wants in them, wee must be well perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them.</p>
                  <p>But what was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> perswasion? did hee perswade himselfe that they were honest good natured men and the like? Nay, more then so, <hi>that they were in the number of those that should be saved.</hi> That young man in the Gospell, was a man of rare and excellent parts,<note place="margin">Mark. 10.21.</note> he had kept (as he said) all the tenne Commandements from his youth, and <hi>Christ</hi> loved him: yet there were not things in him that accompanied salvation. Thou maiest be a sowre <hi>Cato,</hi> a just and upright <hi>Aristides</hi> in thy dealings with men, and yet have not the infallible markes of salvation. It is an excellent thing, when there be those vertues in men and women <hi>that accompany salvation.</hi> Hast thou a sharpe and pregnant wit? So had <hi>Esau,</hi> that could wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily descant on his brothers name. Hast thou a brave and eloquent tongue? So had <hi>Aeschines, Tully</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> Art thou a faire, comely and beautifull man, as goodly a man as one shall see in a summers day?

So was <hi>Porphyrie, Lucian, Iulian,</hi> that never set a foote in the kingdome of heaven. Labour to have those things that accompany salvation, faith, hope, zeale, patience, humility, and other graces of the spirit, whereby we may be perswaded, that you are the deare Children of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> worke <hi>those things</hi> in us all, <hi>that accompany salvation.</hi> Though the Church be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, that thou art a wise man, witty, learned, that is to small purpose. So live, that both the Preachers and all good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may bee perswaded you have that in you, for the which they may judge you to be heyres of salvation.</p>
                  <p>Here hee prevents an objection that might be made. What <hi>Paul,</hi> hast thou bin so bitter towards us? hast thou called us babes and novices in Religion? Hast thou set before our eyes such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible example of <hi>Apostates</hi> and backsliders, as if we were birds of the same feather, and now art thou well perswaded of us? thou doest but flatter us, wee can hardly thinke so. O yes, saies S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> assure your selves, we have a good opinion of you; though we thus speake, these are but trumpets to waken you out of sin, the wounds

of a lover to cure you withall: they be but spurs of fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to pricke you forwards unto all goodnesse. Wee made mention of these men; not as if you were such, but to warne you, that you be not such.</p>
                  <p>Though the Preacher be sometimes round and vehement, yet the people must not imagine that he is hardly conceited of them. A Father loves his child when he chides him, a Physician his patient, though he give him bitter pils: and we love you, though we be hot against the corruptions that raigne among you.</p>

If <hi>God</hi> should not doe this, he should be unjust; but he is not unjust: he is not an unrighteous Father, that forsakes his Sonne, or an unjust builder that leaves his building.</p>
                  <p>That this is his meaning, is apparant, by that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and that which followes after: unlesse he were perswaded that <hi>God</hi> would finish the worke begun in them, his perswasion could not be firme: and in the next <hi>Verse</hi> he prayes, that <hi>they may goe on forward to the end:</hi> and when he hath done so, hee will crowne his owne worke.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iesuits</hi> say it is a world to see what wrything and wringing the Protestants make, to shift off this place, whereby it is cleere, <hi>that good workes are meritorious, and causes of salvation.</hi> If it bee an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous thing with <hi>God,</hi> not to give heaven to our workes, then we have it not on meere mercy, but of justice.</p>

                  <p>It is just with <hi>God</hi> so to doe, not in regard of our merit, but of his own promise. They that came into the vineyard <hi>at the last houre,</hi> had as much as <hi>the first:</hi> yet not of merit, but of covenant.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12681:123"/>
their life to bee seene in their quarrell, to make their part and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</p>
                  <p>This worke of theirs is illustrated by the manner of it, the end, the matter, and the continuance in it.</p>
                  <p>Here are many excellent instructions.</p>
                  <p>Love is laborious. If thou lovest a man, thou wilt labour for him, thou wilt runne and ride for him, thou wilt relieve him in his wants according to that ability, wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath blessed thee: <hi>Love not in word and tongue only,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. I will not give any thing for such love, as hath nothing but words. Shew mee thy love by thy deeds and labour. Art thou ready to doe what thou canst for thy brother? art thou willing to part with thy mony, thy meat and drinke for the relieving of him? then thou lovest him: <hi>hic la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, hoc opus est,</hi> this is the true labour of love indeed: doest thou visit him, if he be in prison for righteousnesse sake? doest thou goe to him and comfort him, if he be sicke? never prate of love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I may see <hi>the labour of thy love. Iacob</hi> loved <hi>Rachel,</hi> therefore he laboured for her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the glorifying of his name.</hi>] Here we have the end of a good worke, which makes it a good work indeed: when it is done for the name of <hi>Christ.</hi> The Pharisees gave almes, yet because it was to procure a name to themselves, it was not a good worke; they have their reward amongst men: they shall have none at the hands of <hi>God.</hi> If thou givest to the poore because the statute compells thee, or because thou shalt be hardly thought of, if thou givest not, or that thou mayest bee counted a liberall man, and that the world may talke of thee and commend thee; it looseth the title of a good worke; whatsoever we doe, let us doe all to the glory of <hi>God,</hi> and he will recompense us.</p>
                  <p>Why, what was this work of theirs? they ministred to the Saints. One speciall good worke is to minister to the Saints. There were certaine women that ministred to <hi>Christ</hi> of their owne substance:<note place="margin">Luk. 8.3.</note> the woman of <hi>Shunem</hi> ministred to <hi>Elisha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 4.10.</note> prepared a chamber and other necessaries for him. <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> ministred to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> which <hi>oft refreshed him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and was not ashamed of his chaine. Dorcas</hi> ministred to the poore widdowes in clothing them. <hi>Doe good unto all, especially to them who are of the household of faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 9.39.</note> If any Saints are in want, minister to them. In this sence we must all be Ministers: this is a glorious service, a worthy ministration: in ministring to them, wee minister to <hi>Christ;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 25.40.</note> 
                     <hi>in as much as yee have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, yee have done it unto mee:</hi> and let it not grieve us to minister to <hi>Christ,</hi> which hath ministred his own bloud to us. The times are hard, wherein we live, all victualls are at an high rate, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore Saints fare hardly, lye hardly, goe hardly: let us open the bowels of compassion and minister to them. This worke above all others shall be recompensed at the day of Iudgement: <hi>when I was hungry, yee fed mee,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore let us occupy our selves in this ministration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:12681:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>But what, doe they content themselves with their former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring, doe they set downe their staffe there? No: <hi>and yet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> It is not sufficient to doe well for a time, but we must continue in well doing. Many soothe up themselves in their former good workes, they vaunt of them: such and such a thing did I. O how bountifull were we to our Preachers? How kind have we beene to them? O I, but are you kinde still? have yee ministred, and yet do yee minister? have yee beene zealous, and yet are yee zealous? have yee beene diligent hearers of the Word, and yet are yee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent? have yee beene liberall to the poore, and yet are yee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall?

                  <p>Yet there bee many that have beene good in the <hi>praeterperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> that are not in the <hi>present.</hi> They were sober, they would looke at no Ale-house, but now they are common drunkards; they were chaste, but now are adulterers: they were wont to keepe their Church well, they would never misse a Sermon; but now come seldome to Church, every trifle will keepe them from a Sermon: they were liberall, but now are covetous: that is a miserable thing, a dolefull tune. Let us so behave our selves, that it may be affirmed of us, we are yet good, yet zealous, yet religious: and let not this <hi>yet</hi> be given over, so long as we live.</p>
                  <p>This is an excellent place, as any in all the bible, to encourage us to good workes. <hi>God will never forget them.</hi> As hee puts our teares into his bottle, so he puts our good workes into his booke, and keepes a register of them all. Men may forget the good turnes to them; they wryte their injuries in steele, and their benefits in water: many will not acknowledge them that have beene their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> butler quickly forgate <hi>Ioseph,</hi> though he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him of his delivery. Men are forgetfull, but <hi>God</hi> is not: hee neither forgets us, nor our workes.<note place="margin">Isai. 49.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking Child, that shee should not have compassion on the Sonne of her wombe? yea, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee. God remembred the prayer and teares of Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20.5. <hi>The almes deeds of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius went up into remembrance before God, Acts</hi> 10.4. <hi>God</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers our prayers, our fastings, our joyfull hearing of his Word: he remembers what money we have given to the poore, the Cloath wherewith we have clothed them, the kindnesse we have shewed to his Ministers: if wee have given but a cup of cold water, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members it, and will reward it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. This should make us all zealous of good workes. Now a dayes by our preaching faith in CHRIST, we have through the corruption of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preached good workes out of the Church: the people nourish

I but <hi>God will not forget your good workes,</hi> he will reward them both in this life and in the life to come: he will give heaven to your workes, as they are the fruits of faith, though he give it not for the worthinesse and dignity of your workes: therefore be full of them.</p>
                  <p>Good workes are not the meritorious causes of heaven, yet they are the way to heaven; and yee cannot goe to heaven, but by the way of good workes:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note> therefore <hi>make your calling and election sure</hi> by them. <hi>Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> Your houses and land, silver and gold tarry behind when yee bee dead: but your workes follow you. <hi>God will not forget them,</hi> but Crowne them with the Crowne of eternall glory: therefore let us be plentifull in good workes.</p>

                  <p>He doth not desire that they might have the same diligence, but that they doe shew the same diligence, openly, abroad; that men may point at it with the finger, and ye may be ensamples to others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they seeing your good workes may glorifie your Father in heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.21. providing for honest things, not onely in the sight of the <hi>Lord,</hi> but in the sight of men. Wee must not only bee godly, but shew our selves godly: wee must not only have faith, but shew it, as <hi>Dorcas</hi> did: <hi>shew me thy faith by thy workes:</hi> we must not only have zeale, but shew it, as <hi>Phinees</hi> did: we must not only have patience, but shew it: <hi>let your patient mind be knowne to all men:</hi> we must not only have love to the Saints, but shew it. Yet we know that there is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shewing without an inward, an outward shew and an inward too: both must concurre. Some are all in shew, nothing in truth: some in shew and truth too. The Pharisees made a shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, fasted, prayed, gave almes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it was nothing but a shew. When they fasted, they looked sowre: when they gave almes, a trumpet was sounded at their gate: they prayed in the corners of the streets.

                  <p>We will be <hi>diligent</hi> in our trades and callings. The Merchant in his, the Clothyer in his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We will be diligent in them for the trash of this world.

Therefore let us be diligent, if by any meanes we may attaine to the resurrection of the dead: and let us not be diligent to day and negligent to morrow, but let us use the same diligence.

It is not a bare and naked faith, that can assure thee of heaven, but such as worketh by love. Men in this age flatter themselves in a supposed faith, and cast away the care of good workes: Wee cannot merit heaven by our worke; therefore wee will not worke at all: as if good workes served to no end but to merit. They are as pledges of eternall life: by them we may know whether <hi>our names are written in heaven</hi> or not: wee must know that, not <hi>à priori,</hi> for who at any time was <hi>Gods</hi> counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? but <hi>à posteriori:</hi> hast thou workes? then thou hast faith: are there fruits? then there is a roote: hast thou faith? then thou hast <hi>Christ:</hi> hast thou <hi>Christ?</hi> then thou hast the kingdome of heaven. Therfore let us all be abundant in good works, let us excell in good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.8. <hi>These are good and profitable to men:</hi> there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary use of them: they are infallible tokens of faith, faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> of the kingdome of heaven: therefore let us <hi>shew all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in them, to the full assurance of the hope of eternall life.</hi>

                  <p>Examples prevaile much. Though wee should rather live by lawes then by examples: yet examples have a mervailous attractive power. The Iewes especially were carryed away with examples: therefore the Apostle propoundeth some to them.

                  <p>They were laughed at that counterfeited a kinde of purblind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to follow <hi>Alexander,</hi> that imitated <hi>Plato</hi> in his crooked shoulders: when they goe straight, let us follow them; but when they goe crooked, let them goe alone. Wee must not follow <hi>Noah</hi> in his immoderate drinking, <hi>David</hi> in adultery and murther, <hi>Peter</hi> in denying CHRIST: we must tread in their good steps, not in their evill: wee must imitate them in faith and patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Philosophers, though in other things they jarred, yet they agreed in the commendation of <hi>patience. Tertul. God</hi> will take the part of a <hi>patient</hi> man.

                  <p>There were two glosses of the Pharisees in this, <hi>Matthew</hi> 23. <hi>verse</hi> 16.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It must be for the confirmation of a truth, not of a false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. It is a most vile thing to make GOD who is the truth it selfe, the witnesse of a lie.</p>

                  <p>We may sweare by <hi>God primariò &amp; principaliter</hi>; but we may sweare by the creatures <hi>Secundariò.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is but a meere shift and fond evasion, <hi>Zephan.</hi> 1.5. for they sware by the <hi>Lord primarily,</hi> by <hi>malchum secondarily</hi>; yet <hi>God</hi> was offended with them. Besides, there is none greater than man, but <hi>God.</hi> The Angels are creatures as well as we: they are our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-servants, and one fellow-servant must not sweare by another: therefore we that be creatures, must sweare only by the Creatour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here wee see what a reverent estimation wee are to have of an oath: it must be the end of contradiction: after men have sworne, wee should be as mute as fishes, not have a word to say. An oath was sacred among the heathen, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col</hi> his Captaine were satisfied, when they had <hi>Isacks</hi> oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.22. but with us small credit is to be given to oathes: the oath of a Christian is no sure foundation to build upon. <hi>Iesabel</hi> had false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses at her elbow to condemne <hi>Naboth</hi> withall: the Pharisees had two false witnesses in a readinesse to sweare against our SAVIOUR CHRIST. And now a dayes, such is the corruption among
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:12681:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christians, that small credit is to be given to many mens oathes: for they say it is an easie matter in London, and I would to <hi>God</hi> it were not in the country, to procure men to sweare to what they will. So that now a dayes an oath is rather the beginning then the end of controversies, whereupon so many perjuries are found in the land: a manifest argument that <hi>Atheisme</hi> growes among us. <hi>The foole</hi> that is the wicked man, <hi>sayes in his heart, there is no God:</hi> and I thinke many sweare by <hi>God,</hi> if there be a <hi>God:</hi> but all false swearers shall one day know, to the terrour of their conscience, that there is a <hi>God,</hi> who will be avenged on them for abusing his name. Let an oath be such an holy thing with us, that there may be no more controversie, after we have sworne.</p>

As wee that be Christians hope for heaven, where wee shall remaine with <hi>Christ</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

There is use of hope only in this world, while we remaine in this vaile of misery: and let us desire <hi>God</hi> to nourish the lampe of our faith to our dying day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In whom must our hope be fixed? In none but in <hi>God</hi> alone: <hi>thou art my hope, my castle, my tower, my refuge.

                  <p>Our ancre is in heaven: but as for us poore soules, how can we come thither? Well enough. <hi>Christ</hi> is there: therefore we shall bee there. The argument is drawne from the relatives. <hi>Christ</hi> is gone into heaven before, and we shall goe after him: he is <hi>praecursor,</hi> and wee <hi>postcursores. Iohn Baptist</hi> was <hi>Christs</hi> forerunner, and <hi>Christ</hi> is our forerunner: the head is in heaven, therefore the members shall be in heaven: the husband is in heaven, therefore the wife shall be with him: the first fruits are in the barne of heaven: <hi>Christ</hi> is the first fruits of them that sleepe; therefore we that are the second
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:12681:132"/>
fruits sanctified in him, and by him, shall one day be in heaven with him. Let this strengthen our faith and hope too: our forerunner is entred into heaven before us, and we shall follow after him. This may uphold us against all the suggestions and temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Flesh and bloud is ready to object against us: oh it is a long way to heaven, an irksome and tedious way: <hi>through many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wee must enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> You shall meete with many enemies by the way, and your legges are weake to carry you in this way: how is it possible for you to come thither?</p>
                  <p>To all these we must oppose this buckler. <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> is gone before us, and we shall follow after. <hi>Christ</hi> had a body as well as we, compassed with naturall infirmities as well as we, he dyed as well as we; yet he is in heaven: therefore, though I be full of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, though I dye, yet I shall rise againe, and <hi>meete Christ in the ayre,</hi> and be translated with him into his kingdome of glory. This is our hope of eternall life, and the <hi>Lord</hi> strengthen this hope in us all to the end.</p>
                  <p>Now least any should bee ignorant of whom hee meanes, hee points him out by his name and office.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST had good authority to enter into this sanctuary, because <hi>he is the true high Priest.</hi> As the High Priest in the time of the Law went into the earthly sanctuary: So is he gone into the heavenly.</p>

               <p>These offices are confirmed by the effects. 1. As a bountifull King, hee met <hi>Abraham,</hi> bringing out of his storehouse bread and wine, for the refreshing of him and his men, after the battell.</p>
               <p>The Papists are most ridiculous to fetch the Masse from hence: that the bread and wine brought by <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was a figure of the Masse, and that he did offer them as a sacrifice to <hi>God.</hi> But the Hebrew is <hi>[hotsia] prodire fecit:</hi> hee made them to come out of his cellar and butterie, he was no niggard of them: <hi>protulit, non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit,</hi> so <hi>Cajetan</hi> himselfe observed.</p>

Vndoubtedly there was a marveilous slaughter: the Kings in this battell on both sides were in number nine: then the common Souldiers, Captaines and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders must needs be many.

               <p>Nay, <hi>Luthers</hi> assertion is this, that we may not War against the Turke, when he is quiet, and doth not molest us.</p>
               <p>Wee must have Ministers and other good Christians to pray; and we must have Captaines and Souldiers to fight: for that cause,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:12681:134"/>
preparation to Warre is requisite.

               <p>Now if it be lawfull on some occasions for Christians to make Warre, then it is lawfull to prouide for Warre, and in the time of peace to have training for Warre, that men bee not to seeke when the enemie commeth. As Schollers are trained up in Schooles and Vniversities for the Ministery: as students are trained up in the Innes of Court for the Law, some to be Counsellors, Sergeants, Iudges throughout the Realme; as some are trained up to bee Merchants, Clothyers, Physitians,, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is requisite that some should bee trained up for the Warres.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Goliah</hi> is said to have beene a man of Warr from his youth up: hee was trained up in the Warre: which is spoken to his commendation, though hee were a wicked man. The Centurion had Souldiers trained up under him: <hi>fidem laudavit, milites non damnavit.</hi> So had <hi>Cornelius</hi> Souldiers, whom he brought up in the feare of <hi>God:</hi> and it is requisite in all Countries professing the Gospell, there shold be training to make men fit for War, if <hi>God</hi> shall send it. In the time of health wee provide for sicknesse, we will not be without Kerchiefes to put on our heads if need be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aquavitae in the house, least we happen to faint. When the Sea is at the calmest, the Marriners are provided for a storme and tempest: they have their Sailes, Masts, Ropes, Oares, Ancres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a readinesse, which they imploy when a tempest comes: So in the time of peace wee must provide for Warre, wee must have our armour and weapons in a readinesse, wherewith we may defend our Country and Religion, our selves, our Wives and Children. So did <hi>Vzziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.14. as GOD blesseth the one, so will he doe the other, if it bee used in his holy feare: and the <hi>Lord</hi> blesse the training that is amongst us, that no hurt, no drinking, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and swaggering, but much good may bee done by it, to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, the comfort of us all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melchizedec</hi> his Priest-hood is confirmed by two effects: the one on his part; the other on <hi>Abrahams:</hi> for his part, hee blessed him, with a solemne blessing, as <hi>Gods</hi> vicegerent: the manner of the blessing is set downe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.19, 20.</p>
               <p>From hence <hi>Bell.</hi> doth inferre. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de Ro: Pont. cap.</hi> 9. that one and the same man may be both an ecclesiasticall and a politicall Prince; as the Pope, who though he have no civill jurisdiction di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, yet indirectly he hath, so farre as it concerneth the spirituall good of the Church; and by vertue thereof he may set up and pull downe Princes at his pleasure. <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> sayes he, was both a King and a Priest: so may the Pope bee. <hi>Heli</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> were Priests and Iudges: So may the Pope be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. These were extraordinary in a few men; that of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> before the law was made for a separation of those two offices,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:12681:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after they were flatly distinguished in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> and sustained both offices, which concur in our <hi>Saviour Christ.</hi> The Pope is no type of <hi>Christ,</hi> therefore he cannot by that reason lay claime to both offices, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be holden upon other grounds.</p>
               <p>Here wee see what a reverent account we are to make of them whom GOD hath set apart to the office of the Priesthood and Ministery.</p>
               <p>They be the Priests, the Ministers of the most high <hi>God,</hi> in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and ecclesiasticall matters, they sustaine the person of <hi>God:</hi> therefore they are highly to bee esteemed of us. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in his letter to <hi>Ezra</hi> gives him an honourable title. <hi>Herod</hi> though a mighty King and glewed to his sweet <hi>Delilah</hi> of incest,<note place="margin">Ezr. 7.12.</note> reverenced <hi>Iohn Baptist. Constantine</hi> that famous and religious Emperour used the Bishops at the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> with mervailous respect: hee would not suffer them to stand bare before him: hee would have them to sit downe by him, professing that as he was <hi>Gods</hi> deputy in the Common-wealth, so were they in the Church: yet a number of prophane persons are there, even where the Gospell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, that thinke basely and speake basely of the Ministers: what bee they? they bee but Priests; I but they are the Priests of the most high <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The name of a Priest is an honourable name in the booke of <hi>God,</hi> not a name of reproach and contempt. Indeed the Popish massing Priests, that take upon them to offer sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, being most injurious to the one sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> once offered up for us all, they are worthy to be thrust out of the Country, with contumelie. Whereupon a woman in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes spake to a Priest, that came into the market to buy fowles, canst thou make GOD Almighty, and canst not make a Capon? But let us take heed how wee mocke the true Priests, Prophets, and Ministers of the LORD. The little Children that called <hi>Elisha</hi> balde pate, were torne in pieces by Beares: they are the Priests, the servants of the most high GOD: the master, whom they serve is the Highest above all; therefore take heed how yee despise his servants: reverence them for their master his sake, for their office sake, being <hi>Gods</hi> Ambassadours: for their workes sake, the salvation of you all, which <hi>God</hi> effecteth by them, receive the word preached by them with all meekenesse, that by it ye may be saved in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>HIs Priest-hood is ratified by another effect on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part: what? as it were to requite him withall? No: but as his part and portion, which in equity he could not with hold from him.</p>
                  <p>In the Hebrew it is somewhat doubtfull, whether <hi>Melchizedec</hi> gave tithes to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Melchizedec:</hi> nay, by that it seemes rather that <hi>Melchizedec</hi> gave to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the seventie, and especially S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> puts it out of doubt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melchizedec dedit spiritualia benedicendo: Abraham tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia decimando.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this historicall description of him out of <hi>Moses</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle first makes an interpretation, then application. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is of that, which was expressed by <hi>Moses:</hi> the application of that which was concealed by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He interprets his name.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The place where he ruled as King. <hi>Melechtzedec. (i)</hi> is put in <hi>ornatus gratia:</hi> as in <hi>Adonibezek, Abimeleck,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So is <hi>Christ</hi> the King of righteousnesse. <hi>Christ</hi> was righteous in his conception, in his conversation, preaching, and in the exequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the last judgement.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ruleth with righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without sinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee makes us righteous, <hi>Iehovah our righteousnesse, Ierem.</hi> 23.6, 26.</p>
                  <p>The second thing interpreted by the Apostle, is the place where he ruled as King: and that is <hi>Salem,</hi> which is, <hi>peace. Christ is our peace: Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Esai.</hi> 9.6.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was borne in the time of <hi>peace.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The Angels at his birth published <hi>peace, Luk.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. <hi>by his crosse he made peace.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> gave a tenth part, not of some, but of all. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees tithed Mint, Cummin and Anise, even the least things: which our <hi>Saviour</hi> commends them for, if they had not left the weightier matters of the law undone. But this goes to the heart of many. We are content to pay tithe corne: yet that, <hi>God</hi> knowes, doe many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly: but must we pay tithe hops, tithe cheese, tithe Apples? must wee pay tithe of the gaine that wee get by the trade of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?

Let <hi>him that is taught in the word, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto him that teacheth,</hi>

                     <hi>in all good things. Abraham gave tithe of all</hi> things to <hi>Melchizedec:</hi> so ought yee to doe, howsoever you flatter your selves to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Our best workes are too often defiled with sinne: many strange by-thoughts creepe into our minds while we are a praying:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:12681:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we pray not with sighes and groanes of the spirit, as wee ought to doe: we preach not with such wisedome, love, zeale, and power, as we should: we give not our almes so sincerely, as becommeth us, we receive not the Communion so penitently and thankfully as we should: we heare not the word with such reverence and attention as becommeth us: every one of us may knocke on our breasts after the best action we have done, with the Publican: and say, <hi>Oh God be mercifull to mee a sinner.</hi> I have no righteousnesse of mine owne to appeare before thee withall: cloath us with the righteousnesse of thy deere Sonne, the King of righteousnesse, that wee may bee found in him, to the everlasting joy and comfort of us all. Let the Papists trust to the broken staffe of their inherent righteousnesse, scoffing at the imputed righteousnesse of <hi>Christ:</hi> but let us desire this righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>By nature there is Warre betweene GOD and us: hee is our enemie, and wee his: the flagge of defiance is displayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us both.</p>
                  <p>Then in what a wofull case are we? are we able to encounter with the GOD of heaven and earth, that hath all creatures at his becke? we must needs goe by the worst: he can arme heaven, earth and hell against us: but here is our comfort,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.14. Rom. 5.1.</note> IESUS CHRIST is our peace: hee hath set at peace by the bloud of his crosse all things in heaven and earth. This is the true peace indeed, without the which wee can have no sound comfort: <hi>there is no peace, saith God, to the wicked. What peace</hi> said <hi>Iehu</hi> to <hi>Iehoram, when as the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of thy mother Iesabel are yet in great number?</hi> Though a man have the world at will, faire houses, large lands, ample possessions, great bagges of silver and gold, yet if his adulteries, oppressions, and other sinnes lye as an heavy loade on his conscience, alas what peace can hee have? <hi>hee is as the raging Sea,</hi> that cannot bee quiet. <hi>Achitophel</hi> had wealth enough; yet because he was not at peace with <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> tooke a rope and hanged himselfe. <hi>Iudas</hi> had money enough being the purse bearer, and having lately received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hirtie pieces of silver from the Scribes and Pharisees: but alas, his sinne vexing his conscience he could have no rest, but became his owne butcher. Therefore let us all desire <hi>God</hi> to give us an assurance in our hearts and consciences, that wee are subjects appertaining to the King of peace, and that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is our Peace.</p>
                  <p>It is a singular blessing to have outward peace, <hi>to sit quietly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our vines and figtrees, to have no leading into Captivity; no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our streets. God</hi> hath beene wonderfull gracious to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land these many yeares together, and that for the admirable peace which it enjoyed: we are to praise <hi>God</hi> that there be no tumults, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections, nor massacres; that there is no sword of the enemies to devoure in the land: but if in the meane season wee bee not at peace with <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> we are most miserable. Therefore let us pray especially for this peace, that we may be perswaded of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of all our sinnes in the bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:12681:136"/>This is most livelily represented to us in the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper. The breaking of the bread sets before our eyes the breaking of <hi>Christs</hi> body for our sins: the powring out of the Wine represents to us the gushing out of the bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> out of his Holy side for our iniquities: therefore let us come to this heavenly banquet with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts and contrite spirits, with a true and lively faith in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> the true King of peace, that wee may be assured that <hi>Christ</hi> is ours, so that whensoever death shall come, we may say with <hi>Simeon, Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace—for mine eyes have seene thy salvation.</hi> This is that <hi>peace which passeth all understanding:</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of peace give it to us all.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us shew our selves to bee Priests to him, offering up our selves, our soules, our bodies as an holy sacrifice to him in this life, that we may reigne with CHRIST our Priest for ever in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>The amplification of his greatnesse is set forth by comparing him with two famous persons, <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Levites.</hi> 1. That he is to be preferred above <hi>Abraham,</hi> he evinceth by these two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>

                  <p>That he is to be advanced above the <hi>Levites,</hi> he sheweth by two arguments.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. They are mortall: he is immortall.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>The first argument hath two parts: an affirmation, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of an objection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Argument: he that received tithes of <hi>Abraham</hi> that famous and worthy man, of whom the <hi>Iewes</hi> doe boast more than of any other, must needs be acknowledged to be a great man: but <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi> received tythes of <hi>Abraham: ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proposition dependeth on this: tythes were Gods right: therefore they that tooke tythes were in <hi>Gods</hi> roome: and for that cause superiour to them, that payd tythes. <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of tithes; <hi>Abraham</hi> a giver of tithes: therefore he was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                  <p>Because it is a matter of importance and worthy the marking, he stirres them up to attention by an <hi>Epiphonema.</hi>

                  <p>The taking of tithes by the Ministers argues a superioritie, that GOD hath given them over the people.

                  <p>Here wee behold the greatnesse of the Ministerie, and what great men the Ministers bee. It is a thing worth the consideration
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:12681:138"/>
of us all, for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> wills us to consider it. The receiving of tythes from the people argues the greatnesse of the Ministers, to whom tithes are paid. The world through the subtilty and malice of Satan hath a base opinion of the Ministers, supposing them to be little men, of no account, or reputation: yet in very truth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their stature be, if as little as <hi>Zacheus,</hi> whatsoever their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate and condition be, though as poore as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> that said, silver and gold have we none, yet in truth they are great men. <hi>Obadiah</hi> though the Kings steward, had an high opinion of <hi>Elias,</hi> sayes he, <hi>art not thou my Lord Elias?</hi> the King of <hi>Israel</hi> esteemed highly of <hi>Elisha; My father the charet of Israel and the horseman thereof. Herod</hi> reverenced <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and the very Devill spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the mayd, spake honourably of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas. Constantine</hi> the Emperour used the Bishops at the Councell of Nice with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous respect, he would needs have them to sit downe by him, and he would not be covered when any of them were preaching. The Spirit of <hi>God</hi> sayes in this place, consider how great a man <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi> was: So say I to you all; consider what great men the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word be. Is not the Kings Ambassadour a great man? they are Ambassadours of the King of Kings: therfore great men. Is not the steward of a noble mans house a great man? these are Gods stewards, the disposers of the secrets of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> termeth them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. they are as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, in their place and office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me, Luk.</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <p>When they preach, <hi>Christ</hi> preacheth: therefore great men, to be received as Angels from heaven, yea, as <hi>Christ</hi> himself: yet some prophane persons there be, that suppose them to be the least of all others, of least account and estimation. He is no Iustice of peace, no governour in the Common-wealth: therefore a little man, a straw for him. I but though in secular affaires they are subject to the civill Magistrates, yet in spirituall matters they are above them (I speak of subordinate Magistrates,) <hi>Consider them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord:</hi> they are the Shepheards; and all others, though there be a Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, yet they be all his sheepe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Minister in respect of his office is a great man; So let us esteeme of him, and receive with meekenesse, feare and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the word delivered by him. The small account that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make of the Preacher, causes the Word of <hi>God</hi> to finde the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser entertainement among them: therefore banish that opinion out of your hearts, and know them to be great men, as indeed they be.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol:</hi> true indeed, yet great oddes betweene them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>According to the law:</hi> not of their owne braines, but by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Law.</p>

Now here a question doth necessarily offer it selfe, whereunto the text draweth mee, whether I will or no; whether tithes bee the perpetuall maintenance of the Ministery or not? A thing somewhat controversall in this last and wicked age of the world, wherein charitie waxeth cold; as to all in generall, so to the Ministers in speciall. Some, if there were no law to compell them, would give them neither tithes nor any other thing at all, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull are they for the foode of their soules. I but wee will not stand to mans courtesie, for then in most places we should have a cursey; but it shall be evinced out of the Word of GOD, that tithes is that part and portion which <hi>God</hi> Almighty hath allotted to us. It was not only the <hi>Levites</hi> maintenance in the time of the law, but it is our maintenance in the time of the Gospell, and must continue to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellar:</hi> contendeth, that tythes are due to the Ministery, <hi>non jure divino, sed ecclesiastico:</hi> yet he alloweth, that in some sence it may bee affirmed that they are due <hi>jure divino.</hi> 1. <hi>Quoad substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, non quantitatem.</hi> 2. <hi>Si addatur ecclesiae determinatio:</hi> and so the feasts are now to bee kept holy <hi>jure divino.</hi> 3. That the very quantity is due, <hi>jure divino:</hi> yet <hi>non ex vi juris divini, sed ex vi juris ecclesiastici.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are nothing else but starting holes: for it is a firme and immoveable truth, that the very quantity is still due to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospell, whether the Church determine it or not: for <hi>Gods</hi> institution dependeth not on the constitution of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Here we have just occasion to intreat of tithes: wherein sundry questions are to be discussed.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Whether tithes are now due to the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell?</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>For the former. Tithes are due to the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; not of almes, or of benevolence, which the people may pay us, if they will: but of justice, we have a right and interest to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire:</hi> a beggar is not worthy
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:12681:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of almes, when yee give a labourer his hire, yee give him his due, not an almes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. A Souldier hath right to his stipend, hee hath it not of almes: A Shepheard hath a right to live on the flocke, and an husbandman hath a right to eat of the fruit of the Vineyard, which he planteth.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. By <hi>Abrahams</hi> paying of tythes to <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> the Apostle concludeth the perpetuity of <hi>Christs</hi> Priest-hoode, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.8. Now if tithes were paid to <hi>Christ</hi> before the law, then they are still due to <hi>Christ</hi> to the end of the world, so long as his Priest-hood continueth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Tithes are the <hi>Lords,</hi> as a right in every mans goods, <hi>Le.</hi> 27.30.</p>
                     <p>Those hee gave for a time to <hi>Levi,</hi> so long as he served at the tabernacle: when <hi>Levi</hi> ceased to serve at the altar, tithes ceased to bee due to <hi>Levi:</hi> but they ceased not to bee the <hi>Lords:</hi> for as they were his before the law; so they stand his for ever: and hee transferreth them from <hi>Levi</hi> to others, that still serve the <hi>Lord</hi> in his ministery.</p>
                     <p>They were in the law of nature: therefore they are perpetuall, as the law of nature is written in mens hearts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14.20.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi> payd tithes; not of the spoiles, but of his owne goods</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is not like he would give of other mens goods.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He could not give that, which he tooke not: but hee tooke none of the spoiles, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.23. therefore. So Master <hi>Calvin</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth on that place.</p>
                     <p>As for that <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.4. 1. The Greeke word is in no authour taken simply for tithes, but for <hi>primitiae:</hi> and sometimes for <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae manubiarum.</hi> 2. <hi>Ierome</hi> translates it, <hi>de praecipuis:</hi> and the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack</hi> calls it <hi>first fruits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet bee it, that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid tithes of the spoiles, it followes not, of them only, much more of his owne goods: for <hi>Levi</hi> then in <hi>Abraham</hi> payd tithes to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> as <hi>Levi</hi> tooke tithes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.9. but he tooke tithes of mens owne goods. So did <hi>Abraham</hi> pay of his owne goods, as well as of the spoiles.</p>
                     <p>And it is very probable, that <hi>Abraham</hi> payd tithes to <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec,</hi> not at that time alone, but yeerely.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As tithes were paid in the law; so were they before the law: the manner was all one: but in the law they payd yeerely: <hi>Ergo.</hi> and the Priests before the law were as worthy of them yeerely, as afterwards.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The distance of place could be no hinderance: for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> dwelt at <hi>Hebron</hi> over against <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Melchizedec</hi> at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which was afterwards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> both of them in the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> not farre asunder.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> This proves that tithes were voluntary, and that men were not bound to pay them: for (as <hi>Bellar.</hi>) If <hi>Iacob</hi> had beene bound to pay tithes, as a morall duty written in his heart by nature, then he did ill to vow it with a condition.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> We may vow morall things, the better to bind our selves to the performance of them, as <hi>God</hi> hath bound us to them before: the worshipping of <hi>God</hi> is a morall duty, but they bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to it with an oath and a covenant, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12. to the 16. To praise <hi>God</hi> is a morall duty: but <hi>David</hi> vowed it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.14.56, 12.</p>
                     <p>And it is lawfull to vow these things with a condition, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did: if <hi>God</hi> would blesse him with <hi>goods:</hi> for else hee could have payd no tithes. We may vow to honour our parents, if <hi>God</hi> will blesse us with life: otherwise we cannot honour them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Wee must vow that which is our owne, not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others: if tithes at this time were the <hi>Lords,</hi> then <hi>Iacob</hi> would not have vowed them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes: wee may vow that which is the <hi>Lords,</hi> to bind our selves by a new promise to the performance of that whereunto <hi>God</hi> hath already bound us: and this argues a resolution to doe it: as <hi>David</hi> bound himselfe to obedience, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.106.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is like that <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed to pay tithes, not immediately to <hi>God,</hi> but mediately to the Priest of <hi>God</hi>; as <hi>Abraham</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                     <p>It may be also proved by the consent of all nations.</p>
                     <p>From the sonnes of <hi>Noah</hi>; the custome of paying tithes to their <hi>Gods</hi> and Priests, was dispersed among all nations. <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> when he had overcome the <hi>Lydians,</hi> offered tithes of all he had to <hi>Iuppiter, Herod. Cli: Macrobius</hi> prooveth out of <hi>Varro,</hi> that it was an ancient custome among the <hi>Romans</hi> to vow and pay tithes to <hi>Hercules:</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth that <hi>Lucullus</hi> grew rich, because he used to pay tythes to <hi>Hercules. Xenophon</hi> witnesseth that men used to pay tithes to <hi>Apollo. Pliny</hi> writeth of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> that the Merchants medled not with the spices, till the Priests had their tenth.</p>

                     <p>That they are not ceremoniall may be proved from the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ceremonie. A ceremonie is a carnall type of an holy thing enjoyned for the use of the tabernacle, till the time of reformation, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.10.</p>

                     <p>Tithes come not within the compasse of this definition.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. They were not instituted for the service of the tabernacle, but assigned to it for a time.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They were not to cease at the time of reformation: for still they are retained in the Church, as the maintenance of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: which the Church should not doe, if it were a ceremony that should end at the comming of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is no institution or assignation of tithes, but a declaration of the <hi>Lords</hi> right. I doe you no wrong in assigning the tithes to <hi>Levi,</hi> for they be mine, and not yours.</p>
                     <p>They are holy to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that is, separate from the use of men: So that it is sacriledge to take them away.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here we may see what is ceremoniall, what perpetual in tithes. This proposition, (<hi>all tithes are the Lords,</hi>) is perpetuall; the assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them to the <hi>Levits</hi> in the second place is ceremoniall, that is Levitically ceremoniall: for if there bee any ceremony in tithes, it is a Leviticall ceremony.<note place="margin">Num. 18.21.</note>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Sacrificing it selfe is in the law of nature: but particular ordinances for the manner of sacrificing are ceremoniall.

                     <p>Yet there is a difference betweene sacrifices and tithes.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>In not sacrificing, godlinesse is violated: in not paying tithes, not only godlines, but Iustice also is violated. Now a ceremonie standeth not in paying to <hi>God</hi> that which is his: but in giving to <hi>God</hi> that which is thine owne.</p>

                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:12681:141"/>2. In the end. Sacrificing is to signifie the great sacrifice on the crosse for the sinnes of the world. The end of tithes is not to signifie any thing, but is the honour and maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery: and therefore they are to remaine so long as the Ministery remaineth.</p>
                     <p>That assignation of tithes to <hi>Levi,</hi> or, that lease being expired, they returne to their proper right againe, that is, to CHRIST <hi>which liveth for ever, Hebrewes</hi> 7. <hi>Verse</hi> 8 for though it bee first true in <hi>Melchizedec</hi> the type, who in respect of the silence of his death, is said to live: yet most of all is it verefied of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The service of the tabernacle being abrogated, the assignation of tithes to the <hi>Levites</hi> is voyd: but the propriety of them ever was and is in the <hi>Lord,</hi> for his Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Improperly to speake, the assignation of tithes was ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that is, appertaining to the ceremoniall law: but properly to speake, there is nothing ceremoniall in the paying of tithes: for in it there is no carnall type of an holy thing, neither in the Leviticall nor Evangelicall ministery.</p>
                     <p>There is no proofe in all the New Testament for any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie maintenance of the Ministery:<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Though tithes were buried for a season in persecution, yet they were resumed and established againe in the Church in all ages,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The causes remaining, the things must still remaine: but the causes of giving tithes remaines still,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Because it was not ordained immediately for the worship of <hi>God,</hi> but for the constitution of equity among men, and for that cause judiciall, rather than ceremoniall. The equity was this, that there might be a proportion, between the goods of the <hi>Levites</hi> and others. The whole family of <hi>Israel</hi> was divided into twelve tribes, or rather thirteene tribes; for <hi>Ioseph</hi> made two, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh:</hi> whereupon in equity, the <hi>Levites</hi> should have had but the thirteenth part: yet because <hi>God</hi> foresaw that a number would pay badly, he allotted to the <hi>Levites</hi> the tenth part.</p>
                     <p>By the same reason, no maintenance of Ministers should bee morall: because it hath not an immediate relation to the worship of <hi>God.</hi>

                     <p>By what reason it may bee shewed, that the determination of the Church is just, that Christians should give the tenth part of their fruits to the Church.</p>

(for it were a madnes sayes <hi>Bell.</hi> to dispute that) but upon what justice and equity the payment of the tenth part dependeth.</p>
                     <p>There was some equity for it in the old law, because the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> were the twelfth or thirteenth part of the people: but now there seemes to be no equitie of it, because the Clergy is not the hundred part of the people.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Because the Clergy must bee hospitall, and maintaine the poore.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> denies that the <hi>Levites</hi> were the thirteenth part of the people, and that the Clergie now is not the hundreth part: for the people were sixe hundred thousand and three thousand, and five hundred and fiftie, besides Women and Children, <hi>Num.</hi> 1.45.46. whereas the <hi>Levites</hi> in all were but two and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, <hi>Num.</hi> 3.39.</p>

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. Whether we are bound to pay tithes to a bad Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or not? Tithes must be given to bad Ministers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Matthew</hi> 22. <hi>Verse</hi> 21. Yet at that time bad <hi>Caesars</hi> and bad Priests—</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>A bad Father, must have maintenance from his Sonne, and a bad Minister must have tithes from his people. But how cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ought yee to give it to them, that are faithfull and diligent in the worke of the <hi>Lord?</hi> Yet all is one. Let him be never so good a Preacher, if S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> were among us, unlesse the law constrained us, he should have nothing.</p>
                     <p>What a lamentable case is this?</p>
                     <p>The light of this truth is as cleere as the noone day. Tithes are still due by the Law of <hi>God</hi> to the Ministers of the Gospell: yet
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:12681:143"/>
what a stirre hath hee to get his due? how hardly is it wrung even from them that carry a glorious shew of Religion? <hi>Wee have a custome,</hi> said the <hi>Iewes</hi> to Pilat, thou must let loose <hi>Barabbas</hi> to us, though hee bee a thiefe and a murtherer: so wee pleade, wee have a custome to pay little or nothing instead of any tithes; therefore we will hold this custome, though you preach your hearts out.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Consider the equity of the custome. That, which at the first springing up of the custome was but worth a Groate, is now worth tenne shillings: and yet will yee against all reason hold that custome still?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Iewes</hi> had a custome, <hi>upon small occasion to put away their Wives,</hi> derived from <hi>Moses:</hi> yet CHRIST brake the necke of that custome, saying, <hi>ab initio non fuit sic. Moses</hi> permitted that <hi>for the hardnesse of your hearts,</hi> because hee had to deale with <hi>a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and stiffe-necked people</hi>;<note place="margin">Matth. 19.8.</note> but from the beginning it was not so. So say I, the law for the hardnesse of your hearts permits this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, as it doth eight in the hundred, but looke backe to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and yee shall finde that from the beginning it was not so. It is an Axiome in the law, <hi>nullum tempus occurit regi. The King never looses his right for discontinuance of time.</hi> And shall the King of Kings be debarred of his right, because of a new upstarte custome? Flatter not your selves in your customes; they are but broken reeds for you to leane upon. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes; <hi>If any man list to bee contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we have no such custome, nor the Churches of God.</hi> So say I to you, if any list to rob <hi>God</hi> and his Ministers of their right, <hi>we have no such custome, nor the Churches of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a wonderfull delusion, that the Devill hath bewitched ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny withall; <hi>stollen waters are sweete,</hi> and all is good that we may take from the Ministers.</p>
                     <p>He that robbeth a Minister; robbeth <hi>God, Mal.</hi> 3.8. and is it no sinne to rob <hi>God?</hi> he that stealeth from a common Christian, is a thiefe: but hee that stealeth from a Minister is a Church-robber: the one is theft, the other is sacriledge: the one breakes the second table; the other the first table. Therefore take heed of this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sinne. Tithes are the LORDS, hee hath given them to us: therefore take you good heede, how yee take them away from us, <hi>least you bee found fighters against God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 5.39.</note> as wise <hi>Gamaleel</hi> said to the Councell. Take away maintenance from any calling, and it will quickly fall to the ground: who would be a Merchant if hee must be a beggar all the dayes of his life? Who would be a Clothier, if he get no gaine by it? Who would put his Sonne to the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, there be at charges with him seven or eight yeares, afterwards to be a Minister, and to have no comfortable maintenance in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? it is a matter of greater importance then we are aware of: the denying of the Ministers right is the overthrow of the Ministery, and so consequently of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> whereby wee must bee saved in the life to come: therefore let us not have a finger in it.</p>
                     <p>You thinke to waxe rich by defrauding of the Ministers, but
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:12681:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that is the high-way to poverty and beggery too. Such money is put into a bottomlesse bagge, it will never prosper. Consider what the <hi>Lord</hi> saith <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Prove me,</hi> &amp;c. pay your tithes conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in truth and sincerity, as you ought to doe, and <hi>Gods</hi> blessing shall bee on you and yours: steale from the Ministers of <hi>God,</hi> and thy wealth one way or other shall melt away as the waxe before the fire. Therefore in the feare of <hi>God</hi> let us all looke to it: let us, as <hi>God</hi> hath given tithes to them for their livelyhood, so give them cheerefully, <hi>for God loveth a chearefull giver</hi>; let us deale bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with GOD and his Ambassadours in this present life, that he may deale bountifully with us, and give us his owne kingdome in the life to come.</p>
                     <p>The second argument whereby the Apostle proves <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi> to bee greater than <hi>Abraham,</hi> is laid downe in the last words of this sixth verse. <hi>Hee that blesseth, is greater than he, that is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:</hi> but <hi>Melchizedec</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham, ergo,</hi> he is greater than <hi>Abraham</hi> whom he blessed.</p>
                     <p>Hee doth not say, him that had so many merits; <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull had no merits, whereof he might glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee was not justified in the sight of <hi>God</hi> by any of his workes, but only by believing the promises: this is our righteousnesse, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promises of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are to make a precious account of <hi>Gods</hi> promises, they be the most excellent jewells that wee can have: hee doth not say; hee blessed him that had silver and gold, Sheepe and Oxen, but <hi>the promises.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> was a mervailous rich man,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.35. Gen. 14.14.</note> 
                        <hi>God</hi> had blessed him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly: hee had at this time above three hundred uprising and down-lying in his house, yet the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth not say, he blessed him that was such a wealthy man, that had such large lands &amp; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, but hee blessed him that <hi>had the promises.</hi> The promises of GOD are the greatest riches that a man can have: our silver and gold may bee taken from us, but <hi>Gods</hi> promises shall abide with us for ever.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Abraham</hi> had not the <hi>promises</hi> for himselfe alone: but for all the Children that believe as he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. as hee had the promises, so have wee: and let us make much of them: they must be our comfort in all calamities, yea in death it selfe: <hi>heaven and earth shall passe away, but not a tittle of my word shall passe unful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled:</hi> therefore let us highly esteeme of the promises of <hi>God:</hi> they be the strongest pillars we have to leane upon.</p>

                  <p>THe major proposition of the argument is proved by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of all: <hi>and without all contradiction, the lesse is blessed of the greater:</hi> that, which is of lesser account and reckoning: the thing being put for the person.</p>
                  <p>I, but is <hi>the lesse blessed of the greater? Iacob</hi> blessed <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 47.10. and 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.66. the people blessed the King, yet they were not greater than <hi>Salomon:</hi> we blesse <hi>God</hi>; yet we are not greater than <hi>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>There is a double blessing: the one improper, the other proper.</p>
                  <p>Improperly to speake, to blesse is to wish well, as to pray for one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. So the poore blessed <hi>Iob. Iob</hi> 31.20. So infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours may blesse their superiours, that is, pray to <hi>God</hi> for them: So the Child may blesse the father, the people the Minister, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Prince: but properly to speake, blessing is a pronouncing and an actuall bestowing of happinesse on them, that are blessed. Thus <hi>God</hi> Almighty doth blesse us all:<note place="margin">Luke 24.50.</note> thus CHRIST blessed his Church at his Ascension into heaven: hee left an actuall blessing with them, and in them with us all: thus the Priests in the name of <hi>God</hi> blessed the people: and so doe we that be the Ministers of the Gospell at this day: we as <hi>Gods</hi> Ambassadours and in CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> stead: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. doe not only pronounce a blessing on the People, but by the gracious operation of <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit wee are as <hi>Gods</hi> hands to powre downe a blessing on them. In this respect we sustaine <hi>Gods</hi> person, and are greater than the people whom we blesse.</p>
                  <p>The Papists ascribe too much to the blessing of the Ministers, and we give too little to it: they say that a Bishops blessing takes away veniall sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But that sounds ill: for the bloud of CHRIST taketh away all sin: yet there is great force and efficacy in the blessing of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers: their curse if it bee lawfull, is terrible. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whom <hi>Elisha</hi> cursed, were torne in pieces with Beares: and their blessing is powerfull and effectuall; when they preach, <hi>God</hi> preaches; and when they blesse, GOD blesseth. Therefore they that runne out of the Church, before the blessing, despise GOD Himselfe. GOD by us blesseth you, and will you not set a straw by this blessing?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To blesse is taken for giving of thankes. So wee blesse <hi>God,</hi> we give him thankes for all his mercies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To blesse is to consecrate a thing to an holy use. So <hi>God</hi> blessed the seaventh day. So the Cup is called <hi>the Cup of blessing,</hi> because it was blessed by <hi>Christ,</hi> and set apart to an heavenly use.</p>
                  <p>This is a lively demonstration of the Ministers superioritie
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:12681:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
above the people, <hi>without all contradiction</hi>—wee blesse you, you are blessed of us: therefore wee are greater than you. <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Iacob,</hi> therefore he was greater than <hi>Iacob. Iacob</hi> blessed his twelve sonnes; therefore he was greater than they: we as spirituall fathers blesse you; therefore we are greater than you. Some of you may bee more honourable, more worshipfull, more wealthy then wee: yet in respect of our office wee are greater than you. If there be a Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord, an Earle in the Parish, he must bee willing to be blessed by the Minister: we as <hi>Gods</hi> deputies blesse you in the name of the <hi>Lord</hi>; in that respect wee are your superiours, highly to bee esteemed and reverenced of you all. You are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, not simply as men, but as men of <hi>God</hi>; for we are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fathers that blesse you in the name of <hi>God,</hi> and are as <hi>Gods</hi> armes to pull you up into the kingdome of heaven.</p>

The Apostles were taught by Christ's owne mouth, the Holy Ghost descended on them in the similitude of Cloven tongues, they were the silver trumpets that carryed the sound of the Gospell over all the world, yet they dyed.

we are as <hi>Gods</hi> stewards to dispose the food of eternal life to them, let not this make us proud: though we be as perfect Scribes in the Law of the <hi>God</hi> of heaven, as <hi>Ezra</hi> was; as eloquent a man and mightie in the Scriptures, as <hi>Apollos:</hi> as learned a man as <hi>Paul</hi> was, that spake with tongues more than they al, as powerful a Preacher, as <hi>Elias</hi> or <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> as thundering a Preacher, as the Sons of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerges.</hi> Though thou haddest the Bible by heart, as <hi>Origen</hi> had, of as great variety of reading as <hi>Athanasius</hi>—yet die thou must. <hi>They that receive tithes dye:</hi> yea all other receivers dye too.

                  <p>HEere the Apostle shewes how <hi>Levi</hi> paid tithes to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec,</hi> lest it might seeme a paradoxe: he payd tithes to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> not in his owne person <hi>exclusivè,</hi> but inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively in <hi>Abraham:</hi> he was in his loines <hi>potentialiter &amp; originariè,</hi> as the Schoolemen speake: as all creatures were in <hi>materia prima.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Levi</hi> was in the loines of <hi>Abraham secundum concupiscentiam carnalem: Christus autem secundum solam substantiam corporalem.

                  <p>But the soundest answer is: <hi>Christ</hi> in this <hi>Antithesis</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> which was a type of him, not under <hi>Abraham:</hi> therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is here considered as a taker of tithes in <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> not as a payer of tithes in <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The scope of all is to prove the excellency of <hi>Christs</hi> Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, above the Leviticall Priest-hood, wherof the Iewes so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gloried: the <hi>Levits</hi> themselves payd tithes to <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi>; therefore <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood is by many degrees more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then theirs.</p>
                  <p>There was a worthy and glorious Priest-hood in time of the law: there was an high-Priest in goodly apparell, clothed with a white linnen <hi>Ephod,</hi> that had a Miter on his head, a faire breast-plate on his breast, on which was written the names of the twelve tribes of <hi>Israel</hi>: he went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> once a yeare, and offered up the prayers of the people. Besides him there were a great number of Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> throughout all the townes and cities of <hi>Israel:</hi> they offered the sacrifices of the people, and made attonement for them before the <hi>Lord:</hi> they taught the people and instructed them in the wayes of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet all these are nothing to our <hi>Saviour Christ:</hi> hee excells them as much as the Sunne doth the Starres, or the body the sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dow. They were all but shadowes of him: hee is the true high-Priest, which is a Priest for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedec.</hi> They were but men, hee is <hi>God</hi> and man: they sinfull, hee without sinne: they mortall, he immortall: their sacrifices were but figures of his sacrifice: the bloud of Goats Lambes offered by them took away no sinne; his bloud purgeth us from all sinne: they received tithes of their brethren; but they themselves payd tithes to <hi>Christ:</hi> they prayed for the people in the Temple; <hi>Christ</hi> prayes for us in heaven. A most glorious high-Priest, worthy to be honoured of us all! Let us subject our selves to this high-Priest, which hath made us Kings and Priests to <hi>God</hi> his father, that we may reigne with him our Priest and King in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>Not <hi>Abraham</hi> alone, not the Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> alone, but all Kings and Princes, yea all the Angels in heaven must stoope to <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore let us all meditate in his greatnesse, which may be a singular comfort to us, that we have such a great King and Priest as <hi>Christ</hi> is, who is greater than all creatures in the world.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The occasion of his calling was the imperfection of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Priest-hood. Above the which the Priest-hood of <hi>Christ</hi> is advanced by foure arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the change of the one, and the firmenesse of the other, <hi>Verse</hi> 11.12, 13, 14.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. From the manner of the institution of them both: the one by an oath, the other without an oath, <hi>Verse</hi> 20.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. from a difference betweene the Priests of them both: they were many, he but one: they dyed, he lives for ever; which is amplified by an effect, <hi>Verse</hi> 23.24, 25.</p>
                  <p>Then followeth the description of this our high-Priest. Where there is a commendation of his person, <hi>Verse</hi> 26.27. and of his Ministery, <hi>Verse</hi> 28.</p>

                  <p>THe first argument from the change is illustrated by the cause, and the manner thereof. The cause was, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection could not be obtained by it. If we had been justified, sanctified, delivered from sin and damnation, and brought to heaven by the Priest-hood of the Levites, then why did it not remaine still, why was another Priest-hood substituted in the roome of it?</p>
                  <p>For the manner of the change; the Priest-hood went not away alone, but the fall of it was the fall of the law too: and when I speake of the Priest-hood, I speake of the law too: for under it the people received the law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:12681:147"/>Some translate the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>unto: for unto it</hi>; namely to put us in minde of perfection, that was to comeby the Priest-hood of CHRIST. The law was established to the people: but that is further fetched: and the preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth signifie <hi>under,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The people were lawified, tied and bound with the fetters of the ceremoniall law.</p>
                  <p>If perfection had beene by them, what needed there a further supply? but there came another Priest-hood, and an other law too: therefore the former were imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Priest-hood; there arose another Priest of another order, then the Leviticall Priests were: they were of the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> this of <hi>Melchizedec.</hi>

                     <hi>Deus &amp; natura nihil faciunt frustrà:</hi> the wise and omnipotent GOD doth nothing that is needlesse and unnecessary. If it had not beene needefull that another Priest should arise after the order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> the Priest-hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> might have remained still. If preaching had not beene necessary, GOD would never have instituted preaching. If the Sacraments had not beene neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary helpes for the strengthning of our faith, <hi>God</hi> would never have ordained the Sacraments: if wee could have beene justified and made righteous by our owne fulfilling of the law, <hi>God</hi> would never have sent his Sonne into the world, made of a woman and under the law for our sakes: but <hi>God</hi> sent <hi>Christ</hi> into the world to fulfill the law for us; therefore all our righteousnes is not worth a straw. This is the Logick of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and all wrangling Sophisters in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must yeeld unto it. If <hi>Aarons</hi> Priest-hood could have perfected us, <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood should never have ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up in the roome thereof.</p>
                  <p>Wherein wee may behold the supereminent dignity of <hi>Christ</hi> his Priest-hood above the Aaronicall and Leviticall Priest-hood. It cannot be denyed, but that <hi>Aarons</hi> Priest-hood was most glorious. As the Psalmist speaketh of the Church; so may wee of it: <hi>many glorious things are spoken of thee, thou City of God:</hi> many glorious things are recorded of the Leviticall Priest-hood. There was a costly tabernacle, a sumptuous Temple, the wonder of the whole world, there was an admirable Altar, many oblations and sacrifices, there were sundry Sabbaths and new Moones, diverse festivall dayes, the feast of unleavened bread, of the blowing of Trumpets, of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, of Dedication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were kept with wonderfull so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, there were many washings and purgings for the clensing of the people. <hi>Vid. Supra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let us magnifie GOD for this our high Priest by
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:12681:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom wee have an enterance into the kingdome of heaven. The high-Priest went into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> himselfe, but hee carryed none of the people with him, they stood without: our high-Priest is not only gone into heaven himselfe, but hee hath also brought us thither: that high-Priest offered Bulls, Calves, Lambes for the sinnes of the people; this high-Priest offered himselfe for us all. Therefore let us honour and reverence this our high-Priest, let us subject our selves to him in all things. He that would not obey the high-Priest in the time of the Law, was cut off.</p>
                  <p>And doe ye thinke we may lawfully contemne our high-Priest in the time of the Gospell? Let us say to him, as the people did to <hi>Iosua, whatsoever thou commandest us, that will wee doe</hi>—Hee hath made us all Priests to GOD his Father, that wee should offer up our selves, our soules and bodies, as an holy and acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him: therefore let us shew our selves to bee Priests, let us sacrifice the filthy Beast of uncleannesse, the ugly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed beast of drunkennesse, the insatiable Wolfe of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the crooked Serpent of Craft and divellish policy, the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Toade of pride and loftinesse, the consuming beasts of envy, hatred and malice: let us offer up the sacrifice of praise to this our high-Priest all the dayes of our life in this present world, that wee may sing praises to him with Saints and Angels for ever in the world to come.

The <hi>Iewes</hi> were stubborne defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Ceremoniall law above all things: they could not abide to heare of any change of it.

                  <p>He doth not openly say; if the Priest hood be abolished, then the law is abolished: the <hi>Iewes</hi> being zealous of the law could not as yet indure that. Therefore he mollifies his speech, using a more soft and gentle terme: <hi>if the Priest-hood be changed.</hi> Yet in effect it is all one: they <hi>changed,</hi> as <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> did. <hi>Felix</hi> went out of the countrey, and <hi>Festus</hi> came in his roome: So the Leviticall Priest-hood went away, gave place to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood, which is come in the roome thereof, <hi>transposed, put out of place, altered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee doth not say; then by all probability, there must bee a change of the law: but of necessity, it cannot be avoyded.</p>

In an armie every one must keepe his station: the common Souldier must not bee a Captaine, unlesse he be called thereunto: a Bow-man must not be a Bill-man, unles he be appointed thereunto: So is it in a well ordered estate; every man must not presume to expound Scripture, to Minister the Sacraments, to bee a Preacher, unlesse hee bee called, <hi>as Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was.</hi>

                     <hi>Vzzah</hi> put his hand to the Arke, when it was in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but hee was stricken with sudden death. <hi>Vzziah</hi> being a King presumed to offer incense,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26.</note> but he was a Leaper for it all the dayes of his life. Then what malepart boldnesse is it for a private man to step up into the Pulpit, and to take upon him without warrant to be as GOD's mouth to the people? Yet some in a jolly humour have done it: whom <hi>God</hi> hath punished one way or other. <hi>None of the Tribe of Iudah served at the Altar.</hi> Let every man abide in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein <hi>God</hi> hath set him. Let us serve in those places which GOD in wisedome hath allotted to us. But though they served not at the Altar, yet they served in other functions: none, of what Tribe so ever, of what condition soever, must bee idle: wee must all serve <hi>God</hi> in some place or other. Some <hi>serve</hi> as Kings: it is a <hi>service</hi> to be a King. The Philosopher calls a King <hi>Servum publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum:</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe calls <hi>David, his servant,</hi> when hee was a King. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> that mightie Monarch was <hi>Gods servant.</hi> Some serve as Counsellours to the King for the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: some serve as Iudges, some as Lawyers, some as Merchants, Clothiers, Weavers, Husbandmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We must all <hi>serve God,</hi> and one another in love, in some calling or other. The eye serveth one way for the benefit of the body: the eare another way: the hand another way, and the foote the lowest part of the body serves too; the service whereof is so necessary, as that the body cannot be without it. We may serve <hi>God</hi> to his glory and our owne comfort in the meanest calling that is: and let us all so <hi>serve</hi> him in our severall places in this world, that wee may raigne with him in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle doth not say, <hi>whereof no man ruled at the Altar.</hi> It cannot bee denyed, but that Ministers in some sort are rulers of the people:<note place="margin">Acts 23.5. Hebr. 13.17.</note>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12681:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our office must not puffe us up with pride; we must remember it is a service, yea a painefull and an honourable service. <hi>He that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the office of a Bishop, desireth a worthy worke, on us</hi> rather than <hi>honos, prodesse</hi> rather than <hi>praesse,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Our selves your servants for</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s sake.</hi> Yet it is not a base <hi>service,</hi> as some imagine, and in reproch they will say of a Minister, hee <hi>serves</hi> at such a towne. Wee grant we are <hi>servants:</hi> yet in an high and honourable place: we serve in the Church, the house of <hi>God,</hi> as stewards do in a Noble mans house: we dispense to you the foode of life.

                     <hi>Sol:</hi> They of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> might take Wives out of other Tribes, so as the inheritance were not transported out of the Tribe, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.11. yet the men, not the women, gave the denomination of the Tribe, and the child was not said to be of that Tribe whereof his mother was, but whereof his father was.</p>

                  <p>It was not <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, but one of <hi>David</hi>'s sonnes of that name, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest, <hi>Christ</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> concerning which—<hi>Moses Gods</hi> Scribe and Pen-man of that, that was deputed to the Priest hood.</p>
                  <p>The Tribe is changed: <hi>ergo,</hi> the Priest-hood.</p>
                  <p>It pleased CHRIST to come of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> not for any holinesse that was in <hi>Iudah</hi> above the rest of the twelve Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. <hi>Iudah</hi> himselfe committed incest with his daughter, though unknowne to him; at the least hee tooke her to be an Whore, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:12681:150"/>
lay with her: but our <hi>Saviour</hi> made choice of this Tribe, of his owne gracious goodnesse.</p>
                  <p>Though CHRIST descended of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet all of that Tribe were not sayed. There are seald as many thousands of all other Tribes as of that: and of that Tribe, as Kings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are noted to be wicked men. Therefore wee must not flatter our selves in any outward prerogatives, as the Papists doe. They have a part of the coate, wherein <hi>Christ</hi> went to be crucified, some of the nailes wherewith hee was fastned to the Crosse: they make pilgrimages to the Sepulchre of <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c. All these are nothing to salvation.</p>
                  <p>Though thou couldest derive thy generation from <hi>Christ</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh: though thou haddest beene one of <hi>Christs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if possible, lien in the same wombe, yet that makes thee not the neerer to the kingdome of heaven. Lay hold on <hi>Christ</hi> with a lively faith, labour to say with <hi>Paul, I live, and yet not I, but the Son of God liveth in mee</hi>; then thou shalt be eternally saved.</p>
                  <p>Our LORD CHRIST is often honoured in Scripture with this title: it may worthily bee adscribed to him. He created us of nothing, preserveth and upholdeth us being created, hee bought us with his precious bloud, when we were worse than nothing: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore justly is he our <hi>Lord.</hi> This we confesse in our Creede. <hi>And in Iesus Christ our Lord,</hi> this we professe in our prayers, which end thus, <hi>through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Yet we use him not as our <hi>Lord: yee call mee Master and Lord, and yee doe well</hi>; but then yee ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your selves as dutifull and obedient servants to me. Servants goe and come at the commandement of their <hi>Lord. I have servants under me,</hi> sayes the <hi>Centurion; I say to one, goe, and he goeth, doe this, and he doth it.</hi> Doe we deale so with <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord?</hi> hee sayes come not at the Ale-house, there to sit quaffing and swilling till reason be buried in you: yet we will be as drunken as Apes, as wee use to speake. Our <hi>Lord</hi> sayes, your bodies are mine, they bee my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the temples of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; doe not prostitute them to Whores and Harlots: yet we will do it.

                  <p>Some of the Iesuits being notable fishers have found a deep myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this pond, the alteration of the word.</p>
                  <p>And wherin I pray you consisteth this similitude? It must needs be in this, and nothing but this.</p>
                  <p>That as <hi>Melchizedec</hi> offered bread and wine, as a sacrifice of praise to <hi>God,</hi> after <hi>Abrahams</hi> victorie: So our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> offered his body and bloud under the shape of bread and wine in the Supper: for this cause, and for this cause alone, or chiefely and principally <hi>he is a Priest after the order of Melchizedec:</hi> and in the end having the streame of all the fathers running with them, they desire <hi>Christ</hi> to confound us that strive against it.</p>
                  <p>But cannot <hi>Christ</hi> be a Priest after the similitude of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> unlesse it be in this? Surely then he is not a Priest at all after the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Melchizedec:</hi> for <hi>Melchizedec</hi> offered no bread and wine. The Hebrew is <hi>Hotziah, protulit, non obtulit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 14.18.</note> as their owne vulgar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter doth translate it, and the <hi>Septuaginta</hi> expound it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: that is a confirmation of <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s kingdome, not of his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: as a King, of his Prince-like liberality he brought forth out of his store-house plenty of bread and wine, to refresh <hi>Abraham</hi> and his men after the battell: he brought them forth, not to offer them to <hi>God,</hi> but to comfort <hi>Abraham</hi> and his wearied Souldiers withall. Therefore concerning the forged sacrifice of the Masse, <hi>Christ</hi> can be no Priest after the similitude of <hi>Melchizedec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Melchizedec</hi> offered no bread nor wine at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If he did, he offered the substance of bread and wine, not the shewes alone, as the Papists doe: therefore in this hee cannot bee a Priest after the similitude of <hi>Melchizedec:</hi> for <hi>Melchizedec</hi> did never any thing like to this.</p>
                  <p>But in sundry other respects hee is a Priest after the similitude of <hi>Melchizedec.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. As <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was a Priest, yet not made after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other Priests, but had an extraordinary calling from <hi>God:</hi> so CHRIST is made a Priest, not after the manner of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Priest-hood, but after a more excellent sort, as <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> was.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was a King and a Priest too: So was our SAVIOUR CHRIST: in these sences Hee is a Priest after the similitude of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> not in that sence which the Papists imagine.</p>
                  <p>The man of GOD, and dispenser of the Word that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to teach the people, whether hee doth it by word of mouth or wryting, <hi>must make things cleere and evident unto them.</hi> It was evident by that which hee said in the former <hi>Verse</hi>; that the Priest-hood is changed, because the tribe consecrated to the Priest-hood is changed: yet not contenting himselfe with that, he makes it a great deale more evident in these <hi>Verses.</hi> A mysterie of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion cannot bee too evident to the people: A Preacher must bee as plaine as possible hee can, as plaine as a pike-staffe, as wee use to speake.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that Preachers are compared to Nurses: a Nurse though shee have a fine, flowing and eloquent tongue, yet shee will speake plainly to the Child: So must we to those Children whom <hi>God</hi> hath put to us to nurse, when we deliver the <hi>sincere milke of the Word</hi> to them. Who hath more learning then <hi>God,</hi> the fountaine of all Wisedome? yet the Scripture which is his Word, is the plainest writing in the world: he is the best Preacher, and drawes neerest to <hi>God</hi> Almighty, that speakes most plainely to the capacity of the people.<note place="margin">Neh. 8.8.</note> They in <hi>Ezra</hi> gave the sense, and made the people to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it: as for those that affect obscurity, that love to speake in the cloudes, that desire rather to be admired for an opinion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then to profit and benefit the people, they can have no comfort of their labour. <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that was surnamed <gap reason="foreign">

Our Apostle here strives to make the alteration of the Priest-hood more and more evident. Indeed the Papists holding it the best policy to keepe the people in ignorance, are of purpose obscure in their writings and sayings. The Rhemes Testament of late yeeres set forth in English is so darke, such inck-horne termes, so many Latine wordes unenglished, as that

                  <p>At the consecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sonnes, very costly and glorious apparell was provided, which were put on their backes: an Ephod, a breast plate, a miter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.1. two Rams and a young Calfe without blemish, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. were offered up to <hi>God</hi> for them, and a boxe of holy oyle was powred on their heads.

                  <p>Not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as they were: but <hi>after the order of Melchizedec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both the parts of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood are everlasting: his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and his intercession.</p>
                  <p>In his sacrifice is to be considered the act of oblation, the fruit and efficacy of it. As for the act of oblation, it passed away on the Crosse: hee was but once offered, and that by himselfe: no mortall man can offer <hi>Christ</hi>; yet the fruit and efficacy of his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is perpetuall: which is the taking away of all the sins of all the faithfull in the world.</p>
                  <p>As for his <hi>intercession,</hi> the Scripture is cleere in that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. still hee <hi>maketh intercession</hi> in heaven for us: therefore <hi>hee is a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedec.</hi> Earthly Priests dye, but this our Priest never dyeth: who as he liveth for ever in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of heaven; so hee will one day assume us to himselfe, and wee shall live there for ever with him.</p>

                  <p>The old Mandate is gone: and the new Mandate is come in the roome thereof. The old Mandate is the Leviticall Priest-hood, with the sacrifices thereof: the new Mandate is the Gospell, with the sacrifice thereof, which is the Masse. The old Mandate is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annulled: and the new Mandate of the Masse is instituted instead thereof, whereof Maundy Thursday hath his name, <hi>quasi, Mandat</hi> Thursday; because then the old Mandate of the Paschall Lambe was abolished, and the new Mandate of the sacrifice of the Masse was ordained in the Supper.</p>
                  <p>It was once called Sheare-Thursday: because the Priests did sheare their haire and shave their Crownes on that day: afterwards it had the name of Maundy Thursday, in our English tongue, not of the Latine word <hi>mandatum,</hi> (that is farre fetched) but rather of the English word, Maund or basket, because the people brought their provision for feasting on that day in Maunds or baskets.</p>
                  <p>Or if they will needs derive it from the Latin, it may be called Mandy Thursday of <hi>Mando,</hi> because CHRIST did eate both the Passeover and the Supper with his Disciples on that day. But as for this new <hi>Etymologie</hi> from <hi>Mandatum,</hi> it hath no sense in it. <hi>Love one another,</hi> is called the new Mandate; but the Supper hath never that name: but I thinke the <hi>Iesuits</hi> make this note, rather to shew their wit than their Divinity.</p>
                  <p>The abrogation of the Leviticall law and Priest-hood stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on good ground: it was weake and unprofitable; therefore no reason it should continue.</p>
                  <p>It had no strength to purifie the soule, to make cleane the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to carrie men into the kingdome of heaven, to purge them from sinne, to make them righteous before <hi>God:</hi> it was weake and unprofitable for these things: therefore worthy to bee aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.9.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say it was abolished, because it was naught: the law was <hi>good</hi> for the end why it was appointed, to shadow out <hi>Christ,</hi> and our redemption purchased by him; but <hi>weake and unprofitable</hi> to worke our redemption: it was strong and profitable <hi>ad figuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> but not <hi>ad praestandum:</hi> it could not performe that which was signified by it.</p>

                     </gap>: because of its owne weaknesse:<note place="margin">Gal. 4 9.</note> The morall law was weak in regard of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. but the ceremoniall law was weak in it selfe: men might doe that which was enjoyned by it; but the doing of it could not justifie and sanctifie them.</p>
                  <p>The Law was before the Gospell, yet the Gospell is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than it: darkenesse went before the light; the night before the day: yet the day is more glorious than the night. All creatures were made before man: yet man excelleth them all. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> went before <hi>Christ:</hi> yet hee was <hi>not worthy to unloose the latchet of Christ</hi>'s <hi>shoe:</hi> the Sword-bearer goes before the Maior; yet hee is

not greater than the Maior. All things are not to be esteemed by their precedency and priority in the world: <hi>there commeth one after me, said Iohn, yet in honour and dignity hee is before me:</hi> So the Gospell commeth after the Law, yet it is more excellent than the Law.</p>
                  <p>If the comparison be made betweene <hi>God</hi> and creatures, then this is a firme Axiome: <hi>that which went before is best. God</hi> went before all creatures: therefore he is above all creatures. <hi>Christ is the first begotten of every creature,</hi> that is, which was begotten of the eternall essence of the Father before all creatures, therefore to bee preferred before them all. But if that comparison bee betweene creatures, then that Axiome is of no force.</p>
                  <p>A thing may be said to be <hi>unprofitable,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Simply, then comparatively: Simply and in it selfe sinne is <hi>unprofitable,</hi> whereupon it is called <hi>the unfruitfull workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> there is no fruit, no commoditie in them. Swearing is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi> thing, Adultery is an <hi>unprofitable</hi> thing, it pulleth <hi>Gods</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on men, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an <hi>unprofitable</hi> thing: men may gaine by it: but <hi>what advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth it a man to winne the whole world and loose his owne soule?</hi> these are <hi>unprofitable</hi> simply in themselves.</p>
                  <p>But the ceremoniall Law is <hi>unprofitable</hi> in respect of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: that could only shadow out heavenly things: but it could not give us heavenly things. The washings that were in the law could signifie our washing in the bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> but they could not purge us from sinne, as the bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> doth: the sacrificing of Sheepe, Oxen, Rams, could tell them there was a Lamb to come that should be offered on the Altar of the Crosse for the sins of the world, but they could not take away sinne: in this respect the law was <hi>weake and unprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary side, the Gospell is a <hi>strong and profitable</hi> thing: profitable to illuminate us in the mystery of our redemption; to ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stifie us, and cloath us with the righteousnesse of <hi>Christ,</hi> that we may appeare unblameable in the sight of <hi>God</hi>; to sanctifie us and make us new Creatures in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; to assure us of the remission of all our sinnes, and to carry us up into the kingdome of heaven. <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is profitable for all things,</hi> sayes <hi>Paul:</hi> So the Gospell is <hi>profitable</hi> for all things: It is <hi>profitable</hi> for the things of this world: GOD <hi>blessed the house of Obed Edom where the Arke was:</hi> and <hi>God</hi> blesseth those Townes and Citties where the Gospell is sincerely and truely practised: but especially it is <hi>profitable</hi> to bring us to the joyes of heaven in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>An argument from <hi>profit</hi> is very forcible. This was <hi>Hamans</hi> coozenage. <hi>It is not for the Kings profit to suffer them</hi>; and it prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much. Nothing so <hi>profitable</hi> as the Gospell; therefore let us all be greedy of it. Why are men so desirous of Sheepe? because they are profitable creatures: Why doe men give so much money for an office? because it is profitable, and bringeth great gaines with it: Why do men strive to make their Sons Lawyers? because
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:12681:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lawyers goe away with all the <hi>profit.</hi> The Gospell of all things is most <hi>profitable: profitable</hi> for this life, to procure us the peace of conscience in this world, and to save us in the world to come. Therefore let us embrace the Gospell with both armes. When the Merchant heard of a Pearle that surpassed all others, <hi>he sold all and bought it:</hi> the Gospell is <hi>the Pearle of Pearles, above thousands of gold and silver:</hi> therefore let us redeeme it, though it be with the losse of all our worldly goods: the Gospell is <hi>profitable</hi> for all things; therefore make much of it.</p>

                  <p>The Tabernacle, Temple, the purifications and washings, the observation of new Moones and Sabbaths, the oblation of Rams, Sheepe, Bulls, Oxen, in the time of the Law, these did lead them by the hand to <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom they should have all perfection: but these did not perfect the people. On the contrarie side, the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in of a better hope by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Author and subject of the Gospell, that doth perfect us.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>better hope</hi> is this? had not the Fathers in the time of the Law as good an <hi>hope</hi> as we? Yes verily. Though some fondly collect from hence, that they had hope only of temporall things, we of eternall; that is crooked and broken Divinity. <hi>The fathers did eate of the same spirituall meate, and dranke of the same spirituall drinke</hi> that wee doe. <hi>Abraham saw the day of Christ, and was glad,</hi> as we be: they had the same hope of everlasting happinesse by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that wee have: here is the onely difference; they had that hope by faith in the promised Messiah, not by the observation of the Law. The opposition is here made, not betweene the persons that lived in the time of the Law, and those that live in the time of the Gospell; but betweene the Law and <hi>Christ:</hi> or, betweene the Law and the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>The Law could not put us in good hope of everlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or the favour of God; but the Gospell did: that hath brought in a better hope.</p>
                  <p>One sweet and comfortable fruit of that hope is this: that by it we draw nigh to <hi>God.</hi> By nature we are <hi>Gods</hi> enemies, and runne away from <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> did, when hee had sinned: but by grace in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> being justified by faith in him, wee have peace with <hi>God,</hi> and a comfortable accesse to his Majesty. <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> held out his golden Scepter to <hi>Hester,</hi> and she drew neere to him: So <hi>God</hi> being reconciled to us by CHRIST holdeth forth the golden Scepter of his favour to us, and wee draw neere to him.

                  <p>THe third argument is taken from the manner of the institution of both Priest-hoods.

                  <p>Both the parts of the assumption are expressed in the Text: and the conclusion is emphatically inferred, <hi>Verse</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>For so much as <hi>Christ</hi> was not made a Priest without an <hi>oath,</hi> whereas those in the time of the Law were.</p>
                  <p>The word of the high and eternall <hi>God,</hi> which is truth it selfe, in whom there is not a shadow of turning, is sufficient to procure credit and authority to that which hee speaketh. <hi>By the word of a King,</hi> as we use to say: nothing can bee more sure.

                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:12681:155"/>Now there be three principall things which <hi>God sweareth</hi> in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The first, is the eternity and perpetuity of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood: he hath not onely said, but <hi>sworne, thou art a Priest for ever</hi>—Which is a singular comfort to us all: wee may bee bold to believe <hi>Gods oath.</hi> Our Priest that makes intercession for us, lives for ever.</p>
                  <p>The second thing, is the destruction of the wicked, of stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and disobedient persons, that by <hi>Gods</hi> voice in the Ministery of the word will not be reclaimed from their sins. <hi>I have sworne in my wrath, that such shall never enter into my rest. God sware</hi> that none of those that came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> save <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> should enter into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It came so to passe, <hi>all their Carhasses fell in the wildernesse. God</hi> hath <hi>sworne,</hi> that such as have the Trumpet of the word continually sounding in their eares, and yet will lye snorting in their sins, shall perish eternally. Therefore let us tremble at it and believe it.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>sworne</hi> unto in the Scripture is the salvation of the faithfull,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.18.</note> 
                     <hi>that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lye, wee might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us.</hi> Hast thou a true and lively faith in CHRIST, which is fruitfull in all good workes, as <hi>Dorcas</hi> was? and canst say with Saint <hi>Paul, I live; yet not I, but</hi> CHRIST <hi>in mee,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>A singular comfort to us. Wee have sinned; we are indebted to <hi>God</hi> many thousands sinnes, and because wee cannot satisfie for them, wee must goe to the prison of Hell: then CHRIST steps forth saying, nay, I will bee their surety, I will pay the debt for them: therefore they shall not goe to hell: unspeakeable comfort! ô loving surety! he payes the debt with no lesse price than his own bloud.</p>
                  <p>How are wee beholden to this surety? All the Priests in the time of the law could not doe so much for the people: therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is better than they.</p>
                  <p>The new Testament is better than the old, not in regard of the substance, but of diverse circumstances: the substance of both is one, which is <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Old Testament did but shadow out things to come: the new Testament makes a gift and an exhibition of them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. and as the body is better than the shadow; so is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament then the Old.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Old Testament was dark and obscure; this is plain and perspicuous: that did darkely speake of <hi>Christ</hi>; this plainely.</p>

                  <p n="4">That was temporall, and therefore not ratified with an oath: this is eternall and lasteth for ever. For the which cause it was confirmed with an oath: So was not that.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Mediatour of surety of that was <hi>Moses</hi>; the surety of this is CHRIST: therefore many degrees greater and better than that.</p>
                  <p>It is a weighty thing that makes GOD sweare: as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.11.6, 17. here he sweares that CHRIST is a Priest for ever: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are not to call into question the eternity of his Priest-hood.</p>
                  <p>The Pope and his skamblings would faine winde themselves into the society of this Priest-hood. <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>a Priest for ever: ergo,</hi> the Pope and his Clergy are Priests for ever.</p>
                  <p>I but this is proper to <hi>Christ:</hi> this Priest that <hi>is for ever, sitteth at the right hand of God, Psalm.</hi> 110.1. So doe not the Pope and his Clergy, therefore it makes nothing for them.</p>
                  <p>We in the time of the Gospell have all things better than they had in the time of the Law: we have <hi>a better</hi> Priest, <hi>a better sacrifice, a better</hi> Testament: therefore in reason wee should bee <hi>better</hi> than they. A King deales better with such a man then with many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of his subjects; therefore he should bee more dutifull to him. The King of Kings hath dealt more bountifully with us, then with them in the time of the Law: therefore we should be more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more carefull to serve him, then they were. Yet it is to bee feared we are worse than they. Drunkennesse, abhominable swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, covetousnesse, loathing of the sweete and heavenly Manna of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> hard-hearted dealing one with another, all kind of vices flow with a more full streame among us, then among them. Having all things better, wee our selves should bee better: yet wee are worse, and therefore have the more fearefull account to make at the latter day.</p>

                  <p>THe fourth argument is taken from a diverse qualitie of both Priest-hoods. The Priest-hood which is everlasting and <hi>abideth for ever,</hi> is more excellent than that which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany, and continueth but for a time. <hi>Christs</hi> Priest-hood is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; the Leviticall Priest-hood lasted but for a time: <hi>ergo.</hi>

                  <p>This Argument hath two branches: the comparison betweene them, 23.24, and an effect, 25. the comparison is in the number, and continuance.</p>
                  <p>That the Priest-hood of the <hi>Levites</hi> was temporarie is evinced by the relatives. If the Priests continued but <hi>a time,</hi> then the Priest-hood: but they continued but <hi>for a time:</hi> which is illustrated by the number of them, and the reason of the number.</p>

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:12681:157"/>And they verily being many were made Priests.</p>
                  <p>And why were they many? because they were forbidden by death to endure.</p>
                  <p>Death would not suffer them to continue long; therefore it was necessary, that there should bee many of them, one to supply the roome of the other.</p>
                  <p>There were not onely many inferiour Priests, but many high Priests: not at one and the same time, but successively. After <hi>Aaron</hi> came <hi>Eleazar:</hi> after him <hi>Phinees,</hi> &amp;c. for the same cause there be many Kings, one King succeedeth another: because death will not suffer them to live, death forbids them <hi>to abide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He brings an inhibition against their continuance. I command thee here to stay, and to goe no further: and all Kings, Priests, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Physitians must obey him.</p>
                  <p>A paucity is a greater argument of perfection, then a multitude.</p>
                  <p>The kingdome is better governed that hath one King, then that which hath many: that house is better ruled that hath one Master, then many: the world is better with one Sun, then if there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: the Phaenix is the most famous of all birds, because there is but one of them at a time. <hi>God</hi> being but one is farre more glorious then man being many. So is it betweene the Priests of the Law and CHRIST: they were many; but CHRIST is but one, which remaineth alwayes: therefore his Priest-hood is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than theirs.</p>
                  <p>But why were they many? because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death. As it is here said of the <hi>Levites:</hi> So it may be said of us all. A man walking in London streets, or in a corporation is on the suddaine arrested by a Sergeant and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to stay: so as wee are walking in our race in the world, comes death as the LORDS Sergeant and bids us stay: here yeeld up thy life, I will not suffer thee to tarry any longer. <hi>Adam</hi> was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest man that ever was, the first that breathed on the earth: yet hee was not suffered to endure by reason of death. <hi>Methusalem</hi> was the longest liv'd man that ever was, he lived almost a thousand yeeres, yet dyed. <hi>Sampson</hi> a mighty strong man, with the jaw-bone of an Asse he slew a thousand <hi>Philistims,</hi> he carryed away the great Gates of the Citty on his Shoulders: yet he was arrested by death. <hi>Saul</hi> a goodly tall man, higher than any of the people; <hi>Absalom</hi> a faire beautifull man, not a blemish in him from the Crowne of his head to the soale of his foote. <hi>Salomon</hi> the wisest man that ever was. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> a learned man, he spake with tongues more than they all, a profound divine, <hi>taken up into the third heaven,</hi> a painfull and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Preacher, he converted a great part of the world to <hi>Christ:</hi> yet they were not suffered to continue by reason of death. This is the condition of us all, high and low, rich and poore, learned and unlearned, none of us all can bee suffered to endure long by reason of death. Death is a cooling Card in all our mirth and jollity, that comes at length with his Axe and cuts all downe. Kings are not

The Physition that hath saved the life of many, in the end surrenders his life into Deaths hands: none of us can endure here long by reason of death. The Priests of the Law dyed, and the Ministers of the Gospell must dye: none but CHRIST <hi>endures for ever:</hi> therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death will not suffer us long to tarry here, let us so live the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and uncertaine time wee have in this world, that wee may live eternally with <hi>Christ</hi> our everlasting Priest and <hi>Saviour</hi> in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>We must not imagine that <hi>Christ</hi> makes intercession for us now in heaven after the same manner he did, when hee was on the earth: either by bowing of the knee, by falling down on his face by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>with sighes and groanes,</hi> as hee did at the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi>; or <hi>with strong cryes and teares,</hi> as he did in the Garden; being glorified in heaven hee doth it not after such a carnall manner: but <hi>Christ</hi> is said now <hi>to make intercession for us</hi> two kinde of wayes.</p>

                  <p>The consideration of <hi>Christs</hi> perpetuall intercession in heaven for us may be a singular comfort to all Christians.

If the Kings Sonne make a request and that earnestly to the King for us, shall wee not be in great hope to speede? <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> makes request to <hi>God</hi> for us, and shall we not assure our selves, that whatsoever wee aske in his name according to his will, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us?

                     <hi>Became.</hi> Not as if wee were worthy of him: as wee say, the best Preacher in England <hi>becomes</hi> the King. It is better transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>Stephen</hi> doth, <hi>conveniebat nobis,</hi> was requisite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for us: it behooved us to have such an High-Priest. Our redemption could not have been accomplished without such a one.</p>
                  <p>What manner of one?</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:12681:159"/>1. Holy, in himselfe and in his own nature: not only in respect of his deity, but of his humanity also, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.27. The Devills acknowledge this; <hi>we know who thou art, that holy one of God. Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Chodesh, Chodashim.</hi> Some Priests, Prophets and others have beene holy men, but none so holy as <hi>Christ:</hi> not a spot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of unholinesse in him: therefore fit to discharge the office of <hi>an high-Priest,</hi> and to reconcile us to his Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In respect of others: doing no harme, but all good to all: not circumventing any by fraud or deceit, nor offering open wrong and injurie to any.</p>
                  <p>In regard whereof hee is compared to a sheepe, which of all creatures is most harmelesse, nay profitable for his flesh and wooll too: So was <hi>Christ:</hi> so farre from doing any harme, that hee did good to his very enemies: a simple man, no craft in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As he was harmelesse himselfe, so he tooke no harme from nothing: 1. Actively. 2. Passively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vndefiled of all things. The Priests in the time of the Law above others were to be circumspect, that they were defiled with nothing, especially in the time of the exequution of their office: all that while they might not keepe company with their Wives, they were to abstaine from wine, not to touch a dead body, or any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing. <hi>Christ</hi> was more undefiled than any of them all: they might keepe their bodies from being outwardly defiled, yet they were stained with sin in soule and body too; <hi>Christ</hi> had no defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any kinde of way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was undefiled of any person.</p>
                  <p>Hee conversed with sinners for the reclaiming of them, as the Physition keeps company with sicke persons for the curing of them: but he neither gave allowance to their sinnes, nor received any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion from them.</p>
                  <p>Then his ministery is set forth to us. Where, 1. The place, where he doth Minister, in the Sanctuary of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Some expound it thus: that is, a most high and excellent man.</p>
                  <p>But it is rather to be referred to the place, where he ministers: he is exalted above all those adspectable heavens, <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.10. he is made higher than them, and exequutes the office of an high-Priest for us in the highest heavens, where <hi>he makes continuall intercession</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p>Is our high Priest holy, and shall we be unholy, that belong to him? Is the head holy, and shall the members bee unholy? Is the husband pure, and shall the wife be an impure strumpet? Nay wee must labour in some acceptable measure to expresse the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that is in him: whereupon he saith, be yee holy as I am holy. Indeed wee cannot bee so holy as he is, and as certaine Heretickes dreamed, that were called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, pure and holy men: yet let us strive in some sort to attaine to that holines which is in him. Thou canst not bee so rich as such a man is: wilt thou therefore labour for no riches at all? A Scholler cannot write so well as his sample, shall hee not therefore endevour to come as neere his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:12681:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sample as hee can? So wee cannot attaine that holinesse that is in CHRIST, shall wee therefore not imitate it? <hi>Yes, wee must bee an holy nation, a royall Priest-hood, a people zealous of good workes.</hi> Learne of mee, said CHRIST, for I am humble and meeke: So learne to bee <hi>holy as he is holy.</hi> As the oyle powred on <hi>Aarons</hi> head stayed not there, but ranne downe to his beard, yea to the very skirts of his clothing: So the heavenly oyle of holinesse powred on <hi>Christ</hi> our high-Priest must be conveyed to all, yea to the lowest, that be in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thou art none of <hi>Christs</hi> if thou beest not holy, as he is. But alas, for the most part, we are unholy, yea even we that professe ourselves to be the members of <hi>Christ.</hi> A great number, that would seeme to belong to <hi>Christ,</hi> that have <hi>Christ</hi> and his Gospell in their mouthes, but are impure, unholy &amp; prophane in their lives: beastly drunkards that stincke of drink wheresoever they become: filthy adulterers, <hi>like fed horses, neighing after their neighbours wives:</hi> covetous misers. meere mucke wormes, that scarce believe there is any heaven but in this world. We should be Saints in some measure, as <hi>Christ</hi> the Saint of Saints is: but, a lamentable case! we are Devills in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations: we should be Eagles mounting up into heaven, where <hi>Christ</hi> our high-Priest and <hi>Saviour</hi> is; but we are Swine wallowing in the puddle of all iniquity. As <hi>Christ</hi> is holy;<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.14.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> was a simple man: <hi>all the treasures of wisedome were hid in him:</hi> he was wiser than <hi>Salomon,</hi> then any politicke <hi>Achitophel,</hi> then any <hi>Matchiavel</hi> whatsoever: yet a simple man. He would not imploy his wits and wisdome about such things as might be hurtfull to any. So <hi>Iacob</hi> was <hi>a plaine man,</hi> and <hi>Nathaneel a true Israelite, in whom there was no guile.</hi> Such must all Christians bee: though GOD have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them never so sharp a wit, so reaching a head, never so great wisedome, experience and learning; yet they must not use it to the hurt of any, but to the good of all, so neere as they can. We must bee harmelesse as <hi>Christ: wise as Serpents; yet as innocent as Doves.</hi> Yet a number there be that have the Serpentine wisdome, and want the Dove-like simplicity: they thinke they cannot be wise men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be crafty and hurtfull men: they are more like the Devill then <hi>Christ:</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Devill hath a plaguie wit, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile pate of his owne: but hee never doth any good with it, but all the mischiefe he can: so doe those that are the Devills brood; they have wit and wisedome enough: <hi>the children of this world are wiser,</hi> &amp;c. but what good doe they with it? Nay, what hurt? how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous be they in a towne or a Country? we must so live, that wee be harmelesse as <hi>Christ</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:12681:160"/>Yet a pittifull thing it is! we are altogether set upon hurt: we are harmefull and not harmelesse persons, as CHRIST was. There be two kindes of harmefull men in the Church, covered with the Cloake of Christianity: the one open, the other close and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; and yet not so close, but that <hi>God</hi> can disclose them, and make their treacheries knowne to all the world: the one are Foxes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Wolves: the one Serpents, the other Beares and Lions. Some there bee that blush not to offer open harme and violence to their neighbours. Such a one as <hi>Iesabel</hi> was, that slew <hi>Naboth,</hi> and tooke away his Vineyard: all the world might see the injurie.</p>
                  <p>Such are they that <hi>grinde the faces of the poore,</hi> that wring house and land from them, and as <hi>Zidkiah, smite their brother on the face,</hi> that all may see the blow: these be impudent wretches; yet few of these Owles dare appeare in the glorious Sun shine of the Gospell. Now, men are waxen not more religious, but more cunning: they will be no hurtfull persons, they doe no harme to any: not openly perhaps, yet secretly: not above hand, but under hand. As he said, <hi>I will kill Ismael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 40.15.</note> 
                     <hi>and no man shall see it.</hi> We will undermine the Preacher, supplant our neighbours, doe hurt and mischiefe in a towne, and no man shall see it. These are worse than the other: those dogs are worst that will bite before they barke: and the Serpent that lyeth in the greene grasse destroyes more than those that bee in high wayes: a man may espie the one sooner than the other. These are like <hi>Iudas,</hi> that would kisse <hi>Christ</hi> at the same instant when hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him: these will speake faire to a mans face, and yet by secret perswasions, by politicke devices, by alienating the affections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, cut his throat behinde his backe. A vile generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers! yet all their plotting, consulting; their devising of mischiefe is knowne to him that knowes all secrets, who will one day reveale them <hi>to</hi> their open shame before <hi>God</hi> and his Angels, unlesse they repent, fie upon this dealing: let us labour to bee harmelesse as our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> is. It is an easie matter to bee harmefull, if we will sell our selves to the Devill. Let us strive to doe good to all, but harme none, neither openly, nor secretly, by word nor deed, by our selves not by others. We that bee Christians must bee <hi>good men,</hi> as <hi>Barnabas</hi> was; <hi>full of good workes,</hi> as <hi>Dorcus</hi> was: but not bad men, hurtfull men, full of evill workes. Let us all so carry our selves in the Towne and Country, where we dwell, that it may bee affirmed of us, we are harmelesse, as <hi>Christ</hi> was. Yet as we reade of one that was famous for nothing, but for burning <hi>Diana</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: so some are famous for nothing but for the hurt they have done and doe dayly: they doe not only no good themselves, but disswade others from doing of good.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>undefiled</hi>; so must we be. <hi>These are they that have not defiled their garments,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apo. 3.4, 14.4</note> 
                     <hi>that have not defiled themselves with women.</hi> Though we live in a filthy and defiled world: yet we must not bee defiled with it. Like the Sun that shineth on a dunghill, yet is not polluted with the dunghill: so though we live in the dunghill of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:12681:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
world, yet wee must not be defiled with it: wee must bee undefiled from covetousnesse, drunkennesse, pride, malice, envy, and other sins that reigne amongst us. But alas, we have no care of it: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our selves innumerable kinde of wayes. A dainty Lady, or Gentlewoman would bee loath to file her fingers with a little dirt: we all loath outward defilements, but we give entertainement to sin, which is the greatest pollution of all.</p>
                  <p>Nay we are like hogs, that had rather be in fowle water, then in cleane, wallowing in the puddle of sin, then bathing our selves in the bath of vertue.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Christ</hi> separated Himselfe from sinners: So must wee doe: how? wee must not shut up our selves in Cloysters, in Nunneries, and Monasteries, as some did in a blind zeale in the time of Popery, thinking that they were then separated from sinners, when they were many of the most beastly sinners themselves.</p>
                  <p>Neither must wee be brethren of separation, as the Brownists most unbrotherly name themselves; <hi>we must not, Hebr.</hi> 10.25. <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the assembling of our selves together.</hi> Wee must not separate our selves from the spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> because of some pretended wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles in her face: neither must we altogether abandon the society of men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. but we must separate our selves from the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinners. Though we be in <hi>Sodome,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was, yet wee must not be <hi>Sodomites:</hi> though we come into the company of drunkards, yet we must not be drunken as they are: though among adulterers, bawdy talkers and livers, yet wee must not draw with them in the same yoke of sin: we must be like to the fishes that dwell in the salt water, and yet themselves are fresh: so though our dwelling be in a prophane towne; yet wee must separate our selves from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse that is in the Towne.</p>
                  <p>This is hard for us to doe, though <hi>Christ</hi> could doe it. It is a difficult matter to touch pitch, and not to be defiled with it: to bee in a fire, and not to be burnt. <hi>Barnabas</hi> keeping company with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers, was brought to dissemble with them:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.13.</note> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> that stout champion of <hi>Christ,</hi> being in the high Priests hall was brought to the denyall of <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore the best course we can take is to refraine their company, as <hi>Ioseph:</hi> if not, but that wee fall into it, then to pray to <hi>God</hi> to separate us from the wickednesse that is in that company.</p>
                  <p>The high-Priest in time of the Law was in a Sanctuary on the earth: but our high-Priest is in the Temple and Sanctuary of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he appeareth alwayes in the sight of <hi>God</hi> for us: and let not our affections be here on the earth, but let our conversation bee in heaven; <hi>let us seeke the things that bee above, where Christ our high-Priest and Saviour is.</hi>

                  <p>THe second thing in his Ministerie is his sacrifice, which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth the sacrifices of the Priests in the time of the Law: in regard of the time when, of the persons for whom, and the kinde of sacrifice offered by him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the time: he had no necessity to offer daily, as they did, <hi>Num.</hi> 28.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>It was necessary for them to offer daily.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because both they and the people sinned daily.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because their sacrifices were imperfect, and were dayly to be iterated. There was no such necessity for <hi>Christ</hi> to offer dayly: because he had no sin, and by one sacrifice perfected us for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They did offer for their owne sinnes and the peoples too; and that every day: and so did not <hi>Christ.</hi> He had no sinne of his owne to offer for: and as for the sins of the people, he tooke them all away by one sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First:</hi> for he must be holy himselfe before hee could make the people holy. <hi>Aaron</hi> sinned grievously in the calfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the kind of sacrifice: they offered things without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as Sheepe, Goates, Oxen, <hi>&amp;c. Christ</hi> offered himselfe: he was <hi>Sacerdos &amp; victima, Hebr.</hi> 9.14.</p>
                  <p>We are all sinners, Ministers and people: we must all say, yea even <hi>arietes gregis,</hi> the Lords prayer: <hi>forgive us our trespasses.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not swell in pride one against another: but flie all to the mercy of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let the best Preacher in the world knocke on his breast with the poore Publican and say; <hi>Oh God be mercifull to me a sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The order is here worthy to be observed: he offered first for his owne sins. A Minister in killing of sinne must begin with himselfe. <hi>Si vis alios flere, flendum tibi prius:</hi> first weepe bitterly for thine own sins, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did, and then make the people to weepe for their sins. <hi>I beat downe mine owne body,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul, least while I preach to others, my selfe should be a reprobate.</hi> The like method must be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by all Christians.</p>
                  <p>First cast the beame out of thine owne eye: let us first represse sinne in our selves. Then in others. As the Priest in the time of the Law <hi>first offered for his owne sins:</hi> so let us all being Priests by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> first offer up our selves to <hi>God.</hi> Wee count him a foole that will have more care of his neighbours Sheepe, then of his owne: and shall wee have more care of our neighbours soule, then of our own? Let us first begin with our selves.</p>
                  <p>There is but one sacrifice of the New Testament, whereby the daily sacrifice of the masse is quite overthrowne. This is a knife to cut the throat of the masse among the Papists: the Priests offer up

                     <hi>Christ</hi> dayly, they doe more than needs: there is no necessity of that: for <hi>Christ</hi> offered up Himselfe once for all. There bee many pregnant places for it in this epistle, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>I, say the Papists, there is but one bloudy sacrifice, which was once offered on the Crosse, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. yet there is an unbloudy sacrifice which <hi>Christ</hi> instituted at his last Supper, where the body and bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> are offered under the similitudes of bread and wine: which is a commemoration and an application of his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the crosse to us: for <hi>Christ</hi> said to his Disciples <hi>hoc facite,</hi> that is <hi>Sacrificate,</hi> as the Poet sayes: <hi>cum faciam vitula pro frugibus ipse venito:</hi> and the Hebrew word (<hi>Gnasah</hi>) doth often signifie <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificare.</hi> After the words of consecration bee said; <hi>this is my body, that is given for you, i.</hi> that is offered to <hi>God</hi> the Father for you: <hi>this is the bloud of the New Testament, that is shed for many:</hi> it was then shed and powred out for a sacrifice to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I, but where do they read in any Author, that <hi>hoc facite</hi> with an accusative case doth signifie to sacrifice? The Poet doth not say, <hi>facere vitulam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Evangelists wrote in Greeke, not in Hebrew or Latine.</p>
                  <p>Hee then ordained no propitiatory (that's my meaning) sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was to be offered every day; he instituted a Sacrament, not such a sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In every sacrifice there is <hi>sensible quiddam,</hi> as <hi>Bellar.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, and they also say, it is an externall thing, and they call it <hi>visible sacrificium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this imaginarie sacrifice there is no sensible outward thing, that may be discerned by the sences. They say, that the body and bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> are there invisible under the shape of bread and wine: therefore by their owne position it is no sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They confesse it to bee an unbloudy sacrifice: and then not propitiatory, for the quicke and the dead, as they will have it: for <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without shedding of bloud there is no remission of sinnes.</hi> There is no bloud shed: therefore no remission of sins: and then a masse not worth a figge: thou canst not have the remission of sins by it: but it is a phantasticall dreame of their owne. Let us magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> for his owne sacrifice which he offered for us, and lay hold on it by a true and a lively faith.</p>
                  <p>What did <hi>Christ</hi> offer for us? not silver and gold, not a Bull, a Sheepe, or a Goate: not the haire of his head, the paring of his nailes, or his little toe, not one of his Disciples, but himselfe. Oh blessed SAVIOUR that spared not himselfe for our sakes! So let us give our selves to him: he, that will be my Disciple, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himselfe and follow mee. We must not only sacrifice our sins for <hi>Christ</hi> his sake, which wee will hardly doe: but, if occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, offer up our selves for him: we must say with <hi>Paul,</hi> my life is not deere to me, <hi>&amp;c. I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem for the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But alas wee are wanting in love and thankefulnesse to <hi>Christ:</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:12681:162"/>
hee offered himselfe for us. We will not offer up our pleasures for him. Hee laid downe his owne life for us: we will not lay downe our sinnes for him. Wee will not forgoe our lusts, our covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, pride, drunkennesse for <hi>Christs</hi> sake: how then shall we offer up our selves for him, as he did for us?</p>

                  <p>THe reason is taken from the excellencie of this our high-Priest: he, that is the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> voyd of all infirmity, sanctified for ever, is able by one sacrifice to satisfie for the sins of the Church: but <hi>Christ</hi> is the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> voyd of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, sanctified for ever. <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is illustrated by a famous <hi>antithesis,</hi> betweene the Priests of the Law and him: whereof there be foure branches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ceremoniall Law made men Priests: the Gospell made <hi>God</hi> a Priest.</p>
                  <p>For this our High-Priest, as hee was the Sonne of man, so the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> too: and therefore <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Law made servants Priests, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5. The Gospell the Sonne: which is more honourable than any servant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Law made them that had infirmities, namely of sinne and corruption: otherwise CHRIST tooke on him all our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infirmities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Law made those that were mortall, and endured not long by reason of death: the Gospell hath made him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated for evermore.</p>
                  <p>By the <hi>word of the oath</hi> may be meant the Gospell, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.73. because it was ratified by <hi>Gods</hi> oath. But rather by it is meant the promise made to <hi>Christ,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> confirmed in the Psalme with an oath.</p>
                  <p>If we respect the substance of the oath, it was from all eternity. CHRIST <hi>was ordained an everlasting Priest in the eternall decree of his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. but it is said to be after the Law, because it was written, published and exhibited after the giving of the Law.</p>
                  <p>The word of this oath comming after the Law did put the Law out of place, though, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. because the promise was of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force and efficacy then the Law: but as the last Will disannulls all the former wills; so the word of the oath comming after the Law, did abrogate the Law, <hi>Which is sanctified for evermore,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: and therefore is able perfectly to fulfill the office of an High-Priest.</p>
                  <p>There was no Priest, no Prophet in the time of the Law: there is no Minister, no Preacher, no Christian whatsoever, but hath some infirmity or other. <hi>Noah a Preacher of righteousnesse</hi> was overtaken with wine, and lay uncovered in his Tent. <hi>Abraham a Prophet,</hi> so
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:12681:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Lord</hi> himselfe termeth him to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> had his infirmities, when hee dissembled, for the saving of his life. <hi>David a man after Gods owne heart</hi> had his grosse faults, when hee was carryed into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and murder, using one as a Cloake to cover the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had his infirmity, when he did <hi>Iudaizare cum Iudaeis</hi>— applyed himselfe to all companies.

Shew mee the garden that hath not one weede in it: and shew mee the man, either Preacher or other, that hath not some infirmitie. Let not us cast off men because of infirmities: much lesse let us be ready, as some are, to hurle away the word, because of the infirmities, that be in the Preachers of the word. If we will have a man without infirmities, we must goe to heaven for one: for there be the Spirits of just and perfect men.<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.23.</note> There is none perfect in this world: we are all full of infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord be mercifull to us: only <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our High-Priest is <hi>voyd of infirmities,</hi> hee is consecrated for evermore, and holds to consecrate all that belong to him.

               <head>CHAP. 8.</head>
               <p>IN the Priest-hood of <hi>Christ</hi> there bee two things. 1. His cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to that office: <hi>cap.</hi> 7. and 8. 2. The exequution of it. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and 10.</p>
               <p>In his calling. 1. The Party called, which is set forth at large in the former Chapter. 2. The thing whereunto he is called, in this Chapter, which is, to Minister for the good and salvation of his Church.</p>
               <p>This Ministration of his is advanced above the Leviticall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration by foure arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From his empyre, rule and authority: by reason whereof hee Ministreth after a more magnificent manner, then the <hi>Levites</hi> did, <hi>Verse</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the place where he Ministers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the Sacrifice wherewith he Ministers, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From the subject whereabout he is occupied.</p>
               <p>In the first argument, 1. An entrance into it. 2. A description of his power and authoritie.</p>
               <p>Having cast up the account, this is the summe, that ariseth of it: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or, upon the things spoken this is the chiefe of all: it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:12681:163"/>This is to stirre us up to attention. The summes of things are welcome to us. Who is not desirous to have the summe of the Bible? The summe of the Law contained in so many volumes? a summe of Physicke? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Oratours in the end of their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deliver the summe of that which they have spoken: so doth S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> here, hee delivers to us the totall summe of the things which he had spoken before: and it is good for Preachers to draw their matter into a summe.</p>
               <p>We have <hi>such</hi> a worthie <hi>High Priest</hi> as all the High-Priests in the Law were not worthy to be named with him the same day.</p>
               <p>Then he comes to shew his magnificence.</p>
               <p>Hee doth not say, <hi>standeth:</hi> as a Lord, Earle, Duke may stand by a King bare-headed, but <hi>sitteth.</hi> Indeed <hi>Act.</hi> 7.5 6. he is said to be <hi>standing on the right hand of God:</hi> but then he is seene standing as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pull <hi>Stephen</hi> out of the jawes of his enemies.</p>
               <p>He doth not sit at his foot-stoole, but at his <hi>hand:</hi> not at his left hand, but on the <hi>right hand. God</hi> the Father as Prince and Potentate sitteth on his throne: and <hi>Christ</hi> sitteth by him.</p>
               <p>Of that Majestie which excelleth the Majesty of all the Kings in the world: either Majesty is put for Majesticall Prince, to whom is due Majesty, <hi>Iude</hi> 25. or, it may be an <hi>Hebraisme, the throne of the Majesty, for a majesticall throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not in earth, but in heaven. In the heavens where there bee many mansions: and in them hee prepareth a place for us. The High-Priests in the time of the Law sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire heere upon the earth: but our High-Priest sitteth in <hi>Gods</hi> chaire in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thinkes it no robbery to bee equall with <hi>God.</hi> In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he is not only higher than all the Priests in the Law, but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels.</p>
               <p>Here hee sitteth as a ruler, for the welfare of his Church.</p>
               <p>From hence it cannot be gathered that <hi>Christ</hi>'s body is every where, because <hi>Gods</hi> right hand is every where: for this his sitting is restrained to a place, namely to heaven. <hi>Stephen</hi> saw him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55. Love is an excellent vertue, because it is an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the whole Law. The <hi>Lords</hi> prayer carries away the bell from all prayers, because that is the summe of all the prayers, that can be made by all men in the world. Here we have the summe of this large and famous epistle. Therefore let it be reverently regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and diligently marked by us all.</p>
               <p>This may bee a singular comfort to us, that wee have such a mightie High-Priest, as hath all power in heaven and earth. The High-Priests here on the earth were controlled by Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Salomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> put <hi>Abimelech</hi> to death: but this our High-Priest is above all the Kings and Princes in the world: they must all cast downe their Scepters at his feete: hee can take the breath out of their nostrils, when hee pleases. In what an happy ease are we, that have such a LORD protectour of the Church? He may suffer us to be tryed as gold in

the furnace of affliction: but he will not suffer us to perish, at the length he will deliver us out of the hands of all our enemies: only let us have a care, so neere as we can, not to displease this our high-Priest. As the people were obedient to the high-Priest in the time of the Law: So let us be to our high-Priest in the time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: <hi>kisse the Sonne, least he be angry, and yee perish from the way.</hi> All Papists kisse the Popes feete, yea Kings, Princes and Emperours. But let us all from the highest to the lowest, in meekenesse and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, kisse this our high-Priest that sitteth at the right hand of the throne of the Majestie in the heavens, and he will defend us from all enemies whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>THe second argument. Those high-Priests were <hi>Ministers of an earthly Sanctuary:</hi> this of an heavenly: <hi>Ergo,</hi> more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than they.</p>

                  <p>The third argument: hee that hath the more worthy Sacrifice, is the more worthy Priest. <hi>Christ</hi>'s sacrifice is more worthy. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sacrifice is set forth to us. 1. Figuratively. 2. Properly.</p>
                  <p>Figuratively it is resembled to a <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some by <hi>Tabernacle</hi> understand heaven too, as well as the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary: but rather by it is meant, the body of our <hi>Saviour Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It is not like, that in so few words he would use a tautology.</item>
                     <item>2. The Tabernacle was for the Priests, not for the High-Priests.</item>
                     <item>3. The reason following, <hi>Verse</hi> 3. doth evince, that by the Tabernacle is signified the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherewith hee did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>It is an usuall thing to resemble the body to a Tabernacle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13, 14. As a man dwelleth in an house or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: So doth the soule in the body. And as <hi>God</hi> dwelt in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle among the <hi>Iewes:</hi> so doth the deity dwell in the humanity of <hi>Christ:</hi> therefore it hath the name of a Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>This similitude is fitly introduced by the Apostle. As the high-Priest by the Tabernacle went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum:</hi> so <hi>Christ</hi> by his body offered on the Crosse went into heaven: <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9.11.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:12681:164"/>
Hence it is that <hi>Christ</hi>'s body is compared to <hi>a Temple, Ioh.</hi> 2.21. to <hi>a vaile, Heb.</hi> 10.20.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is illustrated by an adjunct, and the efficient cause.</p>
                  <p>The other was but a counterfeit to this <hi>True</hi> is not opposed to <hi>false:</hi> that was not a forged Tabernacle: it was of <hi>Gods</hi> institution, and made by his direction. But it is called the <hi>true Tabernacle,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> may be called the <hi>true David, Salomon, Melchizedec,</hi> the <hi>true Manna</hi> that came from heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.32. And as the picture of a man is nothing to the man himselfe: So that <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was but a picture of this: this is the <hi>true Tabernacle</hi> indeed. The shadow of the Sun in the water is not the Sunne: that is the <hi>true</hi> Sun that is in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so that was but a shadow of this <hi>Tabernacle</hi>; this is the <hi>true Tabernacle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is illustrated by the efficient cause. <hi>Moses, Aholiab, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaleel</hi> and other artificers pight that <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which were mortall men, though they did it by <hi>Gods</hi> appointment: this <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was framed immediately by <hi>God</hi> Himselfe: the body of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> was conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note>The name of a <hi>Minister</hi> is no base name; seeing <hi>Christ</hi> being now in heaven doth not thinke scorne of it. He was a <hi>Minister</hi> of the circumcision, when he lived on the earth: and he is a <hi>Minister of the Sanctuary</hi> now in heaven. Therefore let none have a base opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the name and office of the <hi>Ministers. Christ</hi> is the head <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,</hi> and we inferiour <hi>Ministers</hi> under him: therefore let us be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently regarded for his sake.</p>
                  <p>There by presenting of his owne sacred body before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by the efficacy of his passion he still maketh intercession for us; this is the Ministery which he performeth in this heavenly <hi>Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The High-Priest in the time of the Law went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> himselfe alone, he could carry none of the people with him: but our High-Priest, which is a <hi>Minister of the</hi> celestiall <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> shall one day take us up into that <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to himselfe: hee is gone thither to prepare a place for us: at the latter day wee shall meete him in the ayre, and bee translated into this <hi>Sanctuary</hi> with him, and remaine with him for ever.

                  <p>As <hi>Christ</hi>'s body was a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> so is ours: for <hi>he was like to us in all things, sinne onely excepted.</hi> Here is the difference: his body was a pure and undefiled <hi>tabernacle,</hi> not a spot or blemish of sinne in it; ours are impure and uncleane Tabernacles, infected with the Leprosie and contagion of sinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His body was a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> framed immediately by <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the third person in the Trinity: we have our <hi>Tabernacles</hi> mediately from <hi>God,</hi> by the meanes and seede of our Parents.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:12681:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. His body is resembled to the <hi>holy Tabernacle,</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> was served in the time of the Law; ours may be compared to those <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> wherein the Patriarcks dwelt, before they were seated in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet they may have the name of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> and so they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Tabernacles</hi> were different things from houses: they were of more sleight and slender stuffe, soone set up, and soone pulled downe: So our bodies are not houses, faire and magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, strong towers and stately pallaces: they be but brittle <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi> nay <hi>houses of clay,</hi> whose foundation is in the dust: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cause why we should be proud of them. The body of strong <hi>Samson,</hi> that carried the Gates of the Citties on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was but a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> that was quickly crushed in pieces: the body of <hi>Saul, that was higher then any of the people,</hi> was but a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:</hi> the body of fat <hi>Eglon</hi> and of great <hi>Goliah,</hi> were but fraile <hi>Tabernacles:</hi> the body of <hi>Absalom</hi> that had not a blemish from the crowne of the head to the soale of the foote, was but a weake <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:</hi> the body of the fairest Lady and the most comely Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman on the face of the earth, is but a <hi>Tabernacle</hi>; up to day, and downe to morrow. Therefore let us glorifie <hi>God</hi> with these our <hi>Tabernacles</hi> in this world, that wee may receive them glorious and everlasting in the world to come.</p>

Wee offer the sacrifice of almes and Christian liberality in feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, in shewing our kindnesse to CHRIST his Ambassadours, and we must offer up our bodies as a lively sacrifice to <hi>God.</hi> If wee have no sacrifice, wee are no Priests: yet a number of Christians there bee that professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be spirituall Priests, and yet have no spirituall sacrifice to shew. These are as Starres without light, clouds without water, and trees without fruit. Every Priest is ordained to offer sacrifices: if we be Priests, let us shew our sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Now that it is requisite hee should offer the sacrifice of his owne body, hee sheweth by an evident absurditie that must needs ensue, if it were otherwise: and that is a nullitie of CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> Priest-hood. Therefore we must needs affirme, that either he is no Priest at all, which is to make <hi>God</hi> a lyar, who hath said, <hi>thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedec:</hi> or that hee is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Priest from them, and hath another manner of sacrifice then they had.</p>
                  <p>Then hee returneth to the other clause in the second <hi>Verse,</hi> that CHRIST is <hi>a Priest in heaven, a Minister of the heavenly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi> Either hee is a Priest in heaven, or in earth: not in earth: which he proves <hi>ab absurdo</hi>; if he be Priest on earth, then he is no Priest: but yee cannot deny him to bee a Priest: for the Scripture saith, <hi>thou art a Priest after the order of Melchizedec.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The consequent of the proposition is proved by an argument from the contraries.</p>
                  <p>If hee were a Priest on earth, then hee should bee a superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Priest: for there bee Priests enow on the earth, able to offer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>There being Priests, which according to the constitution of the Law offer gifts: the Law had sufficient Priests already on the earth to offer Bulls, Calves, Sheepe, Goates; therefore if <hi>Christ</hi> were a Priest on the earth, he were no Priest different from the Leviticall Priests, or more excellent than they, for they were able to offer up all externall sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>The earthly Priests and hee cannot stand together: so long as they are in force, CHRIST cannot exequute his office. Therefore hee is a Priest in heaven, not in earth.</p>
                  <p>Till they have done, <hi>Christ</hi> cannot beginne: till his sacrifice was offered on the crosse, they were in request: but after that, their date was out, and our high-Priest is a Minister of the Sanctuary in heaven.</p>

                  <p>The Ministers of the New Testament are more glorious, than the Priests of the Old Testament.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:12681:166"/>
shadowed CHRIST to come to the people; wee preach <hi>Christ</hi> already come. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was greater than all the Prophets; but we (in a one sense) are greater than <hi>Iohn Baptist: the least in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is greater than he.</hi> In this respect our Ministery should be more highly esteemed of: the which notwithstanding is little regarded by many. The Devill in the maide spake honourably of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas:</hi> some of us will speake contemptibly of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Ambassadours.

                  <p>Where had they this <hi>patterne?</hi> from <hi>Moses,</hi> and hee from GOD.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> might not swerue from his <hi>patterne.</hi> All things must bee squared according to that <hi>patterne</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath left to us in his word.</p>
                  <p>The Magistrate must rule the common-wealth according to the <hi>patterne</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath set downe in his word. The Governours of the Church must order it according to the <hi>patterne,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath appointed: the disposers of the Mysteries of <hi>God</hi> must preach ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>patterne</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles: <hi>not in the entising words of mans wisedome, but in the plaine evidence of the spirit and with power.</hi> The father must so governe his Children, the Master his servants, the Husband his Wife, according to the <hi>patterne</hi> prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>God.</hi> This patterne of the most wise <hi>God</hi> must be observed by us all. If wee follow the devices of our owne braine, and leave this <hi>patterne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> Almighty, wee justly incurre his wrath and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. <hi>Vriah</hi> the Priest must make the Altar in all points like the fashion that King <hi>Ahaz</hi> sent from <hi>Damascus,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 16.11. A Carpenter and Mason must make the house according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne received from him that is the Author of the house: he must frame the house to the will of him, that sets him on worke, and not after his owne will. A Sempster must sow according to the Sampler: A Scholler must write according to his Coppy. Wee are angry with a Barber, if he doe not trimme us as we would have him: and displeased with a Taylor, if hee make not the Coate, as we wished him: and must not the high and eternall <hi>God</hi> bee justly incensed against us, if we follow our owne <hi>patterne</hi> and forsake his? therefore let that <hi>patterne</hi> so neere as we can, bee carefully observed by us all.</p>
                  <p>Neither must we follow it in one or two things alone, but in all. <hi>See that thou make all things according,</hi> &amp;c. In some things peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which like us well, we can be contented to be directed by <hi>Gods patterne,</hi> but in all things wee will not. In some things wee will bee carryed by our owne will and affection. <hi>Herod did many things</hi> that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> bade him, he followed the <hi>patterne</hi> in some things: but he would not doe all. Let <hi>Iohn</hi> preach his heart out, he will keepe his sweet sinne of incest still. <hi>Saul</hi> followed <hi>Gods patterne</hi> awhile in his government, but at length he departed from it.

A Scholler must not write two or three letters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his coppie, but all: if he make one awry, his Master will be offended with him. Therefore in <hi>all</hi> things, so farre, as it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, let us follow the <hi>patterne,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> hath set before our eyes, that yeelding not a lame and halting, but a full and complete obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, we may have a full weight of eternall glory in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>But what and if we have not all things according to this <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne,</hi> shall wee in a pelting chafe hurle all away? <hi>God</hi> forbid.

If thine house, be not in all respects built as thou desirest, wilt thou pull all down? Though there should be some men in the Church and common-wealth, that draw not so neere the celestiall <hi>patterne,</hi> as were to bee wished: yet let us not in a rage fling out of hose Churches and common-wealths. Such is the infirmitie of man, and the malice and subtilty of the Devill, that no Church in the world can bee found, wherein there are not some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections comming short of the <hi>patterne</hi> delivered to us: yet let us not separate our selves, but hold the unity of faith in the bond of love.</p>

                  <p>In the promises there are these two things: the matter and the manner: as for matter and substance, the promises were all one in the Old and New Testament, that is CHRIST, and eternall salvation by him. But ours in respect of the manner are better and excell theirs.</p>

                  <p>THis better and more worthy Testament is illustrated two kinde of wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the necessity of it. 2. By the introduction of it. The necessitie was a fault or imperfection in the old.</p>
                  <p>That there was a fault and imperfection in it, hee proveth by the bringing in of another. If there had beene no want in the Old Testament, another had not beene brought in: but another was brought in: <hi>ergo,</hi> there was a want in the Old Testament. But what? was there a fault in that Testament? why, <hi>God</hi> was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and <hi>God</hi> I hope makes no faults?</p>
                  <p>In the matter and substance of the covenant there was no fault: but in the circumstance, and that in respect of us, not of it. <hi>It was weake in regard of the flesh, Rom.</hi> 8.3. a condition of that covenant was, <hi>that we should serve God, and obey his Lawes:</hi> we were not able to doe it,<note place="margin">Hebr. 7.19.</note> therefore that covenant was weake and could not carry us to heaven: if it could, there should have beene no place for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Such, as no complaint could be made any way of it.</p>
                  <p>The Old Testament was faultie: there is no fault in the New: because whatsoever is wanting on our part, is abundantly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by our SAVIOUR CHRIST, the Mediatour of the New Testament: therefore this is to be had in great price and estimation with us all.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In respect of the Persons: that was made with their fathers in the time of the Law; this shall bee made with their posterity in the time of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In respect of the time: that was made at their delivery out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when the Law was given by <hi>Moses</hi>; this at their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of the spirituall <hi>Aegypt</hi> by <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That deliverance is amplified by the Author and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how.</p>
                  <p>The Author was <hi>God:</hi> the manner was kinde, loving and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as a father taketh his Child by the hand, least he should fall, or, miscarry by the way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By an effect, that ensued on the imbecillity of the covenant: it was broken because of the hardnesse of it.</p>
                  <p>In the Hebrew it is, <hi>which they brake.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> followes the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint: the sence is all one.</p>
                  <p>One condition of the covenant was, that they should continue in obedience to me; but they did not: therefore that covenant being broken, it was time for a new to come: let us pray to <hi>God</hi> for grace to continue in that, which we promised in baptisme.</p>
                  <p>And I regarded them not: whereupon he was even with them; they cast off Him, and he cast off them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeke</hi> here is much different from the Hebrew: but if the Hebrew words bee read with an interrogation, the sense of the Greeke agrees well with them. <hi>And should I bee still as an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to them?</hi> they have played the Harlot and broken the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on their part, and shall I stand to the covenant: shall I bee as an Husband to them, when as they are no Wife to me? Nay, I will set them as light as they doe me. I regard them not: I cast off the care of them. Though the words differ, the sense is all one: therefore that must be no stone for us to stumble at.</p>
                  <p>Hebrew. <hi>Et ego dominabar in eis.</hi> I shewed my selfe to be their Lord and master in punishing them; which is the right of Masters to doe.</p>
                  <p>Properly to speake, <hi>God</hi> hath no hand to take us by: but this is spoken <hi>metaphorically</hi> for our comfort. As if the child bee fallen into a ditch, the father in kindnesse takes him by the hand, and pulls him out: so deales our heavenly father with us, who is farre more mercifull than earthly parents can bee to their Children. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible love of <hi>God</hi> towards us is set forth by diverse simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes in Scripture. Sometimes he is compared to an Eagle, that fluttereth over her birds, and preserveth them from all dangers: sometimes to an Henne, <hi>gathering us as Chickens under his wing.</hi> Sometimes to a father, as in this place, and many others. In all calamities he takes us by the hand and leads us out. Hee hath not only committed us to the Angels hands, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. <hi>and the Angell tooke Lot by the hand, and brought him out of Sodom:</hi> but hee gives us his owne hand. If the King should take us by the hand, when we are in any distresse; it would greatly cheere us. The King of Kings whose power none can resist, takes us by the hand in all our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Let that bee a staffe of comfort for us to leane upon. As hee tooke the <hi>Israelites</hi> by the hand, and lead them out of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> So,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:12681:169"/>
though wee cannot see it with our bodily eyes, hee takes us by the hand in all miseries.</p>
                  <p>If men should be in prison for righteousnesse sake, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was, till <hi>the iron entred into his soule; God</hi> at the length takes us by the hand and pulls us out. If we be in poverty ready to starve, as <hi>Elias</hi> was <hi>under the Iuniper tree, God</hi> takes us by the hand of his mercy, by some meanes or other and helpes us out. If we be in banishment, as the <hi>Israelites in Babylon,</hi> and as many of our Country men were in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; <hi>God</hi> takes us by the hand and brings us out. If we be in some terrible and dangerous sicknesse, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was, even at the point of death; <hi>God</hi> takes us by the hand, and pulls us out of it. If we bee on the Sea ready to be drowned, as the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were; <hi>God</hi> takes us by the hand and delivers us out of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging tempest. O singular comfort, that we have such a friend as <hi>God</hi> Almighty is! Hee takes us by the hand in all calamities. Let him have our hand and heart too. Let us be carefull to please him all the dayes of our life.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, they never begun to keep my Testament: but <hi>they continued not in my covenant.</hi> It is like they made many faire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, were very forward at the first: but they shrunk in the wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and <hi>continued not:</hi> Therefore <hi>God</hi> shooke them off. <hi>Yee are they that continued with mee in my temptations. Be faithfull to the end,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will runne the way of thy Commandements to the end,</hi> said <hi>David.</hi> Let us not run apace for a while, but let us hold out running to the end, else we shall misse of the gold of eternall life. <hi>Remember Lots Wife:</hi> she went out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but because she <hi>looked backe, she was turned into a pillar of Salt.</hi> Let us not turne out of the way of <hi>Gods</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but <hi>continue in his covenant:</hi> else hee will cast us off. Now of our selves, we have no power to <hi>continue,</hi> no more than we had to begin. Let us entreat him <hi>that hath begun a good worke in us, to finish it to the day of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many flatter themselves in <hi>Gods</hi> mercies: ô <hi>God</hi> is mercifull; though we sin, he will not punish us: he will wink at our iniquities, therefore we need not be so shie of sin. Though we live in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, uncleannesse, pride, covetousnesse, yet wee may bee in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>God. Indeed God</hi> is of wonderfull mercy: hee is called <hi>the father of mercies</hi> in the plurall number, not of Iustices. There is a whole Psalme of his mercie: and so not of his justice. Yet wee must not imagine, that his mercy can put his justice out of place. To penitent sinners as the Publican was, as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was, that <hi>watered Christ</hi>'s <hi>feete with her teares,</hi> he is mercifull: but to them that <hi>continue</hi> in their sins, hee will shew himselfe to bee just, and powre down <hi>the vials of his wrath</hi> on them: he cast off the <hi>Israelites</hi> his own chosen people for their abominable sins: and doe you think that we shall escape, which are but wild Olives, and adopted Children in comparison of them? There is no dallying with <hi>God</hi>; if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not in his covenant, he will reject us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iustifications.</hi> The ceremonies are so called, not because they did justifie, but because they shadowed out our Iustification by CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Some distinguish the two first, ordinances, religions or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippings: yet in all Greeke coppies they be conjoyned.</p>

                     <hi>An holy place: (Mikdash)</hi> where these ordinances were put in exequution, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.8. It was a token of <hi>Gods</hi> dwelling among them: it was removed from place to place: and <hi>God</hi> continually went with them.</p>
                  <p>Yet this holy place hath an epithete to abase it withall, to pull downe the glory of it, least the <hi>Iewes</hi> should have too high an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it. Some interprete it, <hi>whereinto the people and all nations of the world might enter:</hi> as if he spake of that place which was appointed to the people to meete in: but that is quite dissonant from the scope of the Text: for this worldly Sanctuary he divides afterwards but into two parts, not into three: hee meddles only with that, which was a type of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Priest-hood, pretermitting that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the people.</p>
                  <p>He calls it <hi>a worldly one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it was made after the manner of the world: for as <hi>God</hi> stretched the firmament as a vaile and curtaine to separate the things above from them beneath; so the Sanctuary had a vaile, that made a separation betweene the first and second Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because it was made of worldly matter, as of haire, silke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because it was not eternall, as our Sanctuary of heaven is, where our High-Priest appeareth for us before <hi>God:</hi> but a fraile, brittle and mortall Sanctuary, as the world is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As the Old Testament had many ordinances of Religion; so hath the New Testament: that had her rites; and this hath rites belonging to it. 1. Theirs were many. 2. They did signifie
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:12681:173"/>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> to come: ours are few, and demonstrate him come. Wee have new Sacraments, new constitutions; baptisme instead of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; the Supper of the LORD instead of the Passeover. Sundry religious ordinances are appointed in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that there should be every LORDS <hi>day</hi> a collection for the poore: that the man being after a more excellent manner the Image of <hi>God</hi> should <hi>pray bare-headed,</hi> not being ashamed to shew his head, but having a kinde of head-ship over the woman; and <hi>the woman</hi> should <hi>cover her head, when shee prayeth:</hi> that an order should bee kept in prophesying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Christian Church can consist without some externall rites and ceremonies, which if they be not repugnant to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> are to be observed by us, as these ordinances of religion were by the Iewes.</p>
                  <p>All true Christian Churches agree in the substance of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but all disagree in ceremonies. <hi>Socrat. Zozom. Theodoret.</hi> in their Ecclesiasticall histories shew, that some Churches pray to the East, some to the West; some eate fish, some fowles in the time of Lent; some abstaine from both: yet all accord in CHRIST the head. Even so at this present day the French Church have one kinde of ceremonies, the Dutch another, the English different from them both. In the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> they receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Wafer-cakes. In some Churches they sit, in the Church of England we kneele at the celebration of the Supper. In these indifferent things which in their owne nature are neither good, nor evill, wee must not contend, breaking the peace and unity of the Church: but we must doe, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> did, submit our selves to the authority of the Christian Magistrate, <hi>not only for feare, but for conscience sake:</hi> if he command any thing we are sure is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of <hi>God,</hi> then <hi>obey God rather than man:</hi> but if it be a thing indifferent, then obey both <hi>God</hi> and man. <hi>Beza</hi> himselfe sayes of the Crosse in baptisme, that is used in the Church of England; <hi>utantur libertate sua:</hi> for these things all Churches have their liberty, and let them use it in the feare of <hi>God.</hi> The Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament had her ordinances: the New Testament hath hers: one Church hath this ceremony; another that. For the peace of Sion, let us not contend about these things, but bee thankefull to <hi>God</hi> for the pearle of the Gospell continuing among us.</p>
                  <p>And as they had a Sanctuary, to the which they resorted unto the publike worship of <hi>God:</hi> so have we our Churches and places of holy meetings, which are carefully to bee frequented by us. O how love I the place of thy habitation, sayes <hi>David,</hi> and that where thy honour dwelleth? but wee love our owne houses; our burling parkes, loomes, shops, barnes and stables above the place of <hi>Gods</hi> worship.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have here a cooling epithete. Whatsoever things are <hi>worldly,</hi> wee ought not to bee too much in love with them. The <hi>Iewes</hi> Sanctuary how sumptuous soever it was, the glorious Temple at Hierusalem the wonder of the whole earth, was but a <hi>worldly</hi>

thing. The great Cathedrall Churches, that be in this land so state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magnificent: all inferiour Churches and Chappells where wee serve <hi>God,</hi> yea even the kings Chappell (if you looke at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of them) are <hi>worldly</hi> things: all faire and costly buildings: the Royall Exchange, the new Burse, all Lord-like and regall pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces are but <hi>worldly</hi> things: silver and gold which we all hunt after, silkes and velvets, all fine and gallant apparell: a table richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with all kinde of delicates, large lands and ample revenews, a great troupe of serving men following us at our heeles, all these are but <hi>worldly</hi> things, vaine, fickle, transitory; they vanish away like the smoake.</p>
                  <p>We our selves are but <hi>worldly</hi> things; out of the earth we were taken, to the earth we must returne: therefore let us not be enflamed too much with the love of these <hi>worldly</hi> things: <hi>the glory of this world fadeth away like a flower</hi>; therefore let us <hi>use it, as if wee used it not</hi>; let not this <hi>world</hi> be our Paradise: let us remember it is but a strange Country, by the which we passe as travellers.</p>

                  <p>From hence the <hi>Iesuites</hi> collect the reservation and adoration of the relickes of the Saints. Why may not wee reserve the Crosse, some pieces of CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> Coate, of the bones and garments of holy men, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did the <hi>pot of manna,</hi> and <hi>Aarons rod,</hi> and why may we not believe the continuance of them, as well as of these?</p>
                  <p>The reason is apparent: because they had <hi>Gods</hi> expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement for their warrant, which we want.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they were kept; yet they were not adored or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as their relickes be, to the great dishonour of <hi>God,</hi> and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of his Majesty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All things might not be reserved according to their owne will and inventions: they passed through the red Sea; yet we read of no sand, which they kept as a memoriall of it. The three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren came out of the fire unburnt: yet we never read that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith they were in the fire, were reserved as holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes. Wee must not keepe things on our owne braine, but by <hi>Gods</hi> appointment and direction: if we doe, they may stincke and rot, as <hi>Manna</hi> did, when it was kept longer then <hi>God</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These were of miraculous and extraordinary things: but of every thing they make a relicke!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. These wee know to be true: the most of theirs, (I believe) are false, and counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>They are called <hi>the tables of the Testament,</hi> because they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Gods</hi> Will and Testament.</p>
                  <p>See what cost was bestowed on the Tabernacle. They were not of <hi>Iudas</hi> his minde: he said of the box of oyntment; <hi>wherefore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this waste?</hi> they said not so of the <hi>Tabernacle: to what purpose is this waste?</hi> they contributed to it with joyfull and cheerefull hearts: in so much as <hi>Moses</hi> was faine by publike Proclamation to restraine them: <hi>the people brought too much.</hi> Where is this zeale now in the time of the Gospell? we grudge almost at all things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the house of <hi>God.</hi> In many places an homely Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table, wee would be ashamed to have such a one in our owne houses: no decent Carpet to cover the Table withall: their vessels were of Gold; we cannot get silver Cups for the Table of the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> Wee have not so much love to the Gospell, as they to the Law. They were more carefull in adorning the shadow, than wee are of the body. Our owne houses shall be glorious; it makes no matter how inglorious the <hi>Lords</hi> house be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manna</hi> was a singular benefit which <hi>God</hi> bestowed on the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites: God</hi> sent it them in the barren wildernesse, when they were ready to faint: it came not from the earth, but from heaven:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:12681:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>our fathers did eat Manna from heaven:</hi> it was Angels foode: it was a type and figure of our <hi>Saviour Christ. I am the true bread that came from heaven:</hi> therefore <hi>God</hi> would have a pot full of it reserved to all posterity, that so great a benefit might not slip out of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>Wee are to keepe a register of all <hi>Gods</hi> mercies: but especially of them, that be rare and extraordinary. In memoriall of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Arke, and of the Priests and people over <hi>Iordan,</hi> twelve stones were set up, according to the number of the twelve tribes of <hi>Israel. God</hi> will not have their departure out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that was so miraculous, to be forgotten: therefore he puts it in the forefront of the decalogue, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Aegypt, out of the house of bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iewes, Hest.</hi> 9.17. kept that as a festivall day, wherein they were delivered from the cruell plot of <hi>Haman.</hi> Let the like bee practised by us: let not the yeere eighty eight bee rased out of our memories, wherein wee had such an unexpected victory over the Spaniards, that were ready to swallow us up. The time was when there was great scarcity of bread in these quarters, and then <hi>God</hi> sent plenty of small fishes, which were instead of bread and meate to the poore. Let that be reserved in our memories. Of late a most divellish and never heard of treason was contrived by some Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Papists to blow up the whole realme: the which that it might never be forgotten in England, a perpetuall holy day is inacted, by act of Parliament, wherein publike thankes is given to <hi>God</hi> for it. One way or other such extraordinary mercies are to be imprinted in our memories. A reservation of some externall relicke is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes necessary; there may be danger in that: if some part of the Gunpowder, or some of the barrels, which they had layd in the vault, had beene kept, it would not have been so good, as a solemne day every yeere for the recordation of it. But alas, we are all excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding forgetfull of <hi>Gods</hi> mercies: his judgments are soone forgot: the terrible pestilence which at the beginning of the Kings raign swept away so many thousands, is not remembred: much lesse will we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the favours and blessings of the <hi>Lord: beneficia nemo ponit in calendario:</hi> that is good of our own benefits: but we must all put the benefits of <hi>God</hi> Almighty in the calender of our mindes for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>And Aarons rod that budded.</hi> The occasion was this. Whereas <hi>Corah Dathan and Abiram</hi> with all that belonged to them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed for their malepart dealing against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> began to mutter at it, came to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> saying, <hi>ye have killed the people of the Lord, Num.</hi> 16.41. whereupon a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them were slaine. Now to the intent that this murmuring against the Priest-hood might be stayed,<note place="margin">Num. 17.1.</note> the <hi>Lord</hi> by a lively token would make manifest to all posterity, unto what an high chaire of honor he advanced it: he commanded 12. rods to be taken according to the number of the 12. tribes: that tribe should have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence in the sanctuary, whose rod budded: now <hi>Aarons</hi> budded,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:12681:176"/>
and no other: therefore he and the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in spirituall matters above the rest for ever.</p>
                  <p>This doth signifie to us what a care the <hi>Lord</hi> hath of his sacred ministery, which through the malice of Satan is ready to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in the world.<note place="margin">Hos. 4.4.</note> 
                     <hi>My people are as they that rebuke the Priest.</hi> A contemptuous rebuking of <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers is a sinne of sins, <hi>q. d.</hi> they cannot commit a greater offence then this: they have no good successe that resist <hi>Gods</hi> Ministers. <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices were swallowed up by the earth alive. <hi>Ieroboams</hi> hand was dried up, which hee stretched out against the Prophet. <hi>Iesabel</hi> was eaten up with dogs, that set her selfe against the servants of the <hi>Lord. Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> was smitten with a Leprosie, for his contempt of the Priests. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> that went about to play mocke-holy day with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> were smitten with suddaine death.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us take heed how wee oppose our selves to the Ministers: how wee murmure against their authority, thinke or speake contemptibly of them. The world may seeke to depresse <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, but it shall bud and flourish in despite of them all. Therefore let us have a reverent opinion of the Ministers: let us esteeme them as GOD<hi>'s</hi> stewards, as his Ambassadours, such as are over us in the <hi>Lord.</hi> Let us submit our selves unto them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with feare and trembling, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did <hi>Titus:</hi> when his Ministery is despised, <hi>God</hi> is despised, and hee will not put it up at our hands.</p>
                  <p>The third thing reserved were the Tables of the covenant. The Arke is a representation of the Church, which above all other things must have the Law of <hi>God</hi> in it. This golden Candlesticke must hold up the Candle of the Word of <hi>God.</hi> Hence it is that she is called <hi>the ground and pillar of truth:</hi>

                  <p>WEE have heard what was in the Arke.

                  <p>The <hi>Cherubims</hi> are the Angels, that minister to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. and an Angell comforted him in the Garden.

                  <p n="1">1. We that be Christians may be more couragious then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: we are better guarded then any other: the wicked are guarded with the Devill and his Angels; wee with the holy and mighty Angels: they have the black guard; we the white: an armie of ten or twenty thousand men may bee with them; but an army of an hundred thousand thousand Angels is with us.

Let us not be together by the eares, because of the Angels.

                  <p n="3">3. Let us bee thankefull to <hi>God</hi> Almighty, that hath given us his Angels to overshadow us. Let us live in the feare of the living <hi>God</hi> in this world, that we may sing praise to him with his Angels in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Sundry other things there were about <hi>the tabernacle,</hi> the narration whereof might have delighted the reader. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here jogs himselfe by the elbow, and is a Moderatour to himselfe: you are desirous to heare more, but it is expedient to cut them off. Wherein he may be a president to all teachers. Though the discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of curious and intricate questions would more delight the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, yet we must not feede their humour that way. Let us give them but a taste of them, and a whole mouthfull of sound and wholesome foode. The Child would take pleasure in a knife with a golden haft, but it shall bee the wisedome of the nurse to keepe it from the Child: so the people as wayward Children are much carryed away with the golden shew of wittie conceits: but let us that bee their nurses, give them that milke which is most requisite for them. Some peradventure in this place would have said; O <hi>Paul,</hi> why doest thou so sleightly handle the things belonging to <hi>the tabernacle?</hi> repeat I pray thee every particular to us; it doth us good to heare of them: yet he doth not satisfie their itching eares in that. I but S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> hath more necessary matter. Let us espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be desirous to heare of <hi>Christ</hi> our High-Priest and Bishop of our soules, of repentance, of faith in him, of making our calling sure by good workes, of the true <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of heaven, then of those earthly things; these are more profitable for us. Some at this day would have us to discusse these questions in the pulpit: tell us on what day <hi>Adam</hi> fell; on what day the Angels were created; what diversity there is among them: how originall sin is conveyed to us: speake of the diversity of glory in the life to come: as for <hi>Christ,</hi> faith, good workes, these be stale things. But wee must not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them therein: curious matters must not bee stood upon, when more weighty and proffitable things are to bee propounded. The Spirit of <hi>God</hi> passeth over sundry other things about <hi>the Tabernacle,</hi> because hee had more substantiall points in hand tending to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>Now when these things were thus ordained, that is all the parts of the Tabernacle being framed, and all instruments set in their place.</p>
                  <p>In the actions belonging to all the Priests there are these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The place where they did minister: to that they were tyed and might goe no further.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time when they did minister, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, at every time, when it came to their courses. Some or other were alwayes to be implyed in the first Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner of their ministery: they accomplished the services of Religion and of divine worship, which the <hi>Lord</hi> had appointed to them: they trimmed the lights, looked to the Table and shew bread, that was on it, offered up sacrifices and prayers for the people: for there was a morning and an evening sacrifice every day.</p>
                  <p>All these things did the Priests in the first Tabernacle: and they did them not by halves, but finished and accomplished them.</p>
                  <p>As they did their duties: so must wee that be the Ministers of the Gospell, doe ours. Wee must give our selves to the Word of <hi>God</hi> and prayer: <hi>we must be instant in season and out of season, feeding the flock committed to our charge:</hi> we must administer the Sacraments for the strengthning of the faith of the people, that <hi>when the great Shepheard shall appeare, we may appeare with him in glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The killing of the beasts, the preparing of the wood, the kindling of the fire, the offering up of the sacrifices to the <hi>Lord,</hi> the sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the people, the instructing of them in the Law of <hi>God,</hi> this was the service of <hi>God</hi> in the Old Testament. Now the publike prayers of the Church, the reading of Scripture in the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the administration of the Sacraments, the Preaching of the Word, these are the service of <hi>God</hi> in the New Testament. And will you be sitting in the Church yard, when <hi>Gods</hi> service is exercised in the Church, doe yee make no more account of the service of <hi>God?</hi> It is a singular honour to be <hi>Gods</hi> servant. <hi>Nebuchadnezar my servant.</hi> It is no disparagement to the greatest Prince in the world to be <hi>Gods</hi> servant. The Angels glory in this, that they are <hi>Gods</hi> servants. <hi>I am thy fellow servant.</hi>

                     <hi>Christ Himselfe tooke on him the forme of a servant:</hi> he came into the world to serve. There is no fishing to the Sea: no service to the King. Let us serve the King of Kings with all cheerefulnesse in this world, that we may raigne with him in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>THe second part of the typicall service, was performed by the common Priest: the other typicall action or service is peculiar to the High-Priest: wherein wee have these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The place where he served: it was the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. How he served there: he had none of the <hi>inferiour Priests</hi> with him, nor any of his men to attend on him; neither Wife, Childe, servant, nor friend might goe with him: hee went into it alone: wherein he was a famous figure of our SAVIOUR CHRIST: who himselfe <hi>alone,</hi> without the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> his mother, <hi>Peter, Thomas,</hi> or any of the Apostles, made a propitiation for our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>As the High-Priest did offer up bloud <hi>alone</hi> for the sin of the people in the second Tabernacle: So CHRIST <hi>alone</hi> hath satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for our sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. When hee went to the Crosse to bee offered up for our sins, all his Disciples left him: he was faine to be crucified Himselfe <hi>alone</hi> for us: therefore wee are beholden to him <hi>alone</hi> for the wonderfull worke of our redemption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The time when he went: not once a day, but once a yeere. A straight charge was given concerning it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.2.</p>
                  <p>Why did he goe into it but <hi>once a yeere?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this sacrifice offered <hi>once a yeere</hi> by the High-Priest might bee more solemne, and the better regarded by the people: those things that are done dayly, are lesse esteemed: that which comes seldome is more reverenced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To signifie that CHRIST <hi>once entred into heaven for us with his owne bloud, Verse</hi> 12. his one sacrifice <hi>once</hi> offered was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: this was called the feast of expiation: and it was on the tenth of September only.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. With what he went.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The bloud of a young bullocke which he offered for himselfe, Levi.</hi> 16.11. the bloud of <hi>a goate</hi> for the people, <hi>Verse</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>That is illustrated by the end, why the bloud was offered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the expiation of <hi>his owne sinnes, Verse</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the sins <hi>of the people, Verse</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Here it is (<hi>ignorances.</hi>) 1. A <hi>Metonymie</hi> for the sins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ignorance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be <hi>a Synecdoche,</hi> one particular sin being put for all: for all kinde of sins are reckoned up, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.16.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>one</hi> ignorance, but <hi>many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignorance</hi> is one chiefe and capital sin; being put for all: because it is the mother in some sort of all sin. For in all sins we commit, though we be endowed with singular knowledge, our understanding for the time is blinded by Satan and our owne corruption.</p>
                  <p>Here we may see that ignorance is a sin. Some Papists make a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:12681:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vertue of it: she is the mother of devotion: whereas in truth shee is the mother of destruction: <hi>yee erre, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> For the better explication of it; there is a double ignorance, the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, the other privative. As for that which is by negation, when <hi>God</hi> in wisedome hath denyed to us the knowledge of some things, it is no sinne to bee ignorant of them: this ignorance was in <hi>Christ,</hi> which knew no sin, he was ignorant of the day of judgment: but privative ignorance is a sinne; for us to bee deprived by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> of that excellent light wherein we were created, this is a sin, and may justly be required of us.</p>
                  <p>There was a sacrifice for sins of ignorance:<note place="margin">Hab. 3.1.</note> a prayer for ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ shal come in flaming fire rendring vengeance to them that know him not.</hi> Therefore let us not sooth up our selves in our ignorances: let us read the Scriptures, heare Sermons, confer with learned men, pray to <hi>God</hi> to illuminate the eyes of our understanding, that wee may be plucked out of the pit of ignorance dayly more and more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we learne, that there is ignorance in the best of us all: the High-Priest himselfe had ignorance in him: and so hath the Pope by his leave, which challengeth to himselfe the title of the highest Priest in the time of the Gospell. It may be an axiome with them, that he cannot erre <hi>in Cathedra docentis:</hi> yet he hath filled the world with his errors.</p>
                  <p>Not the most profound Divine, nor learned Preacher in the world, but hath his ignorance. <hi>Ezra</hi> was <hi>a perfect Scribe in the Law of the God of heaven,</hi> yet he had his ignorance. <hi>Apollos an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures,</hi> had his ignorance, he was faine to be put to Schoole to tent-makers, to learne of them. The Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though in writing and preaching they could not erre, yet they had their ignorances: even after <hi>Christ</hi> his Ascension into heaven, and the powring downe of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> on them. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> as yet was ignorant of the conversion of the Gentiles, and it seemed a while as a Paradox to him. All the learned men of this age, as of precedent ages, have their ignorances: there bee many places of Scripture, which our best commentators professe they understand not. Therefore let none be proud of their knowledge; but let us all bee humbled with the cogitation of our ignorance, and mourne for it, to our dying day. Let us desire to be in that place, where we shall see, <hi>not any longer in a glasse,</hi> as now we doe, <hi>but face to face,</hi> and have the full knowldge of <hi>God</hi> Almighty.</p>
                  <p>There is no man that sinneth not. <hi>Noah a Preacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> yet he sinned. <hi>Ezra the Priest of the High God of heaven,</hi> yet he sinned: all the Priests of the Old Testament had their sins and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; they offered for themselves as well as for the people. The Ministers of the New Testament have their sins too. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> worthy Preachers, were sinners, they were at variance one with another. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> that famous Champion of <hi>Christ,</hi> had his sin. So have wee all, Ministers and people; therefore we must offer up the sacrifice of fervent prayer, for our selves and for the people too. It is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:12681:179"/>
                     <hi>Christ</hi>'s prerogative to be separate from sinners; all we have our sins.</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, for the Idolatry of the people, for the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of the people: for the murders, thefts, adulteries of the people: but <hi>for the ignorances of the people. Ignorance</hi> is a grievous sin. <hi>Remember not how ignorant I have beene of thy truth.</hi> As ignorance is a great sin in all, so chiefely in them that have the meanes. For them to be ignorant that are nusled up in places where the Scriptures are locked up in an unknowne tongue, is no great wonder: for them in England to be ignorant, where a Sermon once a quarter, is not much to be admired: but to live in a Towne where the word hath beene plentifully preached many yeeres together, <hi>line upon line,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on Sermon, catechizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is wonderfull, and they shall be inexcusable at the day of judgment. <hi>Woe to thee Corazin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>woe to thee,</hi> ô England, ô Suffolke, ô Barfold, if the preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had been in Constantinople that hath beene in thee, they would have brought forth better fruits than thou. Shall a man that hath eyes, live in the open light of the Sunne, and see nothing? Shall a Child goe to Schoole five or sixe yeeres and learne nothing? will you not grieve at it? Some have been in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Schoole ten, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres, and yet they are ignorant of the principles of Religion. Wee reade of some <hi>that could not tell whether there were any Holy Ghost or not:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 19.2.</note> and there be some, it is to be feared, in this towne, that cannot tell what <hi>Christ</hi> is, what is his person, which are his offices, what faith is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A lamentable thing! It shall be easier for <hi>Sodom</hi> then for <hi>Capernaum:</hi> easier for them that live among Turkes, and Indians, then for us, that sit in the lap of the Church, and yet are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. Let us make much of the meanes, come to Sermons cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, heare attentively, look on the text, mark the notes how they are derived out of it, call them to remembrance when yee come home, write them in the Tables of your hearts, that yee may know <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> to the comfort of you all.</p>

                  <p>Not all the people, but one man <hi>entred into the Holy of Holies,</hi> a type of heaven: and hee but <hi>once a yeare.</hi> The way to heaven was not so cleerely manifested then, as it is now, when <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our fore-runner is gone into it before us and for us. The faithfull then knew the way to heaven, and immediately after death went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but they had not such a cleare knowledge of it as wee have. This is probable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first Tabernacle as yet having his standing:</hi> whereby he doth not meane the first part of the Tabernacle, as hee did before; but the whole Tabernacle: for indeed it was but one, though divided into two parts; while the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> with all the rites and ceremonies belonging to it, was <hi>yet standing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is called the <hi>first</hi> in respect of <hi>Christ</hi>'s body, which was the second Tabernacle. It is the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that speaketh in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Iacob</hi> said of <hi>Bethel,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> is in this place, and I was not aware of it. So the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is in the Scripture, and we are not aware of it. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speaks in <hi>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,</hi> in the Psalmes, in the Prophets: he speakes in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, in the Epistles of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi>; therefore when the Scripture is read, let us heare with all reverence, because <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty speaketh in them. No place of holy Scripture is idle, no not the framing of the Tabernacle; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> therby doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to us many holy mysteries in it: therefore let no portion of Scripture be lightly regarded by us.</p>
                  <p>Wee know the way to heaven better than they did: therefore wee should walke more carefully and conscionably in it, then they did: our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> our Head and Husband <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is gone into heaven <hi>to prepare a place for us: blessed are the eyes that see which we see.</hi> Therefore if we tread not in this way, but rather take the way to hell, our condemnation shall bee the greater at the latter day. As <hi>God</hi> in mercy hath opened the way to heaven more cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us then to them: So let us be carefull to take this way to the everlasting joy and comfort of us all.</p>

                  <p>And it may be termed <hi>the time of reformation,</hi> because <hi>Christ</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished those old Ceremonies and sacrifices, and brought better in their roome: namely the sacrifice of his owne body once offered, which was a thousand times more effectuall for the redemption of mankinde, then all the sacrifices in the Law.

                  <p>The Gospell is <hi>a time of reformation.

                  <p>There is a formation, a deformation, and a <hi>reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The formation was at the first Creation of the world: then <hi>God</hi> put all things into a good forme and order: <hi>he beheld all that hee had made, and loe it was good, yea exceeding good:</hi> after that came a deformation by the fall of man, and that put all out of order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: upon that a <hi>reformation</hi> was made. 1. By a generall deluge that purged all the earth. 2. By the Patriarcks after the floud. 3. By <hi>Moses,</hi> when the Law was published in writing. 4. By our <hi>Saviour Christ:</hi> and that is double; the one at his first comming; the other at the second. The spirit of <hi>God</hi> here entreateth of the first. So that the <hi>time</hi> of the Gospell is the <hi>time of reformation.</hi> Now especially ought Christians to endeavour a <hi>reformation.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will take on him to <hi>reforme</hi> the Church: Weavers and Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors will enterprize that. The Church is out of order; let that be <hi>reformed.</hi> I but true <hi>reformation</hi> must begin at our selves: there is a ruinated house to be repaired and <hi>reformed,</hi> where will yee begin? at the top, or at the bottome? will ye goe to the tiling of it, before yee look to the ground selling of it? if yee doe so, you may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring an old house on your heads. He that will repaire an house, must begin at the foundation: so if yee will have a <hi>reformation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme</hi> your selves first: and in the <hi>reformation</hi> of your selves begin with the heart: cast out the uncleane lusts, the pride, envy, malice, covetousnesse, that lye lurking in the corners of your hearts; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>reforme</hi> your eyes, tongues, hands, and all the members of your body: first <hi>wash the inside of the Cup and platter,</hi> then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; else yee will be but <hi>whited tombes and painted Sepulchers,</hi> as the Pharisees were: this is the best order in <hi>reforming.</hi> First let every man strive to <hi>reforme</hi> himselfe, the vices whereunto himselfe is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In the next place let him <hi>reforme</hi> his family: after that, let every one in his place labour to <hi>reforme</hi> the Towne, wherein hee dwells, to rid it of drunkards, of idle persons, to establish good orders in it, for the credit of the Gospell professed by us. This is the time of <hi>reformation,</hi> let us all in the feare of <hi>God reforme</hi> our selves: there shall not be a haire amisse in our head, but we will <hi>reforme</hi> it: if we have a spotted Coate or garment, we will <hi>reforme it:</hi> and shall wee our selves remaine <hi>unreformed?</hi> while the time of <hi>reformation</hi> lasts, let us <hi>reforme</hi> our selves: death may seaze on us ere wee bee aware, and then it will be too late to <hi>reforme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us <hi>reforme</hi> our selves here, that we may be Citizens of the heavenly Hierusalem hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the application of the type with all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular branches of the same. Wherein all of them are applyed to our <hi>Saviour Christ:</hi> he is the marke at the which they all aimed, the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:12681:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
scope, whereunto all must bee referred: hee is the true High Priest prefigured by him in the time of the Law: his body is the true Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, by the which he entreth into the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi> the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary or holiest of all is heaven: his bloud is the true bloud sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by the bloud of all the sacrifices in the time of the Law. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> is the end of the whole ceremoniall Law: it was but as a Schoolemaster to send us to him.</p>
                  <p>But in this application to observe some order, that might bee a light to us all: in it two points are propounded to us.</p>

                  <p>A thing come is better than that, which is to come. A child come into the world is more acceptable then one to come: a feast, come, then one to come. CHRIST was to come in the time of the Law: now he is come. Let us receive him with joy, as old fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Simeon</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Hee is not a laick, but <hi>a Priest</hi>; not an inferiour, but an <hi>High-Priest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All were subject to the <hi>High-Priest</hi> in the time of the Law: and let us submit our selves to <hi>Christ</hi> our <hi>High-Priest,</hi> in the time of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Here we may see what they be, that in truth deserve the name and title of good things. Not silver and gold, houses and lands, Sheepe, and Oxen, faire houses, large lands and ample possessions. CHRIST at his comming brought none of these, yet hee brought good things with him: namely, remission of sins, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious robe of his owne righteousnesse to cover us withall, faith and other graces of the spirit, and habitation in his owne kingdome in the life to come: these indeed are worthy the name of good things.

                     <hi>Projicimus nomen boni; Seneca:</hi> when we adscribe it to these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things. <hi>Why callest thou me good,</hi> sayes <hi>Christ</hi> to the young man? So why doe we call these earthly and transitory things good? The onely good things are the spirituall blessings that <hi>Christ</hi> bringeth. <hi>The greatest sort crave worldly goods:</hi> but let us entreat the <hi>Lord</hi> to fill our store-house with these <hi>good things.</hi> The Philosophers made three kindes of good things: <hi>bona animi,</hi> as wit and wisedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>bona corporis,</hi> as beauty, strength: <hi>bona fortunae,</hi> as riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to speake the truth, none of them all are <hi>good things:</hi> they be <hi>good things</hi> that can make the parties <hi>good</hi> that have them: these doe not. <hi>Esau</hi> had a good wit, could readily descant on <hi>Iacobs</hi> name: yet he was no <hi>good</hi> man. <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata</hi> had great variety of learning, yet a vile man. <hi>Haman</hi> had great honour, his throne exalted above all, yet hee a wicked man. <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Bashan</hi> had strength, <hi>Ahsalom</hi> beauty, yet evill men.</p>
                  <p>Health is a good thing. A man may come to Church, heare service and Sermons, which he cannot when he is sicke. Wealth is <hi>good.</hi> A man may bee liberall to all <hi>good</hi> uses, laying up a <hi>good</hi> foundation against the time to come: but these are not worthy to be named with those, which we have in <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let us desire those <hi>good</hi> things that can make us <hi>good,</hi> to engraft us into <hi>Christ,</hi> in this life, and make us heyres of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Forsomuch as our Priest bringeth such excellent things with him, let him be most welcome to us. <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Ahimaaz, he is a good man, and bringeth good tidings:</hi> much more let us say of <hi>Christ</hi> our High-Priest, <hi>he is a good man, he bringeth good tidings,</hi> that by the bloud of his Crosse he hath reconciled us to <hi>God</hi> the Father, hath obtained a generall pardon for all our sins, he hath prepared a place for us in his own kingdome: therefore let us receive him with all joy. The High-Priest in the time of the Law could bring no such good newes, hee only came with the bloud of a Goate, Bullocke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That was a representation of the bloud of CHRIST. The Pope that challengeth to himselfe the title of an High-Priest in the time of the Gospell, sendeth forth his pardons, and indulgences: but they are little worth, they cannot free us from one sin: it is <hi>Christ</hi> alone, that is the messenger and author of all <hi>good</hi> things to us: therefore let us skip for joy at his comming, and embrace him with both armes.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Christ</hi>'s body is a <hi>Tabernacle:</hi> So is ours, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The name of a tent or <hi>Tabernacle</hi> imports a warfare: Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have their tents. <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> dwelt in tents: the <hi>Iewes</hi> had the feast of Tabernacles. Wee fight against Satan and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the tents of our bodies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a difference betweene a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and an house: for an house is made of solid matter, Wood, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Tent</hi> is made of old clothes patched together, so our bodies are

not made of the Sun, of the Starres, of the firmament, but of the earth which is a brittle thing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Tent is weake, easily pierced through; so our body: a knife, a pin may pricke it, a flie may choake it.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Tent</hi> is quickly up, and quickly downe: So is our body: wee come suddenly, and wee are gone againe in the turning of an hand: though it bee the body of a Wise <hi>Salomon,</hi>

                  <p>Wee know not how soone our bodies may be layd in the dust: therefore let us not be too much in love with them.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Tabernacle in the time of the Law was kept neate, cleane, and handsome, it might not bee polluted with any thing: So let us keepe our bodies from all pollutions.

                  <p>There the High-Priest by the bloud of Goats and Calves went into the holy place: here our High-Priest goes into heaven by his owne bloud: therefore this service excelleth that.</p>
                  <p>When the High-Priest went into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> hee was to offer up a bullocke for his owne sins, and a Goate for the sins of the people: here hee useth the plurall number, because they were iterated every yeare.</p>
                  <p>The High-Priest went in by other bloud, <hi>Christ</hi> by his owne bloud. It was an easie matter for him to take the bloud of a young bullock and of a Goate, it cost him no great paine: but our high-Priest was faine to shed his owne bloud, before he could enter into heaven.</p>
                  <p>He went once every yeere into the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi> CHRIST went once for all into heaven, and there he remaines till the day of judgement.</p>
                  <p>Where wee have a notable argument against his carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the last supper.

Therefore he is not here on the earth bodily: so oft as the supper is ministred.</p>
                  <p>The third thing in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was the use of the service, that was in it: that was onely to shadow out our redemption to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished

                        </gap> Satan, hell:</hi> in whose bondage and slavery we were.</p>
                  <p>Not a temporal redemption, as a man may bee rescued from his enemies and fall into their hands againe; but an eternall one: so as we are delivered from them for ever.</p>
                  <p>These words (<hi>for us</hi>) are not in the Greek: yet they are well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: for <hi>Christ</hi> obtained no redemption for himselfe: he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in bondage to <hi>sin and Satan:</hi> therfore he could not be redeemed. Though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defend, that <hi>Christ</hi> merited the glory of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the exaltation of his name for himselfe: yet no redemption.</p>
                  <p>Our SAVIOUR CHRIST <hi>by the one sacrifice of his owne bloud hath obtained eternall redemption for us:</hi> therefore there needs no more sacrifice for our redemption. Then away with the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the masse, which is propitiatory for the quicke and the dead. For the Papists held it in time past, but being forced to it by the light of Scripture, they let goe that hold, and affirme that it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>repraesentativum, commemorativum &amp; applicativum</hi> of that sacrifice on the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defends it to bee a propitiatory sacrifice, and so doth the councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> The <hi>Iesuits</hi> say, it is not that redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming sacrifice for the sinnes of the whole world, yet it may availe for the remission of some particular sinnes, with a relation to that redeeming sacrifice on the Crosse. They say it is the same with that on the Crosse: it differs only <hi>modo:</hi> that is, a bloudy sacrifice; this an unbloudy.</p>
                  <p>I but all the legall sacrifices instituted by <hi>God</hi> must cease after the oblation of this sacrifice, whereby eternall redemption is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for us: then this new forged sacrifice of the masse being a bird of their owne hatching must cease.</p>
                  <p>And howsoever they minse it, affirming that it is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration and an application: yet they hold still that it is propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory for sin, as if a full propitiation was not made by <hi>Christ</hi>'s sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice on the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>Their opinion is this: that it is not that redeeming sacrifice on the Crosse: that could not be often done, because <hi>Christ</hi> could not dye often; yet by being a commemoration of that sacrifice, and an application of it to us, it doth obtaine remission of sins, and is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for sin, it is <hi>propitiatorium &amp; impetratorium</hi> still.</p>
                  <p>Propitiatory for the sins of them that be present, and of them that bee absent, alive and dead: impetratory, because it obtaineth not only spirituall benefits, but also temporall. So that this is the issue. The Sacrifice of the masse is not that generall redeeming
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:12681:184"/>
sacrifice that was offered on the Crosse, yet being a commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an application of it, it is propitiatory for the sins which wee dayly commit. So sayes the Counsell of <hi>Trent.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Vnder the <hi>genus</hi> all the <hi>species</hi> are comprehended: if that was a generall redeeming sacrifice taking away the sinnes of the world, then it left no sinne untaken away.

                  <p n="2">2. Was that sufficient to propitiate for sins, or insufficient? Surely they will say sufficient: therefore there is no need of any helpe from the sacrifice of the masse.</p>

                  <p>The Idolaters offered the bloud of their Sons and Daughters to their Idolls, but they would not offer their owne: <hi>Christ</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the holy place with his owne bloud, by his owne stripes we are healed: in his owne body he bare our sins, by his own bloud he made a way into heaven for us: he gave not the bloud of any of his servants, but his owne bloud.

                     <hi>We are redeemed,</hi> sayes <hi>Peter, not with corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious bloud of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>as of a Lamb undefiled: we are bought with a price,</hi> and that a deere price, even the bloud of the Sonne of GOD.

So when we are provoked to sinne, to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, covetousnesse, adultery; let us reason with our selves. Indeed the water of these sins is sweete, but did it not cost the bloud of CHRIST? therfore away with it: we think sin to be nothing; yet all the Martyrs on the earth, all the Angels in heaven could not have freed us from sin.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. ult.</note> The Son of <hi>God</hi> must shed his bloud for it: therefore let the consideration hereof bee a perpetuall bridle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine us from sin.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> bloud is the price of our redemption: he sweat drops of bloud, when hee was in his agony in the garden: at the commandement of <hi>Pilat</hi> hee was extreamely whipped, so that the bloud came exceedingly out of his holy body: he had a Crowne
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:12681:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thornes platted on his head, that made the bloud runne about his eares: being nailed hand and foote to the Crosse, the bloud came out in great measure: <hi>a Souldier thrust him through with a speare, and out of his side came water and bloud:</hi> So that this our High-Priest redeemed us not with the bloud of beasts, but with his owne bloud.</p>
                  <p>How then are wee to love CHRIST IESUS, that spared not his heart bloud for us? There was no bloud almost left in this immaculate Lamb, he spent all for our sake. Wee will love them that give their money for us: and shall wee not love CHRIST that gave his bloud for us? yet the love of <hi>Christ</hi> is not so deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed in us as it ought to bee. We love the trash of the world, the pleasures of the flesh above <hi>Christ.</hi> This love of <hi>Christ</hi> should constraine us to forsake our sinnes. Wilt thou make much of the knife that cut the throate of thy friend or father? Sinne was the knife that cut CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> throate: therefore let us hurle it away: but this bloud of CHRIST, by the which we are wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our sinnes, is little regarded: for all that, wee wallow in the mire of our sinnes forgetting the LORD that bought us, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh. Wee are redeemed from our drunkennesse, covetousnesse, pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the bloud of CHRIST: therefore let us have no fellowship with these sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Heaven is an <hi>holy</hi> place: there dwells the <hi>holy God:</hi> there bee the <hi>holy</hi> Angels and <hi>holy</hi> Saints: they that remaine <hi>unholy</hi> shall never enter into it: dogs enchanters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are without.

Let us strive to be <hi>holy</hi> in this world, <hi>holy</hi> in heart, in conversation, that wee may enter into the <hi>holy Hierusalem</hi> in the world to come.<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.14.</note>

                  <p n="3">3. By CHRIST wee have a plenary redemption of soule and body out of the clawes of Satan. As the Bird is in the fowlers net: so were we in the Devills snare: but we may say with them in the Psalme, <hi>the net is broken, and we are delivered:</hi> yea, wee are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered eternally, we shall never fall into that bondage againe. The

afflictions, whereunto we are incident in this life, are temporall; but the redemption is eternall: sicknesse, poverty, malevolent tongues, imprisonment, death it selfe is temporall: our joy is eternall. Let that comfort us in all the calamities of this life. A burning agew, the tooth-ach, the stone lasts not alwayes: but my joy in heaven shall be eternall: here I may be in griefe for a time, but there I shall reigne with <hi>Christ</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>Wee love them, that obtaine a temporall redemption for us. If a young man bee bound Prentise to an hard master for tenne or twelve yeeres, and if one should buy out his apprentiseship and set him free; would hee not take himselfe much beholding to him?

a certaine water was to be made, which being sprinckled on them that were uncleane, by the touching of a dead body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it did sanctifie them, and made them capable of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>; being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by that water, they might goe with the rest of the people into the place of <hi>Gods</hi> worship.</p>
                  <p>This Cow was a type of <hi>Christ.</hi>

As hee was man consisting of flesh and bloud: So he was also <hi>God,</hi> an eternall and incomprehensible spirit.</p>
                  <p>From this his infinite and unspeakeable deity the bloud of CHRIST received a power to make satisfaction for our sinnes. Whereupon it is called <hi>the bloud of God, Acts</hi> 20.28. The bloud of none that was a meere man could doe it: if CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> bloud had not beene offered up by his eternall spirit, it could not have purchased our redemption. The bloud of Martyrs was offered up by the assistance of the HOLY GHOST: yet it was not merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:12681:186"/>
it was not that, but the power of the deity, that made <hi>Christ</hi>'s bloud meritorious.</p>

                  <p>And how must we <hi>serve</hi> him?</p>

As <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> hath redeemed both soule and body: so we must glorifie him with them both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee must <hi>serve God peculiariter:</hi> him and him alone. <hi>I am a jealous God. Thou shalt have no other Gods besides me.</hi> We must not <hi>make our belly our God,</hi> as <hi>Epicures doe:</hi> our money our God, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous misers doe: but wee must <hi>serve God</hi> alone: hee must have all our <hi>service, Matth.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Perseveranter.</hi> not a while, but continually, to our lives end: <hi>bee faithfull to the end, and I will give thee the Crowne of life.</hi> If wee persevere not in his service to our dying day, wee shall loose our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Totaliter:</hi> all the time of our whole life. Wee must <hi>serve</hi> him, not only when wee bee old, drie and withered; but in our fresh and flourishing yeeres: wee must beare the yoke of the LORD, when wee are young: hee must have the first fruits of our service.</p>
                  <p>But alas! though wee professe that wee are redeemed by CHRIST: yet wee <hi>serve</hi> our owne lusts and affections: wee <hi>serve</hi> not the living GOD, as wee ought to doe. Let us have a care to <hi>serve</hi> the living GOD in this short and transitory world, that we may live eternally with this everliving GOD in the world to come.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>It is <hi>ratified by the death of the Testatour.</hi> Which is confirmed by two arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iure humano, Verses</hi> 16.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Iure legali.</hi> Where, 1. A generall assertion, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. 2. A particular explication of it, <hi>Verse</hi> 19.20.</p>
                  <p>Here may seeme to be some contradictions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There it is said, <hi>when Moses had read the booke:</hi> here it is said, <hi>when hee had spoken every precept,</hi> that is appertaining to the booke of the covenant. So that there is no jarre, but a sweete harmony.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is mention only of <hi>the bloud of Beeves:</hi> here <hi>of Calves and Goates:</hi> they are by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> comprehended in the other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is nothing said of water, wooll, and hysop:<note place="margin">Num. 19.6.</note> but there he speakes of <hi>sprinkling,</hi> and these were used in all sprincklings.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not said that the booke was <hi>sprinckled:</hi> but that may well bee collected, <hi>Verse</hi> 6. for having made an Altar, and set the booke of the <hi>covenant</hi> on it, with halfe of the bloud he <hi>sprinckled
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:12681:188"/>
the Altar and the booke,</hi> afterwards hee <hi>sprinckled</hi> the people too.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There it is said, <hi>this is the bloud of the Testament, which God hath made with you:</hi> Here, <hi>which</hi> GOD <hi>commanded to bee brought to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This in sense is all one: it was made according to the booke, and being made was brought to them comprised in the booke, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.9.</p>
                  <p>The force of the argument is this: <hi>the former Testament</hi> was confirmed with bloud, by the death of Calves, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was requisite, that <hi>the latter Testament</hi> should be ratified with <hi>bloud,</hi> namely by <hi>the death of Christ the Testatour.</hi>

                  <p>If CHRIST his death doth <hi>redeeme us from all transgressions,</hi> then there needs no sacrifices for sin after his death? Yes, say the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> one to be a representation of that on the Crosse.

Now if <hi>Christ</hi> be really present in the Masse, how can the Masse bee a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of him?</p>
                  <p>And that manner is opposite to the Scriptures: for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sayes, <hi>he is only offered up with bloud.</hi> Your unbloudy sacrifice is no sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>the former covenant,</hi> whereas we for our part were not able to performe that, which belonged to us; GOD performed his part, but we could not doe ours.</p>
                  <p>It is unseasonable here to dispute, whether CHRIST delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that lived in the time of the Law, for by the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is meant the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> not the time of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> Therefore it is opposed to the <hi>New Testament.</hi> In the Greeke it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not a purchase bought with the money of our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: but an <hi>inheritance</hi> bequeathed to us by the <hi>last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ, Luk.</hi> 22.29. <hi>and I appoint unto you a kingdome, as my father hath appointed unto me.</hi>

                  <p>When Death comes, then we must forgoe all, houses and lands, all that our fathers left us: But this <hi>inheritance</hi> is eternall, wee can never be deprived of it, we shall enjoy it world without end.

                  <p>Secondly, sayes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> this is not to bee understood, as if <hi>without actuall shedding</hi> of bloud there could bee no remission, but <hi>abs<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>I but, First, the <hi>sacrifice of the Masse</hi> doth rather abolish the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the Crosse, then apply it to us: for if that were a full and perfect <hi>sacrifice</hi> for sinne; then there needs no other: the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of the Masse is a blasphemous sacrifice robbing <hi>Christ</hi> of his honour.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But if CHRIST<hi>'s bloud</hi> bee really <hi>shed</hi> so often as a Masse is said or sung, then CHRIST suffers often. Certainely a man

suffers, when his <hi>bloud</hi> is <hi>shed:</hi> but <hi>Verse</hi> 26. therefore in the Masse no <hi>shedding of bloud,</hi> and for that cause <hi>no remission of sins</hi> for the same.</p>

                  <p>In the Masse there is no propitiatory <hi>sacrifice</hi> offered up, that's most certaine.</p>
                  <p>That doth plainely signifie to us, that if CHRIST<hi>'s bloud</hi> had not been <hi>shed</hi> for us, we could never have had <hi>remission of sins.</hi> Then how are we beholden to the <hi>Lord Iesus?</hi> There is a base fellow in the land that hath committed high treason; he must needs dye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Kings Son <hi>shed</hi> his <hi>bloud</hi> for him.

                  </p>
                  <p>Why did not GOD send CHRIST at <hi>the beginning</hi> of the world?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hee would have sicke man for a time to bee humbled with
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:12681:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the sight and feeling of his disease: that the Physitian might bee more welcome, when he came.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He would have the prophesies concerning <hi>Christ</hi> to bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, before he came.</p>
                  <p>A sharpe and evident knife to cut the throat of the Masse withall.</p>
                  <p>If CHRIST be offered up in the sacrifice of the Masse, then hee suffers at every Masse: for there can bee no offering of <hi>Christ</hi> without suffering: but he suffers not, even in the judgement of the Papists: neither <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor any of them all can, though full of shifts, tell handsomely how to elude this argument: for here their unbloudy sacrifice hath a deadly wound. There can bee no oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ</hi> without the suffering of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The world then is not eternall, as some Philosophers drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: it had <hi>a beginning,</hi> and it shall have an end: onely GOD is <hi>without beginning and ending:</hi> for the Angels themselves had a beginning.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>the end</hi> of the world was in the time of CHRIST and of his Apostles, then now it must needs bee at an <hi>end:</hi> now it lyes a gasping, and is ready to yeeld up her breath, that day is at hand, when the world <hi>shall passe away with a noyse</hi>—Therefore why doe wee dote so much on the <hi>world?</hi> wilt thou sit feasting and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting in a rotten house that is ready to fall on thy head? Such an house is the <hi>world:</hi> therefore rather hasten to bee out of it. The wicked are called <hi>the men of this world:</hi> wee that bee the faithfull are men of <hi>another world: ye are not of the world,</hi> sayes our SAVIOUR CHRIST:<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.19.</note> yet for all that wee are meere <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> following the pleasures and profits of <hi>the world,</hi> seldome or never thinking of the joyes of the <hi>world to come.</hi> Who will serve a Master that is ready to dye?

                  <p>CHRIST hath not <hi>redeemed</hi> us by the bloud of a Calfe, Ram, Sheepe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not with the sacrifice of an Angell, of his mother, or any Saint; but by the sacrifice of <hi>Himselfe:</hi> no other <hi>sacrifice</hi> could save us.

                  <p n="1">1. The particular: then the generall.</p>
                  <p>Then there is no Purgatory: We have two purgatories in this life; the fire of affliction, and the bloud of <hi>Christ:</hi> then wee neede feare no purgatory after this life.</p>
                  <p>Here we see an <hi>appointment,</hi> a decree, a sentence: wherein foure circumstances are to be observed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By whom this <hi>appointment</hi> is made: namely by <hi>God</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: in whom there is not a shadow of turning, and which is able to bring that to passe, which he hath appointed. <hi>What I have written, I have written,</hi> said <hi>Pilat,</hi> and would not alter his writing: so what <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>appointed,</hi> hee hath <hi>appointed,</hi> and hee will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish it. Men are mutable; they <hi>appoint</hi> and <hi>disappoint:</hi> it is not so with <hi>God; hath he said it, and shall he not doe it?</hi> Therefore as sure as <hi>God</hi> is in heaven, this <hi>appointment</hi> shall stand. <hi>Who at any time hath resisted his will?</hi> who can breake his <hi>appointment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. What it is that is <hi>appointed? once to dye.</hi> What is <hi>death?</hi> properly to speake, it is a separation of the soule from the body. Man was made with two parts: the body of the dust of the ground; the soule breathed into him by <hi>God.</hi> Life is a conjunction of these
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:12681:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two: <hi>death</hi> is a separation of them. There is an improper <hi>death,</hi> which is a change of these two conjoyned still together, which shall happen to them that be alive at the day of judgment: but the Apostle here speaketh of the proper <hi>death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an extraordinary <hi>dying,</hi> and an ordinary. Some have <hi>dyed</hi> twise, as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and those that rose with <hi>Christ</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: but ordinarily it is <hi>appointed to all men once to dye.</hi> It is not <hi>appointed</hi> to all to be rich, wise, learned, but <hi>to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why was this <hi>appointment</hi> made? <hi>because of sin, Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>at what time thou eatest, thou shalt dye the death. Sinne</hi> is the cause of <hi>death.</hi> Then why should wee bee in love with sin? Wee shunne poyson, because it will kill us, drunkennesse, adultery, swearing and other sins brought <hi>death</hi> into the world: therefore let them be hated by us. Why are wee afraid of the plague? because it will kill us. <hi>Sinne</hi> will kill both soule and body: therefore let us all bee afraid <hi>to sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The persons to whom this <hi>appointment</hi> is made, <hi>to men: to all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is no man living but shall see death: it is appointed to Kings to dye:</hi> to Dukes, Earles, Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, Merchants, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers, Husbandmen, to high and low, rich and poore, learned and unlearned. It is <hi>appointed</hi> to the Ministers <hi>to dye,</hi> and to the people: to the Master, and servant: to the Husband, and to the Wife. We read of a Woman that had seven Husbands, they all <hi>dyed,</hi> and in the end the Woman <hi>dyed</hi> also. None can avoid the stroake of <hi>death:</hi> the Physitions that cure others, at the length <hi>dye: contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis:</hi> the godly <hi>dye</hi>; good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bring forth with sorrow as well as bad: so good men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>dye,</hi> as well as bad: as the faithfull are sicke as well as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull; so also they dye as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Oh that this were carefully remembred by us, and that wee would lay it close to our hearts! We see our neighbours, Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one or other almost everyday carryed to the earth; yet wee lay it not to heart: it workes not in us a <hi>death</hi> to sin: we follow the <hi>world</hi> with such earnestnesse, as if we should never leave the <hi>world.</hi> Let us so live that wee may <hi>dye</hi> in the LORD IESUS, rise againe and live with him for ever. When or where we shall <hi>dye,</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, that is in <hi>Gods</hi> hands: but this is most certaine, <hi>wee shall dye, quocun<expan>
                           <am>

                  </p>
                  <p>If any should aske a reason why the godly should <hi>dye,</hi> seeing CHRIST hath <hi>dyed</hi> for them? the answer is easie: because CHRIST <hi>dyed</hi> to free them from <hi>death</hi> eternall, not from the corporall <hi>death,</hi> which is imposed upon all, because all have sinned: <hi>Christ</hi> hath taken away the curse of the corporall <hi>death,</hi> but not <hi>death</hi> it selfe: <hi>cogitur non obesse, sed non abesse:</hi> wee are all sinners,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:12681:195"/>
therefore we must all <hi>dye.</hi> Let us bee carefull to feare <hi>God</hi> while wee bee alive, that wee may not greatly feare <hi>death,</hi> whensoever he shall come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Death</hi> is <hi>a bitter cup:</hi> all of us in some sort feare to drink of it. CHRIST feared it: <hi>&amp; non est fortior miles quàm Imperator:</hi> wee feare it, as it is a dissolution of nature: but let us not feare it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a slavish manner. Take this sugar to sweeten this bitter Cup withall.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>We must all appeare before the judgment seate of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> The drunkard must give an account of his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse: the covetous man how he hath imployed his riches: we must give an account of our oppressions, thefts secret or open: of our negligent comming to Church and contempt of the Word of <hi>God.</hi> Let this cause us with a narrow eye to looke into our lives, let us <hi>judge</hi> our selves in this world, that wee bee not <hi>condemned</hi> hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yet there bee a number in the Church that thinke it a scare Crow, and make a mocke at this <hi>judgement,</hi> as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did at the resurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.32. they will believe the <hi>Assizes</hi> at <hi>Bury</hi> and in other places, but count this a tale of a tub. <hi>Felix</hi> though a wicked man, <hi>trembled</hi> at it. Let us all tremble at the naming of this <hi>judgement.</hi> Let it be a meanes to pull us from sin, and to make our peace with <hi>God</hi> in this world, that we may stand without trembling before the Sonne of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudgment</hi> followes upon the neck of <hi>death:</hi> either <hi>come thou bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> or <hi>goe thou cursed.</hi> The good thiefe the same day he dyed, was with <hi>Christ</hi> in Paradise; that was his <hi>judgment, the rich man,</hi> the same day he dyed, <hi>was in hell in torments,</hi> that was his judgement.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, whilest wee have time, let us repent; while <hi>God</hi> giveth us a breathing time on the face of the earth: for when death commeth, it is too late: then there is no mercy, but judgement to be expected. While we be alive, <hi>Christ</hi> knocketh at the doore of our hearts with the hammer of his Word: if we will open to him, he will sup with us, and we shall sup with him in the kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but if now we shut him out, and will not suffer him to enter, he will shut us out, and though we cry <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> with the foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, he will not open to us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I but then hee came with his fraile body to offer up <hi>for sinne, Verse</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>Now he shall appeare with no more <hi>sacrifice for sinne.</hi> Then he came as a Lamb to be slaine for <hi>sin:</hi> now as a King and a Lion. Then he came as a Priest with a sacrifice to offer: now as a Iudge to sit on the Throne.</p>

                  <p>Here is another argument against the Masse. Men may as well <hi>dye</hi> often, ordinarily, as <hi>Christ be offered</hi> up often.

                  <p>He <hi>shall appeare</hi> to all, yea even to them, that looke not for him: <hi>they that have pierced him, shall see him:</hi> he shall appeare to <hi>Iudas,</hi> that for thirty peeces betrayed him: to the Pharises that burned in hatred against him to the death, and would not be satisfied but with
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:12681:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his bloud, crying out with full mouth and would have no nay, <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him:</hi> to the Souldier that thrust him through with a speare: he <hi>shall appeare</hi> to abhominable murderers, to beastly drunkards, to impure adulterers and adulteresses, that have grieved him with their sins, and dyed in them without repentance: but it shall be to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>goe yee cursed into everlasting fire.</hi> So that as soone as they begin to peepe out of their graves, they shall howle and cry, <hi>ô yee hills and rockes fall on us,</hi> and hide us from the face of <hi>him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to them <hi>that looke for him, that love his appearing,</hi> that say in their hearts with them in the <hi>Revelation, Come Lord Iesu, come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he <hi>shall appeare to salvation:</hi> So that they shall <hi>lift up their heads, because their salvation is at hand:</hi> he that commeth is their friend, el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, Husband, Head, <hi>Saviour,</hi> therefore they neede not to feare his comming: they shall meete <hi>Christ</hi> in the ayre, be translated with him into the kingdome of glory, and remaine with him in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable happinesse for evermore. Wherefore let us all bee in the number of them that <hi>looke for his comming:</hi> be yee like to <hi>servants,</hi> sayes <hi>Christ, that wayte for their Master.</hi> As the daughter of <hi>Iepthe</hi> looked for her fathers comming, went forth with Timbrels and daunces to meete him: so let us joyfully <hi>look for Christ</hi>'s comming, the father that hath created us, the SAVIOUR that hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us. Shall not the Wife <hi>look for the</hi> comming of her Husband, if he be gone into Spaine or a farre Country? Shall not one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>looke for</hi> the comming of another? <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is our Husband, our elder brother: therefore let us <hi>looke for</hi> him. The Saints in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Pauls</hi> time <hi>looked for</hi> his comming: and shall not wee now? all the signes of his comming are past, which may be as warning pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to us: the Gospell hath beene preached over all the world, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of wars, therefore why should we not <hi>look for</hi> his comming?</p>
                  <p>Especially <hi>his comming</hi> to our particular death may bee <hi>looked for</hi> every moment of an houre. <hi>I am now old,</hi> said <hi>Isaac, yet know I not the day of my death.</hi> So may every one of us say. <hi>Absalom</hi> was a young man: yet hanged by the haire of his head, and shot to death by <hi>Ioab. Nabal</hi> a rich man, over night merry with wine, in the morning as dead as a stone. <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, when sitting in his Consistory, he rayled on the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> an issue of bloud burst out of his body, and he dyed immediately. We are now strong, healthfull, and lusty, <hi>God</hi> be praised for it; yet the axe of death may cut us off ere wee be aware. Wherefore let us looke for <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>comming</hi> generall or particular, that whensoever hee shall <hi>come,</hi> wee may enter with him into the wedding chamber of the kingdome of heaven, there to remaine with him for evermore.</p>

                  </note>BEfore, we had a dissimilitude betweene the two High Priests: now hee prosequutes the difference betweene the Law and CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A consummation of the Priest-hood of <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Verse</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An exhortation to constancy, inferred thereupon.</p>
               <p>In the consummation, 1. An <hi>antithesis</hi> betweene the legall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and <hi>Christ</hi>'s, in the ten former <hi>Verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An opposition betweene the Priests of the Law and our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ, ab</hi> 11. to 19.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antithesis</hi> betweene the legall sacrifices and <hi>Christ</hi>'s hath two branches:
<list>
                     <item>1. Is the weaknesse of the legall sacrifices, in the foure first <hi>Verses.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The power and efficacy of <hi>Christ</hi>'s sacrifice, <hi>à</hi> 5. to 11.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The weakenesse of the legall sacrifices is set downe in this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>1</label> axiome: that they could not take away sin and sanctifie them, that offered them; which is confirmed by foure arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of the Law: that, which was but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the remission of sinnes and other good things to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by CHRIST, could not take away sin: the Law was but a shadow, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From the often repetition of them. If the legall sacrifices <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>2</label> could have taken away sin, purge the consciences of them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, from the guilt of sin, then there needed not such a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent iteration of them: but they were often iterated: <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the use of them. They that can onely put men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>3</label> that they be sinners, cannot take away sin: he that puts me in minde, that I am in debt, doth not discharge me of my debt: but these did put men in remembrance of their sins, <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the vility and basenesse of them: there Bulls, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>4</label> Goates, and such like beasts were offered: now it is impossible, that the bloud of such creatures should take away sin: <hi>ergo,</hi> they were not able to doe it.</p>
               <p>The power of <hi>Christ</hi>'s sacrifice is confirmed by a testimony <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>5</label> out of the Psalme; where there is, 1. An allegation of the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to <hi>Verse</hi> 8. 2. An explication of it, <hi>Verses</hi> 8.9, 10.</p>
               <p>In the testimony alleadged there be two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> calling to the offering up of this sacrifice, <hi>Verse</hi> 5.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His promptnesse and readinesse to exequute that calling <hi>Verse</hi> 7.</p>

                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:12681:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>In his calling two circumstances. 1. The time when 2. The reason why: the time was at his comming into the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. The reason is taken from the rejection of the legall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
               <p>Which is amplified by a repetition of those rejected sacrifices.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>6</label>
               </p>
               <p>His readinesse to execute his calling appeares by the offering of his service to <hi>God</hi> the Father: which is illustrated by the manner of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>7</label> it, the impulsive cause, and the end thereof.</p>
               <p>The manner, <hi>loe I come:</hi> the impulsive cause was the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Scripture, which had written of him before: the end, <hi>to doe thy will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The interpretation containeth two things.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>8, &amp; 9.</label>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The collection of an argument out of it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. and 9. that hath two branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The abolishing of the legall sacrifices. 2. The establishing of <hi>Christ</hi>'s.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A comfortable consequent ensuing thereupon, <hi>Verse</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>The collection of the argument is taken from the order used by the Psalmist, who upon the insufficiency of the legall sacrifices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the necessity of <hi>Christ</hi> his sacrifice.</p>
               <p>These being premised, and <hi>God</hi> professing that he takes no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in them, then commeth our <hi>Saviour</hi> with an offering of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his owne body.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is illustrated.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the propriety thereof, which is <hi>a full assurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By an effect, which it engendreth, which is the comfort of a <hi>good conscience:</hi> as they in the time of the Law were sprinckled with the bloud of beasts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.8. So being justified <hi>by faith, our hearts are sprinckled with the bloud of Christ,</hi> whereby being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from all our sins, we are delivered <hi>from an evill</hi> accusing <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and have peace with <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second vertue is <hi>hope:</hi> the profession whereof is stoutly to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">analysis </seg>23</label> be kept and maintained by us. The which keeping is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Amplified by the efficient cause thereof, which is the <hi>washing</hi> of us <hi>with</hi> the <hi>pure water</hi> of the Spirit, whereby we are made fit to make and hold this profession.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the manner, how it is to be kept: <hi>without wavering.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The third is love: whereunto we are to provoke one another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Love is commended to us. 2. A breake-necke of love is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,<label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>The exercises for the preservation of love are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A reverend estimation of Christian assemblies, a notable <label type="milestone">

               <p>And from that he dissuadeth us by the example of some in his time, which is to be avoided by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A mutuall <hi>exhorting one of another:</hi> whereunto he spurreth us by a consideration of the neerenesse of the <hi>day of judgment:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by their owne testimony.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>day of Iudgement</hi> bee at hand, wherein wee must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how wee have behaved our selves in this present life; what soules we have wonne by our diligent <hi>exhorting one of anothor,</hi> and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:12681:199"/>
what we have lost by the neglect of that duty; then let us careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhort one another. But the first is true, as you all see: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the latter be practised by us.</p>

CHRIST by his <hi>sacrifice</hi> on the Crosse hath taken away the sins of the world: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ</hi> is not to be <hi>offered</hi> up any kinde of way, neither bloudily, nor unbloudily to expiate sin.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>conscience</hi> in every man, that keepeth a register of all his sins. It is <hi>scientia cum alia scientia.</hi> There is a generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law written in the hearts of us all, and <hi>conscience</hi> is a particular application of it to our selves. As for example, the Law of <hi>God</hi> sayes, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My <hi>conscience</hi> sayes to mee, if I be guilty of that sinne, thou art an Adulterer, thou hast had thy Queanes in many corners: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> will judge thee: this is <hi>conscience</hi> which setteth our sins in order before us.</p>
                  <p>For the better unfolding of it, we know that there be sundry kindes of <hi>consciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an erring <hi>conscience,</hi> a blind <hi>conscience:</hi> as was in them that thought <hi>they did God good service,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.2.</note> when they killed the Children of <hi>God.</hi> Such a <hi>conscience</hi> was in <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion, for the which hee was grieved afterwards: when the eyes of their minde come but once to bee opened, then their <hi>conscience</hi> will accuse them for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:12681:201"/>2. There is a <hi>sleeping conscience.</hi> A man knowes the will of <hi>God,</hi> yet his <hi>conscience</hi> being a sleepe for a time,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.8.</note> he lyes snorting in the bed of sinne. So did <hi>David</hi> in his sin of numbring the people: but his <hi>conscience</hi> awoke at the length, and his heart smote him for it. A man may lye sleeping in covetousnesse, drunkennesse, adultery, and <hi>God</hi> at the length awaken him out of that sleepe, which is good for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>seared conscience:</hi> such as was in them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. when men are <hi>past feeling</hi> and hardned in their sins. Custome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes another nature. They are so accustomed to drinking, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, oppressing, and deceiving of their neighbours, as that they thinke those to be no sins. Their <hi>consciences</hi> never checke them for them. These are in the ready way to Hell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is an <hi>accusing conscience,</hi> which is as a scolding queane in the house of a mans heart, and will never suffer him to bee quiet day nor night. <hi>They are like the raging Sea,</hi> continually foaming. In that case were they, that <hi>went out of the Temple one by one, being convicted of their owne consciences.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.9.</note> Such a <hi>conscience</hi> had <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he cryed, <hi>I have sinned in betraying innocent bloud.</hi> This may prove a tragedy both in the end, and in the beginning too, as it did in him, and it may end with a comedy in <hi>Gods</hi> Children. It may lead some to hell, and for others, it may bee the way to heaven. <hi>Mordeat nunc, ut moriatur</hi>—It is better for us that this Worme gnaw on us here to the vexation of our hearts for a while, then gnaw on us eternally hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This accusing <hi>conscience</hi> more or lesse wee shall have in this world at one time or other: they that fall into grosse sins and yet never feele a hell in their <hi>consciences</hi> in this life, shall never finde an heaven in the life to come. Therefore it was well said of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded which was the way to heaven: hell, sayes he. For if thou goest not by hell, thou wilt never get to heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is an <hi>excusing and cleering conscience.</hi> When the bookes are cleered betweene GOD and us. A debter is cleered when the booke of his Creditour is crossed: so our <hi>consciences</hi> are quiet, when our sins are out of <hi>Gods</hi> booke, then we shall have no more <hi>conscience</hi> of sin. This could not be effected by the sacrifices in the time of the Law: neither can it bee obtained by any thing that we can doe in the time of the Gospell. It is neither our comming to Church, nor hearing of Sermons, (though these bee good things) not our prayers, fastings, almes deeds, receiving of Communions: noe, <hi>though wee should give our bodies to be burnt.</hi> These are excellent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet these cannot acquit our <hi>consciences</hi> of sinne: for <hi>when wee have done all, we are unprofitable servants,</hi> and we sinne in our best acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The only way to come to a quiet, and <hi>excusing conscience,</hi> is the application of <hi>Christ</hi>'s merits to our selves:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>being justified by faith we have peace with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If wee have laid hold on CHRIST by a lively faith, wee may take up that song: <hi>death, where is thy sting?</hi> &amp;c. Therefore
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:12681:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let us repent, and then entreat the <hi>Lord</hi> to assure our <hi>consciences</hi> that CHRIST hath dyed for all our sinnes, and then wee shall have <hi>no more conscience of sins.</hi> So we shall sing for joy, when wee lye on our death beds, and shall stand without trembling before <hi>God</hi> in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>This testimony was cited Chapter 8. to prove that there was a New Covenant to abolish the Old.

                  <p>The foundation, whereupon the remission of sins promised by <hi>God</hi> was built, was the sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> in the New Testament: otherwise this testimony should not be alleadged to purpose.</p>
                  <p>That which we minde to punish we will <hi>remember.

                  <p>Why will he not <hi>remember</hi> our sins any more?

                  <p>And as by CHRIST alone we have the forgivenesse of our sins, which all the sacrifices in the Law could not purchase, nor any thing that we can doe under the Gospell: so let the love of <hi>Christ</hi> in dying for our sins cause us to dye to sinne dayly more and more: and as he in wonderfull love offered up himselfe as a sacrifice for the putting away of our sins: so let us <hi>offer up</hi> our selves, our soules and bodies, as a holy, living and acceptable <hi>sacrifice to</hi> him all the dayes of our lives; that the power of <hi>Christ</hi>'s passion appearing in us in this world; we may reigne with him in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>SOme might say, thou speakest of our <hi>entrance into heaven,</hi> but which is the way that leadeth to it?

That he pointeth out with the finger: this way is the sacred and undefiled <hi>flesh</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> wherein he payd the price of our redemption.</p>
                  <p>Which is here resembled to a <hi>vaile.</hi> His <hi>flesh</hi> is called <hi>a vaile,</hi> sayes <hi>Gorrhan, quia sub velamine specierum sumitur in viaticum.</hi> The High-Priest went into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> by <hi>a vaile,</hi> and so by the flesh of CHRIST wee goe to heaven.

never heard of or knowne before: for <hi>Abraham</hi> saw this <hi>way</hi> a great while agoe, and went into heaven by it. So did all the faithfull in the time of the Law.</p>
                  <p>But it is called <hi>a new way,</hi> because it was now <hi>newly</hi> manifested to the world being before obscured under types and figures. 2. <hi>New</hi> things retaine their vigour and strength, whereas old things wither away. This is alwayes a fresh and <hi>a new way:</hi> the power thereof shall never bee dryed up. 3. <hi>New</hi> things are acceptable to men: a <hi>new</hi> Preacher shall be heard more attentively then an old: this is <hi>a new way,</hi> therefore let it be welcome to us all. 4. It may be termed <hi>a new way,</hi> because none but they, that be <hi>new</hi> men, <hi>new</hi> creatures in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> can tread in this <hi>way.</hi>

                     <hi>A living way.</hi> It is improperly adscribed to <hi>a way:</hi> yet it is emphaticall.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. So called, because it is opposed to the <hi>dead way</hi> in the time of the Law. There the High-Priest went into the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> by the bloud of beasts, that were dead, when they were sacrificed: our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> was sacrificed alive. 2. This <hi>way</hi> is ever <hi>living</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for men <hi>to enter into heaven</hi> by. Some <hi>wayes</hi> dye and cannot be seene: this <hi>way lives</hi> to be seene of all the faithfull to the worlds end. 3. It leadeth to life: therefore it may be termed <hi>a living way.</hi> 4. They that take this <hi>way</hi> shall <hi>live</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Christ</hi> is called <hi>living</hi> water, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>way</hi> hath <hi>Christ</hi> dedicated for us: hee hath gone it in his owne person, that wee may bee bold to follow him in it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.2. All <hi>Antisthenes</hi> Schollers had <hi>new</hi> bookes, pens, writing tables: and here is <hi>a new way</hi> for all <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples.</p>
                  <p>He hath <hi>renewed</hi> it againe: that is the force of the word. It was in the time of the Law, and the Fathers trode in it: but it was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> at his death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iesuites</hi> gather from hence, that none went this <hi>way</hi> before <hi>Christ.</hi> But when the Temple was dedicated, it was before: So this <hi>way</hi> now dedicated by our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> was before, though not so conspicuous, as it is now.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST alone is the <hi>way</hi> to heaven. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man commeth to the Father but by me.</hi> Then in what a wofull case are they that be out of this <hi>way?</hi> Turkes, Iewes, and all that professe the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> but blaspheme it? Surely they must needs be in the high <hi>way</hi> to Hell. Yea and also a number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that will have <hi>Christ</hi> to be but the halfe <hi>way</hi> to heaven? He is one part of the <hi>way,</hi> and their workes are the other part. <hi>A way</hi> is for men to walke in: so in <hi>Christ</hi> and by <hi>Christ</hi> we must walke to the heavenly Hierusalem.

                  <p>There be many <hi>false-hearted</hi> wretches in the world, such as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, that kissed <hi>Christ,</hi> and betrayed him at the same time: there bee many that pretend love to religion, and yet have none in them, such were those, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.1.

                     <hi>Faith</hi> is like the Moone, sometimes at the full, sometimes in the wane.

                  </p>
                  <p>How shall wee come to this <hi>full assurance?

                     </gap>. <hi>Keepe</hi> it, so as we loose it not: he doth not simply say, hope, but the <hi>confession</hi> of it. Let us bee ready to make an open <hi>profession of the hope,</hi> we have by <hi>Christ,</hi> before all men whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Not inclining one while this way, another while that way, but keeping alwayes one and perpetuall tenor, <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. <hi>verse</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</p>
                  <p>Not leaning on our owne wit, wisedome or strength: but upon the fidelity of <hi>God.</hi> He that hath promised to us eternall salvation by <hi>Christ,</hi> will accomplish it: therefore <hi>let us hold fast the profession of the hope which wee have in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If wee had the word of a man only, wee might bee wavering: but we have <hi>the Word of God:</hi> he doth not directly say <hi>God,</hi> but he describes him by his attribute.</p>
                  <p>Many are <hi>washed</hi> with the water of baptisme, that are not <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi> with this water: as <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>fonte quidem lotus, sed non in pectore mundus: except a man be borne of this water, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> Therefore let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>wash</hi> us with this <hi>water:</hi> Let us say with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> yet more sensibly than she did: <hi>Lord, ever give us of this water:</hi> then shall wee be cleane and fit for the Holy Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough to <hi>have hope</hi> as a precious jewell locked up in the Chest of our hearts, but wee must also <hi>make a profession of it</hi> before the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. We must <hi>professe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men, that we looke for salvation by CHRIST, and by no other. Whatsoever come of it we must keepe this our <hi>profession. What went yee out into the wildernesse to see? a reede shaken with the winde?</hi> wee must not be wavering Reedes, but Stones built on the Rocke CHRIST IESUS: we must not be as meteors hanging in the ayre betweene heaven and earth: we must not <hi>halt betweene two</hi> religions: wee must not be wavering which way to take; whether to be Papists, Familists, Schismatickes, or of no religion: but we must <hi>hold fast the profession</hi> of true religion to the end. When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples departed from him, he said to the twelve, <hi>will yee also goe away? to whom should we goe,</hi> saies, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi>? Let us sticke to CHRIST, and goe to none but him.</p>
                  <p>There be two things that hinder it: feare and shame.</p>
                  <p>Of the former we have an evident example, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the chiefe rulers believed in Christ: but because of the Pharisees
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:12681:213"/>
they did not confesse him, least they should bee put out of the Synagogue.</hi> Men in times of persequution are afraid to loose their goods, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, liberty, life: it is good sleeping in an whole skinne. This terrifies them from any open <hi>profession</hi> of the name of CHRIST. But let such remember, that <hi>the fearefull</hi> are the first, that have their portion in the lake—<hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.8. Let nothing drive us from the <hi>profession</hi> of CHRIST our SAVIOUR: let us <hi>not feare them that can kill the body, but Him, that can cast body and soule into hell fire.</hi> This caveat is needfull in some places and time.</p>
                  <p>The other is shame. CHRIST is poore in this world, the Gospell is sometimes naked, destitute of wealth and honour, many afflictions attend on it, the professours of it sometimes thrust to the walls. In <hi>Iulians</hi> time none of the Christians were Captaines, or had any office: this makes many ashamed of it. If the father be a poore man, many a sonne is ashamed of him, ashamed to owne him for his father: so because the <hi>profession</hi> of CHRIST in some places hath nothing to grace it withall, sundry are ashamed of it: but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>I am not ashamed of the Gospell of</hi> CHRIST. Men will hold fast their purses: and shall they not hold fast their <hi>profession</hi> of CHRIST? Let us not bee ashamed of CHRIST, how contemptible so ever he seeme to be, lest he be ashamed of us, before his father and his glorious Angels.</p>
                  <p>Why, what should move us to it?</p>
                  <p>The Papists will have two pillars for hope to leane upon; <hi>gratia Dei, &amp; merita praecedentia: sine meritis sperare aliquid non spes, sed praesumptio est.</hi> I but the grace and mercy of GOD is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pillar alone by it selfe: the Apostle sayes not, <hi>keepe the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of your hope</hi>; yee have many merits; yee shall never fall; but keepe it, let no persequution remove you from it: for <hi>he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that hath promised.</hi> You are weake, you stand to day, and fall to morrow; your enemies are many and mighty, and there is no strength in you to resist them: yet <hi>hold fast your hope; for God is faithfull.</hi> In him there is <hi>not so much as a shadow of turning.</hi> Wee are <hi>unfaithfull,</hi> wee promise and unpromise. It is not so with him. <hi>I know whom I have believed. I have fought a good fight: from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid up for mee a Crowne of righteousnesse.</hi> In all assaults and temptations, let us not looke to our owne weakenesse, for then we may stagger, but to the promise of <hi>God,</hi> and then we may be sure: for as hee hath promised us a kingdome, so hee will performe it. Therefore <hi>let us hold the profession of our hope.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>meetings</hi> of Christians are private or publike: Politicall, or Ecclesiasticall. Even <hi>civill meetings</hi> about the affaires of the towne, where <hi>God</hi> hath set us, are with care and conscience to be kept: as also the <hi>meetings at the houses</hi> one of another for the encrease of <hi>love: have yee not houses to eate and drinke in?</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.27.</note> and <hi>yee will goe</hi>—Surely they that live wholly to themselves, that will not come at their neighbours <hi>house,</hi> nor bid any to theirs, that will neither be <hi>feastma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> nor <hi>feast-takers</hi>; they are guilty of the breach of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Either they be cynicall <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s: or greedy and miserable <hi>Nabals,</hi> that love to <hi>make feasts</hi> for none but for themselves.

                     </gap> haters of all good fellowship and humane society.</p>
                  <p>If there be any meetings of neighbours about the townes good, wee must not draw in a yoke alone, but <hi>associate our selves</hi> with them. If the whole towne be on fire, what shall become of thine house? art not thou a part of the towne, a member of it? and doest thou not care what become of the body? <hi>God</hi> said to the <hi>Israelites</hi> concerning <hi>Babel, in the peace of it shall be thy peace.</hi> They were to seeke the good of <hi>Babel,</hi> and shall not we of <hi>Sion?</hi> should not every bird have a care of her owne nest? The towne is the nest, wherein
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:12681:215"/>
thou sleepest, and doest thou not care, though it goe to ruine? doth not the safety of every passenger consist in the ship? If water come into the Ship, ought not all to prevent it to their power? The towne is the Shippe, wherein thou saylest, and doest not thou care though it be drowned? in those things that concerne the civill good of the towne, <hi>let us not forsake the fellowship we have among our selves. God</hi> will require it at our hands.</p>
                  <p>But especially let us beware how we <hi>forsake Ecclesiasticall meetings,</hi> where wee have the preaching of the Word, the ordinary ladder, that leadeth to heaven, the comfortable use of the Sacraments for confirmation of our faith, and where we have the prayers of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy ones to joyne with us. These <hi>meetings</hi> above all others ought highly to be esteemed of us, and the curse of <hi>God</hi> will light on them that <hi>forsake</hi> them. We are commanded <hi>to go out of Babylon,</hi> but we are never commanded <hi>to forsake</hi> the spouse of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> for some spots that be in her. The corne doth not skip out of the barne, because chaffe is with it. <hi>Christ</hi> did not pull downe the Temple, but purged it. The <hi>V. Mary</hi> was an heavenly and a singular woman, yet she would not be apart by her selfe, she would joyn with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Woe to them that forsake her, that be the brethren of the separation, as they terme themselves. Fie on such a brother-hood, <hi>Gods</hi> vengeance doth apparently follow them, wanting the light of the true preaching of the Word, they become Atheists in the end. Let us make much of <hi>fellowship</hi> we have in the <hi>publike assemblies</hi> of the Church, let our hearts skip for joy to see them, as <hi>Davids</hi> did. It doth him good to see the tribes going to the house of <hi>God,</hi>

                     <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to visit his Temple.</hi> This <hi>one thing</hi> is more to be esteemed of, then all others things in the world.</p>
                  <p>There are sundry motives to stir us up to the embracing of the <hi>fellowship</hi> of the Saints. 1. Let us make much of all kinde of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian meetings <hi>propter mutuam supportationem. Vae soli. If hee fall, who shall lift him up?</hi> but if we be among the faithfull, one brother may helpe another up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Propter participationem suffragiorum.</hi> The <hi>prayer of one righteous man is available, if it be fervent:</hi> how much more of many righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous together? If the heart of a Father will be pierced with the cry of one of his children, how much more with the cry of many? Let this make us desirous of their company, that we may be helped to heaven by their prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Propter terrorem daemonum, Cant.</hi> 6.9. If an army bee scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, some here, some there, it is the sooner exposed as a prey to the enemy: so if Satan that <hi>roaring Lion that walkes about seeking whom he may devoure,</hi> if he find any of CHRIST<hi>'s</hi> Sheep stragling from the rest, hee will sooner catch them in his clawes: hee tooke <hi>Eve</hi> when she was alone, from her Husband.</p>
                  <p>But if hee see us in an armie united and coupled together, the

Generall whereof is <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> he will be afraid of us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us delight in the <hi>fellowship</hi> of the Saints, <hi>propter divinum consortium: where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middest among them.</hi> Therefore let us be in the <hi>company</hi> of the faithfull, that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> may be in our <hi>company.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let none on pride, vaine glory, singularity, or any other sinister respect rent themselves from the <hi>fellowship</hi> of their brethren; but let us rejoyce in the society one of another. There is a <hi>fellowship</hi> among drunkards, thieves, adulterers, swearers, swaggerers: and shall there be no fellowship among good Christians?</p>
                  <p>There should be the greatest good <hi>fellowship</hi> among them. The Communion of Saints is an Article of our Creede: we say wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, but we do not practise it. <hi>All my delight is on the faithfull, that are upon earth.</hi> Let us take pleasure in the <hi>fellowship</hi> of the faithfull in this world, that we may have the <hi>fellowship</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> his Saints, and Angels in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love the brother-hood.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> The <hi>forsaking</hi> of that is a step to the sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Christians are brethren.</p>
                  <p>It might be objected: why, some <hi>forsake the fellowship:</hi> why may not we doe the like? <hi>quia vivitur legibus, non exemplis.</hi> Some tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellours goe out of the way, wilt thou doe so too! Some fall into a water and drowne themselves, shall we doe so too? Some are so madde, as to leape into a fire and burne themselves, and shall we doe so? Though others take the way to hell fire, yet let not us doe it. It is the manner of some to sit quaffing at the Ale-house all the day long: let not us doe so. It is the manner of some, for supposed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that be in the Church to <hi>forsake</hi> the Church quite: but let them goe alone, let not us follow them: <hi>we have no such custome, nor the Church of God.</hi> Let us follow them that follow <hi>Christ</hi>; and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi> them that follow the Devill, let them goe alone for all us.</p>
                  <p>Some imagine they are safe, if they have example to alleadge. Such and such doe so.</p>
                  <p>That is a crooked rule: yee shall meete with bad examples eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, but let us not be seduced by them.</p>

                  <p>Ye may see it with your owne eyes. Almost all the <hi>signes</hi> are passed already, they be blind that cannot see this.</p>
                  <p>Here then it is cleere, that there is <hi>a day of judgment,</hi> and <hi>that day drawes neere.</hi> If it were neere in the Apostles time, how neere is it now, a thousand and odde yeeres being passed since? Let not us bee like them that <hi>put farre from them the evill day:</hi> not like that servant which saith, <hi>my Master defers his comming, and falls a beating of his fellow servants:</hi> not like those mockers, that say, <hi>where is the promise of his comming?</hi> but let us make a just reckoning, that <hi>this day</hi> is drawing neere indeed, that CHRIST is ready to open the heavens, and to descend in the cloudes, and to <hi>assemble all nations before him.

Let us bee thankefull to GOD for the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Gospell revealed to us, let us make much of it. Let us not quench the light of the spirit, but nourish it in our hearts. Let not the least thought against the <hi>truth</hi> finde any entertainment in us: Let us never open our mouthes against it, but blesse <hi>God</hi> for it, and defend it by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes.

                  <p>There is an outward and an inward sanctification: <hi>hee is not a Iew which is one outward; but he is a Iew which is one within. Iudas</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a Saint: yet he was a Devill.</p>
                  <p>Let us entreat the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>sanctifie our hearts</hi> as well as our <hi>hands,</hi> our <hi>soules and consciences,</hi> as well as our <hi>tongues.</hi> That is <hi>true san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> that beginneth at the heart, and from thence floweth to all the parts and members of the body.</p>
                  <p>What should we doe with a faire and beautifull Apple, if the core be rotten? A straw for an outward glorious profession, and if there be no truth in the inward parts. Therefore let us desire <hi>God to sanctifie us in soule, spirit and body throughout.</hi>

                  <p>If GOD bee a <hi>just judge,</hi> and a <hi>severe revenger</hi> of all impiety, even among his owne people, then those vile wretches must not thinke to <hi>escape, that tread under foote the Sonne of God</hi>—But <hi>God</hi> is such a one. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quàm verax &amp; potens sit.</hi> They that bee Christians must bee acquainted with <hi>God,</hi> they must know him, of what nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he is: <hi>ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, Heb.</hi> 9.11. If sitting in the lappe of the Church, we <hi>know not God,</hi> our condemnation shall be the greater.</p>
                  <p>Where hath he said it? In <hi>the Scripture. Moses</hi> was the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that booke, out of the which this testimony is desumed: yet it is <hi>God that speaketh</hi> in that booke. <hi>God spake</hi> by the mouth of <hi>David, by the mouth of all his Prophets.</hi> Art thou desirous to heare <hi>God speake?</hi>

Scriptures, and there thou shalt heare him <hi>speaking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which ought to enflame us with a love of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and cause us to read and heare them with al reverence, because not man, out <hi>God speaketh</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>sayes</hi> he? he thunders with a vehement voice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vengeance and retribution are mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, may none <hi>revenge</hi> but GOD? Surely no, by his owne authority.</p>
                  <p>The Magistrate may <hi>revenge:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.</note> for <hi>he carryeth not the sword in vaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But his throne is <hi>Gods</hi> throne, his sword <hi>Gods</hi> sword, his <hi>venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance Gods vengeance:</hi> no private man may <hi>revenge.</hi> The King sayes, White-Hall is mine, the Scepter and Crowne of England is mine; and shall any goe about to wring them out of his hands? The King of Kings sayes, <hi>vengeance is mine,</hi> and wilt thou wrest <hi>Gods</hi> sword out of his hand? Take heede how thou doest it, lest thou beest found <hi>a fighter against God.</hi> Say not, such a one hath angred mee, I will be <hi>even with him:</hi> ô saucy Merchant! wilt thou intrude thy selfe into <hi>Gods</hi> office?</p>
                  <p>The second branch of the testimony.</p>
                  <p>The greatest part of Interpreters are of opinion, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle alleadgeth this to his purpose indirectly, by the way of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. If <hi>God</hi> will bee <hi>avenged</hi> on the enemies of his people, much more on the enemies of his Sonne.</p>
                  <p>They thinke that <hi>to judge his people,</hi> is, <hi>to judge the enemies of his people for his peoples sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is alleadged directly: and <hi>to judge</hi> is put for <hi>to punish.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 7.3.</note> The <hi>Lord shall judge his owne people,</hi> even so many of them as revolt from him, the living <hi>God,</hi> to dumb and dead idols. That is the scope of the whole Chapter, as yee may see from <hi>Verse</hi> 15 to this place: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> citeth, <hi>Verse</hi> 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. to prove the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Iewes.</hi> Though they be <hi>his owne people,</hi> whom he hath honoured with the Word and Sacraments, that have given up their names to him, and taken upon them the profession of his holy truth: yet if they fall from him, he will <hi>severely punish them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore those men that have beene <hi>enlightned with the Spirit</hi> of grace, that have had CHRIST IESUS revealed to them, and yet <hi>contumeliously despise that spirit; count the bloud of the Testament a prophane thing,</hi> and tread the Sonne of <hi>God</hi> under their feete, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly they shall drinke deepely of the cup of <hi>Gods vengeance:</hi> for <hi>vengeance is Gods, and he will powre it in full measure on them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot bee denyed but that <hi>God</hi> is exceeding mercifull: <hi>his mercy reacheth to the clouds, is higher than the heavens: his mercy is over all his workes.</hi> There is not halfe a Psalme of <hi>Iustice:</hi> but an whole Psalme of his <hi>Mercy.</hi> The foote of that song is this, for <hi>his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever:</hi> yea he is the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>mercies:</hi> yet for all that, hee is <hi>just</hi> too. As <hi>mercy</hi> is his, so <hi>vengeance is his:</hi> he is <hi>a Iudge</hi> as well as <hi>a Father.</hi> As he is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:12681:221"/>
kind and beneficiall to his people, when they serve him: so he will <hi>judge his people,</hi> when they depart from him <hi>David</hi> said concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the government of his house and kingdome, <hi>I will sing of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Iudgement.</hi> Wee sing of <hi>Mercy,</hi> but we let <hi>Iudgement</hi> goe; like bad Musitions wee leave out one part of the song: wee harpe much on the string of <hi>Mercy,</hi> but we never meddle with the string of <hi>Iustice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though wee sweare, be drunken, commit adultery, steale se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly from our neighbours, though we make small reckoning of his word, raile on it and the Preachers too: yet <hi>God</hi> is <hi>mercifull, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive</hi> our sins.</p>
                  <p>I but remember likewise that <hi>vengeance is his,</hi> and <hi>he will judge, even his owne people:</hi> especially, if with an high hand they sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: <hi>hee will wound the hairie scalpe of them, that goe on in their sins.</hi> The Scripture records examples of <hi>Gods vengeance,</hi> as well as of <hi>Gods Mercie.</hi> He threw the Angels out of heaven, when they sinned: hee drowned the whole world for sinne: he rained fire and brimstone on <hi>Sodome</hi>; he made <hi>Iesabel</hi> a filthy adulteresse, though a Queene, to be <hi>cast out of a window and eaten up with dogs.</hi> If we <hi>know the truth,</hi> and make no conscience to <hi>live according to the truth:</hi> if we cause his Gospell to be blasphemed by our wicked lives: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee choake the truth revealed to us, set our selves against it, and <hi>maliciously despise the spirit of grace,</hi> whereby wee were in some measure sanctified, then the <hi>vengeance of</hi> GOD will light heavy on us. Therefore let us thinke as well on <hi>Gods Iustice,</hi> as on his <hi>Mercy.</hi>

                  <p>OVt of this divine testimony the Apostle inferreth a fruitfull conclusion, shewing what use we are to make of this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: it must cause us <hi>to feare God Almighty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An horrible thing! to fall</hi> suddenly, when we little thinke of it, and deepely too, <hi>into the wine presse of Gods wrath:</hi> so much the word doth import. Into what? <hi>into the hands of the living</hi> GOD. Why, <hi>God</hi> hath no <hi>hands:</hi> therefore we need <hi>not feare falling into them?</hi> True indeed, <hi>God</hi> hath no part or member of a body, as we have, for <hi>he is a spirit:</hi> yet for our capacitie, it is adscribed to him. By the <hi>hands of God</hi> in this place is meant, <hi>the wrath, power and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God Almighty.</hi> As a master sayes to his servant, take heede how you <hi>come into my hands</hi> againe: so <hi>it is a fearefull thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is this <hi>God? A living God,</hi> that <hi>lives</hi> for ever, not a dead and dumbe Idoll: therefore there is <hi>no escaping out of his hands, if we fall into them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better explication of it, know, that GOD hath two hands. The one is <hi>Manus protegens, into thy hands I commend my
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:12681:221" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spirit.</hi> It is a comfortable thing to <hi>fall into these hands.</hi> The other is <hi>manus puniens,</hi> and that is double; the one as he is <hi>Pater castigans,</hi> so <hi>David chose to fall into the hands of God:</hi> the other,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> as he is <hi>Iudex vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicans</hi>; and so <hi>it is a fearefull thing to fall into his hands. The wrath of a King,</hi> sayes <hi>Salomon, is as the roaring of a Lion:</hi> what is the wrath of the King of Kings? An earthly King may be appeased with rewards and requests: but his wrath, if he be once angry as a Iudge, cannot be appeased. Some by violence may snatch thee out of a <hi>Kings hand,</hi> which is stronger than he: none can deliver thee out of <hi>Gods hands:</hi> if thou beest his prisoner once, looke for no Gaole delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thou mayest run out of a Kings kingdome,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.39.</note> but there is no run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from GOD: <hi>whither shall I flye from thy presence?</hi> in any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the earth hee will finde thee out: yea though thou haddest wings to mount up into the heavens, he can fetch thee downe. An earthly King <hi>lives</hi> but for a time; at the length hee dyes: but GOD <hi>lives for ever.</hi> Therefore <hi>it is a fearefull thing to fall into his hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet men little consider this: they imagine it is nothing <hi>to fall into Gods hands.</hi> A servant had rather <hi>fall into Gods hands</hi> by making a lye, then into the <hi>hands</hi> of his master by speaking a truth. A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of desperate persons had rather <hi>fall into Gods hands</hi> by swearing and forswearing, then <hi>into the hands</hi> of an earthly judge. We make no account of <hi>Gods hands: tush God sees it not,</hi> or if he regard it, he is a kinde <hi>God,</hi> it makes no matter for <hi>falling into his hands:</hi> yet <hi>it is a fearefull thing:</hi> for though he beare long with thee in wonderfull patience and long suffering, yet he will make thee beare in the end. Therefore let us not wittingly and willingly <hi>fall into Gods hands,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially let us take heede how wee doe maliciously impugne the truth sealed up in our hearts and consciences by the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> let us beware, how we wage battell against CHRIST and despise him the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world: if by such a sinne wee <hi>fall into the hands of the Almighty</hi> GOD, there is no getting out of his <hi>hands</hi> againe.</p>

                     <hi>Faith</hi> is an excellent eye.

word: <hi>he commanded, and they were created: let there be a firmament, and there was one: let there be a Sea, birds; and it was so:</hi> only he pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and deliberated at the making of one creature, which was <hi>man,</hi> because he was to be his vicegerent, and a King over all creatures. By his omnipotent word all were made.</p>
                  <p>And of what was <hi>the world made:</hi> what timber, what stones had <hi>God</hi> to make this building withall? Surely nothing, yet hee <hi>made it.</hi> Not so much as any atomes: even <hi>materia prima</hi> was <hi>made of him:</hi> he found it not in the <hi>world</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>O mighty and puissant <hi>God!</hi> Let us all feare him that <hi>made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth.

                  <p>Now as <hi>the world</hi> was <hi>made,</hi> so it must have an end, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. therefore notwithstanding all the pleasure and wealth of this <hi>world, let us use it as if wee used it not: for the glory thereof fadeth away: they waxe old as doth a garment.</hi> Therefore let us lay up our treasures in a better <hi>world.</hi> From hence, the <hi>Iesuites</hi> make this collection, <hi>we must believe the world was made out of nothing,</hi> though wee doe not see it: so we must believe that the body of CHRIST is corporally in the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, though we cannot see it.</p>
                  <p>But, they might see there is a different reason. <hi>Wee believe the world was made of nothing,</hi> though we see it not, because the Word of <hi>God</hi> hath avouched it: <hi>God</hi>'s Word never teacheth us, that the body of CHRIST is in the Sacrament corporally, but in heaven: therefore there is no cause why we should believe it.</p>

                  <p>Externall sacrifices of Religion have beene practised by all in the lappe and bosome of the Church from the beginning of the world. <hi>Cain</hi> did not refuse <hi>to sacrifice,</hi> he offered <hi>a sacrifice,</hi> as his brother did: they therefore that contemne the exercises of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that will not come to church, offer up the sacrifice of prayse and prayer with the rest of their brethren, are worse than <hi>Caine.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Here wee see, that <hi>opus operatum</hi> is not sufficient. It is not enough to doe a good worke, which GOD requireth at our hands, but wee must performe it in such a manner, as the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth: we must not only doe <hi>bonum,</hi> but <hi>bono.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pharisee <hi>prayed</hi> in the Temple, and the Publican <hi>prayed:</hi>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:12681:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>prayer</hi> of the one was acceptable, of the other abominable. The Pharisees <hi>heard</hi> CHRIST preach, and many of the common people <hi>heard</hi> him preach: to the one it was <hi>the savour of life to life</hi>; to the other <hi>of death unto death. Simon Magus</hi> was baptised and gave up his name to CHRIST, and <hi>Lydia</hi> was baptised: the one sincerely, the other in Hypocrisie. <hi>Peter</hi> received the Passeover, and <hi>Iudas</hi> received it: to the one it was honey, to the other poyson. The Pharisees gave almes, and <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The one <hi>went up into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance before God:</hi> the other did not. So <hi>Cain sacrificed, and Abel sacrificed:</hi> yet GOD had respect to the one, not to the other.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we had need to beware with what minde and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we doe good things. It is not enough to come to Church, to professe CHRIST, to heare Sermons, to receive the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to offer up the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of thankesgiving with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: but wee must doe these things with a <hi>sincere heart: da mihi cor:</hi> not for fashion sake to be well thought of among men, to be counted devout and religious persons, but we must doe them in faith, to glorifie <hi>God</hi> withall.</p>
                  <p>Againe here it is apparent to us all, that <hi>God</hi> hath a care of his Children; even when they be dead: hee will revenge their bloud, and the injuries offered to them, when they be gone.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.2.</note> He remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred what <hi>Amaleck</hi> had done to <hi>Israel</hi> many yeeres after: the dogs licked up <hi>Iesabels</hi> bloud a good while after <hi>Naboth</hi> was slaine, Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem that killed the Prophets, and stoned them that were sent unto her, doth now drinke deepe of the cup of <hi>Gods</hi> vengeance. <hi>Abel</hi> was dead, his body raked up in the earth, yet his bloud spake, and <hi>God</hi> heard it, he set a brand of his indignation on <hi>Cain</hi> for it: therefore let us take heed how we offer any wrong to <hi>God</hi>'s Saints; especially how we imbrew our fingers in their bloud. Though they be dead, and no man living will follow the Law against us, yet <hi>God</hi> will proceede as a just Iudge against us. This should encourage us to serve such a loving and carefull Master, as GOD is: slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and waking, living and dying, he takes us under the wing of his protection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Enoch</hi> was adorned with many rare and excellent vertues: hee walked not after the course of the world in the broad way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to destruction; but in the streight path of <hi>Gods</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: he was full of prayers, of almes deeds, of fastings; yet his translation is adscribed to his <hi>faith. The just man lives by faith. Faith</hi> is the wing whereby wee must all flie into the kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Hee was taken from one place, and put into another; from earth, and placed in heaven.</p>
                  <p>The end. <hi>There is a time to be borne, and a time to dye. It is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all men once to dye. Enoch</hi> was a man, yet hee dyed not: hee had a birth day, but no dying day. Death is a separation of the soule from the body. <hi>Enoch</hi> in soule and body was taken up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into heaven: this was his priviledge: he escaped the axe of death, that cuts of all our heads.</p>
                  <p>For a proofe of it: <hi>he was not found</hi> in any place here upon the earth. It is like, that as some sought for <hi>Elias,</hi> when <hi>in a fierie char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret he was taken up into heaven,</hi> so some sought for <hi>Enoch</hi>; but <hi>he was no where to be found:</hi> a writ of <hi>non inventus</hi> was returned.</p>
                  <p>Who tooke him away? not the Devill; that (as some write) <hi>tooke away</hi> some of the Popes, but GOD Himselfe <hi>tooke him away.</hi> Why? For hee pleased GOD: for it is twise said of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.22, 24. that he walked with <hi>God:</hi> he was no man pleaser, but <hi>God</hi> pleaser.</p>
                  <p>The translation of <hi>Enoch</hi> is an intricate question, that hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised the heads of many Divines. Some are of opinion, that he was turned of a man into an Angell: but <hi>God</hi> makes no such meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoses. In the kingdome of heaven we shall be like Angels, but not Angels. The greatest part of the Hebrew <hi>Rabbins</hi> doe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily avouch, that <hi>Enoch</hi> dyed. The Hebrew phrases imply <hi>death. Enoch was taken away:</hi> and they that dye are <hi>taken away, Psal.</hi> 39. <hi>ult. Iob</hi> 32. <hi>ult. Ezek.</hi> 24. <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>taken away</hi> such a neighbour of ours. 2. <hi>Aenenu:</hi> he was not: so <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.36.</p>
                  <p>I but here the Spirit of GOD avoucheth in expresse words, making a Commentary of that in Genesis; that <hi>he did not see death:</hi> and if he had dyed as other men, <hi>Moses</hi> would have shut up his life with the same clause, that he did the rest. <hi>Enoch</hi> lived so long, and he dyed: therefore certainely he dyed not. Some maintaine this assertion, that <hi>Enoch</hi> is still alive together with <hi>Elias,</hi> they are kept by the providence of GOD in <hi>paradise:</hi> where either they eate of the fruites of the Garden, or live without meat miraculously, as <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and CHRIST did forty dayes together: then towards the end of the world these two witnesses shal come forth,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:12681:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shew themselves openly to all, encounter with Antichrist, convert the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and in the end shall be put to death. But I proceed:</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. So <hi>Enoch</hi> did not dye, yet he was changed, in soule and body, extraordinarily assumed in <hi>coelestem patriam,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> speaketh; yet not in <hi>coelestem gloriam:</hi> freed from the miseries of this life, yet not fully glorified. Some glory now they have, yet their full glory is now deferred; <hi>till we all meete together in a perfect man in Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is here registred as a singular honour, that God vouchsafed to <hi>Enoch,</hi> to <hi>take him away.</hi> They are sometimes deepest in GODS bookes, that are soonest <hi>taken out of this world,</hi> being fitted for it by GOD Almighty. We read of two, <hi>Trophenius</hi> and <hi>Agamedes,</hi> that having built a Temple to <hi>Apollos,</hi> required of the GOD such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as he thought to be best for men: he granted it, and within three dayes they were found dead. The best we read of in Scripture tarryed not long here. <hi>Iosias</hi> was taken away in the flower of his age: our Saviour CHRIST lived not past thirty foure yeeres: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Enoch</hi> pleased GOD, <hi>he tooke him away:</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being in the Mount said, <hi>it is good for us to be here:</hi> let us heere make our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles. So we say of the Mountaine of this world, <hi>it is good for us to be heere,</hi> ôh that we might make our Tabernacles heere! wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, it were best for us to be <hi>taken out of this wretched and sinful world,</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> was. Here we are with wicked and deceitfull men: there we shall be with Holy Angels: here we sin continually; there we shall cease sinning: heere we are subject to innumerable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; there <hi>all teares shall be wiped from our eyes.</hi> Let us desire God to prepare us for death, and then to <hi>take us away,</hi> when it shall seeme best to his heavenly will.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> out of these words <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. framed this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they that be in the flesh cannot please God. <hi>Married</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are in the flesh: <hi>ergo. Enoch</hi> was a <hi>maried</hi> man, he begat Sons and Daughters, yet he pleased God. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>Maried</hi> man, he had two Wives, and many Children, yet he pleased God; in so much as heaven is called <hi>the bosome of Abraham. Zachary</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> were <hi>Maried</hi> folkes: yet they pleased God, and walked in all his Commandements without reproofe. <hi>Spiridion</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> a <hi>Maried</hi> person, yet he protested, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. It is a propertie of <hi>faith</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> the word of <hi>God</hi>; though sense and reason cannot comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> had not a foresight and knowledge of the floud by Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall astrologie, as <hi>Berosus</hi> affirmed, by the influence of stars and conjunction of planets: he had it immediately from <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God</hi> gives <hi>warning</hi> of his judgements.</p>
                  <p>The other mooving cause was internall: hee did not count this a tale of a tub, some old wives fable, but he had a reverent regard of it: ô this is a fearefull punishment, which GOD will inflict on mankinde, yet undoubtedly it shall come to passe: <hi>hath hee said it, and shall he not doe it?</hi> Thus with a reverent <hi>feare</hi> he went to the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Arke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We <hi>feare</hi> neither <hi>God</hi> nor man.</p>
                  <p>As a <hi>goodly vessell appointed by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arca ab arcendo:</hi> because it kept away the waters from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to them.</p>
                  <p>There were three principall things commanded by GOD to bee <hi>made: the Tabernacle</hi> by <hi>Moses, the Temple</hi> by <hi>Salomon, the Arke</hi> by <hi>Noah. The Arke</hi> in sundry respects may bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other. 1. It was a making an hundred yeeres: none of them so long: this is probable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Noah</hi> was five hundred yeeres old before: then sixe hundred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was the preservation of all the world. 3. All creatures
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:12681:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
came into it of their owne accord, by the secret instigation of <hi>God</hi> Almighty. 4. Though they were of diverse kinds, some of a more fierce, some of a more mild disposition, yet they continued quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the <hi>Arke</hi> an whole yeere together: Lions, Beares, Lambes, Hawkes, Doves, Vultures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. It was guided not by any art or industrie of man, but by <hi>God</hi> Himselfe: there was no Pilot to sit at the Sterne, no Mast, no Sailes, no Rudders, but <hi>God</hi> by His unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providence, kept it from the violence of the waters.</p>
                  <p>The proper end is taken from the deluge to come, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. some of them were wicked men, yet they had that temporall salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the <hi>faith</hi> of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word <hi>(Arke)</hi> is nearer. 2. The <hi>Antithesis</hi> requires it. As <hi>he and his house-hold were saved</hi> by the <hi>Arke:</hi> So <hi>the world was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by it: he <hi>condemned</hi> it by his preaching, for 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and by his practise in <hi>making the Arke</hi> before the eyes of them all, which might have brought them to <hi>repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The commendation of his <hi>faith</hi> is by the fruit of it.</p>
                  <p>He was not a purchaser of <hi>this righteousnesse,</hi> but <hi>an heyre</hi> of it: he had it by an <hi>inheritance</hi> from the meere love and mercy of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not, which is <hi>by workes,</hi> but <hi>by faith:</hi> he had many excellent <hi>workes,</hi> he sequestred himselfe from the world, hee <hi>walked with God,</hi> he <hi>built the Arke,</hi> when the whole world laughed at him for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: yet the <hi>building of the Arke,</hi> nor any worke of his did make him <hi>righteous,</hi> these shewed him to be a <hi>righteous</hi> man: but it was his <hi>faith</hi> alone that made him a <hi>righteous</hi> man: yet this <hi>faith</hi> must have <hi>workes:</hi> as ye see in all these examples. They are all celebrated for some famous <hi>worke</hi> or other. That <hi>faith</hi> which brings forth the fruit of good <hi>workes</hi> makes us <hi>righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who <hi>made the Arke?</hi> here it is said that <hi>Noah prepared it,</hi> and <hi>Genesis</hi> 6.14. the conjunction is given to him alone. Some thinke it was <hi>made</hi> by him and his three sonnes alone: but there is no likelihood of that. It is very probable, that he got himselfe skilfull artificers to make it: who though they derided the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of the drowning of the world, yet for money they were content to be imployed in that worke. Some Carpenters, Masons, Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Glaziers may worke in the <hi>building</hi> of a Church for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of themselves, though they care not a halfe penny for a Church, and the service of <hi>God</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>Some made <hi>Noahs Arke,</hi> that were not saved in it: and many Ministers may <hi>prepare</hi> others for heaven, and never come thither themselves.</p>
                  <p>When was <hi>the floud?</hi> Most Authors thinke, in <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it might wholly be adscribed to the power of <hi>God,</hi> not any way to the course of nature, as it might, if it had beene in winter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the wicked of the world being drowned in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the earth might at that time of the yeere bee deprived of them, when the earth was most pleasant.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:12681:232"/>3. Because <hi>the floud</hi> began to dry up in the spring, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.23. as it was a faire sunne shine morning, when fire and brimstone fell from heaven on <hi>Sodom:</hi> so <hi>the floud</hi> might come in the fairest time of the yeare.</p>
                  <p>Whether were they all damned that perished in <hi>the floud?</hi> Some writers exempt infants: they had something answering to baptisme that saved them. The question is about <hi>adulti,</hi> whether all they were damned? <hi>Epiphan. Ambrose, Beda</hi> affirme that they went all to hell: yet when <hi>Christ</hi> came and preached in hell, they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: but in hell there is no Gaole delivery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Lyra</hi> say, that some of them went to hell: yet not <hi>ad locum damnatorum,</hi> but <hi>ad limbum patrum,</hi> out of which <hi>Christ</hi> fetched them, when he went to harrow hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                  <p>For mine owne opinion.</p>
                  <p>It is not like they were all damned: yet that reason of Saint <hi>Ieromes</hi> is not convincing, <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.9. following the Seventie he translates it, <hi>non vindicabit Deus bis in idipsum:</hi> whereas in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew it is, it shall crush them at the first time, there shall be no need of a second blow: <hi>God</hi> may justly punish, both in this life and in the life to come, one and the same fault, that hath not beene washed away with repentance.</p>
                  <p>But three reasons may induce us so to thinke.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.22. <hi>the floud</hi> was a prevailing fortie dayes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nights. Some that were hardned before, at the sight of the waters, running up into some high mountaines, might repent of their folly, and their soules might be saved: <hi>inter pontem &amp; fontem est misericordia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who dares avouch that they were all damned, that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed in the wildernesse? that all went to hell, whom the earth swallowed up in the conspiracie of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram?</hi> and why should we affirme them to be al damned that were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>the floud?</hi> wee must judge more charitably of them, that are swept away in temporall plagues and calamities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us judge our selves, which is the strongest. As they were not all saved that were in <hi>the Arke: Cham</hi> was a cursed wretch: so were they not all damned that were carryed away with the waters.</p>
                  <p>By his framing of the <hi>Arke</hi> before the eyes of them all, and his preaching to them of the <hi>floud,</hi> the LORD might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter by vertue thereof to proceed to the just condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them all.</p>
                  <p>Or the word <hi>(world)</hi> is here taken for the <hi>wicked of the world,</hi> as oft in Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. I pray not for the <hi>world: he brought in the floud upon the world of the ungodly,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>warning</hi> was not for <hi>Noe</hi> alone, but for all <hi>the world,</hi> that seeing the Arke a making they might repent. This is the goodnesse of <hi>God</hi> Almighty, he gives <hi>warning</hi> of his judgements before they come: hee shoots off a <hi>warning peece:</hi> not like austere masters, who
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:12681:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
strike before they speake; but herein he is like the Lion, that roares before he goes to his prey.</p>
                  <p>He gave a <hi>warning</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that <hi>at what time they did eate of that fruit, they should die:</hi> he gave <hi>warning</hi> of the destruction of <hi>Sodom; Lots</hi> sonnes had <hi>warning</hi> to goe their way, if they would have lystened to it: he gave the <hi>Israelites warning</hi> of the captivitie in Babylon; Hierusalem had <hi>warning</hi> of her overthrow: <hi>Christ</hi> wept over it, and said; <hi>O if thou haddest knowne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 19.42.</note> 
                     <hi>at the least in this thy day those things which belong unto thy peace! but now are they hid from thine eyes. God</hi> gave the <hi>Ninevites warning,</hi> of their destruction, that it was at hand. The old <hi>world</hi> had a faire <hi>warning</hi> of <hi>the floud:</hi> they were <hi>warned</hi> of it an hundred yeares together. This is <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, he doth nothing but he reveales it to his Prophets, that they might open it to the people. At this day, <hi>God</hi> gives us many <hi>warnings,</hi> by his Word and creatures: by earth-quakes, thundring and lightning, by blazing starres and fierie comets: as wee have had a fearefull one of late yeeres, continuing in some places of the land a moneth together, portending wars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us not stand in a slavish feare of them, <hi>God</hi> is above them all: yet let them be as trumpets to waken us out of sinne. <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>warned</hi> us by his Ambassadours and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Word: we have had <hi>warning,</hi> that if we loath the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Manna of the Word, God</hi> will take it from us; if we receive it not with all gladnesse when it is put into our mouthes, we shall goe from East to West and not finde it; yet this <hi>warning</hi> doth us little good; for all that, we are not diligent and cheerefull in hearing of Sermons and in the participation of other holy rites: we have had <hi>warning</hi> of Adultery, Theft, oppression, cruelty, of coozning one another, that there is a <hi>God</hi> that sees all, and wil revenge all, yet these sinnes are ryfe among us. As the <hi>old world</hi> had <hi>warning</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of it by water, so we have beene <hi>warned</hi> of the destruction of it by fire: almost all the signes of the day of Iudgement are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past; yet we feare not that day, neither prepare for it. All these <hi>warnings,</hi> because we have not profited by them, shall bee so many witnesses against us at the latter day. <hi>Praemonitus praemunitus:</hi> but our hearts are so hardned, as that all the <hi>warnings</hi> in the world will doe us no good. We are angrie with our servants, if they will take no <hi>warning</hi>; did not I <hi>warne</hi> thee of such a thing: and then wee thinke we have just cause to be on his jacket: how many thousand <hi>warnings</hi> hath <hi>God</hi> given us? and yet we, like bad servants will take no <hi>warning?</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> soften our hearts, that they may enter into us, for the reformation of our lives.</p>
                  <p>Of what was hee <hi>warned?</hi> In themselves they could not bee <hi>seene:</hi> yet <hi>Noah saw</hi> them by the <hi>eye of faith.</hi> The incarnation and passion of our SAVIOUR CHRIST could not be <hi>seene</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> because CHRIST was not then borne: yet <hi>Abraham saw it by faith and was glad.</hi> Neither Heaven nor Hell can be <hi>seene</hi> of us: yet <hi>by faith we see</hi> them, and believe them both. That terrible day, when <hi>the world shall passe away with a noise</hi>—cannot
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:12681:233"/>
yet be <hi>seene:</hi> yet being <hi>warned</hi> by <hi>God</hi> of it, we <hi>behold</hi> it, and know assuredlie it shall be.</p>
                  <p>The resurrection is not yet <hi>seene,</hi> wee doe not <hi>see</hi> the dead rise out of their graves: yet because GOD hath said it, we <hi>believe</hi> it. The proper object of faith are <hi>invisibilia</hi>; as for those things which we <hi>see,</hi> properlie to speake, wee doe not <hi>believe:</hi> when wee shall <hi>see</hi> CHRIST our blessed SAVIOUR in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then <hi>faith</hi> is turned into fruition: but there is singular use of it in this world: and let us entreat the <hi>Lord</hi> to make bright the <hi>eye of our faith</hi> daily more and more, that with <hi>Noah</hi> wee may <hi>see</hi> the things that are not yet <hi>seene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What entertainment did <hi>Noah</hi> give to this <hi>warning?</hi> did hee contemne it or set light by it in his heart? no verily: he <hi>reverenced</hi> it. Wee must <hi>reverence</hi> the judgements of GOD. When <hi>Daniel</hi> pondered in himselfe the fearefull fall of <hi>Nebucadnezar,</hi> that such a faire and beautifull tree which reached to heaven should bee cut downe, <hi>he held his peace by the space of one houre, and his thoughts troubled him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.16.</note> When the Angels were to blow their trumpets, there was si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in heaven,<note place="margin">Apoc. 8.1.</note> they were stricken with a kinde of astonishment and could not speake. When the booke of the Law was read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iosiah, his heart melted</hi> at it, he <hi>reverenced</hi> the judgement denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in it. When this proclamation was made in <hi>Nineveh, yet fortie dayes, and Nineveh shall be destroyed:</hi> they all <hi>reverenced</hi> it, from the King to the beggar, &amp;c. <hi>they put on sackcloth, fasted, and prayed to</hi> GOD. <hi>Noah</hi> hearing of a <hi>floud</hi> to come, <hi>feares</hi> it after a godly manner, and provides against the comming of it. But some there be that are no more moved with them then the stones in the Church-wall, <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.24. yet were not they afraid, <hi>&amp;c. When Paul prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of the resurrection and of the day of judgement, some in Athens mocked at it:</hi> and <hi>Lots sonnes laughed at the destruction of Sodom</hi> that was at hand. Let the Preacher thunder out GODS judgements against abhominable swearing, lying, flattering and dissembling, and other sinnes that reigne among the people; some laugh at it in their sleeves: tell them of the day of judgement, when as all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall appeare before the sonne of man; they set not a straw by it, they are worse then <hi>Felix; he trembled when</hi> Saint <hi>Paul discoursed of righteousnesse and the judgement to come:</hi> they are worse than the Devills, for they <hi>believe that there is a</hi> GOD, <hi>and tremble at it.</hi> There is great difference betweene <hi>trembling and reverencing.</hi> The wicked that have no portion in CHRIST <hi>tremble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 6.16.</note> they <hi>cry to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and rockes, fall on us,</hi> &amp;c. but the holiest men of all must <hi>feare and reverence</hi> the judgements of <hi>God,</hi> and we must prepare our selves for the avoyding of them, as <hi>Noah</hi> did. <hi>Doth the Lion roare, and shall not the beasts of the forrest quake?</hi> Doth GOD Almighty roare, doth he threaten, and shall we be mooved with no <hi>reverence?</hi> as <hi>Noah reverenced</hi> the comming of <hi>the floud,</hi> so let us <hi>reverence</hi> all the plagues that are denounced by <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What doth <hi>Noe</hi> in this his <hi>feare?</hi> hee is not as a man amazed
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:12681:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and besides himselfe, but as GOD had commanded him, he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Arke:</hi> he doth not reason with flesh and bloud; surely this may be but a scare-crow, there is no such inundation to come, God will not bee so unmercifull as to destroy all that hee hath made: as for the <hi>Arke,</hi> it must be very large to be a receptacle of all kind of creatures, an hard and difficult thing to make such a Vessell; when it is made, how shall I and my family be preserved in it? a thousand to one but wee shall be drowned: hee admits no such consultation. But knowing from GODS owne mouth there was <hi>a flood</hi> to come, <hi>he prepares an Arke, for the saving of him and his. Faith</hi> must leape over all difficulties, all stumbling blockes that lye in the way: if <hi>God</hi> have sayd a thing, let us <hi>beleeve it,</hi> though all the world seeme to be against it. GOD hath said, there is a <hi>Iudgement</hi> to come, let us all <hi>prepare</hi> for it, as <hi>Noah</hi> did for the flood. The old world <hi>prepared,</hi> and <hi>Noah prepared:</hi> they <hi>prepared</hi> by building of houses, planting of Vinyards: So we <hi>prepare</hi> for the world, but not to meete GOD by repentance. <hi>Noah prepared an Arke for the saving of himselfe,</hi> and let us <hi>prepare the Arke of a good conscience, for the saving of our selves</hi> at that day.</p>
                  <p>When it is said, <hi>he prepared the Arke,</hi> it is not to be imagined, that he wrought it with his owne hands: he was a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and it is not like he could play the Carpenter, or shipwright. They may be like the Bell in the Steeple that calls others to the Sermon, but hath no benefit of it itself: they may build up others, yet be unbuilt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Therefore it shall be good for us to <hi>preach</hi> to our selves, as well as to the people: lest <hi>while we preach to others, we our selves be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He provided all things</hi> for it: Wood, Pitch, Nailes, <hi>made it after the forme God had prescribed,</hi> with many severall Roomes in it.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Arke</hi> in the judgement of all interpreters, was a type of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Arke</hi> was made after <hi>Gods appointment,</hi> not after <hi>Noahs.</hi> So the Church must be framed by GOD<hi>'s Will,</hi> and not by mans.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All were drowned that were not in the <hi>Arke:</hi> so all (regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly) are damned, that are not in the Catholike Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Arke</hi> was neere drowning, yet never drowned; it was miraculously preserved by <hi>God</hi>: So the Church may be brought to a low ebbe, yet it shall continue still.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There was in <hi>the Arke</hi> good and bad, cleane and uncleane: so wee must never dreame to have all holy and sanctified persons that be in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In <hi>the Arke</hi> there were diverse mansions, and roomes; some for men, some for beasts: so in the Church, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.2. In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house there are many dwelling places.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The Arke</hi> had but a few in it, eight persons, yet there was the Church.</p>
                  <p>Vniversalitie is no necessary note of a Church. <hi>Christ</hi>'s flocke is but <hi>a little flocke.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:12681:234"/>Here we see what a priviledge it is to be of the household of a godly man, that may bee as a Sanctuary to thee from temporall plagues and judgements. <hi>All that were in the ship were saved for</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls sake, God gave him the soules of them all. Noahs</hi> family was <hi>preserved</hi> for his sake: because cursed <hi>Cham</hi> was of this house-hold, he was <hi>saved. Potiphars house was blessed for Iosephs sake, Gen.</hi> 39.5. Strive to bee of the house-hold of a man that feareth <hi>God,</hi> that shall be a shelter to thee from earthly punishments, thou shalt fare the better in the world for that. There is much contending, much suit made to bee in the house of a rich man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they bee godly and religious men too, as many are, it is well: but thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest better bee in the house of a godly poore man, who is deepe in <hi>Gods</hi> books, then in the house of a wealthy and wicked <hi>Nabal.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be one of <hi>Noahs house-hold.</hi>

                     <hi>Noe</hi> and his family were saved in the <hi>Arke</hi>; yet with much a doe: they endured much, they were in continuall danger: they passed through many difficulties, the smell of beasts, the <hi>Arke</hi> ready to rush on rockes and mountaines. So the Children of <hi>God</hi> shall bee saved, yet through many tribulations, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7.14. Wee must looke to be tossed with the waves of many afflictions before we come to the kingdome of heaven: but let us bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the middest of them all. The <hi>Arke</hi> was hoysed, but not drowned: so though we be afflicted, yet we shall not perish. <hi>God</hi> kept the <hi>Arke</hi> by the hand of his providence: and so will he us too. Hee that hath loved us will love us to the end, and will keepe us to his everlasting kingdome: the gates of hell may <hi>availe,</hi> but shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>prevaile</hi> against the <hi>Church.</hi> GOD in all extremities <hi>prepareth</hi> for his Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.30. he <hi>prepared</hi> a place in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for his Church in the time of famine: he <hi>prepared Pharaohs</hi> daughter, and drew her to the river, to save <hi>Moses</hi> from drowning: he <hi>prepared</hi> a Whale to receive <hi>Ionah,</hi> as soone as he was cast out of the ship, and caused him within three dayes to set him safe on the dry land: hee <hi>prepared Pella</hi> for the <hi>Iewes</hi> unto which they fled and escaped the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Romans:</hi>

                     </note> he <hi>prepared</hi> an <hi>Arke</hi> by the hands of <hi>Noah,</hi> for the saving of him and his house-hold. Let us be thankfull unto him, and depend on him.</p>
                  <p>There be many things that <hi>condemne</hi> a thiefe. The Iudge <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes</hi> him, hee gives sentence against him: the evidence <hi>condemnes</hi> him, and the witnesses <hi>condemne</hi> him; but the chiefest of all is his owne sinne, the theft which he hath committed. So many concurre in the <hi>condemnation</hi> of a wicked man. <hi>God condemnes</hi> him as a just Iudge: his conscience brings in evidence against him and <hi>condemnes</hi> him: the holy and righteous men that have shined as Starres among them, <hi>condemne</hi> them: but the greatest of all is their owne sin. The Queene of the South shall <hi>condemne</hi> the <hi>Israelites. She came from the uttermost parts of the earth to heare the wisedome of Solomon.</hi> They had <hi>Solomon</hi> at home, and regarded not the hearing of him. The <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> shall <hi>condemne</hi> them: they <hi>repented</hi> at the preaching of one

                     <hi>Ionah.</hi> The <hi>Iewes repented</hi> not at the preaching of many <hi>Ionahs.</hi> The Scripture shall <hi>condemne</hi> us: <hi>there is one that judgeth you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.45, 12.48.</note> 
                     <hi>even Moses in whom yee trust.</hi> The plentifull preaching of the Gospell, and the small reckoning that is made of it shall <hi>condemne</hi> us. <hi>Noah con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> the world: and our <hi>Noahs</hi> shall <hi>condemne</hi> us, if wee regard them not. We for our parts had rather save you then <hi>condemne</hi> you. Therefore <hi>receive with meekenesse the engraffed Word,</hi> that by it yee may be saved in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>The good actions of godly men that were as reall Sermons to preach to the wicked, shall <hi>condemne</hi> them at the latter day. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unspotted life of <hi>Lot</hi> that vexed his righteous soule in <hi>Sodom</hi> shall <hi>condemne</hi> the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> The Synagogue set up by the <hi>Centurion</hi> shall <hi>condemne</hi> those miserable wretches that will give nothing to good uses: the continuall praying of <hi>Annah,</hi> them that never pray: The garments that <hi>Dorcas</hi> made for poore widdowes, them, that except Law compell them, will give nothing to the poore: the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of a good Scholler, shall <hi>condemne</hi> all the loytering Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us profit by these examples: let them be as spurs to pricke us forward to the practise of those good things which we see in them, especially in the Preachers of the word, such as <hi>Noah</hi> was. If we contemne their preaching, it shall rise up in condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against us in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith,</hi> as yee see makes us heyres, not of silver and gold, houses and lands, mannours and Lordships, but of the righteousnesse of <hi>Christ,</hi> by whom wee have a right to all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. Wee thinke highly of one that is heyre to a great Gentleman, a Knight, a Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There comes such a Noblemans heyre. I but poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> that believes in <hi>Christ</hi> is in better estate than he, if he want <hi>faith.</hi> Therefore let us pray to <hi>God</hi> for <hi>faith,</hi> that may assure us of the inheritance of the kingdome of heaven, which surpasseth all the inheritances in the world.</p>
                  <p>And what manner of <hi>faith</hi> is it that makes us heyres of this kingdome? not a <hi>verball faith,</hi> that hath nothing but faire words, and a glorious profession, like the figge tree; but a <hi>working faith,</hi> such a <hi>faith as worketh by love,</hi> that is full of <hi>good workes,</hi> as <hi>Dorcas</hi> was. All these that be in this Catalogue had <hi>workes</hi> for the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their <hi>faith. Abel</hi> had his sacrifice. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with <hi>God. Noah</hi> had the building of the <hi>Arke, Abraham</hi> the offering of his Sonne, <hi>Moses</hi> the leaving of <hi>Aegypt, Rahab</hi> the preservation of the spies. None of them but had <hi>workes.</hi> Therfore if we say we have <hi>faith,</hi> and have not <hi>workes,</hi> wee deceive our selves. Let us <hi>shew our faith by our workes,</hi> make up our calling and election sure by them; then we are heyres of the blessed inheritance reserved for the Saints in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>WE have had the <hi>faithfull</hi> before <hi>the floud.</hi> Now, to them after <hi>the floud,</hi> before the possession of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and after.</p>
                  <p>The first is <hi>Abraham,</hi> who because he was the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> entreating of <hi>faith</hi> he is more plentifull in him.</p>
                  <p>Here are three things for the celebration of his faith: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe, his Wife and his Sonne.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His obedience to GOD calling him out of his owne Country.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His patient abode in a strange Country, whereunto hee was called. Or,
<list>
                        <item>1. His egresse out of a Country, which he knew.</item>
                        <item>2. His progresse to a Country which he knew not.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vulgar translation hath it, <hi>hee that is called Abraham,</hi> which before was <hi>Abram.</hi> At the first hee was called <hi>Ab—ram, Pater excelsus:</hi> now <hi>Abraham, Ab rab gnam, the Father of many Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That dreadfull name of GOD, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> hath two <hi>Hehs</hi> in it. GOD, say some, gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a letter of his owne name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause GOD was to come of his loines: for our SAVIOUR CHRIST, who is GOD above all, blessed for ever, was of the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> that is somewhat too curious. The change of his name did signifie that hee was <hi>a great man,</hi> highly esteemed of GOD, and worthy to bee honoured of men. The <hi>Iewes</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of him as of their Father: therefore above all others hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth him as an example of <hi>faith,</hi> that they his Children might tread in his steps. He was of great fame among the heathen, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> writeth, many ancient Historiographers make an honourable mention of him. <hi>Berosus, Damascenus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>went</hi> not of his own head upon an idle and phantasticall brain, he had a calling so to doe, whereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. that was his warrant, his passeport and licence to travell withall. If all travellours had this calling, they might be secure in their <hi>journeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some <hi>goe</hi> into strange countries in a male contended minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many things crosse them at home. Some, because they cannot live at home, some to see fashions, for the satisfying of a carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: these cannot so well looke for <hi>Gods</hi> protection. If thou <hi>goest</hi> upon <hi>Gods</hi> calling, behold he will support thee in thy <hi>going.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every word in this calling might be as a dagger to the heart of <hi>Abraham. Out of thy Country, kindred,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>Abraham</hi> did not draw the necke out of the collar, he <hi>obeyed God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>obedience</hi> is illustrated by the place from whence he went: <hi>from his owne Country:</hi> and by <hi>the place to the which he went.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He went, tam animo, quàm corpore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:12681:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>But at this time when hee was <hi>called,</hi> hee had no inheritance in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a blind man, that cannot tell where he <hi>goes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> told him he would shew it him: but as yet he had not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: when GOD <hi>called</hi> him, hee knew neither the name of the place, nor the Scituation of it.</p>
                  <p>This was a mervailous exercise of his <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A mans native country is sweet and pleasant to all: <hi>nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos ducit, &amp; immemores non sinit esse sui. Vlysses</hi> was very desirous to see the smoake of his <hi>country.</hi> Shall I leave my <hi>Country,</hi> that hath beene as a mother to bring mee into the world and to nourish mee in it? A man in conscience, by the Law of nature is bound to his owne <hi>country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here I am among my <hi>kinsfolke and acquaintance:</hi> there I shall bee among strangers, as an Owle among birds, to bee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here I have plenty of all things: I know not what I shall finde there. A bird in the hand is better then two in the bush.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This <hi>Country</hi> I know: that I know not, <hi>God</hi> hath not revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mee so much as the name of it: and shall I <hi>goe</hi> to it? nay, soft a while, it is good tarrying in mine owne rest.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Here I may <hi>goe</hi> up and downe quietly: In my travelling I shall meet with many dangers. Therefore it is good sleeping in an whole skinne. Shall I <hi>obey</hi> this vision? I will not doe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> admits of none of these consultations: but <hi>obeys God calling</hi> him. I am sure my <hi>God</hi> is able to keepe me in what corner of the world soever I am: for all the world is his: and I am sure hee will keep me; for he loves me, as the <hi>apple of his own eye.</hi> Therfore come on it what will, I will <hi>obey Gods calling.</hi> O admirable <hi>faith!</hi> without <hi>faith</hi> he could never have done it. Let us leave all, if <hi>God calls</hi> us to it. It is not simply unlawfull to travell. GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands no unlawfull thing. He commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to travell. It is not necessary a man should bee like a Snayle, alwayes carrying his house on his backe: that becomes a woman rather than a man. There is a time, when a man may leave his owne <hi>Country,</hi> and travell into strange <hi>Countries</hi>; yet great circumspection is to be had in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A man must be <hi>called</hi> to it: wee must doe nothing without a <hi>calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not as if every one should expect such a <hi>calling,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, by <hi>Gods</hi> immediate voice. We have our <hi>callings,</hi> but mediate. If a man be employed in an Ambassadge to a forrein Prince, he hath a <hi>calling</hi> to leave his <hi>Country</hi> for a time. If a man cannot live in his owne <hi>Country,</hi> and can more conveniently maintaine himselfe and his charge in another, he may <hi>goe</hi> to it, so as he make not shipwracke of Religion. If a man abound in wealth, and be desirous of tongues, arts and sciences in another <hi>Country:</hi> he hath a <hi>calling</hi> to it. <hi>Et sic in reliquis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:12681:236"/>2. Wee must take heede, that our families in the meane season be not neglected: <hi>he that careth not for them of his house, is worse than an infidell.</hi> A man under pretext of travelling, may not runne away from his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee must have no sinister respect in it. <hi>Dinahs</hi> gadding abroad lost her her Virginity. We must not make <hi>travelling</hi> a cloake to cover theft, murder, adultery, and other grosse and notorious vices. <hi>God</hi> can finde us out in all places: for <hi>whither shall we flye from his presence?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We must not imagine our <hi>travelling</hi> to be meritorious, as pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages were in former times: they should merit heaven by going to the holy land, by visiting the Sepulcher at Hierusalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when wee have <hi>gone</hi> all the world over, wee are <hi>unprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Let</hi> us take heed in <hi>travelling,</hi> that wee <hi>travell</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way faith and good conscience: wheresoever we become, let us keepe our selves undefiled of the superstitions and corruptions that be in other <hi>countries.</hi> Let us keepe our religion safe and sound, that the least cracke be not found in it. Wee make a faire <hi>travelling,</hi> if wee <hi>travell</hi> in the Devils cloakes. A great sort of young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rashly and unadvisedly, by <hi>travelling</hi> are like the Scribes and Pharises: <hi>they compassed Sea and land, to make a proselyte; and when they had made him, they made him threefold more the child of the Devill:</hi> so they <hi>by their travelling make themselves threefold more the Children of the Devill,</hi> greater swearers and blasphemers, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and adulterers, then they were before. They went out Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and come home Papists: they went out religious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne Atheists. <hi>Travelling</hi> is a dangerous thing. Let us not take it on us, unlesse wee bee some way or other called to it, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>went</hi> not alone: he carryed his old father, his nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> and it is like, sundry others, whose names particularly are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. No doubt, for the world, he was exceeding well in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea:</hi> it is very like hee had a convenient house to dwell in, sweete Gardens, and pleasant Orchards, droves of Cattell and flockes of Sheepe, great store of pastures and arable grounds about his house, faire household stuffe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Would it not grieve a man to part with all these, and to goe he knew not whither? yet <hi>Abraham</hi> leaves all at GODS <hi>appointment:</hi> so must we all doe. We must tread in the steps of our father <hi>Abraham.</hi> We in England, <hi>God</hi> be thanked, are well seated; by report of travellers it is one of the fattest ylands on the earth: here wee live quietly under the reigne of a religious King, wee have all things fit and convenient about us: yet if <hi>God</hi> should <hi>call</hi> us out of our owne <hi>Country,</hi> let us be content to forsake all, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. We are tenants at will, <hi>ad voluntatem domini:</hi> all that wee have is at <hi>Gods</hi> disposition, and let him dispose of us where it pleaseth him. If we leave all at <hi>Gods appointment,</hi> wee are no loosers by it: we shall have <hi>an hundred fold, even in this world:
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:12681:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in the world to come life everlasting. Abraham</hi> was a great gainer by his going out of his Country, <hi>God</hi> made him a great man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: he was able with his owne household servants to wage bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with five Kings, and conquered them. <hi>God</hi> blessed him with abundance of Gold and Silver, Sheep, Camels, Oxen, <hi>&amp;c. Hesters</hi> banishment was an occasion of a kingdome to her: and some have lived better in exile, then in their owne countrey, as <hi>Themistocles.</hi> Howsoever <hi>God</hi> dealeth with us in this world, wee shall have an abundant recompence in the life to come: therefore let us goe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>How did he abide in this <hi>land?</hi> not as a Lord and master in it, but as a stranger: it was a <hi>strange Country</hi> to him, he had no house, no land in it, no not the breadth of a foot: hee was faine to buy a piece of ground to bury his Wife in.

It was wont to be said, golden Chalices and wooden Priests! so now a dayes it may bee said, golden houses, wooden house keepers; a great house, a large house, yet little meat in it. It may be sufficient for themselves: stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nay neighbours seldome drinke of their cup: a great sort of brave chimneys, but little smoake in them: many a Noble mans house, scant smoakes once in a yeere. <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Captaine had no stately house, yet his almes were great. <hi>Gaius</hi> had no glorious house: yet an hoast to the whole Church: wheresoever we dwell, though in a <hi>Tent</hi> or <hi>booth,</hi> yet let us doe good with that which wee have, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; our house shall be the better blessed for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham dwelt in a Tent,</hi> yet GOD protected him from all enemies and dangers. Wee never read that thieves brake into his <hi>Tent</hi> and spoyled him, of that which he had. In a tempest, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and lightning, the <hi>Tent</hi> was not set on fire. It is better to bee in a poore cottage under <hi>Gods</hi> wing, than in a magnificent Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace without his favour. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> dwelt in a sumptuous building, yet hee got a fall that cost him his life. <hi>Michah</hi> had a strong house: yet the <hi>Danites</hi> came and tooke all in his house.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lot</hi> had an house in <hi>Sodom; Abraham</hi> had but a <hi>Tent:</hi> yet <hi>Abraham</hi> was safer in his <hi>Tent,</hi> then <hi>Lot</hi> in his house. GOD kept <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>Lions denne,</hi> the three Children in the <hi>fiery furnace, Ionah</hi> in the <hi>Whales belly:</hi> hee preserved <hi>Abraham</hi> in his <hi>Tent:</hi> and hee will for ever keepe his Children in the meanest Cottage in the world.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his <hi>dwelling</hi> in the land of promise is illustrated by his <hi>companions:</hi> not he alone, but <hi>Isaac and Iacob.</hi> Whether he and they dwelt together in <hi>Tents</hi> at the same time, cannot bee defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If wee respect <hi>Abrahams</hi> age, they might: for hee lived after <hi>Isaac</hi> was borne seventy five yeeres, and after <hi>Iacob</hi> was borne fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres; yet whether that be the meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> or not, I dare not affirme: they in their time dwelt in <hi>Tents,</hi> as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did in his time, because the promise was made to them all: to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his feed. They were intailed in the promised land with their father.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Canaanites</hi> had Cities and beautifull houses to dwell in. <hi>Abraham Isaac and Iacob dwelt in Tents:</hi> the wicked may have fairer <hi>dwellings</hi> in this world, then the godly.</p>
                  <p>Now wee have sumptuous and magnificent buildings: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the floud they erected a Tower, the height whereof reached to heaven. <hi>The Canaanites had townes and Cities that were walled up to heaven. Ahab had his Ivory pallace, Nebuchadnezar his stately Babel.</hi> There are many gay buildings in all places: but as CHRIST said of marriage, <hi>from the beginning it was not so.</hi> What manner of <hi>house did Adam and Eve dwell in? Abraham, Isaac and Iacob?</hi> these worthy and renowned Patriarcks dwelt in <hi>Tents:</hi>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:12681:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and incommemoration hereof there was instituted among the <hi>Iewes a feast of Tents and Tabernacles,</hi> which was kept with great solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; by the space of seven dayes, they sate in Boothes. Let us not be too carefull, nor too curious about our <hi>dwellings.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 8.17.</note> Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of all, <hi>had not an house to hide his head in:</hi> at his dying day he commended his mother to Saint <hi>Iohn, who tooke her home to his house.</hi> There is as free a passage to heaven out of a <hi>poore beggarly Cottage,</hi> as out of <hi>a Kings Pallace.</hi> Let us not spend too much cost about our <hi>earthly houses,</hi> but labour to build up our selves as <hi>houses to God</hi> in this life, that when we must remove out of <hi>these buildings,</hi> be they greater or lesser, we may be received up into <hi>that house that is made without hands,</hi> in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>GOD doth not immediately performe his promises: hee will exercise our <hi>faith and patience</hi> in the expectation of them. This <hi>land</hi> was <hi>Abrahams</hi> now by promise, yet <hi>his seed</hi> had not the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it many hundred yeares after: yet <hi>Abraham by faith wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it: he that believeth will not make hast.</hi> Wee must not be too <hi>hasty,</hi> but <hi>tarry Gods leysure.</hi> So the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> the kingdome of heaven, is ours by promise: <hi>feare not little flocke, it is your Fathers pleasure to give you the kingdome:</hi> yet we must passe through many tribulations into this kingdome. Let us with <hi>patience</hi> beare them all, and at the length, though it be at a <hi>long runne</hi> first, wee shall bee sure to be partakers of it: for <hi>heaven and earth shall passe, but not one title of Gods Word shall fall to the ground.</hi>

                  <p>And why? what was the cause of it? <hi>because she judged him faithfull,</hi> &amp;c. this <hi>Lyra</hi> referres to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

                     <hi>because he judged</hi>—as for <hi>Sarah, she laughed at it,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> thought it an incredible thing: yet it may be adscribed to <hi>Sarah</hi> her selfe: as for <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is not mentioned at all in this verse.</p>

                  <p>How then is it true, that <hi>Shee judged him faithfull who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised?</hi> At the first she doubted and derided it: but afterwards being reprehended by GOD, better instructed by her husband and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in her mind, that it was GOD Almighty which had spoken it, she believed it, and <hi>judged him faithfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that hath <hi>promised</hi> me a child is able to fulfill his <hi>promise: faithfull to performe</hi> that, which he hath promised: therfore though I be <hi>barren</hi> and <hi>old</hi> too, I shall have a child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.6, 7.</p>

                  <p>CHRIST the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world was <hi>promised</hi> to them, that he should come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed: but as yet he was not come, the kingdome of heaven whereof the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type, was <hi>promised</hi> to them: but as yet, they <hi>received it not:</hi> yet they <hi>believed</hi> certainely that they should have them, and <hi>dyed in that faith.</hi>

which is faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> in the birth of <hi>Isaac saw</hi> CHRIST. <hi>In thy seed,</hi> that is, in CHRIST, <hi>shall all nations be blessed.

                  <p>So the <hi>Israelites</hi> afterwards <hi>saw</hi> CHRIST afarre off in the Paschall Lamb, and the rest of the sacrifices: but <hi>blessed are our eyes</hi>— wee as yet <hi>see</hi> the kingdome of heaven, but <hi>afarre off</hi>; but one day we shall <hi>see God face to face.</hi>

                     <hi>there is no man living, but shall see death.</hi> Wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> godly <hi>David</hi> that was a man after <hi>Gods</hi> owne heart, is <hi>dead:</hi> strong <hi>Samson,</hi> faire <hi>Absalom,</hi> wealthy <hi>Nabal</hi> is <hi>dead. Lazarus dyed,</hi> and the rich man also <hi>dyed,</hi> and was buryed. Beggars <hi>dye,</hi> and Kings <hi>dye. Have I not said, yee are Gods? yet yee shall dye as men.</hi> It is well observed by Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> that it fell out by the providence of GOD, that the verb <hi>morior</hi> should not be declined after the same manner, that other verbs of that kinde be: <hi>orior ortus est: morior mortuus est,</hi> to declare that <hi>death</hi> signified by it, cannot be declined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mors non cogitur abesse, sed cogitur non obesse. Death</hi> cannot hurt the godly, it is rather a benefit to them: yet they <hi>dye.</hi> This we can all say, nothing so certaine as <hi>Death</hi>; yet we make no use of it: for all that, we bathe our selves in the pleasures of sin, we are set on

the merry pinne, we follow the world so earnestly, so greedily, as if we should live for ever.</p>
                  <p>We are like the fishes that are skipping and leaping in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet by and by are taken in the Net. We know that the Net of <hi>Death</hi> is continually spread for us all: yet we are as jocund, as if no net were laid for us.</p>
                  <p>It is said <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.4.

                     <hi>All these dyed:</hi> but how did they <hi>dye?</hi> in the faith.

                  <p>Happy are they that <hi>dye in faith.</hi> The Scripture doth not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply say, <hi>blessed are the dead:</hi> but, <hi>that dye in the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iob dyed in the faith. I am sure my Redeemer liveth</hi>—Old Father <hi>Simeon dyed in the faith,</hi> with CHRIST in his armes.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is the greatest commendation that can be given of any, that they <hi>dyed in the faith.</hi> Whyle we live, we are in the field and battle, wee may receive many a wound from sin and the Devill: but being

                     <hi>dead</hi> we are conquerors, have Crownes on our heads and palmes in our hands, as it is in the Revelation.

Is it reported truly of any, that he <hi>dyed in the faith,</hi> such a man made a godly end? that is the height of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Wee cannot well praise a faire day before night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many stormes may be in it: neither can wee give a man his full and perfect commendations till hee be <hi>dead.</hi> Therefore this is registred of these fathers, <hi>tanquam fastigium laudis,</hi> the very top and crest of their praise, that they <hi>dyed in the faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All good men have the <hi>like confession,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a mighty rich man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. Yet but <hi>a stranger and pilgrim. David</hi> was a King: yet but <hi>a stranger.</hi> Hast thou faire houses, large lands, and ample possessions? art thou a rich Clothyer, a wealthy Merchant, a Gentleman, a Knight, a <hi>Lord?</hi> yet acknowledge thy selfe to be but <hi>a stranger:</hi> there is a time when thou must part with all, yea with a kingdome if thou hast it. The very heathen confessed this. The oratour could say, <hi>natura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit nobis non habitandi locum, sed commorandi divorsorium:</hi> this world is but an <hi>Inne,</hi> it is no <hi>dwelling house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if wee bee <hi>strangers</hi> on the earth, as we must all confesse our selves to be, then let us carry our selves as <hi>strangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>stranger</hi> is no medler in the Country wherein he is: he takes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat, which is requisite for him: hee lookes to his owne businesse; but he doth not interpose himselfe in the affaires of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, he leaves them to those that be of the Country. <hi>A stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the heathen said. Even so being <hi>strangers</hi> in the world, let us meddle no more with the world then needs must But wee are drowned in the world, our mindes are on the world all the weeke, all the yeere long: we meddle little with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with prayer, heavenly meditations: we are altogether in and about the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Strangers</hi> must not thinke to beare sway in the Towne and Country where they dwell: the naturall inhabitants will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.9. the <hi>Sodomites</hi> could not endure that <hi>Lot</hi> should bee a King among them. So we being <hi>strangers</hi> in the world must not make account to domineere in it, to have all men at our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll: wee must be content to be underlings here, that wee may bee aloft hereafter, the faithfull are often put to the wall, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are <hi>Lords</hi> over them. This we must take patiently, because wee are <hi>strangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Strangers and Pilgrims</hi> are wont to be abstemious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. a <hi>stranger,</hi> a <hi>Travellour,</hi> if he be a wise man, doth not set his mind on feasting and banquetting, hee takes a morsell, and so away. So being <hi>strangers</hi> here, we must lead a sober life, take no more of the world then will serve us for our journey, wee must reserve our fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:12681:242"/>
till wee come to that place, where wee shall eate bread with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Strangers</hi> must looke for no great love: for the most part they are hated in the Country where they bee, and they are wished to be out of it: even so the world loveth her owne: we are not of the world, we are men of another world; therefore mervaile not though wee find little friend-ship in the world. Dogges will faune on them that be of the house: but they will barke at <hi>strangers,</hi> flye in their faces, and be ready to pull them downe: so because we are <hi>strangers</hi> to the wicked, no marvell though they barke at us and bite us now and then.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Strangers</hi> have a longing desire to be at home. If an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man bee in Spaine, Turkie, India, hee thinks every day two till he be in England: oh that I were with my Wife and Children, with my friends and neighbours at home! So being <hi>strangers</hi> in this world, let us not make too great account of it: let us desire to be at home in our heavenly Hierusalem: let us say with Saint <hi>Paul, I desire to be dissolved, and to bee with</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which is best of all.</hi> But a number of us say in our hearts of the world, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> of the Mount: we are well here, I would to <hi>God</hi> I might never goe from hence.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Strangers</hi> do not hartily love that Country wherin they be, they may love it in some sort, but nothing to their owne Country; so being <hi>viatores</hi> wee may take <hi>viaticum,</hi> but let us not love the world; let us <hi>use it, as if we used it not.</hi> This world must be as worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to us in respect of the joyes of heaven: we may <hi>use</hi> silver and gold, houses and lands, but let us not <hi>love</hi> them. Let the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> our native Country have all our love.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If a <hi>stranger</hi> come to an Inne, he looks about him and sayes: this is a fayre <hi>Inne,</hi> here I have a goodly Chamber, I fare well for my mony; but this is no place for mee to tarry in: so wee should think and say of the world; I have a convenient dwelling, meat and drink enough; I thank <hi>God,</hi> I want nothing: but this is not my place of abode, I am but <hi>a stranger</hi> here, all these things I must forgoe.</p>
                  <p>I would to <hi>God</hi> that this were deepely engraven in the hearts of us all, that wee did effectually consider wee were <hi>strangers</hi> on the earth. We say we are <hi>strangers,</hi> but we live as <hi>Lords:</hi> We say with that rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>Soule, eate, drinke, and bee merry, thou hast goods laid up for many yeares.</hi> Our lives and deeds bewray that wee thinke nothing lesse, than that we be <hi>strangers.</hi> A strange thing that <hi>strangers</hi> should be so bewitched with a <hi>strange</hi> Country, as wee are with the earth.</p>

                  <p>By what token doth he shew himselfe to be <hi>our God?</hi> because he hath <hi>prepared a City.

                  <p>This hee heard not from others, but with his owne eares, and that from <hi>the mouth of God,</hi> that cannot lye.

That <hi>promise</hi> was, that <hi>in Isaac should his seed be called,</hi> and that the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the world should come of <hi>Isaac:</hi> yet now <hi>Isaac</hi> must be slaine, before he had any seed. A strange tryall!</p>
                  <p>Againe, the <hi>Law of nature</hi> written in <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, said; love thy Child, preserve thy Child, especially such a <hi>rare Sonne</hi> as this is, <hi>rarely borne,</hi> and endewed with <hi>rare qualities.</hi> This <hi>Commandement</hi> crosses that, and saies, kill the Child. What a contrariety was this? how did this perplex <hi>Abraham</hi> and cast him into the bryars? but <hi>faith</hi> did reconcile all: and all these obstacles set aside hee <hi>offered him up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A most worthy and unmatchable example! The like is not to bee found againe in the whole world. As <hi>Ioel</hi> saith of the Grasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers and Caterpillers in his time: <hi>hearken ô yee elders, heare all ye inhabitants of the land, whether hath such a thing beene done in your dayes, or in the dayes of your fathers?</hi> so may we say of this; <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all yee that live on the face of the earth,</hi> though yee be as old as <hi>Methusalem,</hi> whether <hi>hath such a thing as this beene done in your dayes,</hi> for a <hi>Father to offer up his only Sonne, at the commandement of</hi> GOD?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manasses</hi> caused his Sons and his Daughters to passe through the fire to his Idols; so did other Idolaters: but they <hi>offered them up to devills,</hi> not to <hi>God,</hi> contrary to the will of <hi>God,</hi> in a blind su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, at the instigation of the Devill, that was a murderer from the beginning, and delights in bloud; but <hi>Abraham</hi> did it in a pure devotion, to testifie his obedience and love to <hi>God,</hi> at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and provocation of <hi>God,</hi> to glorifie him withall. Those Idolaters it may bee were not present at the <hi>offering</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or at least, they <hi>offered</hi> them by others. <hi>Abraham</hi> with his owne hands <hi>offered him</hi> himselfe.

the tormentour of them herselfe. <hi>Mauritius</hi> that good, yet unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Emperour saw all his sons slaine before his face by usurping <hi>Phocas,</hi> and at the death of every one, hee uttered these religious words, <hi>justus es domine, &amp; justum judicium tuum:</hi> but he did not kill them himselfe. In prophane histories, sundry are recorded to have <hi>offered</hi> their Children: as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> did <hi>Iphigenia,</hi> though she were carryed away by <hi>Diana.</hi> So did divers others among the heathen: but these <hi>offered them</hi> to devills, not to <hi>God,</hi> and they did it not with such a divine resolution as <hi>Abraham</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>I but what say yee to <hi>Iephte?</hi> he <hi>offered up</hi> his only daughter: unlesse a Sonne, be valued at an higher rate than a daughter. So that he comes not behind <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes many degrees. 1. Some collect out of the Hebrew words, that he did not <hi>offer her up:</hi> but let it be granted; yet it is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee compared with this of <hi>Abraham</hi>; for he did it not with his owne hands: and if hee did, it was in a rash and preposterous zeale: and his vow like <hi>Herods</hi> oath had better beene broken then kept; he had not <hi>Gods</hi> warrant for it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had.</p>

                  <p>In what a perplexity thinke yee was <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he tooke this journey about such a sorrowfull businesse as this was? how might <hi>Sarah</hi> take on, when shee missed her Sonne five or sixe daies, and could not tell what was become of him, nor her husband?

In what a pittifull case was <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee built the Altar, couched the wood on it, bound <hi>Isaac</hi> to it, put to the fire, and was stretching out of his hand to cut his throate? If <hi>David</hi> kept such an howling for <hi>Absalom</hi> an ungracious child, <hi>ô my Sonne Absalom, my Son Absalom,</hi> when he saw him not; he was a wicked son, a rebell, a Traytor, one that went about to put his father besides the saddle, and to justle him out of his throne; yet how lamented he for him? how might <hi>Abraham</hi> be pierced in this time and cry, <hi>ô my Sonne Isaac, my Sonne Isaac,</hi> my sweet Child, the only staffe of mine old age, my loving, my dutifull, and obedient <hi>Sonne,</hi> beautified with so many glittering vertues, the joy of the world, to whom the <hi>promises</hi> are tyed, must thou be killed, and that by thine own father too? must I be the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and kill thee? this touched him to the quicke.</p>

Art thou fallen to poverty, of a mighty rich man art thou become an exceeding poore man, as <hi>Iob</hi> was? yet <hi>consider</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>able to raise thee</hi> up againe. Is thy Sonne or thy daughter <hi>dead?</hi> is thy Wife, or thy Husband <hi>dead?</hi> is thy friend <hi>dead,</hi> that was as thine owne soule? Weepe not over much, <hi>consider that God is able to raise them up from the dead:</hi> they bee not <hi>amissi,</hi> but <hi>praemissi:</hi> they are gone into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before, and we shall follow after.

                     <hi>Isaac</hi> was in a manner dead, yet he lives still many a yeere; and at his going out of the world <hi>blesseth his two Sonnes:</hi> which was a demonstration of his <hi>faith:</hi> he <hi>lived and dyed in faith,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had done.</p>
                  <p>But it seemeth the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> might have made choyse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of <hi>Isaacs,</hi> serving better for the expressing of his <hi>faith</hi> then this:<note place="margin">Gen. 24.63.</note> he was a devout and religious man, much given to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and heavenly meditation, <hi>he went into the field to pray or meditate</hi>: he continued praying twenty yeeres together for a Child,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.21.</note> and would not give over: hee was obedient to <hi>God,</hi> and followed him from place to place: why doth not the Apostle make mention of these, but of his <hi>blessing?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. These were common to others together with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>blessing</hi> did most of all argue, that he had <hi>lively faith in the promises</hi> of <hi>God</hi> made to him and <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as hee doth bestow the things promised, with as great <hi>assurance,</hi> as if they were accomplished already. This <hi>blessing</hi> is a fulfilling of all the <hi>promises:</hi> therefore most fit to declare his <hi>faith,</hi> and to publish it to all the world.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>blessing</hi> there are three things.</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>For the instrument, it was <hi>by faith.</hi> Was it so? he was cooze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in it by <hi>Rebeccah</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> and he was induced to it against his will and purpose; for he was determined to have <hi>blessed Esau.</hi>

Some infirmities of a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not marre the action of <hi>God:</hi> as a sicke man is a man; so a weake <hi>faith</hi> is a <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. His constant resolution after the blessing was ended, doth shew it came from <hi>faith.</hi>

                     <hi>God loved,</hi> and in whom the <hi>promises</hi> were continued. <hi>Esau</hi> was a prophane person, yet he had some <hi>blessings:</hi> Therefore both are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>blessing,</hi> though diversly.</p>

                  <p>Neither were <hi>the things to come</hi> temporall <hi>blessings</hi> alone, but especially spirituall, shadowed out by <hi>earthly things.</hi> In the <hi>blessing</hi> hee said to <hi>Iacob, Genesis</hi> 27.29. <hi>Be thou thy brothers Lord:</hi> yet <hi>Iacob</hi> was faine to crouch to <hi>Esau,</hi> hee was <hi>his Lord:</hi> but this was accomplished in CHRIST, that should come of <hi>Iacob.</hi> All Nations were subject to him.

Therefore he is desirous, that <hi>Iacob</hi> a famous <hi>Patriarke,</hi> a man deepe in GODS bookes, might blesse them ere hee dyed: for his <hi>blessing</hi> was GODS <hi>blessing. Ioseph</hi> being ruler of the land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> no doubt had purchased great lands and Lord-ships for them: hee was like to leave them money enough, that they should want no earthly <hi>blessing</hi>; yet because all these were not worth a straw without the <hi>blessing</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> hee is most carefull to procure this to them, which they were to receive from the mouth and hands of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Fathers are carefull enough to provide outward things
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:12681:251"/>
for their Children, to lay up bagges of Gold and Silver for them, to leave them houses and lands, Sheepe and Oxen and such like: but as for GODS <hi>blessing,</hi> that is the least thing they take thought for. This is to build without a foundation: for the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God</hi> is all in all. Therefore above all things, procure that to your Children.</p>
                  <p>Why doth not the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> rather say, <hi>by faith he blessed his owne Sonnes?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because this is greater. <hi>By the eye of faith</hi> hee did not onely <hi>foresee,</hi> what should happen to his <hi>owne Children:</hi> but also to the <hi>Children of his Child.</hi>

What hast thou,</hi> beest thou never so great, <hi>which thou hast not received?</hi> Therefore swell not in pride in respect of the <hi>gift,</hi> but thanke the <hi>giver</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This must represse the envy of inferiours.

The neerer the time approcheth, that a tenant must goe out of his farme, the more carefull he will be to improve it to his best commodity: the lesser time that a man is to enjoy money lent to him, the greater advantage he will make of it, if hee can; even so when we perceive wee must depart out of the farme of this world, let us use it most to <hi>Gods</hi> glory: and seeing <hi>God</hi> hath lent us our life, as a summe of money to be payd to him <hi>praesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuto die</hi>; the neerer the day of payment comes, the more conscionably and diligently let us be in the use of it, to the honour of <hi>God</hi> and our owne profit.

                  <p>So this life being as a stage whereon wee play our part, let us chiefely look to the last act at our departure out of the world, that it may be joyfull to our selves and all those that be round about us: our whole life should bee a continuall <hi>glorifying</hi> of GOD, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the closing up of our life with <hi>death,</hi> that wee may leave a testimony behind us of that lively <hi>faith,</hi> which wee have in the <hi>Lord Iesus.</hi> Let us be praying, meditating, <hi>blessing,</hi> talking of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matters, to the last gaspe.</p>

                  <p>Though it were the hazzard, not of their goods alone, but lives too, they <hi>looked to Gods promises:</hi> that they should multiply, that out of <hi>Israel</hi> should come a deliverer, and the Messiah too: therefore they will not drowne their Male-child.</p>
                  <p>They did not so feare it, as that it should hold them from the preservation of their Child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Three moneths:</hi>] not three dayes, or three weekes: yet at <hi>three moneths end</hi> they commit him to the water: then their <hi>faith</hi> began to stagger.</p>
                  <p>Some thinke they did it in <hi>faith</hi> too, being assured that <hi>God</hi> would deliver him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.4. If he had beene in danger, they would have taken him home againe.</p>
                  <p>They were the first, and all that wee read of, that kept their Children against the <hi>Kings decree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they <hi>hid him three moneths</hi> was commendable. All that whyle they were in feare, and hazarded their lives: but that at the <hi>three moneths end</hi> they expose their Child to the wide world, that argues a weakenesse in them: yet this weake action, this <hi>weake faith</hi> of theirs is registred, to their commendation, <hi>God</hi> alloweth and commendeth a <hi>weake faith:</hi> he doth <hi>not quench the smoaking flaxe, nor bruise the broken reed:</hi> he chides <hi>Peter</hi> for his <hi>weake faith, ô thou of little faith!</hi> but he doth not cast him away for it.</p>
                  <p>Though a Child be <hi>weake,</hi> yet the Father loves it: so doth our heavenly Father us, though he find <hi>weakenesses</hi> in our best actions. There was a <hi>weakenesse</hi> in the Mid-Wives, when they preserved the Children with a <hi>lye:</hi> there was a <hi>weakenesse</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee thought he could not be safe unlesse he <hi>dissembled:</hi> there was <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> in the Parents of <hi>Moses,</hi> in thrusting their Child at length out of doores: there is <hi>weakenesse</hi> in our praying, hearing of Sermons, in our giving to the poore, and maintenance of the word preached, in our preserving of our Children in dangers and calamities: yet if these things bee done in sincerity, though there be <hi>weakenesses</hi> in them, they are accepted at the hands of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi> Let that encourage us in all good actions, though they be stained with some <hi>imbecillities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Beauty</hi> is a precious pearle, a picture of the heavenly <hi>Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> a singular ornament, wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath graced his Children. <hi>Ioseph was a fayre person and well favoured, Gen.</hi> 39.6. <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12. <hi>Daniel and his fellowes.</hi> The base fare they had could not impaire their <hi>beauty.</hi> This the LORD in wisedome hath used for the preservation and advancement of his Children. <hi>Moses beauty</hi>
                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:12681:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a load-stone to draw the favour of <hi>Pharaohs daughter</hi> to him. It was as a stirrope for <hi>Hester</hi> to mount up to a Kingdome: yet for all that, let us not dote too much upon externall <hi>beauty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though some of GODS Children have it, yet all have it not: it is not <hi>proprium quarto modo. Ebedmeleck,</hi> the blacke-more was <hi>no fayre man:</hi> neither be they all the Children of GOD that have it. <hi>Absalom was a beautifull man, not a blemish in his whole body,</hi> yet a wicked man, who by all probability never set a foote into the kingdome of heaven: and many a filthy strumpet is <hi>fayrer</hi> than an honest woman.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a transitory gift: here to day, gone to morrow: <hi>beauty</hi> is a goodly flower, yet there be many wormes to consume it: sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, griefe, old age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us chiefely desire that <hi>beauty</hi> that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us consider, there is a double <hi>beauty</hi>; the one outward, the other inward: the one proper to <hi>Gods</hi> elect, the other common to the reprobate together with them. <hi>The Kings daughter is glorious within, Psal.</hi> 45.13.</p>
                  <p>It is the <hi>inward beauty</hi> of the heart, that is acceptable to <hi>God.</hi> Let us all pray to <hi>God</hi> for that, to bestow it on us: that is better then the <hi>beauty</hi> of all Ladies in the world: this is the <hi>true beauty, Prov.</hi> 31.30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is spoken comparatively, not simply: they did not so feare <hi>the Kings commandement,</hi> that they should banish the <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the King of Kings,</hi> out of their minde. The King said, <hi>drowne the child: God</hi> said, <hi>save the child from drowning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What, are not <hi>Kings</hi> to be feared? <hi>have I not said, yee are Gods?</hi> a <hi>King</hi> is a certaine <hi>God</hi> on the earth: therefore to be feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced: <hi>he carrieth not the sword in vaine,</hi> sayes the Apostle. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> Asse feared, when he saw the Angels sword: and shall not we feare that glittering sword of authority in the hand of <hi>Kings</hi> and Princes? they are rather to be condemned, then commended for <hi>not fearing the Kings Commandement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The answer is easy. Wee must distinguish betweene the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the <hi>commandement</hi> of a <hi>King.</hi> There is no power, but it is of <hi>God:</hi> but there may be a <hi>commandement</hi> which is not of <hi>God.</hi> Feare the power, the throne, the dignity, the authority of a <hi>King,</hi> the office of a <hi>King</hi>; but feare not every <hi>commandement of a King</hi>; if wee be sure they are against plaine Scripture. In doubtfull things, we must believe that our Governours are wiser than our selves.</p>

                  <p>This the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> mentioneth, least this his refusall should be adscribed <hi>temeritati</hi> or <hi>imprudentiae.</hi> Young men want knowledge and experience: often times they doe they cannot tell what: if they had had moe yeeres on their backes, they would have beene wiser: and many times they doe that rashly upon weaknes and impotency of affection, which they repent them of afterwards: many a young man in a proud conceit of himselfe <hi>refuses</hi> a living, which he would gladly have afterwards, and cannot. <hi>Moses</hi> did not so make this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall.</hi> Hee was great in yeeres, of a ripe and mature age, wise, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect, considerate enough; yet <hi>he refused,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

trained him up in all the learning of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> she adopted him to be her <hi>Son,</hi> and now doth he thinke scorne to be called her <hi>Son?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No doubt but hee was thankefull to her for all the kindnesses she had shewed him, and behaved himselfe reverently and dutifully to her: <hi>honour thy father and mother.</hi> She had beene as a <hi>mother</hi> to him, and out of all question hee honoured her: yet hee would not honour her above <hi>God:</hi> he was appointed by <hi>God</hi> to be the deliverer of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt. Israel</hi> was the Church of <hi>God, to them the promises were made</hi>; the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were a prophane company, strangers from the covenants: therfore though he might have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a kingdome by it, he would not be in their Calendar, he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed plainely he was an <hi>Israelite,</hi> one of <hi>Gods</hi> chosen people, he was none of <hi>Pharaohs daughters Sonne:</hi> hee was the <hi>Sonne of</hi> GOD <hi>by faith</hi> in the promised <hi>Messiah. Hester</hi> concealed her people, when shee stood on a kingdome: yet <hi>Moses</hi> for a kingdome will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale his: the time was now come, when he was to open himselfe to the world, what hee was: hee set not a straw by that magnificent title, in comparison of the affinity and consanguinity hee had with <hi>Gods</hi> people.</p>
                  <p>Together with this title, he <hi>refused</hi> all the appendices that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it: the crowne of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; all the honours, riches, profits and pleasures, that were appertaining to the Crowne. A strange and admirable <hi>refusall!</hi> being with <hi>Pharaohs daughter</hi> hee might live in all ease, rest and quietnes, none durst give him a foule word, much lesse offer him any wrong in deed. He flourished in the pomp and honour of the world, all the Court reverenced him, capped and bowed to him: by reason hereof he was in some probability of the Crowne hereafter, for <hi>Iosephus</hi> writeth, she had no naturall Sons of her owne, but intended to make him her heyre: yet this regall title with all the golden appurtenances he <hi>refuses. Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit aurum?</hi> much more, <hi>quis respuit oblatum regnum?</hi> men will doe any thing for a kingdome: yet he desires to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of <hi>Gods</hi> people, how meanly soever he lived in the world. An admirable <hi>faith</hi>!</p>
                  <p>This he did, not when hee was under age, in his minority, but when hee was <hi>of full age</hi> and capable of a kingdome, if it had descended to him. <hi>Iosephus</hi> recordeth, that when he was a Child, <hi>Pharaohs daughter</hi> glorying exceedingly in his beauty and towardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, presented him to the King her Father, who to please his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withall, set the Crowne on <hi>Moses</hi> head, the which he suffering to slip off and fall on the ground, stamped it under his feete, which the South-sayers of <hi>Aegypt</hi> presaged to bee ominous to the kingdome. That he did when he was a boy, if it be true: but now being a man <hi>of compleat age,</hi> he contemneth, as it were, the crown of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he sets not a straw by it, because <hi>God</hi> had called him to another kingdome.</p>
                  <p>It is not a thing unlawfull to appertaine to the Court of earthly Princes, or to be reputed in the number of their <hi>Sons.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was urged by <hi>Sauls</hi> servants to take <hi>Michal,</hi> the Kings daughter; he

                     <hi>Riches</hi> are excellent things, honour and promotion is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing. <hi>God</hi> oftentimes bestowes them as tokens of love on his Children: hee made <hi>Abraham rich:</hi> and <hi>he gave David a name like the name of the great men on the earth:</hi> but if either GOD or they must be forsaken, away with all the <hi>riches,</hi> all the kingdomes of the world. The Devill offered <hi>Christ all the kingdomes of the earth:</hi> but he would none of them. When the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> tooke more on her, then became her, <hi>Christ</hi> said to her; <hi>woman, what have I to doe with thee?</hi> so if honour or promotion, <hi>riches</hi> or pleasure draw us from <hi>God,</hi> let us shake them off, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper, and say, <hi>what have I to doe with you?</hi> my <hi>God</hi> must be dearer to me, then you all. Because the kingdome of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> glory could not stand together, <hi>Moses refused</hi> a kingdome: then let us be content to forsake a Lord-ship, a small quantity of ground, a simple house, a little silver and gold for the <hi>Lord:</hi> whatsoever we have, be it more or lesse, let us count all as dongue for <hi>Christs</hi> sake.</p>
                  <p>In the time of prosperity let us weane our selves from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and commodities of this life, that in the time of tryall and persecution wee may not bee glewed to them, as the young man to his <hi>riches,</hi> but may be willing to forsake all for <hi>Christs</hi> sake: and so much the rather, because wee know not how nigh tryall is, how soone the wind of affliction may rise, and make a difference between them that love <hi>Christ</hi> and his Gospell sincerely, and betweene them that <hi>love this present world,</hi> as <hi>Demas</hi> did. If wee have but a little house and land, one hundred or two hundred, and should bee loath to leave it for CHRISTS sake: how would wee leave a kingdome for him, as <hi>Moses</hi> did? It must bee <hi>Gods</hi> worke, not our owne.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is said, that <hi>Moses</hi> did it <hi>by faith,</hi> he did it not by any naturall strength or power, by vertue of education, though he had famous Schoolemasters, and was <hi>trained up in all the learning of the Aegyptians:</hi> he did it not by the advice of any witty or politick <hi>Achitophel:</hi> he did it <hi>by faith. Faith</hi> in the promised Messiah moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to it. As <hi>Abraham saw the day of Christ, and was glad:</hi> so
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:12681:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> saw <hi>Christ</hi> and the kingdome of heaven by the <hi>eye of faith:</hi> this made him not to set a rush by the kingdome of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> I shall be heyre of a far more glorious kingdome, then a straw for <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The kingdome of <hi>Aegypt</hi> lasts but a while, death one day will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me from it: but I shall have a <hi>kingdome that cannot be shaken,</hi> that endures for ever and ever. Therefore let <hi>Aegypt</hi> goe. If wee have a true and lively <hi>faith in the promises</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> a sight of the joyes reserved for the faithfull in the life to come, it will withdraw our mindes off from these earthly things. A worldly man can never doe it, he will say, it is good sleeping in an whole skinne; a bird in the hand is better than two in the bush; I know, what I have here, I cannot tell what I shall have afterwards: but <hi>faith is an evidence of things that are not seene.</hi> This caused the Martyrs in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> dayes, some to leave their Bishopricks, as <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley:</hi> some their lands and great revenewes, as the <hi>Dutches</hi> of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> some their liberty, some their Country for the Gospell: and if we have a true and <hi>lively faith</hi> indeed, it will make us to leave all for a good cause: therefore let us make this prayer, <hi>Lord encrease our faith:</hi> let it bee so strong, as that neither <hi>riches,</hi> honour, nor any thing else may separate us from thee.</p>
                  <p>When? not when hee was a Child, for then it might have beene deemed to be want of witt and discretion, as Children <hi>refuse</hi> gold, and take Apples: but when he was <hi>great,</hi> of a <hi>good and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient stature,</hi> about <hi>fourtie yeeres of age:</hi> when he knew well enough what he did: he did it not <hi>puerili temeritate, sed judicio virili,</hi> when he was in the prime and flower of his yeeres. Young men about <hi>fortie</hi> are most fit for honour and promotion. This may be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to young men to consecrate their best yeeres to the <hi>Lord. Wherewithall shall a young man clense his wayes? I write to you young men,</hi> sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn. Timothy was exercised in the Scriptures from his Child-hood.</hi> We read of a <hi>young man in the Gospell, that said he had kept all the Commandements from his youth:</hi> he was no swearer, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, rayler, fighter, quarreller, stealer, cutter, whoremonger: but our young men cannot abide to heare of godlinesse; tell them of forsaking of pleasures, and honour as <hi>Moses</hi> did, they cannot abide to heare on that eare. As the Devill said to <hi>Christ, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest thou to torment me before the time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So this is a torment to them. When they be <hi>old</hi> they will thinke of Religion; in the meane season they will bee swash-bucklers, as <hi>Lamech</hi>; haters, as <hi>Esau</hi>; Ruffians, with <hi>Absalom</hi>; they will follow their lusts, with <hi>Amnon.</hi> It seemes a paradoxe, for a <hi>young man</hi> to be a Martyr, to leave the Court, the honours and pleasures of this world, as <hi>Moses</hi> did.</p>

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:12681:259"/>
Christ.</hi> GOD hath created all for <hi>his owne glory: our light must so shine before men, that they seeing our good workes may glorifie our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven.</hi> I will abstaine from sinne, because it <hi>dishonours</hi> GOD.</p>
                  <p>I will adorne the Gospell with good workes, because they <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>love of Christ must constraine us</hi> thereunto. As he hath dyed for my sins, so I will dye to sinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The consideration of our owne duty must presse us to it. All that wee can doe is a debt, which wee owe unto our GOD:<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note> therefore wee must alwayes bee paying our debt to our lives end.</p>
                  <p>The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. is, that <hi>rich,</hi> and ample <hi>reward</hi> reserved for us, which is as a bell to toll us to good workes: this we may respect, but it is not the chiefest thing propounded to us in well doing. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers could say, that <hi>nuda virtus</hi> is to be desired: so <hi>God</hi> is <hi>to bee loved</hi> and served for himselfe alone, without any other by-conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They that doe good workes only for the <hi>reward,</hi> are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary: as a labourer will not doe a dayes worke, unlesse hee may have a shilling: and they that have <hi>no respect to the reward,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not at all are unthankefull to <hi>God,</hi> who hath prepared a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for us. Let us looke to the <hi>reward,</hi> by the which he allures us, as a father doth his Children, to well doing: but let that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee the sole nor principall marke wee ayme at, but the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of our heavenly father,</hi> for whose <hi>glory</hi> we were created and redeemed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us expect a <hi>reward</hi> for our well doing: yet not upon merit, but upon promise. <hi>Paul</hi> being ready to dye <hi>looked at the reward: from henceforth there is layd up for mee a Crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note> But what <hi>Crowne?</hi> not which hee had merited, but which GOD had <hi>promised,</hi> and for his <hi>promise</hi> sake would give to him. This is the surmise of some Papists, that <hi>merces &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum</hi> bee relatives: though <hi>promissum &amp; merces</hi> are relatives, yet <hi>merces &amp; meritum</hi> are not. Wee <hi>looke for a reward,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>promised</hi> it: not because wee have <hi>merited</hi> it: for <hi>when we have done all that we can, we are unprofitable servants.</hi> Otherwise let us be bold to <hi>cast up our eyes to the reward. Christ</hi> himselfe had <hi>respect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense of the reward, Hebr.</hi> 12.2. and we that be Christians may imitate him in that.</p>
                  <p>Though a child have a poore man to his Father, that is not able to leave him a Groate, yet he is bound to honour him: but much more, if hee be a <hi>rich</hi> man and willing to leave him a fayre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Our father is <hi>rich,</hi> hee will <hi>reward</hi> us with a kingdome: therefore let us the rather serve and honour him: <hi>great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heaven: behold I come, and my reward is with me.</hi> Here wee meete with many crosses in our mindes, bodies, goods, name, in our Wives, Children, Cattell: here are many occasions of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: but let us cheerefully endure them all: One day we shall be
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:12681:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
taken up into that place; where <hi>all teares shall bee wiped away from our eyes for ever.</hi> Let us looke to this <hi>recompense of reward.</hi>

                  <p>THe second notable thing in <hi>Moses,</hi> is a necessary crosse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on him: which is amplified by a corrumpent and a conservant cause of it. The corrumpent was the fiercenesse of the King, which he feared not: the conservant was the sight of <hi>God</hi> standing by him.</p>
                  <p>The greatest part of Interpreters expound it of <hi>Moses</hi> departing out of <hi>Aeyypt,</hi> when hee carryed the people with him: then and in the dispatchall of his message and office, he <hi>feared not the fiercenesse of the King,</hi> but <hi>contemned</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>That is true: yet it seemes not to be the proper meaning of the place.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then the Apostle should invert the order, which hitherto he hath not done, nor hereafter doth in this Chapter, hee should set the <hi>departure</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> before the Institution of the Passeover.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>departure</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> is included, <hi>Verse</hi> 29. it should be now unseasonable to speake of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then <hi>Moses</hi> did not forsake <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but hee went as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They that <hi>forsake a Country,</hi> leave it for some cause; in regard whereof they cannot safely tarry in the Country. Therfore it is rather to be referred to the flight of <hi>Moses,</hi> when after the <hi>killing of the Aegyptian, he left Aegypt, and fled into the land of Midian.</hi> This might seeme to have proceeded from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, yet the power of faith is to be seene in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> perceiving that now, the King being incensed against him, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> as yet not acknowledging him for their deliverer, there was no convenient time to prosecute his office: therefore he flieth for a season, committing himselfe to the providence of GOD, and expecting a better opportunity for the delivering of the <hi>Israelites:</hi> in the meane season, <hi>by faith he forsaketh Aegypt</hi> for a time.</p>
                  <p>There is one only thing that opposeth itselfe to this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Here it is said, that he <hi>feared not the fiercenesse of the King,</hi> yet <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.14. it is as cleere as the noone day, that <hi>he feared it, and fled upon it.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The participle may be rendred in the <hi>praeterpluperfect-tense,</hi> as <hi>Verse</hi> 31. <hi>by faith Moses forsooke Aegypt, having not feared the fiercenesse of the King,</hi> namely, <hi>in killing the Aegyptian,</hi> according to his commission received from <hi>God:</hi> not, that he <hi>feared</hi> it not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though hee <hi>feared</hi> a little at the first, yet that <hi>feare</hi> was
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:12681:260"/>
allayed afterwards: in a couragious magnanimity he <hi>forsook Aegypt, and feared not the fiercenesse of the King</hi> in pursuing after him. It may be this fierce Lion will sent messengers after me to catch me, but the King of Kings is with mee, I <hi>feare him not,</hi> I will rest under the wings of <hi>Gods</hi> protection.</p>

                     <hi>Chrysost.</hi> answers, that he did <hi>not so feare,</hi> as that he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returne againe.</p>
                  <p>Why? for he endured, with a strong and a valiant minde: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could overthrow him.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>seeing him, that is invisible. God</hi> in himselfe is <hi>invisible,</hi> and cannot be <hi>seene.</hi> Yet <hi>Moses by the eye of faith saw him</hi> as a Gyant on his side; which made him to <hi>contemne Pharaoh</hi> and all enemies whatsoever: <hi>he saw him in the bush, Exod.</hi> 3. but rather, <hi>by the eye of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rhemists</hi> translate it, <hi>him that is invisible:</hi> he <hi>sustained,</hi> as if he had <hi>seene</hi> him: how can a man <hi>sustaine God?</hi> they have quite lost the force of the Greeke word; which governes no case, but is absolute of it selfe.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>flight</hi> is not to be condemned. <hi>Moses fled out of Aegypt,</hi> yet it was <hi>in faith.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul fled out of Damascus,</hi> yet <hi>in faith. Tertullian</hi> hath an excellent treatise to this purpose. There is a time to burne, and a time to flye. <hi>If they persecute you in one City, flye to another.</hi> If our <hi>flight</hi> come from faith, not from feare and infidelity, wee may have comfort in it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be two wings wherewithall we must <hi>flye,</hi> when wee <hi>flye</hi> out of any Country, being pursued by our enemies: the wing of <hi>faith,</hi> and of righteousnesse. Whatsoever we doe, must be done <hi>in faith,</hi> else it is sinne in the sight of <hi>God:</hi> if we sticke by it in the time of persecution, it must not be in <hi>presumption, presuming</hi> in our owne strength, but in <hi>faith</hi> relying on GOD. If we <hi>flye,</hi> it must not be in <hi>infidelity,</hi> as if GOD were not able to keepe us in security, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to suffer any thing for the name of <hi>Christ</hi>; but it must be in <hi>faith</hi> to reserve ourselves for better opportunities, and to <hi>fight</hi> more manfully afterwards under <hi>Christ</hi> his banner. <hi>By faith Moses forsooke Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second wing wherewith we must <hi>flye</hi> is, the wing of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>

                  <p>If wee <hi>flye</hi> not sinne, as well as the Country, if wee carry our <hi>sinnes,</hi> adultery, covetousnesse, pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with us in our <hi>flight:</hi> they will make hue and cry after us, and pursue us to the terrour of our conscience, whithersoever wee goe; these things being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let us bee bold to <hi>flye.

                  <p>The reason why we faint in calamities, why wee give place to the fury of men is, because we <hi>see</hi> not GOD on our sides by the <hi>eye of faith:</hi> for if we did, we would not feare men.

                  <p>THE former were proper to <hi>Moses.</hi> Now follow two other, which are common to the <hi>Israelites</hi> together with him: the celebration of the Passeover, and their passage through the red sea.</p>
                  <p>In the celebration of the Passeover: 1. the act: then the causes of it, which are three; the instrumentall, formall, and finall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Made the Passeover:</hi> which doth signifie both to <hi>ordaine,</hi> and to <hi>keepe and celebrate, Matth.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Moses</hi> did not onely <hi>ordaine</hi> it at GODS appointment, but together with the Israelites did <hi>keepe and celebrate it,</hi> as a confirmation of their faith in the deliverance that was to come.</p>
                  <p>Here by <hi>Passeover,</hi> of necessity must be understood, the <hi>Paschall Lambe,</hi> which was a signe and token to them of the <hi>Passeover.</hi> The <hi>Passeover</hi> was the passing of the Angell by the house of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> when he slew the first-borne among the <hi>Egyptians. Moses</hi> did neither <hi>institute</hi> nor <hi>celebrate</hi> that: but that was <hi>instituted</hi> and <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> by GOD. They did take and eat the Paschall Lambe, which was a significant token to them of that <hi>Passeover:</hi> therefore it is no new thing, by a <hi>Sacramentall metonymie,</hi> to give the signes the name of the thing signified. This is the LORD's <hi>Passeover, Exod.</hi> 12.11. that is, <hi>A signe of the Lords Passeover: this is my covenant,</hi> sayes GOD of <hi>Circumcision, Gen.</hi> 17.10. that is, as it is expounded, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. <hi>A signe of my Covenant: The Rock was Christ</hi>; that is, <hi>a type and

The Lambe was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the bloud effused into a Basin, the sponge of hysope dipped in the bloud, whereby it was sprinkled on the doore cheekes. This <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ordained and celebrated,</hi> that the Angell seeing this bloud on the doores of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> might passe by their houses, and kill none there.</p>
                  <p>That is, the <hi>Angell</hi> appointed to it by GOD: yet no <hi>Angell</hi> is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The celebration of this Sacrament by <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites,</hi> was a lively demonstration of their faith. <hi>Achaz would have no signe.</hi> They did not reject this <hi>signe.</hi> To what purpose should <hi>bloud be sprinkled on our doores?</hi> Cannot the Angell discerne the house of an <hi>Israelite</hi> from the house of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> without such a marke? or can a few <hi>drops of the bloud of a Lambe</hi> be as a <hi>buckler</hi> to us against the wrath of <hi>God?</hi> They chopt no such Logick with the Lord, but in faith submitted themselves to his <hi>ordinance</hi>: so must we with the hand of faith imbrace the Sacraments of the New Testament. Some Atheist might object against them: to what end is a little <hi>water</hi> laid on the forehead of the childe? as <hi>Naaman</hi> said, <hi>Are not Abana and Pharpar, Rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?</hi> So say they, is not <hi>the water</hi> in the pompe, as good as the <hi>water</hi> in the Font? Wherefore doe we receive a little Bread and Wine so solemnely in the Church, at the celebration of the Lords Supper? May we not have as good in every Taverne? I but if we have <hi>faith,</hi> wee receive them as pledges of the <hi>body and bloud of Christ,</hi> with hearty thanksgiving to GOD, yea, as exhibiting the same.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>bloud of the Lambe on the doores</hi> of their houses, did assure them of their <hi>deliverance from the plague and judgement of God:</hi> that though never so many were slaine among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet none of their <hi>first-borne</hi> should lose their lives: so <hi>the water in Baptisme,</hi> must assure us of the <hi>washing away of our sins</hi> in the bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in the Lords Supper must assure us of the <hi>Body and Bloud of Christ:</hi> that as we eate and drinke the one with our mouth, so we eate and drinke the other with our hearts; in so much, as CHRIST is one with us, and we with him. Our reverent use of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in the feare of <hi>God,</hi> is a token of <hi>faith:</hi> they that contemne the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> that regard them not, that care not though they come not at the Communion once in a yeere, nay, in five or ten yeeres, they feele no want of it, these declare to the world that they have no <hi>faith. Moses</hi> keeping of the <hi>Passeover</hi> was a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of his <hi>faith:</hi> and our usage of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> will bewray our <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:12681:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>The <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> was a type of <hi>Christ:</hi> whereupon he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>our Passeover,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. He was <hi>the Lambe of God, that taketh away the sinnes of the world. Not a bone of the Paschall Lambe might be broken, Exod.</hi> 12.46. So, <hi>Not a bone of Christ could bee broken, Iohn</hi> 19.36. This <hi>Passeover</hi> was an adumbration of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Effusion of the bloud of the Lambe</hi> was a <hi>figure of the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the bloud of Christ, Heb.</hi> 12.24. As the <hi>bloud of the Lambe sprinkled on the doores of the Israelites,</hi> kept away the <hi>Destroyer</hi> from them: So <hi>the bloud of Christ sprinkled on our consciences,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. keepes away the Devill from us. Where <hi>this bloud is sprinkled by</hi> the sponge of <hi>faith,</hi> there the Devill can have no entrance nor posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion. This no doubt they likewise <hi>saw by the eye of faith:</hi> and let us desire to be <hi>sprinkled with this bloud</hi> more and more.</p>
                  <p>Whether it were a <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill Angell,</hi> is a question more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than commodious: for the most part, Executioners among us are bad men, the scum and off-scouring of the Countrey, such as have no piety nor religion in them: yet sometimes a good man may be a Kings executioner, as <hi>Benaiah</hi> was to <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 2. <hi>Punire malum, non est malum, sed facere malum, malum est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So it may please the High and Eternall GOD, to use <hi>good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in the execution of his wrath. They are as ready to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his justice, as of his mercy. It might be a <hi>good Angell</hi> that slew 70000. with the Pestilence, in three dayes space;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Whether it were or no, it makes no great matter, it doth not much concerne us.

                  <p>Whom did the <hi>Angell destroy? The first-borne,</hi> which of all the children are deerest to the parents.

If we love our <hi>children,</hi> let us love GOD: if we desire to keepe them, let us keepe in with GOD; he gave, and hee can take away at his pleasure: if we provoke him by our sins, whom we ought to love most, hee will bereave us of that which wee love most. If wee have one childe deerer to us than another, by one meanes or

ancles, but <hi>as if they had bin on the dry and firme land, Exod.</hi> 14.22.</p>
                  <p>This is adscribed to their <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the beginning their <hi>faith</hi> was <hi>weake:</hi> they cryed out like des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate persons without hope, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.11. but when they heard the promise of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he had said it, when they saw the <hi>pillar of a cloud</hi> as a token of <hi>Gods</hi> presence with them, when they beheld the <hi>waters driven backe by the rod of Moses,</hi> then committing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to the <hi>Lord,</hi> they <hi>enter boldly into the red Sea.</hi> This was a lively manifestation of their <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>weake faith</hi> at the first, may prove a <hi>strong faith</hi> at the last, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Peter</hi> on the Sea.</p>
                  <p>There be three especiall things that commend their <hi>faith</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That at <hi>Gods</hi> Word they would <hi>believe it:</hi> hee said they should <hi>goe through the Sea,</hi> they give credit to it: Hath <hi>God</hi> spoken it? Let us rest quietly in his word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>waters were</hi> on both sides, <hi>on the right hand and on the left</hi>; they might be in a continuall feare, least they shold fall on them and overwhelme them: yet <hi>through faith</hi> they go on and feare nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Aegyptians followed them into the red Sea,</hi> even there they were at their heeles: this might have scared them. Though we be not drowned in the Sea; yet the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> may cut our throats and kill us in the Sea: but <hi>through faith</hi> they likewise overcome that.</p>
                  <p>This was a supernaturall work: if, they had not had <hi>faith,</hi> they could never have done it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> is the best weapon to fight withall in all dangers, the best bridge to passe over any river, yea the Sea it selfe; a coate of Maile in all battels.</p>
                  <p>All of them had not <hi>faith,</hi> no doubt there were some <hi>unbelievers</hi> among them, which went over for company and fashion sake, for the saving of their lives, they would venter with the rest, but they had not a <hi>true and sound faith</hi> in the promise of <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. yet the fact hath the denomination of the better part. There were <hi>many that believed,</hi> therfore it is attributed to <hi>faith:</hi> for the <hi>faithfuls, sake</hi> the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull</hi> were kept from drowning. The <hi>wicked</hi> in temporal blessings fare the better for the <hi>godly.</hi> Every man must <hi>live eternally by his own faith:</hi> but the <hi>unfaithfull</hi> in temporall blessings may <hi>fare the better for the faithfull. The</hi> LORD <hi>blessed Potiphar for Iosephs sake.</hi> It is like some <hi>bad ones</hi> were <hi>in the Ship,</hi> some prophane Marriners, wherein S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> sayled to <hi>Rome:</hi> yet they were <hi>all preserved</hi> for <hi>Pauls</hi> sake.</p>
                  <p>So here the unbelieving <hi>Israelites</hi> were saved from <hi>drowning,</hi> for the believers: the world hates the godly, and cannot abide to be in their company; yet they escape many dangers for their sake. This should cause them to make more of them than they doe.</p>
                  <p>Through <hi>faith</hi> the people went over <hi>Iordan,</hi> the three Children walked in the middest of the fire, <hi>Daniel</hi> continued safe in the Lions den, <hi>Ionah</hi> came out of the Whales belly. The nature of <hi>faith,</hi> it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth over difficulties and followes <hi>God.</hi> Through <hi>faith David</hi> said, <hi>by the power of God I will leap over a wall.</hi> If a man have the Kings

passe-port, he may passe all <hi>England</hi> over: but if a man have <hi>faith,</hi> he may passe all the world over, through fire and water, thicke and thinne.</p>
                  <p>Here we see, that all creatures are servants to <hi>Gods</hi> Children, all worke for them. <hi>The Sun stood for Iosua. The Starres fought for the Israelites against Sisera.</hi>

                  <p>In the <hi>Israelites</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> forgets her nature: in the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> she exercised her nature. 1. The cause of their destruction. 2. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Whereof the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> taking tryall: why may not we passe through the Sea, as well as they? Why should it not give place to us as well as to them?</p>

                  <p>The enemies of the Church may insult over it for a time, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made the <hi>Israelites</hi> their slaves, and kept them in cruell bondage: but at the lenght they shall drinke of the Cup of Gods wrath. <hi>Iesabel</hi> was <hi>cast out of a window and eaten up with Dogs. Herod was eaten up with wormes. Sennacherib was slaine by his owne Sonnes.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were <hi>overwhelmed in the red Sea.</hi> Most of the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in Q. <hi>Maryes</hi> daies (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Fox</hi> reporteth) came to a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lamentable end: Some ranne mad, some stuncke above the ground, while they were alive. The rod may be aloft, but it shall be hurled downe, and cast into the fire. Let this be our comfort, we shall one day be conquerors over them all.</p>
                  <p>The Lord doth not onely meete with them, but oftentimes in justice he serves them with the same sauce. <hi>Iezabel</hi> spilt <hi>Naboths blood</hi>: in the end <hi>her bloud was licked up with Dogs.</hi> As <hi>Adonibezech had done unto</hi> 70. <hi>Kings, so God rewarded him. Iud.</hi> 1.7. The <hi>Aegyptians drowned</hi> the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>; now <hi>they are drowned.</hi> Some of the traytors that thought to have blowne us up with <hi>gun-powder,</hi> were destroyed with <hi>gun-powder</hi> themselves. <hi>Plutarke</hi> writeth of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Theseus,</hi> that whom they sacrificed, had sacrificed: whom they hurled into the Sea, had hurled into the Sea: whom they thrust through with the Sword, had thrust through with the Sword.</p>
                  <p>Let them take heed what tortures they put the godly unto, the LORD will repay them with the like. In this he will be a <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean,</hi>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:12681:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he will use <hi>jus talionis,</hi> and <hi>mete the same measure to them, that they have meted to others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The same Sea that gave way to the Israelites drowned the Aegyptians: the same fire that had no power over the three Children, slew those men that cast them into the hot fiery furnace: the same Lions that touched not Daniel, devoured his enemies: the same Angell that smote the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, preserved Lot: the same earth that swallowed up the rebellious route of Core, Dathan and Abiram, bore those that were loyall and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God. As all worke for the best to them that love Gad: so all things worke for the worst to them that hate God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is a strange and wonderfull miracle, a glasse wherein wee may behold the power and goodnesse of <hi>God.</hi> This was the sole finger of <hi>God</hi> Almighty. Yet there have beene some Atheists that have gone about to extenuate the glory of it: this was nothing (say they) but the cunning of <hi>Moses</hi> to delude the world withall: he being <hi>trained up in all the learning of the Aegyptians</hi> had great skill in Astronomy, he was well acquainted with the course of the Moone, with the ebbing and flowing of the Sea: immediately after the tyde was gone, he found a shallow place, where the sand was drye, there hee carryed the people over, and makes us believe that they went through the Sea: and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> having not that wit, but leaping into the Red Sea <hi>were drowned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is plainely confuted by the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Moses</hi> did it <hi>by faith,</hi> not by art or cunning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The waters</hi> were not gone away, as they be at an ebbe: they were still remaining, as <hi>a wall</hi> on both sides of the people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were as skilfull Astronomers as <hi>Moses,</hi> and knew every hole in the Sea as well as hee: therefore there is no probability of this fabulous devise: it was <hi>the Lords doing, and it ought to be mervailous in our eyes:</hi> let us admire it, not carp at it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They passed through the Sea on dry land.</hi> Now though the tyde be gone, yet the land is not dry, the sand still is moist: but <hi>God</hi> by his omnipotent power <hi>divided the waters of the Sea,</hi> and made a dry path in the middest for them to goe over, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.29. <hi>Baij abashah, in arido.</hi> The note of similitude is left out.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Moses</hi> did this on the suddaine: he had no leysure to make choyse either of time or place, but when <hi>God</hi> had <hi>dryed up the Sea,</hi> then hee went into it with the <hi>Israelites. God</hi> made a way for them where there was no way. Let us admire it, not goe about to smeere it with the mire of mans invention.</p>
                  <p>This their passage <hi>through the Red Sea</hi> was a figure of <hi>baptisme,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. They were <hi>baptised unto Moses,</hi> that is, to obedience to the doctrine of <hi>Moses; in the Red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Israelites</hi> had no way out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but by the <hi>red Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They must passe through it into the land of promise. So we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, (as the Fathers teach,) have no way to heaven, but by <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme:</hi> We must passe through <hi>baptisme,</hi> into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="512" facs="tcp:12681:264"/>2. The <hi>waters being as a wall</hi> on both sides, <hi>they passed through the Sea</hi> as through a deepe grave and ditch: so <hi>baptisme</hi> must be the grave and buryall of sinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>came out of the Sea:</hi> So we in <hi>baptisme</hi> must rise out of the grave of sinne.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As <hi>they in the Sea had the waters on both sides:</hi> so wee that are <hi>baptised</hi> must expect the <hi>waves</hi> and surges <hi>of temptations on all sides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>In the Sea the Aegytians were drowned,</hi> which were enemies to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> so <hi>in baptisme,</hi> sinne, Satan, Hell, damnation, all the enemies of our salvation have their overthrow.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>By the Sea the Israelites were saved,</hi> and <hi>by baptisme we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, it is <hi>the salvation of Gods elect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore this <hi>passage of the Red Sea</hi> is not lightly <hi>to bee passed over,</hi> wee must dwell in the meditation of it: the <hi>Lord</hi> doth often harpe upon this string in the Scriptures, because it doth afford us sweete musicke.</p>

                  <p>The first sixe dayes they compassed the City but once: on the seventh day they compassed it seven <hi>times:</hi> at the length the <hi>Priests sounded with the trumpets,</hi> at the hearing whereof <hi>they gave a great shoute,</hi> and then on the suddaine <hi>the walls fell downe.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 The <hi>compassing of it</hi> so many dayes together might seeme childish and ridiculous: once <hi>compassing</hi> to mans judgement had beene as good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 All this while they <hi>make no noyse,</hi> they might <hi>not speake a word</hi>:<note place="margin">Ioshua 6.10.</note> which was an exercise of their <hi>faith,</hi> especially if there were any women in their company.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Every day they went in danger of their lives, when they <hi>went about the wals.</hi> Some might have cast downe Milstones upon them, and have brained a great number of them, as a Woman served <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech:</hi> or when they were in their procession about the City, they of <hi>Ierico</hi> might have made an irruption, and set upon them: but for so much as GOD had sayd, <hi>within seven dayes Ierico shall be yours,</hi> they believe the promise of GOD, despising all things, that might oppose themselves to it: this was an act of <hi>faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> insist in this? why doth hee not rather say, <hi>by faith Ioshua made the Sunne to stand?</hi> that was greater then the fall of <hi>Iericho.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some answer, because in the overthrow of <hi>Iericho, Ioshua</hi> was a <hi>type</hi> of our <hi>Saviour Christ. Iericho</hi> hath her name of <hi>Iareach,</hi> the Moone. Now <hi>the Moone</hi> in Scripture represents <hi>the world.</hi> As <hi>Ioshua</hi> made <hi>Iericho</hi> to fall by trumpets of <hi>Rams hornes:</hi> So <hi>Christ</hi> our spirituall <hi>Ioshua</hi> subdued <hi>the world</hi> by twelve men, as by twelve trumpets: but that is farre fetched, even <hi>beyond the Moone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle maketh choyse of this, because <hi>Iericho</hi> stood in the entrance of the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> now we may <hi>ex ungue leonem.</hi> As their first victory came of <hi>faith,</hi> so did all the rest: by <hi>faith</hi> at the length they conquered the whole Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Heere we have many instructions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Faith</hi> is the best weapon to goe to warre withall: not Bils, Bowes and Guns, Swords and Daggers, Muskets, Pistols, Cannons and <hi>Demi</hi>-Cannons, strong Iron Engins to undermine and scall wals withall.

                  </p>
                  <p>So these externall weapons are to be provided, but the greatest of all is <hi>faith.</hi> All these without <hi>faith</hi> can doe little good: <hi>faith</hi> without all these can doe much good. <hi>By faith Gideon</hi> with three thousand men overcame the <hi>Midianites: by faith</hi> little <hi>David</hi> and <hi>unarmed</hi> too slew great <hi>Goliah</hi> that was <hi>well armed: by faith Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> put three Nations to flight, an exceeding great multitude that came against him: <hi>by faith Ionathan and his Armour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By <hi>faith</hi> one shall chase a thousand, and an hundred put ten thousand to flight. Therefore it were to be wished, that when we are to fight in battell, choyse might be made of honest Souldiers. When a muster is made, we chuse stout and valiant men, expert Souldiers, such as can handle a Sword or a Gunne well: they bee good; but Souldiers indued with <hi>faith,</hi> are the best warriers. As the <hi>heathen</hi> man sayd, he had rather have one <hi>Vlysses,</hi> then ten <hi>Aiaces:</hi> so it were better for us to have one <hi>faithfull</hi> honest godly man in a Camp, then ten Souldiers that can quaffe and swill, sweare and swagger, yea though they bee lusty men of body. Why was <hi>Elias</hi> called <hi>the Charets and horsemen of Israel?</hi> for his <hi>faith</hi> and prayers that hee made for Israel: not in regard of any bodily strength.

If our Preachers were flaunting oratours, if their Sermons were such eloquent orations as <hi>Demosthenes's</hi> and <hi>Tullies,</hi> it were something: but shall a rude kinde of speaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with the power of GODS Spirit, save soules?

                  <p>It is sayd, that <hi>Iericho was compassed about seven dayes:</hi> Now one of those seven must be the <hi>Sabbath</hi>; therefore some works might be done on their Sabbath day, and so on the Lords day now. Here we are to distinguish: some are our own workes, and some <hi>Gods</hi> works; our owne workes are the workes of our calling, and the workes of our Nature, which are <hi>sinnes</hi>; both these must cease on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day</hi>; wee may not goe to plow and Cart <hi>on that day,</hi> much lesse may wee kill, steale, commit adultery, bee drunken on that day.</p>

By the instrumentall cause, 2. By the estate of the party preserved, 3. By the goodnesse of God extended to her, 4. By the motive of her preservation.</p>
                  <p>Not by any strength or prwes of her owne, for shee was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and by force could not have wrastled out of this danger.</p>
                  <p>Her <hi>faith</hi> shineth cleerely, as in a Chrystall glasse, <hi>Ios.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>By faith</hi> she was perswaded that GOD had given them the Land, although as yet they were not firmely settled in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 She reckons up the wonderfull workes, which <hi>God</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had done for them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>All these are lively demonstrations of her faith.</p>
                  <p>Though shee did speake nothing of the promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> the true and proper object of <hi>faith:</hi> yet it may bee, shee had some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of that heavenly mystery, specially before the spies depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of her house; they perceiving good affections in her alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might Catechize her further in the principles of religion: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that she had <hi>faith.</hi>

                  <p>Where first it may be demanded, how she came by <hi>faith? Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>faith</hi> comes by hearing of the Word: there were no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in <hi>Iericho:</hi> the trumpet of the Word Preached did not sound in that Citty.

The Preaching of the Word is the ordinary meanes whereby wee come to <hi>faith:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> is not tyed to that: he may worke <hi>faith</hi> in men and women by extraordinary meanes.</p>

Indeed the Scripture saith, <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge:</hi> he will <hi>judge</hi> them, though they bee his owne children, with temporall plagues in this life, for their owne instruction, and the terror of others, as he did <hi>David; The childe borne in adultery dyed,</hi> all his fasting and crying would not serve the turne: hee lay with <hi>Vriahs</hi> Wife. GOD stirred up his owne Son to lye with <hi>his wives. David lay with Bathshebah in secret. Absalom lay with his wives, in the open sight of all Israel.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> judged him for it. Yet <hi>David</hi> escaped eternall <hi>judgement.</hi> There is no sin, but the sponge of repentance will wipe it away. If they that have <hi>sinned against the Holy Ghost,</hi> could <hi>repent,</hi> they might have beene saved. <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them to be renewed to repentance</hi>; therefore they are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but <hi>at what time soever a sinner repenteth, &amp;c.</hi> Let drunkards, thieves, murtherers, harlots, <hi>repent,</hi> and GOD will receive them into the lap of his mercy. But what is repentance? not a knock on the breast, a sigh, a sob, a teare only, but a changing of the minde, a forsaking of sin, and an imbracing of vertue: <hi>declinare à malo, &amp; facere bonum,</hi> that is <hi>repentance.</hi> He hath not <hi>repented</hi> of his <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse</hi> that is sorry for it to day, and goes to it againe to morrow: he hath not <hi>repented</hi> of his <hi>uncleannesse,</hi> that grieves for it a time, and <hi>returnes with the Swine to the wallowing in the mire.</hi>

They would not obey <hi>God,</hi> they stood out with him at the staves end, &amp; would not yeeld themselves to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> had appointed.

                     <hi>Rahab in faith obeyed the wil of God,</hi> submitted her self to him, therfore she perished not in the common destruction of the <hi>City: the Lord knows how to deliver the righteous, and to reserve the wicked to the day of wrath.</hi> The <hi>world was drowned,</hi> but <hi>Noah</hi> was <hi>saved</hi>; the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> were <hi>destroyed,</hi> but <hi>Lot</hi> was <hi>preserved:</hi> all <hi>Iericho</hi> went to the pot, but <hi>Rahab perished not with them.</hi> Thus graciously dealt the <hi>Lord</hi> with his children.</p>

                     <pb n="519" facs="tcp:12681:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>But was <hi>Rahab</hi> alone preserved? No verily,<note place="margin">Ios. 6.23.</note> but all that were in the house with her: her father, kinsfolke, &amp;c. What, had they all <hi>faith,</hi> as well as she, that they <hi>perished not?</hi> That cannot be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the Scripture. <hi>Rahabs</hi> faith is commended; not a word of theirs, yet they were exempted from the temporall calamity for her sake, <hi>The justmust live eternally by his own faith:</hi> yet for outward &amp; externall blessings they may fare the better for the <hi>faithfuls sake. Cursed</hi> Cham <hi>was saved from drowning for</hi> Noahs <hi>sake. God blessed the house of the Egyptian, for Iosephs sake. All that were in the Ship,</hi> though some prophane Mariners were in it, <hi>were saved for</hi> S. <hi>Pauls sake.</hi> Behold then what a blessed thing it is to be in the families of good Men and Women. You may escape many fearefull calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their sakes. GOD will not only extend his mercy to them, but to all that be in their houshold: whereas it is dangerous being with the wicked and irreligious. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> would not goe into the Bath where <hi>Cerinthius</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>But why did they not put her to the sword, as well as others? what induced them to spare her? Surely their owne <hi>Promise</hi> which they had given her, ratified with an <hi>oath. Ioshua</hi> had a speciall care of that, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 6.22.</p>
                  <p>Which may be a fruitfull caveat to us all, to make conscience of our <hi>words</hi> and <hi>promises. Promise</hi> is a <hi>debt,</hi> and every honest man will have a care to pay his <hi>debts.</hi> Though that be counted a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie now a dayes; yet the <hi>Israelites</hi> according to <hi>promise,</hi> tooke <hi>Rahab,</hi> set her safe out of the Citie, before they slew the rest. <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus a Heathen man kept his word with his enemies,</hi> though it cost him his life: but we that be <hi>Christians, will not keepe our words with our friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Especially <hi>if our promise bee bound with an oath,</hi> as theirs was: let not a world make us to breake it. <hi>Iuramentum est res sacra.</hi> Let not that be violated. But <hi>must all oathes bee kept?</hi> because <hi>Herod swore to give the Damosell whatsoever she asked, did he well for his oaths sake to give her Iohn Baptists head?</hi> No verily. There be <hi>two</hi> that may be hindred <hi>by our keeping of our oathes, God, and our selves.</hi> If we have <hi>sworne, though it be to our own hindrance,</hi> let us keepe it:<note place="margin">Psal. 15.4.</note> but if it be to GODS <hi>hinderance,</hi> to the <hi>dishonour of God,</hi> let us not <hi>keepe them.</hi> Hast thou sworne in an anger, never to come at such a Mans house? be sorry for it. Hast thou sworn in a fury to kil a man? grieve for it, and breake that <hi>oath.</hi> But is it a lawfull thing which thou hast <hi>sworne,</hi> tending to GOD's glory, and the good of thy brethren? Thou art now in an holy bond, the breach whereof God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Therefore looke to it: let nothing cause thee to infringe thine <hi>oath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet now adayes <hi>oathes</hi> are nothing: men are become meere <hi>Atheists: they think there is no God:</hi> they <hi>may sweare, for sweare,</hi> abuse his Name at their pleasure; <hi>tush, God sees it not.</hi> A monstrous height of impiety, whereunto we are growen! Words, writings, bonds, <hi>oathes</hi> are nothing, if there be no law to compell us to the keeping of them.</p>

                     <pb n="520" facs="tcp:12681:268"/>Hast thou <hi>sworne,</hi> and that before a Iudge, which is a certaine <hi>god</hi> on the earth, to say the <hi>truth,</hi> the <hi>whole truth,</hi> and <hi>nothing but the truth, So God save thee by Iesus Christ?</hi> discharge that <hi>oath</hi> with feare and reverence.

Let us keepe this <hi>oath,</hi> not for feare, but for conscience sake. An <hi>oath</hi> is an edge-toole, dally not with it.

Rahab</hi> is a <hi>Cananite,</hi> therefore let us <hi>not keepe our oath</hi> with her.</p>
                  <p>The cause of her preservation was the peaceable <hi>entertaining of the Spies:</hi> which was a lively demonstration of her faith: shee knew them to bee their enemies, yet shee shutteth not the doores against them; hence ye villaines, ye come to <hi>espie</hi> the weaknesse of our Citie, yee shall not set a foot into my house; but readily and willingly she <hi>takes them in</hi>: there she hides them from the cruelty of the King: she conducts them safely away againe. This was <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen fidei:</hi> if she had not beleeved GOD and his promises; shee would never have done it. All this while she hazarded her owne life: if her house had beene searched, and the <hi>Spies</hi> found with her, it had cost her her head, she had beene drawne, hanged, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for a traitor; yet knowing they were <hi>Gods people,</hi> and that <hi>God had delivered the Citie into their hands,</hi> though it were with danger of life, they should be her ghests, and she would keepe them: this was <hi>actus fidei,</hi> it could be no other. <hi>My life,</hi> said S. <hi>Paul, is not deere to me, so as I may fulfill my course with joy.</hi> So said <hi>Rahab, My life is not deere to me, so as I may fulfill the will of God.</hi> They that have a true <hi>faith</hi> indeed, will venter even their lives in <hi>Gods</hi> causes.</p>
                  <p>It is like, as she was an <hi>harlot,</hi> so she was an <hi>Inkeeper</hi> too. Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture some signe hung at her doore, which made the <hi>Spies</hi> to take that house: but undoubtedly, <hi>God</hi> by the secret finger of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence directed them to this <hi>Harlots</hi> house, for the saving of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule too. When she hath once taken the charge of them, she discharges the duty of a good <hi>Inkeeper,</hi> no hurt shall come to her Ghests: yet in some <hi>Innes</hi> in <hi>England</hi> many a one have had their throats cut, even with the consent of the <hi>Host</hi> and <hi>Hostesse.</hi> Vile beasts, farre unlike to <hi>Rahab</hi>!</p>
                  <p>But is this such a worthy act, such a notable worke, to bee so highly extolled by the pen of the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> It was stained with two foule blots, with <hi>treason</hi> and <hi>a lye.</hi> 1. <hi>Iericho</hi> was her native Citie, the mother in whose lap she had sitten quietly many yeeres together, and doth she now <hi>betray</hi> it into the hands of the enemie? now fie upon her Traitor! It is a <hi>bad bird that defiles her owne nest:</hi> it is an ungracious bird, that destroyes her owne nest. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is easie. In this <hi>Rahab</hi> shewed her selfe <hi>faithfull</hi> to <hi>God, rather
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:12681:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
than unfaithful</hi> to her Countrey. Al the Countreys in the world are his. The Devill said, <hi>All these are mine,</hi> but he lied: <hi>God</hi> may truly say of all the Kingdomes of the Earth, <hi>All these are Mine, &amp; I give them to whom I will.</hi> Now <hi>Rahab</hi> knew, <hi>that</hi> God <hi>had given Iericho to the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.</hi> Therefore she joynes with <hi>God</hi> in introducing them into the Land. Where did <hi>God</hi> ever say, that he hath given <hi>England</hi> into the <hi>Popes</hi> hand? Therfore some of our <hi>English</hi> Iesuites are most unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and divelish to goe about to betray it into his hands. <hi>Rahab</hi> shall be rejoycing in heaven, when they without repentance are howling in hell. The other blot wherewith this fact was stained, was a <hi>lye.</hi> That is apparant, it cannot be denied, it cannot be coloured: shee said, <hi>they were gone, and wished them to pursue after them,</hi> when they <hi>were on the roofe of her house, covered with the stalkes of flax. Origen</hi> said, we may used <hi>a lye, Tanquam medicamento &amp; condimento.</hi> But this we will not defend, wee will seeke no cloake for it. Wee will not say it was a <hi>profitable lye</hi>; therefore warantable: for wee may not doe ill, that good may come of it. Yet we will distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>fact,</hi> and the <hi>blemish of the fact.</hi> It may be a good <hi>Horse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 13.7.</note> though he stumble now and then: it may be a good <hi>garden,</hi> though there be some <hi>weeds</hi> in it: she may be a <hi>faire Woman,</hi> though she have a <hi>wart,</hi> and that in her face too: so it may be a <hi>good worke,</hi> though it be <hi>defiled</hi> with the spot of some weaknesse and infirmities. This is enough to prove that <hi>Rahab</hi> was not justified in the sight of GOD by this worke, because some pitch of impiety did cleave unto it: yet for all that the <hi>worke</hi> was <hi>good,</hi> and well pleasing to GOD. If God should accept of none of his childrens <hi>workes</hi> because they be <hi>imperfect,</hi> he might worthily reject all. <hi>In many things we sin all.</hi> Perfect Saints are in heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Imperfect</hi> here on earth: yet we doe not affirme that the <hi>workes of the faithfull are Merae Sordes &amp; inquinamenta.</hi> Though there is filthinesse in them, yet they be not filthy. There may be a <hi>spot of inke,</hi> or a little <hi>dirt on the face</hi> of a beautifull <hi>Absalom,</hi> yet he is no foule man: there is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>staring and starke mad.</hi>

                  <p>But who were they that perished? <hi>They that obeyed not,</hi> that would not be perswaded to yeeld themselves to GOD: and who were they? looke <hi>Ios.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Men women and children.</hi> As for the <hi>men and women,</hi> there might be some reason, because they were <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> and resisted <hi>God:</hi> but why were the <hi>children</hi> put to death? As <hi>David</hi> cried in the pestilence, <hi>I have sinned, but as for these sheep, what have they done?</hi> So it might be said, as for them of the elder sort, it made no matter for them, but as for the children, those little Lambes, <hi>what had they done?</hi> 1. We are not to dispute with <hi>God. Iusta judicia Dei, licet occulta.</hi> 2. They were <hi>the brood of rebellious parents,</hi> conceived and borne in sin, therefore they might justly perish with their parents, <hi>Liberi partes parentum:</hi> a young Serpent may be killed, because he may poyson, though actually he cannot poyson, as the old doth.

                  <p n="1">1 He was a man of no great account in the eye of the world, a poore man, by his owne confession. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6.15. and he was a thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Angell appeared to him: yet the Lord made him a thresher of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and a <hi>Iudge</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 Though he be heere extolled for his <hi>faith,</hi> yet his <hi>faith</hi> at the first was marvellous weake and staggering. GODS bare word will not serve the turne, he must have three signes for the confirmation of him.

Thus at the length with much adoe, he sets on them being haled to it: yet this <hi>faith</hi> of his is not onely allowed, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded too.

                  <p>The second is <hi>Barac</hi>; His <hi>faith</hi> likewise was not very strong: hee would not enter upon the worke without a woman, he would not set a foote out of the doores without <hi>Deborah:</hi> therefore the honour of the victory redounded upon <hi>Iael.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 4.8.</note> Yet in confidence of <hi>Gods</hi> protection he went forth, encountred with <hi>Sisera's</hi> Army, and overthrew it.

                  <p>There is one onely Spunge which may seeme to wipe him out of the Catalogue of the <hi>faithfull: hee killed his owne selfe:</hi> yet even that also proceeded from <hi>faith,</hi> as Saint <hi>August.</hi> well defendeth it, <hi>de civit. dei. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>cont. secundam epist.

                  <p>Hee was <hi>hunted</hi> up and downe by <hi>Saul, as a partridge on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines:</hi> he could never be quiet for him, he went continually in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, and could never get the peace of him. After he came to the Crowne, he was molested by the house of <hi>Saul</hi> sundry yeeres together: his owne sonne had like to have justled him out of his kingdome: the pestilence in his time was sore in Israel: many inward conflicts had he in his soule, as appeareth by his Psalmes: <hi>Why art thou disquieted in me, O my Soule? hath God forgotten to bee mercifull?</hi> He fought with hell and damnation: yet <hi>by faith</hi> he was a glorious Conquerour over them all: therefore no marvell though hee be in the catalogue of <hi>faithfull men.</hi>

                  <p>All shall <hi>rise againe,</hi> good and bad. <hi>Cain</hi> shall <hi>rise</hi> with the <hi>same hand</hi> wherewith he slew his brother: <hi>Iesabel</hi> with the <hi>same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> that was eaten up by the Dogs: <hi>Rabsekeh</hi> with the <hi>same tongue,</hi> wherewith he railed on the <hi>God of Israel: Iudas,</hi> with the <hi>same lips,</hi> wherewith he trayterously betrayed our Saviour <hi>Christ: Turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coats,</hi> like <hi>Ecebolius,</hi> shall rise; but they shall rise with horror of conscience.

                     <hi>All examples are written for our learning.</hi> It is a true speech that Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath; <hi>amplius proficitur exemplo, quàm admonitione:</hi> he renders three reasons of it.</p>

This <hi>cloud of witnesses</hi> is for our imitation.</p>

                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:12681:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>It would grieve a man to walke in a way alone. <hi>I onely am left,</hi> said <hi>Elias.</hi> If we were alone in this <hi>race,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Reg. 19.10.</note> we might be loath to <hi>run it:</hi> but we are not <hi>alone,</hi> we have a <hi>cloud of witnesses,</hi> a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that have broken the ice before us, and that <hi>run with us</hi> at this present day: we are compassed about with one <hi>cloud of witnesses</hi> in the Old Testament, with an other in the New. The blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> all the Apostles, and many excellent men and women: with a third cloud of witnesses in the Primitive Church: Many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Martyrs, that have <hi>gone through many tribulations</hi> into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: Therefore having <hi>so many</hi> fellow runners, let us cheerefully <hi>run the race set before us.</hi> If we were all alone, it might be some discomfort: wee are not alone, wee have <hi>great</hi> company, and <hi>good company</hi> too. If a man have <hi>good company</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> though the way be foule, it will encourage him to goe. We have <hi>good company</hi> to the celestiall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a cloud of witnesses to goe with us. Therefore though the <hi>way</hi> bee somewhat unpleasant to flesh and bloud, yet let us take it: though we fare hard by the way, yet wee with all our company shall have good cheere at our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end, we shall <hi>eate of the hidden Mannah, and of the tree of life, that growes in the middest of the Paradise of</hi> God.</p>
                  <p>The impediments to be removed are two: the one without, the other within. He doth not say, let us lessen it, get companie to helpe us to beare it; but, <hi>let us cast it quite away. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, Omnem molem, every weight:</hi> not some part, but the whole burthen. They that <hi>run,</hi> will have nothing to trouble them, so neere as they can: they will <hi>cast off all,</hi> even their very clothes oftentimes, to their very shirts. So in this our spirituall race, we must be as light as may be: therefore <hi>we must cast away every thing that presseth downe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They may be reduced to these three Heads: honour, riches, pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel ran</hi> with <hi>honour, Dan.</hi> 2.48. <hi>David</hi> with a kingdome: but if <hi>honour</hi> hinder us, if it bee a burthen, that wee cannot travell with it to the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> away with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses refused</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Egypt</hi>; CHRIST <hi>refused</hi> to be made a King, because it was a clog to him, and would hinder him in his Office. <hi>Latimer</hi> cast away a Bishoprick.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that <hi>presseth downe,</hi> is riches. In themselves they are not weights, but wings. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a rich man, yet <hi>ran:</hi> yet many times, howsoever we are desirous to loade our selves with them, they <hi>presse us downe,</hi> and <hi>hinder</hi> us exceedingly in our <hi>race.</hi> The <hi>Young man</hi> was so laden with his wealth, that he could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ. Can a Bird flye when she is in a snare? can a Man goe when he is fettered? <hi>Riches</hi> are snares, yea the devils snares, which is a strong and cunning Fowler: therefore beware how yee are intangled in them. Ye may have <hi>riches:</hi> and yet not be had of <hi>rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:</hi> if they be <hi>weights</hi> and <hi>incumbrances, Martha thou art cumbred about many things,</hi> then away with them: these <hi>Camels</hi> hardly go to heaven. It had beene better for the Young Man to have parted
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:12681:277"/>
with his <hi>riches,</hi> than with CHRIST. Many a <hi>rich</hi> Man is so <hi>pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed downe</hi> with his wealth, with the cares of the world, about Sheep and Oxen, Silver and Gold, as that he cannot goe to Church, hee can finde no time to pray, to read Scripture, to occupie himselfe in heavenly meditations.</p>
                  <p>How can he <hi>run the race</hi> that leadeth to heaven? <hi>If thy eye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, cut it out:</hi> much more, if thy <hi>riches</hi> offend thee, if they clog thee in this <hi>race,</hi> away with them: it is better to goe a <hi>poore</hi> man to heaven, than a <hi>rich</hi> man to hell. If a man be <hi>pressed</hi> to death, though it be with gold, what gets he by it? And if thou be <hi>pressed</hi> to eternall death, though it be by thy <hi>golden riches,</hi> what doth it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thee? The <hi>Mariners, Ion.</hi> 1.5. for the saving of their lives, <hi>cast away their goods,</hi> and with their owne hands hurled them into the sea: and for the saving of our soules, shall we not cast away our goods? shall we suffer them to drowne us, and that in everlasting perdition? <hi>whatsoever presses thee downe, cast it away.</hi> If an Executor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Stewardship, Lordship, multitude of Farmes, <hi>presse thee downe,</hi> and make thee to have an ill conscience before God and Man too, <hi>cast it away.</hi> But we love our burthens too well: we had rather lose heaven, than them.</p>
                  <p>The third thing that <hi>presseth down</hi> is <hi>pleasure, Luke</hi> 21.34. Surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkennesse are great pressers. We may run with drink and wine, but not with drunkennesse. When a mans belly is full, he is unfit to run in a bodily <hi>race,</hi> much more in the spirituall <hi>race.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and prayer are good for this <hi>race:</hi> fornication and adultery are <hi>Heavie burthens to presse us downe, Hos.</hi> 4.11. they take away the heart: no heart to run, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. <hi>The voluptuous person is dead while he lives.</hi> That man in the Gospell said, <hi>I have married a wife, therefore I cannot come:</hi> how much more will an adulterer say, I have gotten a whore, I must solace my selfe with her; therefore <hi>I cannot come?</hi> Let them <hi>runne</hi> that will, <hi>I cannot runne</hi> the race of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>let us cast away every thing that presseth downe,</hi> bee it never so neere or deere to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 5.18.</note>This universall particle is worthy to bee observed: every thing. Some flatter themselves in one thing or other. <hi>In this the Lord bee mercifull unto mee,</hi> as <hi>Naaman</hi> said. <hi>Herod cast away many things,</hi> but his sweet sin of Incest he would not <hi>cast away.</hi> A drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard will <hi>cast away</hi> any thing, save his drunkennesse; in this, <hi>the Lord be mercifull unto me,</hi> that I may take a cup of <hi>Nimis</hi> now and then. A covetous miser will <hi>cast away</hi> any thing, save his love of money: In this, <hi>the Lord be mercifull unto me,</hi> that I may keepe my purse. I will come to the Church, but I will give nothing, so neere as I can. I but we <hi>must cast away everything that presseth downe,</hi> lest we misse the gold of eternall glory. <hi>My life</hi> sayes S. <hi>Paul, is not deere unto me, so as I may fulfill my course with joy</hi>; and shall our pleasures and profits be so deere to us, that they shall keepe us from fulfilling our course? Let us <hi>cast every thing away,</hi> rather than perish eternally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="539" facs="tcp:12681:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>But there is one thing which above all others we must strive to <hi>cast away</hi> .i. <hi>the sin</hi>: this is ready to give us a fall at every turne: it is <hi>inclusus hostis.</hi> The Snaile carries his house with him: but we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our enemy with us. The Snake of Originall sin is in our bosome, wheresoever we become.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That doth so easily compasse us about.</hi> As a paire of Compasses that compasse the whole Circle: so doth this the whole man. It compasses about our soules and bodies, our eyes, eares, hands, feet, and is ready alwayes to molest and stop us in our <hi>race:</hi> therefore away with it.</p>
                  <p>There be two compassers; the one is Sathan, <hi>he compasses the earth to and fro</hi>; the other is our owne corruption, that <hi>compasses</hi> all men on the earth.

                  <p>The <hi>foundation</hi> being layed, he comes to the <hi>building</hi> it selfe, and sets the admonition on it. The <hi>race</hi> that we must <hi>run</hi> is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the efficient cause, and the manner of our <hi>running.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth not say, <hi>run you,</hi> and I will sit still; but <hi>let us run.</hi> All must <hi>run.</hi> Ministers and People, Magistrates and Subjects.</p>
                  <p>We must not goe, but <hi>run:</hi> not creepe like Snailes, but <hi>runne</hi> like Roes. Our life is not compared to a sitting, but to a walking or <hi>running:</hi> yet we must not be like foolish <hi>runners,</hi> that <hi>run</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of breath at the first. Faire and softly goes farre. Wee must not come in such a rash and heady zeale, as that we <hi>runne</hi> quite out of the Church, as some doe. Let us <hi>run,</hi> but wisely and discreetly.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>race?</hi> not that which is <hi>set before us by the devill,</hi> the <hi>race</hi> of pride, envie, hatred, malice, contention: the <hi>race</hi> of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, uncleannesse, &amp;c. but <hi>the race that is set before us by God,</hi> the <hi>race of Christianity,</hi> cleaving stedfastly to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Gospell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By God Almighty.</hi> Hee hath appointed to every one his <hi>race</hi>; some a longer, some a shorter. Some have many crosses, some few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: all have some. Yet, <hi>let us all run this race.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 How long must we <hi>run?</hi> not for a while, but to the end. Not <hi>run</hi> while we be young men, till our <hi>juvenilis ardor</hi> be a little over, as many doe: but though we be old <hi>Mnasons,</hi> we must <hi>run</hi> still: never cease <hi>running,</hi> till we cease breathing. <hi>I have finished my course,</hi> sayes S. <hi>Paul.</hi> We must <hi>never leave running, till our course be finished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 How must we <hi>run?</hi> with patience. This must be the staffe,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36.

                  <p>So wee have <hi>joy set before us, Rom.</hi> 8.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. This <hi>joy</hi> was the everlasting glory hee should have in his owne person, and in his body the Church, which by his <hi>sufferings</hi> should be assumed into heaven to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Endured the Crosse.</hi> Though it were a <hi>cruell death.</hi> 1. It was <hi>long,</hi> he was many houres a dying on the Crosse. 2. It was <hi>ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,</hi> betweene two Thieves. 3. It was <hi>cursed, Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ suffered</hi> foure kindes of wayes. 1. <hi>Libenter,</hi> for the joy. 2. <hi>Graviter,</hi> the Crosse. 3. <hi>Turpiter,</hi> shame. 4. <hi>Vtiliter,</hi> sitteth at the right hand of the Throne of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And despised the shame.</hi> To <hi>endure</hi> was much: but this was much greater. <hi>Shame</hi> goes to the heart of many. <hi>Christ despised it:</hi> hee <hi>regarded it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Shame</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> was wonderfull great: being <hi>Lord</hi> of all, he took on him the <hi>forme of a servant.</hi> Is it not a <hi>shame</hi> for a King to be in a beggars weede? his supposed Father was a Carpenter, his Mother a poore woman, brought to bed in a stable, hee had not an hole to hide his head in, he was spit on, blindfolded, buffeted, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Herod</hi> and his Souldiers, pittifully whipped. Loe here is the man! derided in a manner of all, when he hung on the Crosse. Yet <hi>Christ</hi> counted all this <hi>nothing in regard of the joy. Christ</hi> will not be ashamed of us, when he <hi>comes in glory with his holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What fruit hath hee by it? what is his reward? <hi>he sits at the right hand of the Throne of God, Hebr.</hi> 1.3.8, 1.</p>
                  <p>If a man have an excellent <hi>runner,</hi> before him; the sight of him, will make him to run more couragiously: why should not I <hi>run</hi> on as well as he? <hi>Alexander</hi> would <hi>run,</hi> if he might have Kings to <hi>run</hi> withall. Therefore here he propounds a notable example to us.</p>
                  <p>We may looke to the Patriarckes before and after the floud: to <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>David</hi> and all the Prophets, to the <hi>blessed Virgin Mary</hi> and the Holy Apostles: but especially wee must <hi>look to Christ:</hi> he is <hi>exemplar exemplarium:</hi> he <hi>ran</hi> without <hi>sin,</hi> all others with sinne: he <hi>ranne</hi> and never took a fall, all the rest <hi>fell</hi> at one time or another. Therefore let our eye be chiefely on him. To whom should the servant <hi>looke,</hi> rather than to his <hi>Lord</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? The Souldier rather than to his Captaine? The Wife, rather than to her Husband? <hi>Christ</hi> is our Captaine, Head and Husband,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.20. Iud. 9.38.</note> our <hi>forerunner</hi> into heaven: therfore let us in this <hi>race looke to him.</hi> As <hi>Abimelech</hi> said to his followers, <hi>as yee see mee doe, make hast and doe the like:</hi> so sayes <hi>Christ</hi> to us, as yee see me <hi>run,</hi> so <hi>run</hi> yee. I have <hi>run</hi> through thicke and thinne, prosperity and adversity, good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and evill, death and life: so doe yee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="542" facs="tcp:12681:279"/>How did CHRIST <hi>runne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who was so handled as <hi>Christ</hi> was? yet <hi>for the joy set before him he endured all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> and <hi>ran</hi> on to the very end. So let us doe.

                     <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment causeth unto us a farre more excellent, and an eternall weight of glory.</hi> This is it which bred such courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in the holy Martyrs, <hi>for the joy that was set before them:</hi> they were sawen in pieces, stoned, racked, put to the sword, broyled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live on hot Grydyrons. The consideration of this hony did swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all their <hi>afflictions.</hi> This made Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> to say to <hi>Latimer,</hi> come my brother, though we have an hard breakefast, yet wee shall have a comfortable dinner. So let this <hi>joy</hi> hearten us all. A Merchant and Marrinour <hi>endures</hi> many stormes and tempests for the haven that is set before them: a Souldiar <hi>endures</hi> the heate of the battell for the spoile: a sicke man <hi>endures</hi> better pills and potions, yea cutting, for the health set before him: and let us <hi>endure</hi> all calamities, sicknesse, poverty, banishment, imprisonment, death of friends and Children, losse of goods and of life, for the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable joy set before us:</hi> Such <hi>joyes, as neither eye hath seene, nor eare heard, neither ever entred into the heart of man to conceive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here our <hi>Saviour</hi> walked from towne to towne, preaching and working miracles: <hi>he sate weary on the well of Samaria</hi>; but now he <hi>sits at the right hand of God.</hi> Which is a signe of rest, and of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Iudges <hi>sit,</hi> Kings <hi>sit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And wee shall one day <hi>sit</hi> in heaven with him; <hi>that where I am, they also may be, Ioh.</hi> 17.24. We shall be in the same pallace of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with him, though not <hi>at the right hand of God</hi> with him. The Noble men and Courtiers are in the Court, though they bee not so neere the King, as the Kings Son is: we shall be with the <hi>Lamb, aray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in white robes, having palmes in our hands, and Crownes on our heads,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Christ endured</hi> much sorrow, but now he hath much glory: so shall it be with us: <hi>ye heard of the patience of Iob, and what end the Lord made.</hi> Affliction is sowre, but the end is sweete: we have a tragedy in this world, but wee shall have a Comedy in the world to come. Therefore let us <hi>run with patience and joy</hi>—There be <hi>two races,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills and <hi>Gods:</hi> as there be two wayes, the broad and narrow: if we <hi>run</hi> the <hi>devils race,</hi> in pride, covetousnesse, drunkennes, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the end of it will be <hi>wofull,</hi> wee shall bee tormented with the Devill and his Angels for ever: but if we <hi>run the race of God, looking to Iesus the author and finisher of our faith</hi>; the end shall be glorious and comfortable.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If wee respect the <hi>opprobrious speeches</hi> wherewith they laded him: all that could be devised: they <hi>upbraided</hi> him with <hi>his Father a Carpenter:</hi> by his <hi>brethren and sisters:</hi> by his <hi>Country, a Galilean, no good thing can come out of it:</hi> never a good bird in that nest. That was one of the least: they cast aspersions on his life, <hi>a bibber of wine, a friend of Publicans and sinners, a Samaritane; one that had a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> a <hi>Magitian,</hi> that wrought by the Devill, a <hi>coosener,</hi> a <hi>deceiver, Matth.</hi> 27.63. a <hi>seditious man,</hi> a perverter of the people, a rebell, that denyed to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> a <hi>mad</hi> man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.21. a <hi>Sabbath breaker,</hi> because he healed on the Sabbath day, a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> that intituled himselfe the Son of <hi>God.</hi> All that could be imagined, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If wee respect the manner how they <hi>reviled</hi> him: with
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:12681:280"/>
                     <hi>mockes, taunts, nodding</hi> of the head, <hi>spitting</hi> on him. They <hi>blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> him, they <hi>smote</hi> him, and then they said, <hi>prophesie ô Christ, who it is that smiteth thee.</hi> The manner was most ignominious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we respect the generality of the persons, that spake against him. <hi>All</hi> of all degrees did whet their tongues against him. <hi>Herod, Pilat,</hi> the Pharisees, the Sadduces, the rulers of the Church, his kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.3. The Thieves that were crucified with him, both at the first, though one repented; the Souldiers, the skumme of the Country. The whole people cryed with one voyce, <hi>away with him: no King but Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. What was hee against whom they threw the dirt of these vile and malignant speeches? <hi>Separate from sinners:</hi> in whom the most sharpe sighted Eagle of them all could not finde one spot of sinne. <hi>Which of you can rebuke mee of sinne?</hi> Hee did good to the whole Country, healed all diseases for nothing, hee preached the glad tydings of the Gospell; yet thus they rewarded him. He is the Butt at which they shoote their poysonfull arrowes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Consider him. David</hi> is worthy the <hi>considering,</hi> how patiently did hee beate <hi>Shimei?</hi> hee shewed himselfe more valiant in that, sayes S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> then in <hi>cutting off Goliahs Head.</hi> But that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this: he bore <hi>one Shimei; Christ bore many Shimeis. David</hi> was a <hi>sinner; Christ</hi> was none: yet <hi>he endured the speaking against of sinners.</hi> Let us <hi>consider him.</hi> Let him be in the mindes and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of us all: when wee are ill spoken of, let us <hi>consider Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was hard to be <hi>endured,</hi> yet <hi>he endured</hi> it. Neither was it <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence perforce</hi>; he might have curbed them, if he had listed: he might have caused their tongues to have beene eaten up with wormes, as <hi>Nestorius</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>Hee might have made them to drop out of their heads: hee might have called for a thunderbolt from heaven to strike them starke dead: he could have made the earth to have <hi>opened her mouth and swallowed them up quicke,</hi> as he did <hi>Core,</hi> that <hi>spake against Moses:</hi> yet he would not: <hi>he endured</hi> all.</p>
                  <p>We thinke much to bee <hi>ill spoken of:</hi> and I pray you what are we, in comparison of <hi>Christ?</hi> Was the Creator ill <hi>spoken of,</hi> and shall the Creatures stomacke it? did the <hi>Potter endure</hi> ill speeches, and shall not the <hi>Pots?</hi> did hee that <hi>knew no sinne,</hi> and shall not we that are <hi>full of sinne?</hi> did the LORD and <hi>Master,</hi> and shall not wee the <hi>servants?</hi> What? are wee greater than <hi>Christ? my Lord Ioab,</hi> said <hi>Vriah, lyes abroad in the field, and shall I goe to my house?</hi> So the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> passed the pikes of ill tongues,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> and shall we think to be freed from them?</p>
                  <p>There bee three things, that may comfort us against <hi>evill tongues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The consideration of <hi>Gods</hi> providence in all things. <hi>God</hi> carries a stroake in it: <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> said <hi>Eli, let him doe what seemeth him good. It may bee God hath bidden him to curse David,</hi> said that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Prophet; that stayed his hand: their <hi>tongues</hi> move against us,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:12681:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but it may bee <hi>God</hi> moves us, or suffers it so to be; either to try us withall, or to humble us for one thing or other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Testimony of thine owne conscience: if that accuse thee, weepe: if that excuse thee, laugh: that which they speake, is either true or false: if in be true, mourne for it, and amend it; if it be false, rejoyce in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Christs</hi> example must be never out of minde. An ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther professeth of himselfe, that when hee remembred that prayer of <hi>Christs,</hi> he could not find in his heart to be revenged of any. It was as a bridle to restraine him from revenge: So, as oft as we thinke on these words, <hi>consider him, that endured such speaking against of sinners</hi>; let them be a Bull-warke to us against <hi>evill tongues.</hi> Did he that was no sinner <hi>endure?</hi> and shall not we that be sinners <hi>endure ill speeches?</hi> There is none that can challenge a priviledge from <hi>ill tongues.</hi> Kings themselves are faine to swallow up many an ill word.</p>
                  <p>The persecution of the <hi>tongue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.29.</note> is a grievous persecution to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearts, more grievous than that of the hand. Mocks and taunts goe to the heart of men, and discourage many. In all these let us <hi>consider our Saviour Christ, that endured such contradiction of sinners:</hi> he had a loade of <hi>contumelious speeches</hi> lay'd on him; yet he endured them. Let <hi>Christs</hi> enduring make us to endure, and let them not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us in the race of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Let us take heed we be not accessary to his persecution. Some there be, that are never well, but when they be <hi>speaking</hi> ill of others. Their mouthes are like Mils that cannot grinde without foule wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A dangerous Plurisy! it were well that they were let bloud of that vaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Come,</hi> say they, <hi>Let us smite Ieremie with the tongue.</hi> Let us keep our hands off, but let us lay on loade with our tongues. This they thinke they may lawfully doe. <hi>Our tongues are our owne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 12.4.</note> 
                     <hi>who shall controll us?</hi> Nay, they be not your owne, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Of every idle word ye must give an account:</hi> much more of every <hi>rayling</hi> and <hi>back-byting word. The tongue is an unruly evill:</hi> but labour to rule it. As we sit at Table, by the Chimney side, let us not speak ill, but sound forth the praises of GOD, for CHRIST's comming into the world. S. <hi>Iames</hi> sets two brands on him, 1. He is a <hi>Coosener</hi>; whom doth hee deceive? not another, but himselfe.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.26.</note> 2. His religion is vaine; he may thinke highly of himselfe; yet he is a <hi>vaine</hi> man.</p>
                  <p>Some take a liberty to themselves to <hi>speake ill</hi> of those that be not as they are, so holy, so religious as they: thou shouldest rather pray for them, than speak ill of them. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.29. S. <hi>Paul</hi> wished <hi>that Agryppa, and all that were then present, were he was:</hi> but he did not raile on them; no more must we. If defects be in any, pray for the supply of them, but <hi>speake not ill</hi> of them behinde their backs. Let us remember, that in sinning against the brethren, we sin against <hi>Christ:</hi> let not one member persecute another: let <hi>Ismael</hi> doe it, but let not <hi>Isaac</hi> doe it.</p>
                  <p>Let us all arme our selves against malevolent tongues: let us
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:12681:281"/>
never dreame to live without ill words.<note place="margin">Luke 6.26.</note> Nay, S. <hi>Luke</hi> sayes, <hi>Woe be to you, when all men speake well of you.</hi> Let us alwayes remember this <hi>Item</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost, Consider him that endured such speaking against of sinners:</hi> that his example may be as <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> to keepe us from fainting.</p>

Let us resist in the defence of <hi>Christ</hi> and his Gospell, <hi>to the bloud. Christ</hi> hath shed his bloud for us, and shall not we shed ours for him? Many of the Heathen have given their bloud for their Countrey, and shall not wee give it for <hi>Christ</hi> and the Church, for the confirmation of it in the faith of <hi>Christ?</hi> Though we have stood out a long time in <hi>Christs</hi> quarrell, resisting the enemies of the Gospell, yet let us not set downe our staffe. Let us never think wee have resisted enough, till wee have resisted to bloud.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> gave us our bloud: <hi>Christ</hi> redeemed our bloud: <hi>Christ</hi> hath prepared heaven for us that be flesh and bloud: therefore it cannot be spent better than in his service.</p>
                  <p>But as for us, we yeeld our selves Captives to sin: we throw downe the bucklers, and suffer him to over-master us, there is no striving against sin. We strive one with another; every Towne is full or unneighbourly strifes, and unbrotherly contentions. We strive not against sin. Sin is the greatest enemie that we have: it will cut the throat of our soule, and banish us out of heaven; therefore
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:12681:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let us <hi>strive against it.</hi> Leave <hi>striving</hi> one with another, and let us all <hi>strive against sinne.</hi> We shall never bee Martyrs if we doe it not: for they that will not lay downe their sins for <hi>Christ,</hi> will never lay downe their lives for <hi>Christ.</hi>

                  <p>For he it is that <hi>chasteneth</hi> us, whatsoever the rod or instrument be, which he useth. Sometimes he <hi>chasteneth</hi> us by the Devill, as he did <hi>Iob:</hi> sometimes by creatures, fire and water, by men of our owne mold, yet alwayes the LORD <hi>chasteneth</hi> us. The <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims</hi> had killed <hi>Eli</hi> his two sons, and taken away the Arke: yet <hi>Eli</hi> said, <hi>it is the Lord:</hi> The <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> tooke away <hi>Iob's</hi> cattell: yet <hi>Iob</hi> sayes, the <hi>Lord hath taken away.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Afflictions</hi> come not by chance or fortune, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.9. but by the <hi>providence of God.</hi> Therefore let us not despise, but accept with meeknesse <hi>Gods chastenings.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. They in <hi>chastening</hi> us, oftentimes respect their owne ease and quietnesse, their owne credite, and commodity more than ours: or if they <hi>correct</hi> us for our profit, yet it is but for a temporall profit, that we runne not into outrages in the world, that we may lead a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill honest <hi>life</hi> among men: that is the marke most <hi>Parents</hi> aime at: Whereas <hi>the Father of spirits chasteneth us</hi> for our profit, he himselfe standeth not in neede of us: not only to make us civill men, <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum moralem quandam honestatem,</hi> but <hi>that we might be partakers of his holinesse:</hi> that we might be holy in soule and body in this life, and Citizens of the holy <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>Peace, ease, health, wealth, worldly prosperity through the corruption of our nature and the malice of Satan, makes us <hi>unholy.

We read of no filthinesse that <hi>David</hi> committed, while he was <hi>persecuted</hi> by <hi>Saul:</hi> when he came to his kingdome, and had peace from all his enemies, then he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>adultery.</hi> When a man hath his health, and when hee is of a strong and lusty constitution of body, he runs at randome, seldome or never thinkes on <hi>God,</hi> not with such zeale and sincerity, as hee ought to doe: on the other side, it is <hi>adversity</hi> that through <hi>Gods</hi> goodnesse makes us <hi>holy</hi> men. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was better in his sicknesse, than in his health. <hi>Manasses</hi> chaines were a meanes to rid him of the chaines of sin: when he was the King of <hi>Babels</hi> prisoner, he became the <hi>Lords</hi> free man. <hi>Davids</hi> long and tedious sicknesse, there being <hi>no rest in his bones because of his sin,</hi> did him much good: it made him to say, <hi>it is good for me, that I was afflicted.</hi> The <hi>sicknesse</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy engendreth the <hi>health</hi> of the soule: <hi>perijssemus, nisi perijssemus,</hi> said <hi>Themistocles</hi> to his Wife and Children, when they were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and found extraordinary favour at the hands of strangers. So wee may say; if our <hi>outward man</hi> had not perished by sicknesse, our <hi>inner man</hi> had perished. In the time of health, we are <hi>Martha</hi>'s, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away too much with the world. <hi>Sicknesse</hi> makes us <hi>Maries,</hi> to meditate more upon heavenly matters: that causes us to pray, and that with teares, <hi>to turne our faces to the wall,</hi> and take a farewell of the world, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did: <hi>to call our sins to remembrance,</hi> as 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.18.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us beare the <hi>chastisements</hi> of our wise and loving <hi>Father,</hi> that we may be <hi>partakers of his holinesse</hi> in this life, and of the holy <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>So some of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> began to <hi>halt betweene two Religions,</hi> Iudaisme and Christianisme.

                  <p>Wee will pause a little on the matter, wee will consider with our selves, whether it were best for us to be Christians or not. This <hi>halting</hi> hee would have removed, and wishes them <hi>to make straight steps,</hi> to goe on manfully in the profession of the Gospell, that no <hi>afflictions</hi> make them to <hi>halt.</hi>

                  <p>As for us, GOD be thanked for it, we live not in the time of <hi>persecution,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> did: wee are not spoiled of our goods, cast into prison, constrained to flye our native Country, carryed to the stake to be burnt for the name of CHRIST: we have a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Religious King, that is a nursing Father to the Church: yet the <hi>chastisements of the Lord</hi> are ryfe among us, because wee are <hi>not bastards; but Sonnes.</hi> When the first borne were destroyed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 12.30.</note> there was <hi>not one house of the Aegyptians, but one dead in it.</hi> There is scant one house among us, but there is one sicke or <hi>afflicted</hi> in it.

Neither are they of the worser sort, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, adulterers, atheists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but many of the better sort; good professours, sober, godly and religious men that are thus visited. Our heavenly father sees something amisse among us, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to send forth his rods into so many places. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was an excellent Church, yet S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes; <hi>for this cause,</hi> namely a negligent and disorderly receiving of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, <hi>many are weake, sicke, and sleepe among you.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> sees us to bee rocked asleepe, in security, to bee negligent in prayer, reading of Scripture, comming to Church: he sees the heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> of his Word, the food of our soules to be loathed in all places, men waxe too nise and dainty in hearing: he sees the Sacraments not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, men make small reckoning of these seales of faith.</p>
                  <p>For these causes <hi>many are weake and sicke among us:</hi> yet let us not

faint under these afflictions. <hi>Let us lift up our hands that hang downe,</hi> &amp;c. Let us consider who it is that striketh us: <hi>it is the</hi> LORD, said <hi>Eli,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is not an unlucky conjunction of Planets, they be not the dogge dayes which are the cause of these diseases: they are not simply to be imputed to the weather, or the time of the yeere. <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> that smiteth us, and <hi>let him doe what seemeth him good.</hi> Hee is our loving and mercifull Father in <hi>Christ Iesus, hee will lay no more on us then hee will enable us to beare,</hi> to our everlasting comfort in the end. <hi>We are chastned by the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned with the world.</hi> Hee suffers the wicked oftentimes to live in jollity: the rod of <hi>God</hi> is not upon them; <hi>they are not in trouble, as other men:</hi> but hee Schooles <hi>his owne Children,</hi> they shall seldome bee without some <hi>affliction</hi> or other, least they should bee drowned in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the world.

                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was at peace with the <hi>Pharisees:</hi> hee went to many of their houses to dinner: hee was at peace with <hi>Caesar,</hi> though he were a <hi>persecutor</hi> of the Church, and payd tribute to him: and wee may be <hi>at peace</hi> with all men throughout the wide compasse of the world: with Atheists, drunkards, adulterers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                  <p>Yet here two cautions are to be observed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee must distinguish betweene <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>familiarity</hi>: wee may bee at a generall <hi>peace,</hi> even with the enemies of <hi>God:</hi> but wee must not bee familiar with them. There is danger in that. <hi>All our delight must be on the Saints, that be on the earth:</hi> they must be our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee may bee <hi>at peace</hi> with the persons of all: but with the vices of none.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bee at peace</hi> with a drunkard, but not with his drunkennesse: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that, shew thy dislike of that.</p>
                  <p>But we are so far from <hi>being at peace with all,</hi> as that wee are not <hi>at peace</hi> with our neighbours, with them that dwell in the same towne, and professe the same Religion with us: there is heart bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, envy and malice, strifes and contentions even among us: nay, some are so farre from being <hi>at peace with all men,</hi> as that they are at peace with no man: like <hi>Ishmael, whose hand was against every man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee are so farre from <hi>following of peace,</hi> that wee will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, when it is offered. They <hi>seeke peace,</hi> and we refuse it. Such is our folly, wee had rather be following the Lawyers to our cost and smart, then to <hi>follow peace</hi> home to prevent Law.</p>
                  <p>Let us all bee <hi>followers of peace:</hi> let us <hi>follow it,</hi> let us seeke it by all meanes possible. The hunter followes the deere, though it run away: so let us doe <hi>peace,</hi> and lay hold on her whether shee will or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace</hi> is a singular thing. <hi>God</hi> is stiled the <hi>God of peace:</hi> he is not called the <hi>God</hi> of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.20.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. he doth not say, blessed are they that can talke gloriously of religion, but <hi>blessed are the peace makers:</hi> Why? <hi>for they shall be called the Children of God.</hi> They that be <hi>at peace</hi> are <hi>Gods Children:</hi> they that live in strifes and contention, are the <hi>Devils Children.</hi> The envious man sowed tares: hee it is that soweth the tares of discord and dissention. 3. Wee are members one of another: and shall we be at warre? <hi>Ioseph</hi> would not have his brethren to <hi>fall out by the way:</hi> We are <hi>brethren,</hi> and have <hi>one el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother,</hi> which is <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> shall we fall out one with another, and that upon every trifling occasion? It is a wonder to see what jarres there are betweene the professours of the Gospell, betweene neighbour and neighbour: scant two in a towne that love heartily and sincerely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="561" facs="tcp:12681:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>There be two especiall things that hinder <hi>peace:</hi> pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Pride</hi> is the Nurse of contention. There is I proud, and Thou proud: I stout, and Thou stout: none will bend, none will yeeld, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, though he were better than us every kinde of way.</p>
                  <p>The second is <hi>Covetousnesse.</hi> We are so much wedded to the world, the valour of an halfe penny will make us to contend. <hi>Why rather suffer yee not wrong?</hi> If every man were content to put up a little wrong, what <hi>peace</hi> would there be in the Towne? how should it flourish, to the credit of the Gospell, and comfort of us all?</p>
                  <p>The second vertue is <hi>holinesse.</hi> It might be objected: if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low peace with all men, then we must bid <hi>holinesse</hi> adieu. For some will not be at <hi>peace</hi> with us, if we be holy. I, but if <hi>peace</hi> cannot be joyned with <hi>holinesse,</hi> away with it: doe not so <hi>follow peace,</hi> as that ye should let holinesse goe. Above all things, lay hold on <hi>holinesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.7. They shall see him when he comes to judgement: but they shall not see him in his kingdome. Or if they see him, it shall be afar off, as the <hi>rich man in hell saw Lazarus:</hi> they shall not be partakers of his joy and glory.</p>
                  <p>Without learning, without variety of tongues, without riches, honour, beauty, men may <hi>see the Lord</hi>: but <hi>without holinesse none shall see him.</hi> By nature we are all <hi>unholy,</hi> comming of unholy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: borne and conceived in sin: but we must be holy before we can goe to Heaven. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is called the <hi>holy Ierusalem. No uncleane or unholy thing can enter into it.</hi> The Angels for their <hi>unholinesse</hi> were cast out of Heaven: and shall we thinke that GOD will take unholy men into heaven?</p>
                  <p>A great number scoffe at holinesse: O, yonder goes an <hi>holy man.</hi> Indeed if he be a <hi>whited Tombe and a painted Sepulchre</hi>; whose <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> for the most part consisteth in the laying open the <hi>unholinesse</hi> of others, he is worthy to be despised.</p>
                  <p>But except we be all <hi>holy,</hi> we shall never see heaven. Let us be <hi>holy</hi> first in heart, then in our eyes, tongues, hands, feet, and all the members of our body: being truly holy, <hi>we shall see the Lord,</hi> to our eternall comfort. Perfectly <hi>holy</hi> we cannot be in this world: there will alwayes be some drosse cleaving to the best golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke: but let us be sincerely <hi>holy:</hi> and we shall triumph with <hi>Christ</hi> for ever.</p>

                     <hi>Sweet</hi> in the committing: <hi>bitter</hi> afterwards. It stingeth us after the committing of it, and makes us to weepe bitterly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is bitter in the conscience: when we come to a feeling of it, then our hearts smite us for it, as <hi>Davids</hi> did: then it sets us on the racke.</p>

                  <p>A wonder it is to see, how the branches of sin will spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <hi>their word is a Canker, Arianisme</hi> quickly inverted the whole world, <hi>totus mundus ingemuit se subito factum esse Arrianum. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe:</hi> One scabbed Sheepe:— If there be one Sectary, it will make many Sectaries: one Drunkard, many Drunkards. Therefore let us prevent it betimes. Wee are loth that one man that hath the plague should come into the Town, left it run over the whole Towne. Sin is a dangerous plague-sore, it will infect many: yet we have no care to stop it; we suffer it to run on: but the soules of those many that through our negligence are defiled with it, shall be required at our hands. Therefore let us looke to it.</p>

                     <hi>Fornication</hi> was esteemed by the Heathen a light sin,<note place="margin">Acts 15.29.</note> or no sin at all.

                  <p>If we will have no <hi>fornicatours</hi> among us, let there be no <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> among us: for <hi>drunkennesse</hi> will pull on <hi>fornication.</hi> Seldome shall ye have a common <hi>drunkard,</hi> but he is a common <hi>fornicatour</hi> too.

Therefore let us all stand on our watch and ward.</p>
                  <p>The wicked are never mentioned in Scripture, but to their disgrace. Let there bee no Traytor among you, as <hi>Iudas:</hi> no grosse and open Idolater, as <hi>Ieroboam, that made Israel to sinne:</hi> no Strumpet, as <hi>Iesabel,</hi> whose adulteries were in great number: no worldling is <hi>Demas:</hi> no drunkard, as <hi>Falcidius, qui superavit totam Asiam bibendo.</hi> If their names be registred to posterity, it is with a perpetuall blot of infamy.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>prophanenesse</hi> doth appeare by a Sale that he made. The <hi>Gardarens</hi> were <hi>prophane</hi> persons,<note place="margin">Luke 8.37.

and Ale-houses in Sermon time: they know there is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Church, yet wittingly and willingly they continue in the Ale-house still. What are these but <hi>prophane</hi> persons? For a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drinke, they loose <hi>the sincere milke of the Word,</hi> whereby they might grow to everlasting life. All covetous Misers, that are glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their wealth, that had rather lose the Kingdome of Heaven, than their riches, are <hi>prophane persons</hi>; the pottage of this world is sweeter to them than the joyes of Heaven. Let mee live merrily while I am here, let me have the world at will, and let them take Heaven that can get it. O miserable wretches! Farre unlike <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that preferred the rebuke of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>before the treasures of Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They count Heaven but a Tale of a Tub: whereas we ought to <hi>Count all as Dongue, that wee may winne</hi> CHRIST. <hi>Let there bee no such prophane persons among us:</hi> where the sound of the Word ringeth daily in our eares, let us have holy and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindes.</p>
                  <p>Yet are there not <hi>prophane</hi> persons among us, that count all preaching prating, that no credit is to be given to the Scripture, full of contradictions, shall we beleeve them?

When <hi>David</hi> had free liberty to come to <hi>Gods</hi> house, hee was not so much inflamed with the love of it: but in exile he longed after it; then the Sparrowes and Swallowes, that build their nests by GOD's Altar, were in better case than he.<note place="margin">Psal. 84.3.</note> When the <hi>prodigall Son</hi> was at home in his fathers house, where he had aboundance of all things, he set light by it; but when he was keeping Swine, ready to starve for hunger, <hi>than hee would bee as one of his fathers hired ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>; his fathers Table could not content him before, now hee would bee glad to sit at the servants Table. While <hi>Esau</hi> had the <hi>birth-right</hi> and the <hi>blessing</hi> too, he regarded it not: now he howles for it, and cannot get it. Let us make much of good things while we have them.

Yet these benefits are now scarse worth a good mercy. What care we? we will not set a foot over the threshold to go to Church now. But I pray <hi>God</hi> that the time come not, that we shall not onely wish, but howle and cry for them, and not get them. Let us use with all thankfulnesse the gracious mercies of GOD, while we have them, least <hi>afterwards</hi> we seeke for them, when it is too late. <hi>While we have the light, let us walke worthy of the light:</hi> while ye have the word, make much of the word: while ye have health, use your health to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and the salvation of your soules.</p>

                  <p>Now let us proceed to the persons to whom wee are come: they are in number five. The first are the guardians of the Church: the second is the Church it selfe: the third is the Founder and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of the Church: the fourth is certaine speciall members of the Church: the fifth, is our Saviour Christ, the Head and Mediator of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The guardians of the Church are the <hi>Angels,</hi> the Souldiers that keepe the Citie. <hi>Nomen spiritus, nomen essentiae,</hi> the name of Spirit is the name of essence. If we respect their nature, they be <hi>Spirits: nomen Angeli, nomen officii.</hi> An <hi>Angell</hi> is a <hi>Messenger. Ye are come to innumerable messengers,</hi> sent from <hi>God, ministring spirits for the salvation of elect men.</hi> In whom these points are briefly to bee discussed.</p>

                  <p>They are <hi>innumerable</hi> to us, not to GOD. There bee many things that wee cannot <hi>number,</hi> but GOD can.

                  <p>I but you bring us into a fooles Paradise. We see none of these things performed by the Angels. What then? we must walke by faith, not by sight. Thou seest not GOD, yet thou beleevest there is a <hi>God</hi>; thou seest not thine owne soule: yet beleevest thou hast a soule. So though we see not the Angels ministring to us, yet let us believe it. It is divinely and elegantly set forth by <hi>Bernard. Quid si non videmus obsequium, cùm experiamur auxilium?</hi> what though we see not their service, when we have experience of their aid? <hi>quid si non mereamur aspectum, cum sentiamus effectum?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What though we behold not their ministration with our eyes, when we feele the fruit and effect of it in our lives? This is the <hi>Lords</hi> doing, and it ought to be marvellous in our eyes. <hi>What am I, O Lord,</hi> said <hi>David, and what is my fathers house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</hi> What are we miserable sinners, wormes-meat, dust, and ashes, that the high and holy Angels should wait on us? This is <hi>Gods</hi> unspeakable goodnesse; his Name be blessed and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified for it.</p>
                  <p>The last question remaineth: whether every one of GOD's elect have a <hi>particular Angell</hi> or not. The greatest part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirme, that we have. Among the Greeke, <hi>Basil,</hi>

                     <hi>Naz. Theod. Chrys. Theoph.</hi> Among the Latin, <hi>Origen, Ierome, Aug.

Yet the greater sort contend but for one: and there is a controversie about that one, whether he be assigned to us <hi>à nativitate,</hi> or <hi>à baptismo</hi>;<note place="margin">Tom. 2 in Mat. tr. 5. p. 66</note> from our birth, or from our <hi>baptisme. Origen</hi> disputes it <hi>in utramque par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Zanchius</hi> a late Divine, thinks that both may wel be conjoyned together. Extraordinarily as the Lord sees it meet and expedient, we have many <hi>Angels</hi> for our protection: yet ordinarily, every one of <hi>Gods</hi> elect hath a <hi>particular Angell</hi> appointed to him from his
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:12681:297"/>
cradle to his grave. The principall places whereon they build are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. <hi>The Angell which hath delivered me from all evill, blesse the children.</hi> In the Hebrew it is not [<hi>Maloac</hi>] but, <hi>ham maloac.] <gap reason="foreign">

This Angell is expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led GOD, <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. The <hi>God</hi> that hath fed me all my life long to this day, blesse thee: he that fed him, sayes <hi>Chrys.</hi> and he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him, is all one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Cajetan</hi> the Cardinall hath a remarkable anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on that place: <hi>bene nota,</hi> note it well. <hi>Non dixit, singuli An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli eorum, sed Angeli eorum:</hi> not their <hi>particular Angels,</hi> but <hi>their Angels: neque enim ex hoc textu colligi potest singulos credentes singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los habere Angelos:</hi> it cannot be collected out of this Text, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beleever hath a <hi>particular Angell:</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> useth the plurall number, <hi>their Angels,</hi> not the singular; <hi>every ones Angell. Take heed ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, that in heaven their Angels doe alwayes behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There seemes to bee a greater validity in the third place, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.15. When S. <hi>Peter stood knocking at the doore, the maide</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by the voice that it was S. <hi>Peter, for joy opened not, but ran in to tell them: thou art mad,</hi> said they: <hi>it is not he, it is his Angell.</hi> Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they might understand it of a created Angell, yet not of one that was appointed to him from his first entrance into the world; but of one that <hi>God</hi> sent to him to comfort him while he was in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to deliver him, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all that, it can hardly sinke into my head, that they should be so fond as to imagine that an <hi>Angell</hi> would stand knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the doore. Therefore it might bee translated, a <hi>Messenger:</hi> as <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.24. <hi>When the messengers of Iohn were departed,</hi>

                     </gap>: so here, <hi>it is not he, it is the Messenger, that useth to come to us now and then,</hi> and with whose voice thou and we are well acquainted. If <hi>Lazarus</hi> had a speciall <hi>Angell,</hi> me thinkes that should have caried his soule to heaven: yet not one, but many <hi>Angels</hi> did it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse for mine owne part, I will not be contentious. I see no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience in <hi>Zanchies</hi> opinion, but much comfort rather, if it had pregnant proofe out of the written word: but let us <hi>sapere ad sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatem,</hi> be wise to sobriety. <hi>Calvin</hi> himselfe in his <hi>instit.</hi> leaves it doubtfull.

                  <p n="2">2. Hee was his Fathers strength, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.3.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Hee had a double portion of goods, and the inheritance was wholly his.</p>

Hier. trad. Hebr. in Genesin.</hi> So must wee in speciall manner bee consecrated to the Lord, and as so many Nazarites, <hi>serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our life. Israel is my first borne,</hi> though all the world bee mine. All the world is Gods, yet wee are his <hi>first borne.</hi> What an honour is this? A noble man hath many sonnes: the yonger may goe a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, the elder hath all the land. Among us there is never a yonger brother: all elder brethren, and shall all have the inheritance of the Kingdome of Heaven. Let us be thankefull to GOD for it. <hi>Israel</hi> was his: even so wee, being Gods first borne are his, not our owne: <hi>wee are bought with a price, and must glorifie God in our spirits and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are his.</hi>

his hands,</hi> wee are ever in his sight. GOD needs no pen, paper, writing tables, for helpe of memorie: but this is spoken for our capacitie. The Senatours of Rome were called <hi>Patres Conscripti,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Register was taken of their names. A Captaine sets downe the names of his souldiers in a booke. So GOD Almighty to shew what account hee makes of us, hath our <hi>names written.</hi> Where? not in water, not in loose papers, not in the earth, where perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they may be blotted out; but <hi>in heaven,</hi> whither none of our enemies can have accesse to race out our <hi>names.</hi>

A King takes the <hi>name</hi> of one of his owne subjects, to preferre him, to make him a Lord, &amp;c <hi>God</hi> takes our <hi>names,</hi> to preferre us to a Kingdome.</p>

Of apert and manifest things we may <hi>judge.</hi> Wee may call a spade a spade, a knave a knave, a drunkard a drunkard, &amp;c. but of secret things we may not <hi>judge.</hi> The heart is a secret thing, <hi>judge</hi> not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that: the number of GOD's elect is secret; <hi>judge</hi> not then who shall be saved and who damned: true sanctification is a secret thing: many may be holy without, that are not within, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees; some holy within, <hi>as the Kings daughter is all glorious within.</hi> If a man or woman follow not the bent of thy bow, if he make not as great an outward shew as thou, shall he by and by be an unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied person? This is too great rashnesse. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another mans servant?</hi> Shall one fellow-servant <hi>judge</hi> another? Let us referre that to the <hi>Iudge</hi> of all.

                  <p>THE second reason is taken from the dignity of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>Then, at the delivery of the Law, <hi>The voice of</hi> God <hi>did but shake the earth, Exod.</hi> 19.18. Now, at the exhibition of the Gospell, <hi>It shooke earth and heaven too.</hi> The which he proveth out of <hi>Hagge:</hi> where we have, 1. an Allegation of the Text; then a Commentary on the Text.</p>
                  <p>The people mourned that the second Temple was not so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as the first: GOD comforts them, promising to make it more glorious; not in sumptuous building, but by the comming of the <hi>Messiah</hi> into it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before, he did shake but the earth,</hi> when the Law was given: <hi>now he will shake heaven and earth: heaven and earth</hi> was moved with the comming of Christ when he was borne, <hi>Herod, and all Ierusalem was shaken.</hi> Wise-men directed by a Starre, came out of the East to worship him. At the Passion of Christ, <hi>the earth shooke, the graves opened; many dead Saints came out and appeared. Heaven also was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> at his comming, the Angels in great multitudes came from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and sung for joy at his comming: the voice of the Father was

heard from heaven at his Baptisme, <hi>This is my beloved Son, &amp;c.</hi> At the passion of Christ, the Sun in the <hi>heaven</hi> was darkned, and drew in her face. At the Feast of Pentecost after Christs asscention, the Holy Ghost came from heaven: the Apostles on the sudden spake all languages on the earth; all Nations were shaken with the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, which as a Trumpet from Heaven sounded in the eares of them all.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Gospell, whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is the Minister, is farre more glorious than the Law, whereof <hi>Moses</hi> was the Minister. Therefore let us <hi>take heed how we despise him that speaketh now to us from heaven.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>Which is amplified by the efficient cause, and the formall.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2 Thes. 1.8.</note> when they shall bee with the rich Glutton in the lake, burning with fire and brimstone for ever. Therefore let us feare this God: <hi>Kisse the Sonne, least, if His wrath be kindled but a little, yee perish from the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We flatter our selves too much in the mercies of God. <hi>God is mercifull. As a Father pittyeth his children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His mercie reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the heavens.</hi> Though we be adulterers, drunkards, proud, malicious: yet <hi>God is mercifull.</hi> I but as He is <hi>demulcens Pater,</hi> so he is <hi>animadvertens judex:</hi> with an axe ready to cut our heads. Because God doth not alwayes shew Himselfe in the likenesse of <hi>fire,</hi> a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God, powring downe the coales of his wrath upon us, because he beareth with us, and doth not by and by punish us for our sins; we thinke we may contemne him, we may serve him as we list, any service will content him. I but remember likewise, that our <hi>God is a consuming fire.</hi> It is long peradventure before a <hi>fire</hi> breakes forth, it may lye lurking a great while and not be seene: but if it begin to flame, to set upon a Towne; without great prevention it will burne up the whole Towne. So God is patient, His wrath is long a kindling: but if wee provoke him too much, Hee will breake forth as a <hi>fire</hi> and consume us all. He is a <hi>fearefull God</hi> with whom wee have to deale: therefore let us serve Him with <hi>feare and reverence, in holinesse and righteousnesse all our dayes:</hi> that wee may not onely avoyde this <hi>fire,</hi> but enjoy the light of the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for ever.</p>

Of them that be brethren</hi> in CHRIST: which have <hi>one Father,</hi> which is God, <hi>one mother,</hi> the Church: that suck one milke out of the two dugs of the Word of God: that have <hi>one Faith, one Saviour, one Baptisme, one H. Supper, one inheritance,</hi> the kingdom of heaven. Let the <hi>love of these brethren</hi> continue. We must <hi>love</hi> all men, as they are the glorious workemanship of God, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after Gods image: but those especially that are His workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in CHRIST IESUS, renewed after the image of the LORD IESUS. <hi>Owe nothing to any man, save love. Love</hi> a <hi>Turke,</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> but especially <hi>love</hi> a Christian that embraceth CHRIST truely as thou doest. There ought to bee <hi>brotherly love</hi> amongst them, that as brethren professe <hi>one Faith, one</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and one Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Love</hi> is the body of a Christian.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Love</hi> is the Seale of our election. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. If thou hast no <hi>love,</hi> thou hast no assurance of eternall life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Love</hi> is the sauce that seasons all vertues. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Though thou commest to Church and hearest Sermons, receivest the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, offerest up the sacrifice of prayer and praise, talkest never so gloriously of Religion; yet <hi>without love, thou art but as sounding brasse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore let brotherly love continue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a sweet thing: therefore it is compared to the oyle, powred on the head of <hi>Aaron:</hi> it is a profitable thing, resembled to the <hi>dew of Henmon:</hi> therefore let it continue.<note place="margin">Psal. 133.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all that, <hi>love</hi> is a rare bird among us; she is much in our
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:12681:306"/>
tongue, little in our hands: we talke of her, but we walke not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of <hi>love. Love envyeth not.</hi> What <hi>envy</hi> is among the professors of the Gospell? If our Neighbour be in better estate then we, we grieve at it. <hi>Love</hi> disdaineth not. What contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is there one of another? <hi>Love</hi> seeketh not her owne. Among us every man is for himselfe, none regards the good of an other. <hi>Love thinkes not evill,</hi> it speakes not evill. What <hi>cursed speaking,</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, railing and slandering is there among us? <hi>Love</hi> is not onely cold, but in a manner dead among us: there is more <hi>love</hi> among <hi>Turkes</hi> and infidels then among Christians. Drunkards <hi>love,</hi> there is good fellowship among them: Theeves <hi>love,</hi> they have one purse: Adulterers <hi>love:</hi> The Divels <hi>love: A legion of Divels</hi> were in one man: onely wee that professe our selves brethren in <hi>Christ,</hi> which ought chiefely to abound in <hi>love,</hi> and be lights to others, wee want <hi>love.</hi> What a pittifull thing is this?</p>
                  <p>He doth not say, let it be, let it finde a footing among you, but <hi>let it abide and continue:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.16.</note> he that <hi>dwelleth in love,</hi> dwelleth in GOD; not he that hath <hi>love.</hi> He doth not say, let <hi>love</hi> be as a guest among you, which tarries for a night or two, but let him be <hi>a continuer:</hi> let him never discontinue from you.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture sayes, <hi>let not the Sunne goe downe on thy wrath.</hi> Wee must not keepe anger with us an whole night: but wee must keepe <hi>love</hi> with us day and night, <hi>continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love</hi> hath many enemies that seeke to thrust her out of doores. Therefore we had need to hold her, and to labour for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance after.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 There is the Divell that cannot abide her. <hi>Iud.</hi> 9.23. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his name, he is an enemy, that sets himselfe against <hi>love.</hi> If he see <hi>love</hi> in a Towne, he will expell her if he can, by one meanes or an other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He hath his factors and agents in all places, that labour to breake the necke of <hi>love.</hi> Now a dayes they bee especially two; talebearers, and wrangling Lawyers. God tooke order in the law, that none should goe about with tales: yet they are too frequent in every Towne, sowing the seed of dissention, and nipping <hi>love</hi> in the head. Therefore if yee will have <hi>love continue,</hi> stop up your eares against Talebearers: And as the North winde driveth away raine; So with an angry countenance doe ye the Talebearer.</p>
                  <p>As for Lawyers, they be necessary in the Common wealth, as well as Physitions: but as he is a bad Physition that will make work for himselfe; So he is a bad Lawyer that will set men together by the eares, for the enriching of himselfe. Let us take heed of all that goe about to pull <hi>love</hi> from us: and let her bee <hi>continued</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There bee weaknesses in our selves: wee are too supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, too credulous, ready on a small occasion to cast away <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 There are many infirmities in them whom wee <hi>love:</hi> yea even in the best of all. Now when <hi>love</hi> sees an infirmity, shee
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:12681:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must cover it, or amend it, and not cast off a friend for an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghost not without great cause made choyse of this word, [<hi>continue:</hi>] for hee knew there were many ropes to pull us from <hi>love</hi>; many that would seeke her discontinuance.</p>
                  <p>Wee desire the <hi>continuance</hi> of all other good things: wee would be glad, that wealth, honour, health, ease, prosperitie might <hi>continue,</hi> and shall we not seeke the <hi>continuance of love,</hi> that sweetens them all to us?</p>
                  <p>Doe not onely <hi>love</hi> for a time, but <hi>continually.</hi> But alas, <hi>love</hi> is <hi>of little continuance:</hi> Many have beene friends, that proove enemies. <hi>Herod and Pilat were friends,</hi> but afterwards fell out: <hi>Love</hi> is fine drinke, but it growes soone sower. Some there be with <hi>Amnon,</hi> that hate more then ever they <hi>loved</hi> before. In other things wee cannot away with the Praeterperfect tense, as to say, I had health, I had house and land, I had wealth: yet wee content our selves to say, I had <hi>love.</hi> Indeed, the time was when wee <hi>loved:</hi> but now one neighbour cares not for an other. That is a miserable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Let brotherly love continue.</hi> Let her tarry with us, so long as we our selves tarry. Let her dwell with us in this world, that shee may dwell with us, and we with her in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>Yes, with all our hearts: God forbid, but that wee that bee Christians, should <hi>love</hi> one an other.</p>
                  <p>I but if yee have <hi>love,</hi> let it appeare by your fruits, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.18. As Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Shew mee thy faith by thy workes:</hi> so shew mee thy <hi>love</hi> by thy workes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hospitality. Hee doth not say, be hospitall, but <hi>let the love of hospitality continue.</hi> Wee are ready to forget that which as wee thinke, is against our profit, or is an empairing of our wealth. Now many imagine <hi>hospitality</hi> to be so. Therefore wee invent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shifts and excuses. I am decayed in my estate, I am not so rich as I have beene. I have wife and children to provide for. I cannot give that I have to strangers. My house is but little; my fare meane: strangers will not like of it. I but for all this, <hi>be hospitall:</hi> forget it not. These <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.34. were spoyled of their goods: yet he would not have them to forget <hi>hospitalitie.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. How were they Angels, when as one of them is called Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, and the Iudge of the world? One of the three was GOD, the other two were Angels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they thought them to be men, not <hi>Angels</hi>; why then did they worship them? It was but a civill adoration or reverence, such as <hi>Iacob</hi> gave to <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Shechemits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They did not dreame that they were <hi>Angels:</hi> they were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they were but men, yet they <hi>entertained them.</hi> Which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies their fact. If a great Lord come to thine house, like a Lord, and thou take him into thine house, it is no mervaile: but if hee come in a beggers weede, and yet thou receive him, that is lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. These were <hi>Angels,</hi> Lords of Gods privy Councell: yet they came like men; for all that <hi>Abraham and Lot entertained them,</hi> and were glad of them. See how GOD honoured their <hi>hospitality.</hi> Let us doe the like, that God may blesse and honour us.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>hospitality</hi> these things are required. 1. That wee doe it <hi>frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> One swallow makes not a spring. The receiving of a stranger once makes not an <hi>hospitall</hi> man. Wee must make a dayly use and occupation of it. It was the continuall practice of <hi>Lot and Abraham,</hi> as may appeare by their behaviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must bee <hi>celeriter:</hi> wee must not tarry till strangers offer themselves: we must pull them in, as <hi>Abraham and Lot</hi> did. Wee must <hi>constraine</hi> them, as <hi>Lydia</hi> did S. <hi>Paul and Silas.</hi>

They be the brethren of <hi>Christ,</hi> the sonnes of GOD: we are not worthy of such guests.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Abundanter:</hi> according to that abilitie wherewith <hi>God</hi> hath blessed us. If wee have but a little, let them have a little, as the widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> dealt with <hi>Elias.</hi> If we have a great portion of Gods blessings, let them tast of them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Wee must doe it <hi>perseveranter: be not weary of well doing. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalitie</hi> is a good thing, be not weary of it. Let thy house be open

to good men all the dayes of thy life. But alas, this is an hard do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who can abide it? wee are too much wedded to the world: yea, they that make a great shew of Christianitie, are ready to say with <hi>Nabal, shall I take my bread and my water, and my flesh,</hi>

                     <hi>and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</hi> O forget not this duty. Here hee meanes such strangers especially, as are compelled to forsake their countrie for the Gospels sake: but it is to be extended to all.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent dutie: and wee have many spurs to pricke us to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God requires it. <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee have many examples for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We our selves may be strangers: therefore doe as ye would be done to.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The want of it hath beene grievously punished: it was the overthrow of an whole tribe. <hi>Iud.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In receiving men that be strangers, we may receive <hi>Angels:</hi> Preachers which be Gods <hi>Angels,</hi> nay, <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is gainefull for this life, and that which is to come. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had a Sonne streight after the entertainement of his strangers. <hi>Lot</hi> was delivered from the destruction of Sodom. <hi>God blessed the house of Obed Edom:</hi> and hee will blesse those houses that receive <hi>strangers.</hi> Therefore be not forgetfull to lodge <hi>strangers,</hi> receive them into your houses in this life, that CHRIST may receive you into <hi>the house made without hands</hi> in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>That may suffice for the entertainement of forrainers: now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes our usage of them that be at home with us: they are either in bondage, or at libertie.</p>
                  <p>Out of sight, out of minde. These were enclosed in the prison wals: therefore hee sayes, <hi>remember.</hi> Though they be a good way from you, yet <hi>remember them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be 2. kindes of <hi>bondmen: Vincti Iesu Christi, &amp; diaboli:</hi> Some are <hi>in bonds</hi> for righteousnesse sake; some for unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: some for the Gospell, some for theft, murther, treason,<note place="margin">Act. 28.20. Gal. 6.10.</note> grosse and notorious vices. <hi>For the hope of Israel,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul, Am I bound with this chaine.</hi> Some are <hi>in bonds</hi> for Popery, Anabapt. for sects and schismes. All are to be <hi>remembred,</hi> as occasion serveth: though they be <hi>in bonds</hi> for evill causes, yet let us in some sort <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them.</hi> Let us goe to them, if opportunitie serve, and give them good counsaile. Let us labour to bring them to a sight of their sinnes, and so make them <hi>Christs</hi> free-men: that is a worthie worke. A theefe was converted at the gallowes: therefore there is hope of doing them good in the prison. A blessed thing to save such a soule.</p>
                  <p>But especially if any are <hi>in bonds</hi> for the Gospell, let us <hi>bee mindefull</hi> of them: Let us repaire to them personally, if wee can, and not be ashamed of them, if that be not permitted, as it is not by the Papists, who are more cruell then <hi>Nero</hi> himselfe: for under

him Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee was at Rome, had all his acquaintance to come to him, and were not forbidden. Yet if wee cannot doe that, let us send reliefe to them, as <hi>Onesiphorus</hi> did to S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Let us speake for them,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.16. Mat. 27.19. Acts 23.25.</note> as <hi>Pilats wife</hi> did for Christ. Let us write for them, as <hi>Lysias</hi> did for <hi>Paul.</hi> If none of these lye in our power, at the least let us pray for them. All the Tyrants in the world cannot hold us from that, at the least in heart to <hi>commend</hi> them to the LORD. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> was in prison,<note place="margin">Acts 12.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Earnest prayer was made of the Church for him.</hi> Let us pray earnestly for them that be in prison, for the profession of the Gospell. Though there be none in <hi>England</hi> in these happy dayes of prosperity; yet there be Christians in bonds in <hi>Turkie,</hi> in the unholy-house of <hi>Rome,</hi> and such like places. Let us <hi>remember</hi> them to the GOD of Heaven. If wee were in prison, we would be glad to be <hi>remembred</hi>; so let us <hi>remember</hi> others. But alas, we heare often the lamentable cry of poore prisoners, and it pierceth us not: like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butler, we <hi>forget the affliction and imprisonment of Ioseph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And them that are <hi>evilly intreated:</hi> namely, in the body, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that which followeth: whether they are afflicted with poverty, with want of meat, drinke, cloth, and other comforts, or with sicknesse that puts them to much paine; let us <hi>remember</hi> them, <hi>as being our selves also in the body</hi>: that may well bee supplied. Some supply the word <hi>afflicted.</hi> Others interpret it of the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Body, as being of the same body that they are of.

                  <p>The words may be taken as they be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Being in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> subject to like calamities that they be. They are poore, so we may be. They are sick, so may we be. The nayle in the wheele that a while agoe was aloft, is now below in the myre and dirt: so we that are now at liberty, and enjoy prosperity, may on the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an hand be <hi>evilly entreated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the reason why we are so little affected with the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our brethren; because we poste light by it: <hi>What is that to us,</hi> said the Chiefe Priests and Elders to <hi>Iudas?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when one tels us, such an one in the Towne wants bread for him and his children, <hi>What is that to us?</hi> Such a family is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously visited, the man, wife, and children, are all downe at once: I am well, a flye for it. Thou hast no charter of thy health: what a shame is this? <hi>Who is weake,</hi> sayes S. <hi>Paul, and I am not weake?</hi> So we should say, who is poore? who is sick in all the Towne, and I am not sick? If the goute be in the feet, shall the head say, what is that to me? if the head ake, shall the foot say, what is that to me? The affliction of our brethren, should be our affliction.

                  <head>VERSE 4.</head>
                  <p>IN the former Verses the Apostle hath commended three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to us: charity, hospitality, pitty, and compassion over the afflicted. In this Verse he comes to the fourth, which is chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: shewing the meanes whereby we may keepe our selves chaste, and the judgement of <hi>God</hi> against all unchaste persons.</p>
                  <p>So that this Verse divides it selfe into two parts: 1. A <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi> of mariage. 2. A <hi>condemnation</hi> of all uncleane persons, that neglect or violate <hi>mariage.</hi> In the former, first the estate is <hi>commended,</hi> secondly the bed is defended. The <hi>commendation</hi> of the estate is in these words, <hi>mariage is honorable in all:</hi> where three points are to be considered. 1. The subject, what <hi>mariage</hi> is: 2. The attribute, why it is called <hi>honorable.</hi> 3. The persons among whom it is <hi>Honourable. Mariage</hi> hath three names in the Latine Tongue: <hi>Nuptiae à nubendo</hi>; because at the solemnization of the <hi>mariage</hi> the <hi>maried</hi> parties, in token of modesty, were wont to be covered; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugium à conjungendo,</hi> of the joyning of them together: <hi>matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, quod à matre nomen accepit</hi>; either <hi>quasi matris munium,</hi> the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the mother, because the mother is most occupied about the children when they be young: or <hi>quasi matrem muniens; mariage</hi> is a defence to the woman, she gets a husband that is a vaile to her eyes; or <hi>quasi matrem monens,</hi> putting the woman in minde of her duty to her husband and children.</p>
                  <p>It may be thus defined. <hi>Mariage</hi> is a copulation of one man and woman together, for GOD's glory and the comfort of them both.</p>
                  <p>The first man that had two wives, was a wicked man. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob</hi>; sundry holy Kings, as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> had many wives. That was <hi>ex dispensatione, non ex instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one:</hi> howsoever, it was winked at by <hi>God,</hi> yet it was an aberration from the first institution, <hi>ab initio non fuit sic</hi>: and if ever there was any necessity of many wives, it was at the foundation of the world for propagation, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> might dispense with a man to have many wives: but hee cannot dispense with a woman to have many husbands, sayes <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacr. Mat. c.</hi> 11. No though there were but one woman in all the world. This is strange: may the <hi>Pope</hi> dispense with all the ten Commandements; and shall <hi>Gods</hi> hands be tyed up from dispensing? but in very truth, by <hi>Gods</hi> appointment <hi>mariage</hi> is only betweene two. There may come no more into this yoke, save two at once. God gave but one wife to <hi>Adam,</hi> yet there were <hi>plures costae in Adamo</hi> (as <hi>Tert.) &amp; indefatigabiles manus in Deo:</hi> there were many ribs in <hi>Adam,</hi> and power in <hi>God</hi> to make moe wives, if it had pleased him.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first <hi>mariage</hi> being of GOD's owne making, must bee a president to us all. Among the <hi>Turkes</hi> it is lawfull for a man to
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:12681:309"/>
have as many wives as he can keepe: yet he must have but one at once with him in his house. Christians doe abhor it: we have a sharpe, yet a wholesome statute against it of late in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mariage</hi> then is the conjunction of a Man and Woman toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after a comely and religious manner in the publike face of the congregation, that the Church for avoiding of offence may take notice of it, and that all things may be done in order as the Apostle speaketh, this here is termed <hi>honourable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth not say, <hi>mariage</hi> is lawfull, good: it is a convenient thing: but <hi>honourable.</hi> Vertue is laudable, said the Philosopher: but felicity onely is honourable. This is the highest title of all: it is to be had in great price, honour and estimation: it is <hi>honourable</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God,</hi> his Saints and Angels. Some honour it too much, as the Papists, that make a Sacrament of it. <hi>Sacramentum hoc magnum est, Eph.</hi> 5. Yet the Greeke word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: and if every Mystery should be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> there should not be seven, but seventy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and more: neither doth he speake of <hi>mariage,</hi> but of the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ and his Church, in that place.</p>
                  <p>We will fight against them with their owne weapons. 1. As the covenant is <hi>common</hi>; so ought all Sacraments, the Seales of the Covenant, to be <hi>common.</hi> If <hi>mariage</hi> be a Sacrament, why is it not <hi>common</hi> to all Christians? Why doe they deny Ministers to <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> 2. Every Sacrament must be celebrated by a Minister: <hi>Goe teach all Nations, baptising them, &amp;c.</hi> A Minister (as <hi>Bell.</hi> conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) is not necessary in the celebration of <hi>mariage:</hi> the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting are sufficient. Therefore (to speake properly) it is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Though the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> of late hath taken some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order in it. We may not honour <hi>mariage</hi> so farre as to make a direct Sacrament of it: yet it is honorable.</p>
                  <p>A number there be, that have exceedingly dishonoured and disgraced it. <hi>Marcion</hi> (as <hi>Epiphan.</hi> recordeth of him) called <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, inventionem Diaboli, &amp; mulierem, ipsum opus Diaboli. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnius &amp; Basilides</hi> (as <hi>Iren. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. writeth of them) blushed not to affirme, that <hi>Nubere &amp; generare</hi> were <hi>à Satana. Hier.</hi> treading in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s steps, wrests some sentences of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of <hi>mariage.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>Melius est nubere quàm uri.</hi> A goodly <hi>commendation</hi>! As if a man should say, it is better to have a lame leg, than none at all. <hi>Melius semper comparationem deterioris respicit.</hi> That is not so: it is better to take Physick, than to live in paine: is it therefore evill to take physick? So it is <hi>better to marry than to burne</hi>; is it therefore evill to marry? Let them all say what they will, <hi>mariage is honourable,</hi> and <hi>to be honoured</hi> by us all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It was instituted by the most honourable person, that ever was, namely, by GOD Almighty: he saw it was not <hi>good for man to bee alone:</hi> therefore Hee provided <hi>an helper</hi> for him: <hi>Hee cast him into a deepe sleepe, tooke a rib out of his side, of it hee made a woman, and brought her to the Man.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="603" facs="tcp:12681:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>2 It was ordained in the most honorable place that ever was on the face of the earth, namely, in <hi>Paradise,</hi> the Garden of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 It was appointed in the most <hi>honourable</hi> time that ever was, in the time of innocency. Then a woman was needfull for a man, much more now in the time of corruption.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It was preserved in the most dangerous time that ever was: in the great deluge that overflowed the whole World. <hi>Noah</hi> and his wife, his sons and their wives were saved in the Arke. An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that GOD made a precious and <hi>honourable</hi> account of <hi>mariage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 It was <hi>honoured</hi> with the presence of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> and graced with the first miracle that he wrought.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 By the judgement and practice of all Nations, it is ratified to be an <hi>honourable</hi> estate. For they that bee <hi>maried,</hi> in all places have the upper hand: they have the higher roome in all meetings, in the Church, and at the Table: which argues that <hi>honourable</hi> estimation which all have of it in their hearts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 It hath <hi>honourable</hi> effects: by it, the number of <hi>Gods</hi> elect is accomplished, the kingdome of Heaven replenished, the Church is furnished with worthy Preachers, that are as <hi>Gods</hi> arme to pluck up men into the Kingdome of Heaven. The Common-wealth is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of wise Governours, of stout Souldiers, of all kinde of estates and conditions: <hi>mariage</hi> is the pillar that upholds the world, the seminary of Church and Common-wealth. Therefore it must needs be confessed, to be a glorious and an <hi>honourable</hi> estate. Let none open their mouthes against it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Because it is an excellent meanes to keepe our vessels in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and <hi>honour,</hi> as we are commanded, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                  <p>And now seeing <hi>mariage</hi> is an honourable estate; let us be bold as occasion serveth, to flye to it. If thou hast deflowred a virgin, that is none of thine, as <hi>Amnon</hi> did <hi>Thamar,</hi> though it have beene in thy secret chamber, the doores fast locked up, be ashamed of it. If thou art an impure strumpet, as <hi>Iesabel</hi> was, tyring thy head, and painting thy face to allure lovers withall, be ashamed of it: for if thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistest in that sin without repentance, <hi>Christ</hi> will be ashamed of thee, when he commeth in his glory with his holy Angels. In regard thereof thou mayest be ashamed: but be not ashamed of <hi>mariage.</hi> This is no sin in it selfe: nay, it is an <hi>honourable</hi> thing, thou needest not to be ashamed of it. When <hi>Mordecai</hi> was carried through the City with the royall apparell on his back, with a crowne set upon his head, with this Proclamation, <hi>so shall it be done with the Man whom the King will honour,</hi> was there any cause why he should blush at it? No, because it was an honour appointed to him by the King. If the Lord have given unto thee a <hi>godly wife,</hi> being a man; or a wise hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, being a woman, thou needest not be ashamed of this crowne which the King of Kings hath set upon thy head. We may be bold as occasion serveth, to flye to this <hi>honourable Sanctuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet let us not rush rashly and unadvisedly into this <hi>honourable</hi>

estate. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> being in the Mount, saw the externall glory of his <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> that his face shined like to the Sun, by and by he is enamoured, in a love of that place, and saith, <hi>Master, it is good for us to bee here:</hi> but the Text witnesseth, <hi>that he wist not what he said:</hi> even so a great number of rash and heady young men, set their love upon a maide, before they have learned to love GOD. When they are carried up, as it were, into the Mount, where the glory of <hi>mariage</hi> is shewed unto them, and by by they say in their hearts, <hi>It is good for us to bee here.</hi> But if they were rightly examined of the things appertaining to <hi>mariage,</hi> they might take up that speech of S. <hi>Peter's,</hi> and say, <hi>We speake we cannot tell what.</hi> Though it is a most worthy estate, yet it is not without a godly premeditation to be undertaken: we must take a diligent view of those spurs that put us forward to <hi>mariage.</hi> It must not be the bare satisfying of our greedy lusts and raging affections; though a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect may be had unto them: but the glory, that we may procure to <hi>God</hi> by it, our mighty Creator, and Mercifull Redeemer. The good that we may purchase unto the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in that estate, must be set before our eyes. A wise choyce must bee made, with great advice &amp; deliberation of that yoke-fellow which we propound to our selves. We must not onely fixe our eye upon the externall beauty of the body, as <hi>Shechem</hi> did upon <hi>Dinah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she was faire. Beauty indeed is the good gift of <hi>God,</hi> and many godly women have had it, as <hi>Sarah, Rebeccah, Rachel, Hester,</hi> and such like: neither is it to be contemned unlesse it be alone, not accompanied with the internall beauty of <hi>Gods</hi> spirit. As it is said of the Church, the Spouse of <hi>Christ, The Kings Daughter is all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within:</hi> so may it be affirmed of a good wife, that is fit for a Christian indeed, see that she be <hi>glorious</hi> within; see that she be of a sound and incorrupt religion, else she may steale away thy heart from <hi>God,</hi> though thou beest as wise as <hi>Salomon,</hi> and as strong as <hi>Sampson.</hi> See that she be a wise <hi>Abigail,</hi> for the carrying of her selfe; that she be a sober and modest <hi>Hester:</hi> see that she may be an other <hi>Elizabeth, to walke with thee in all the Commandements of God without reproofe.</hi> Then when beauty shall fade away like a flowre corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by sicknesse, thought, cares, age, and such like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when riches shall decay, that are subject to a thousand casualties, of thieves, fire, water, &amp;c. A wise, godly, and loving wife, shall bee a perpetuall comfort unto thee, and as it were a continuall feast. The <hi>Lord</hi> grant, that as he hath given <hi>mariage</hi> unto us as a singular blessing, so by our owne sinnes it prove not a curse to any of us.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>God</hi> hath made it <hi>honourable:</hi> so let not us <hi>dishonour</hi> it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by disorders abroad, nor ill-government at home. What a shame is it for a <hi>maried-man</hi> to sit at the Ale-house al the week long, that hath wife and children to provide for? It is a disgrace to a Batchelour, much more to a <hi>maried-man.</hi> Shall a <hi>maried-man</hi> have a Queane in a corner, that hath a <hi>Rebekah</hi> of his owne: For a <hi>mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-man</hi> to bee a gamester, to spend all at cards and dice? Shall a

                     <hi>married man</hi> be absent from Church? be a swearer and a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: he gives bad example to them of his family: <hi>vul nerat non tam facto, quàm exemplo. A marryed man</hi> had neede to bee more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect over his wayes then an other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not by ill government at home. If the children and servants bee out of order, who shall beare the blame of it, but the househol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? every man is as a petty king in his owne house: if wee cannot restrayne them, we may remoove them. If they will not be brought into GODS house, send them packing out of thine house. <hi>A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull person shall not dwell in my house: Psal.</hi> 101.7. So let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, and say, a swearer, a theife, an alehouse hunter shall not tarry in my house: especially let us not dishonour it by unnaturall strifes and contentions one with an other.</p>
                  <p>There be two things that may make <hi>marriage honourable</hi> to us. The one before <hi>marriage:</hi> the other after. The things before, are prayer and Christian choyce of our yoke-fellow. When <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant went to seeke a <hi>Wife</hi> for his Masters Son, he begun with <hi>God,</hi> LORD GOD, send mee good speed this day. Wee ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise nothing without prayer: much lesse so weighty a thing as <hi>Marriage,</hi> which is not of a day, but for a terme of life.</p>
                  <p>GOD at the first brought <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam:</hi> and Hee by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hand of His providence brings Men and Women together at this day. If thou <hi>Marriest</hi> without GOD, thou shalt live without GOD: and that is a miserable life. Yet a number are carryed by their owne affections, and never consult with <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other thing before <hi>Marriage</hi> is a Christian choyce. There bee two loadstones for the most part that draw us to <hi>Marriage:</hi> beauty, and riches. Beauty indeed is the gift of GOD, a precious <hi>pearle,</hi> a comely ornament, yet this must not bee a sole motive to <hi>marry.</hi> There bee many wormes to eate up this goodly flower of <hi>beauty,</hi> care, sicknesse, the poxe, old age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If a man love for <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> alone, <hi>beauty</hi> vanishing, his love vanisheth. Remember what the wise man sayes, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.30. <hi>Favour is deceitfull,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But now a dayes riches is all in all. Though she be a beautifull woman adorned with many vertues, yet shee may bee long enough without an husband, unlesse shee bee penny white, as well as Nature white: unlesse shee have the red angels as well as ruddy cheekes. Now the question is, what hath she? not, what is she? what dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not what endowments of GODS Spirit? what portion, not what piety? <hi>Iudas</hi> question is too ryfe among us; we say to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>quid dabis?</hi> what will yee give with your daughter? nay the trash of the world makes men like where they have no liking. A woefull thing! The world is not wholly to bee neglected, whyle men are in the world: yet the world must not be the chiefe or onely tyer of the knot of <hi>Marriage:</hi> then it may be soone untyed. GOD hath many bellowes to blow away riches withall. A rich man over night, a fire comes on the sudden, a poore man in the morning: when wealth is gone, that made the <hi>Marriage,</hi> where is the love of
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:12681:311"/>
                     <hi>marryed</hi> folkes? Againe, <hi>this night may thy soule be taken from thee: then whose shall all these bee that thou hast gathered together?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things that may make this estate honourable to us after <hi>Marriage,</hi> are likewise two. The first is the bearing of one anothers burthen. There is no man or woman on the earth, but have their infirmities: Saints we may be, but <hi>Angels</hi> we are not. If ye will have perfect men and women, yee must goe to heaven for them: <hi>there are the Spirits of just and perfect men. Hebr.</hi> 12.23. The <hi>husband</hi> must beare with the <hi>wife,</hi> the <hi>wife</hi> with the <hi>husband:</hi> else we shall disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour this <hi>honourable</hi> estate. The woman, they say, was borne to beare: true indeed, to beare Children: by bearing of Children yee shall be saved: that is the purgatory whereby shee must goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But the man in some respect was made especially to beare, <hi>vir à virtute.</hi> Man of man-hood, he is of greater strength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>mulier quasi mollior,</hi> therefore to be borne withall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Being <hi>married</hi> we must arme our selves against the crosses of <hi>Marriage.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.28.</note> It is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a sweet bitter thing. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> hath read the destiny of <hi>married</hi> folkes: <hi>Such shall have trouble in the flesh.</hi> Somtimes the man is troubled with an unkind wife, as <hi>Iob</hi> was: <hi>curse God, and dye.</hi> She could be content to be rid of him. Sometimes the woman is troubled with a churlish husband, as <hi>Abigail</hi> was with <hi>Nabal:</hi> sometimes both are troubled with their Children, as <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah</hi> was. <hi>I am weary of my life, for the daughters of Heth, &amp;c.</hi> Sometimes they are troubled with their servants. As the Psalmist sayes, <hi>many are the troubles of the righteous</hi>; so may it bee sayed in speciall: <hi>many are the troubles even of righteous married folks:</hi> crosses in themselves, their goods, and in those that belong to them.</p>
                  <p>If wee have not Christian patience in some measure to beare them, we shall dishonour this <hi>honourable</hi> estate. In stead of <hi>honourable</hi> we shall make it <hi>onerable,</hi> burdensome to our selves and others. As God hath pronounced it to bee <hi>honourable:</hi> So let us <hi>honour</hi> it with our Godly lives in this present world, that God may <hi>honour</hi> us in the world to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 As <hi>Marriage is honourable:</hi> so it is for this life alone. In the Kingdom of Heaven there shall be <hi>nec foeminae, nec nuptiae:</hi> we shall <hi>neither marrie, nor be married, but we shall bee like the Angels of heaven for ever.</hi> A wife is but for this life, which God hath made <hi>as a span long.</hi> As there is a time when wee go to the Church to be <hi>marryed:</hi> so there is a time when we shall be carryed to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> to be buried. Though a wife be as faire as <hi>Sarah,</hi> as vertuous as <hi>Hester,</hi> as religious as <hi>Hannah,</hi> as chast as <hi>Susanna,</hi> though she bee never so sweete a companion; yet shee is for this life alone. Therefore let us so live together in this world, that wee may live with our Husband CHRIST IESUS in the world to come.</p>

                  <p>Because the adjective in the originall Text may indifferently be applyed either to the masculine or neuter gender, there hath beene great controversy, what substantive should be supplyed.

                     <hi>Durandus</hi> in a Booke hee made of the manner how to celebrate a Councell, contendeth by many reasons, that it were good for the antient libertie of <hi>marriage</hi> to bee granted againe, by a generall Councell unto the Clergie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cardinall Cajetane</hi> affirmes, that properly to speake, it cannot be prooved neither by reason, nor authoritie; that a Priest should sin, if hee did <hi>marry. Platina</hi> in the lives of the Popes reports, that <hi>Pius</hi> the second himselfe said, there were some reasons why <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> was taken from the Priests, but there are more and better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why it should be restored unto them. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> in his Booke that hee writeth of the Clergie saith, that the vow of Continencie annexed to Orders, is not a meere Divine decree, yet an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call decree. A distinction without a difference: as if the Apostles being the holy men of GOD carryed by the Holy Ghost, did set downe any thing, which was not Divine: and hee calleth it <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall,</hi> not because it can be found in the writings of the Apostles, but because it was a long time kept in the Church, since the time of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Ye see then on what weake grounds it standeth, even our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries being judges. But because it is not good to stand to their courtesie, wee will proove by unanswerable Arguments out of Gods Word, that <hi>Marriage</hi> is also <hi>honourable</hi> amongst the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Word, and that they may challenge it as well as others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That is a generall license extending it selfe unto all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. They of the Clergie are subject to be entangled with the sweet baite of concupiscence, as they of the Laity, unlesse GOD su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine them with the hand of his Spirit. The Romane Clergie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth to us too many examples. One <hi>Iohn</hi> a Cardinall sent from the Pope to ratifie the condemnation of Priests <hi>marriages,</hi> the very next night was taken in bed with an whore. So was <hi>D.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the having of a wife, the wise government of her, his children and family be a note, whereby a Minister must bee tryed; then it is lawfull for him to have one.</p>

                     <hi>Resp.</hi> Why then have some of them tenne, twelve, or twenty Churches? A ridiculous Allegorie. For the Apostle speaketh of a naturall wife, of whom hee begetteth children; not a spirituall wife, as the Church is.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> expoundeth it in the Praeterperfect tense, <hi>which was the husband of one wife,</hi> not <hi>which is.</hi>

                     <hi>So.</hi> But if it had not beene his meaning to permit a Bishop a wife, why doth hee make mention of his wisedome in the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his children? unlesse hee should have children without a wife, as the Pope and his Clergie sometime have had, if their owne Authours say true.</p>

                  <p>But it is lawfull: as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> disputeth by many reasons.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Who goeth a warfare at his owne charges?</hi> what shepheard doth not live of his flock? why should not the spirituall Shepheard of the soule bee maintained, himselfe, his wife, and children, by the sheepe whom he feedeth?</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> This is to be referred to those women which served the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles of necessaries, as certaine wealthy women following <hi>Christ, ministring unto him of their owne substance, Luc.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So.</hi> 1. It cannot be understood of them.</p>
                  <p>They were wealthy, more able to give then to receive: but it is the drift of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place to proove, that <hi>hee might lead about such a woman,</hi> as should be maintained by the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having put the name of <hi>Sister</hi> in the first place (for so the words are to be translated according to the Greeke, not as it is in our English Bibles.) He addeth the name of <hi>Wife</hi> in the next place, to shew what manner of sister he meant: not any common woman, but a <hi>wife.</hi> It were ridiculous, thus to translate it: <hi>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a woman?</hi> as if there were a sister, that were not a woman.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those women were wont to follow the Apostles of their owne accords: they were not carryed. The Greeke word impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that right, which the <hi>husband</hi> hath over the <hi>wife</hi> to carry her about with him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. All the Apostles were <hi>marryed.</hi> All save two at the most, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Saint <hi>Philip</hi> also the Evangelist was marryed,

for <hi>hee had foure daughters, that were Prophetesses, Act.</hi> 21.9.</p>
                  <p>Sundry might be alleadged in the Ecclesiasticall histories.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> both reckon up many Popes, whose Fathers were <hi>marryed</hi> Priests, as <hi>Boniface</hi> the first. <hi>Felix</hi> 3. <hi>Gelasius</hi> the 5. and others: yet hee saith, they were not borne in fornication, but in lawfull <hi>marriage.</hi> One exception they have, that they were <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed</hi> before they had taken Orders, not since, and that afterwards they lay not with their wives.</p>
                  <p>But how proove they that? The Apostles indeede forsooke all, and followed <hi>Christ</hi>: but it is like, they left their wives no more then they did their goods: rather <hi>affectu</hi> then <hi>effectu,</hi> as one speaketh: for <hi>Matthew</hi> retained his house still, and made <hi>Christ</hi> a great feast in it. <hi>Luc.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.27. it is not like they would keepe their houses, and not their <hi>wives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. That the brethren of the Lord, and <hi>Peter</hi> did then <hi>lead about their wives,</hi> when they had long since taken holy Orders: and hee prooveth, that hee himselfe being then in holy Orders hath authority to doe the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the High Priest in the time of the law after he was anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the holy oyle might <hi>marry:</hi> then Ministers now after they bee in Orders may <hi>marry:</hi> for greater sanctity was required in the High Priest being a type of CHRIST, then the Ministers of the Gospell: but hee after hee was consecrated might <hi>marry.

                     </hi> and let us heartily give thanks to GOD for this happy reigne of our gracious Sovereigne, wherein wee may safely enjoy the libertie which GOD hath left unto us in his Word.</p>
                  <p>Here a Question may be demanded, whether it be <hi>honourable among them that marry</hi> the second, third, or fourth time, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As for the first <hi>marriage</hi> all confesse, except it be the <hi>Tatians, Eustathians, Eucratitae,</hi> that this is lawfull. The Papists doe not condemne second <hi>marriages,</hi> yet they count them not so <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> as the first, for they subtract benediction, and blessing from them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> writing to his wife, perswades her not to <hi>marry</hi> againe the second time: but in his Booke <hi>de monogamia</hi> hee shewes himselfe plainely in his colours, and is very bitter against second marriages: his principall reasons are as weake as water.</p>

                  <p>A strange reason? God lives ever: therefore there needs but one God: a wife lives not ever, but dyes; therefore there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of one wife: when one is dead, in the feare of God we may take an other.</p>

No question, but all <hi>marriages</hi> are lawfull: yet as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> sayes, <hi>all things are lawfull, but all things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</hi> There is more inconveniency in regard of diversity of children, of the diverse disposition of sundry <hi>wives</hi> and <hi>husbands, &amp;c.</hi> in the second <hi>marriages,</hi> then in the first: therefore greater care, wisdome, circumspection, is to be used in them. Yet as <hi>God</hi> hath ordained <hi>mariage</hi> for all, so all may flye to it.

                  <p>So much of the estate.

                     <hi>And the bed undefiled.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Either the Verbe substantive may be supplied in the middest of the sentence, and then the sense runneth thus, <hi>And the bed is undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> meaning the <hi>mariage bed:</hi> it is no <hi>polluted bed,</hi> as the <hi>bed</hi> of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and fornicators is: it is no <hi>polluted</hi> thing: or else the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Verse must be repeated, <hi>and bed undefiled is honorable:</hi> whereunto I doe rather leane, because such repetitions are usuall.</p>
                  <p>It is a profitable <hi>caveat</hi> to <hi>married</hi> folkes, instructing them how to behave themselves in the <hi>bed of mariage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are so at all times and in all places to carry themselves, as that no dishonesty be admitted into that <hi>honourable</hi> estate: nothing that is repugnant to the Law of nature, or Christian modesty is to be committed.</p>
                  <p>No doubt, but that a great liberty is permitted to them that be <hi>maried:</hi> they may have their lawfull sports and honest recreations one with another. <hi>Isaac sported with Rebeccah,</hi> neither did he incur any just reprehension for it.<note place="margin">Gen. 26.8.</note> If he had thought he had beene in the sight of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> he would not then have shewed such familiar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of love: yet wheresoever they be, they must doe nothing, but that which may be warrantable by the Law of Nature, and the Word written.</p>
                  <p>As the Psalmist speaketh, <hi>Whither shall I goe from thy presence? If I climbe up into heaven, thou art there, &amp;c.</hi> So all <hi>maried</hi> persons may say within themselves, in the middest of all their delights: <hi>Whither shall I goe from thy presence?</hi> If I walke abroad with my

wife into the fields and pleasant pastures, <hi>thou art there:</hi> if I sit with her at the Table, or by the fire side, <hi>thou art there:</hi> if I be with her in my chamber and bed, <hi>thou art there:</hi> therefore I will doe nothing in this estate which may be displeasing in thy sight. This is <hi>the bed undefiled,</hi> that is <hi>honourable</hi> and well-pleasing unto the <hi>Lord. God</hi> grant it may be so among us all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The bed</hi> it selfe is <hi>undefiled.</hi> As they bee put together in the Church: so they may meet together in the <hi>bed,</hi> for the procreation of children, that may be mutuall comforts to them both, and may be as <hi>Olive branches round about their Table:</hi> which may be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table members both in Church and Common-wealth, and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Heaven. Yet let them take heed they be not drowned in the pleasures of <hi>mariage.</hi> Let them not say with him in the Gospell, <hi>I have maried a wife, therefore I cannot come.</hi> I cannot pray, heare sermons, reade the Scriptures, &amp;c. A wife is appointed as an <hi>helper</hi> to further thee to Heaven, not as an hinderer to keepe thee out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>That may suffice for the commendation of <hi>mariage:</hi> now to the condemnation of all uncleane persons, that neglect or violate <hi>mariage.</hi>

If for some causes best knowne to himselfe, they escape his fingers in this world: yet they shall feele the heavie hand of his indignation in the world to come. <hi>This ye know:</hi> all that be in the Schoole of <hi>Christ</hi> know this,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.5.</note> that <hi>no whoremonger, wanton, buggerer, shall inherit

We are Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: therefore our conversation must be in Heaven. Let us goe out of our faire houses, sweet gardens, pleasant pastures. Let us goe out from our sheepe, and Oxen, gold and silver, wives and children. Let us so use them, as if wee were ready to depart from them. The time must come when I must leave you all.

Let us <hi>use this world, as if we used it not, for the glory thereof fadeth away.</hi> Yet for all that, we are loth to goe out, nay we dwell in the world continually: we are in the world all the weeke long; yea, even on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> too. We are like them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Whose belly is their God, which minde earthly things:</hi> the world, the world, nothing but the world.

                  <p n="1">1. Reverence in regard of their Office. <hi>Alexander</hi> reverenced <hi>Iaddus. Herod, Iohn the Baptist. Obadiah</hi> called <hi>Elias</hi> Lord. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, said <hi>Iohash</hi> to <hi>Elisha.</hi> If wee reverence them not, the Word
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:12681:324"/>
will not have so free a passage among us. They that use their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours unreverently, sin against God.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">Math. 5.13.</note>2. Love: <hi>Have them in exceeding love for their workes sake.</hi> It is the best worke in the world; the Saving of your Soules: therefore love them for it. You love the Fathers of your bodies, that brought you into the world, and will yee not love them that beget you with the Word of truth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. ult.</note> and bring you to a Kingdome? <hi>Obad. ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 6.20.</note>3. Obedience, to their doctrine, exhortations and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Herod</hi> observed <hi>Iohn Baptist, and did many things.</hi> You will obey the prescript of the Physition for the health of your bodies; though it be a bitter potion, you take it well at his hands: and will you not obey them that give you counsell for your soules? though their reproofes be bitter, their rebukes sharpe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.13. as the qualitie of the sin requires; yet accept of it, if they tell you, and that in love, of your covetousnesse, drunkennesse, pride, malice, obey them in the reformation of those vices.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Is Maintenance. All Rulers must be maintained. The King hath maintenance due from the people, and so must the Minister. You receive spirituall things from them, and is it much, if ye give them carnall? <hi>They that served at the Altar, lived on the Altar:</hi> and shall not they that preach the Gospell, live on the Gospell? If the Preachers would preach to us, and take nothing, wee would like them well: but wee grudge at their maintenance: an Argument that wee feele not the sweetnesse of the Word of GOD. The <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would have plucked out their eyes to doe Paul good withall:</hi> Wee thinke much to pull money out of our purses to doe him good withall. In the feare of GOD, if yee be good and religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, discharge the duties, that GOD requireth, to them that have the Spirituall government and oversight of you.</p>
                  <p>Why? there bee two reasons to excite us to it: the one taken from the matter of their worke; the other from the manner of their working. They are <hi>your watchmen:</hi> therefore submit your selves to them, love them, regard them.</p>
                  <p>Not over your goods and bodies, as the Magistrate is: but over <hi>your Soules,</hi> which are more precious: not as the fowler <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> for the bird to catch it and kill it, but they <hi>watch</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and eternall <hi>Salvation of your soules:</hi> therefore submit your selves to them.</p>
                  <p>All Ministers have <hi>Curam Animarum:</hi> none can bee a Minister without that charge.</p>
                  <p>Your Soules are <hi>subject</hi> to many enemies: there bee innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable devils that seeke to carry away your Soules. As the henne watches for the chickens against the kite: so doe they for you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the devill. There be sundry Heretiques, that go about to infect your Soules with the poyson of false doctrine, Papists, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Schismatiques, Priests and Iesuites, Arrians, Nestorians, &amp;c. The Ministers <hi>watch</hi> for you against them. There be sectaries, that for small matters would draw you from the Church: there be
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:12681:324" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many dangerous sinnes, that are ready to cut the throate of your Soules, covetousnesse, pride, ignorance, &amp;c. they keepe a <hi>watch</hi> over you, and labour to bring you out of those sinnes. Therefore <hi>esteeme highly of them,</hi> make much of these <hi>watchmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is illustrated by a spurre, that pricks them to this <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> they know <hi>they must be countable for your Soules</hi>; therefore they watch over them. <hi>Iacob</hi> gave account to <hi>Laban</hi> of every sheepe he had; if any were lost or torne by the wild beasts, hee required it at his hands, hee made it good: so wee must give an account to IESUS CHRIST, the great Shepheard, of every sheepe in our fold. This makes us to watch carefully over your Soules. Some are to give a single account. We must all <hi>give account of our Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> as private persons for themselves alone: some a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, as Magistrates, Masters, Fathers, Ministers: therefore wee had neede to looke to it, to cast over our Bookes betimes in this life, that our accompts may be joyfull in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>That wee may say, <hi>Here am I, and the children that thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mee:</hi> Here am I Lord IESU, and the sheepe that thou hast given mee.</p>
                  <p>Suffer us to meddle with you, to reprehend that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in you: for we must give an accompt for you. Therefore we cannot let you alone, wee cannot, nay, wee must not permit you to sleepe in your sinnes: wee must lift up our voices as trumpets to waken you, <hi>because wee are to give accompt for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Reason is taken from the manner of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they would gladly doe their <hi>worke with joy:</hi> they would <hi>watch over you with joy:</hi> which they cannot doe, if you be peevish, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and froward: therefore <hi>submit your selves to them.</hi> What though wee <hi>grieve</hi> them? what care wee? will such a thing <hi>grieve</hi> him? hee shall be sure to haue it then: we will doe it for the nonce. Some are at this passe. But you shall have no benefit by that: you hurt your selves more then them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnprofitable:</hi> 1. in this life: and that two kinde of wayes. 1. being <hi>grieved</hi> they cannot discharge their ministerie so well to your edification: they cannot studie so well, preach so well, as otherwise they might doe: and that makes against your profit. The worse they preach, the worse it is for you. They cannot till the ground of your hearts so cheerefully: they cannot build you up as an house to GOD so comfortably, as it were meete. Thus you gaine nothing by <hi>grieving</hi> of them, but loose by it. Griefe overthrowes any worke: a clothyer cannot labour in his calling well, that is <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Griefe</hi> hinders any man: much more a Preacher. It deprives him of his sleepe, and makes him unfit for any thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Preacher and Pastour being <hi>grieved</hi> must needs powre out his <hi>griefe</hi> into the bosome of GOD Almighty, whose worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hee is: hee cannot but complaine to God of it. Lord what untoward people be these? and doe yee not thinke God will take his cause into his hand, looke upon the <hi>griefe</hi> of his steward, and by
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:12681:325"/>
one meanes or other, by the pestilence, sword, famine, plague the people for it, that are the Authours of his <hi>griefe?</hi> therefore <hi>grieve</hi> them not. You shall finde it very <hi>unprofitable for you</hi> in the end.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It shall bee <hi>unprofitable you</hi> in the life to come, if yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not of it. CHRIST will say to all them that have opposed themselves to his Ministers, come, you are they, that haue vexed my servants, <hi>depart from mee, I know you not.</hi> Therefore so behave yourselves, that they may <hi>performe their Office with joy, not with griefe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>grieving</hi> of them, you <hi>grieve</hi> the Holy Ghost, and <hi>Christ</hi> too. <hi>It is not wee that speake, but the Spirit of Father, that speaketh in us.</hi> If wee bee <hi>grieved,</hi> hee is <hi>grieved:</hi> and as <hi>Christ</hi> said to <hi>Saul, Why persequutest thou mee?</hi> So hee sayes to all peevish persons, that set themselues to <hi>grieve</hi> his Ministers, <hi>Why grieve yee mee?</hi> Yee shall finde the incommoditie of it in the end. Therefore <hi>grieve</hi> them not: give them all the encouragement you can, that they may <hi>doe their dutie with joy,</hi> to the Salvation of you all.</p>
                  <p>In the former verse, hee enjoyned <hi>Obedience</hi> to their Spirituall Governours: now hee requires their <hi>prayers</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He requests their <hi>prayers:</hi> 2. hee affordeth them his <hi>prayers, verse</hi> 20.</p>

                  <p>BY all probabilitie it was <hi>Paul,</hi> and the rest of the Ministers that were with him, that put up this grace, to be <hi>prayed for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wee will <hi>pray</hi> for them whom wee love most. Wee are not commanded in the Word of GOD, to love any so dearely as the faithfull Preachers. <hi>Have them in exceeding love,</hi> sayes the Spirit of GOD.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.13.</note> Excesse is dangerous in all things, yet wee must exceede in our <hi>love</hi> to the Ministers. <hi>Paul</hi> hath <hi>exceeded</hi> in the choyce of his Word, and wee must <hi>exceede in our Love:</hi>

                     </gap>: hee could not goe higher. Above all abundance in <hi>love.</hi> Wee <hi>love</hi> them best that doe most for us. The Preachers doe more for us then any in the world, under GOD. Our Fathers give us our bodies, but not our Soules: they make both Soule and body new creatures in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Our Fathers bring us into the light of this world, which wee must one day loose againe: they bring us to the light of the heavenly Ierusalem, which wee shall enjoy for ever: these then are most to bee <hi>loved:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

most to bee <hi>prayed for.</hi> If that heathen King, and mighty Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did thinke himselfe more beholden to his Schoole-master, then to <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, because from the one hee had his <hi>Esse</hi>; from the other, his <hi>benè esse:</hi> Truly wee are more to praise GOD for the Preachers, by whom wee are made new creatures in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and Citizens of Heaven, then for our earthly Fathers, by whom wee are made Citizens of the earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>We pray for you:</hi> we sequester ourselves from worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses, that wee may <hi>give our selves to the word of God and prayer. Acts</hi> 6. there is never a day but we <hi>pray for you:</hi> wee count it <hi>sinne</hi> with <hi>Samuel to cease praying for you:</hi> therefore pray you for us. <hi>Vnum orare pro multis,</hi> is a great matter and requires much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and confidence, sayes <hi>Chrys.</hi> But <hi>multos orare pro uno, nihil est onerosi.</hi> When one man <hi>prayes</hi> for many, <hi>oratio fit unius virtutis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitu:</hi> when many <hi>pray</hi> for one, <hi>oratio fit multitudinis &amp; concordiae intuitu, qua Deus ubique potissimum placatur. Multi animi dum unanimes congregantur, fiunt magni:</hi> therefore you being many may more boldly <hi>pray</hi> for us, then we for you.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There is singular use of the Preachers, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.17. we are GODS Torch-bearers, that carry the flaming Torch of the Word of God before your eyes, to shew you the way to the Kingdome of Heaven. They are <hi>the Charets and horsemen of Israel.</hi> Without us ordinarily you cannot be saved: <hi>how can they heare without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? Saint Peter</hi> saved three thousand Soules at a Sermon. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> saved <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Proconsul, <hi>Dionysius</hi> a Iudge of Mars street, <hi>Damaris</hi> a noble Gentle-woman, and sundry others: and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily not one man or woman can goe to heaven, unlesse a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher carry him on his shoulders: not one sheafe can get into the barne, unlesse a harvest man do carry it: and thou canst not bee car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed as a sheafe into the barne of the Kingdome of heaven, unlesse some of CHRIST's harvest men carry thee thither: therefore <hi>pray</hi> for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If we doe well, the profit is yours: <hi>postulamus quidem, ut pro nobis oretis: totum autem fit pro vobis, in vos istae divitiae redunda bunt. Chrys.</hi> If a Nurse have a full dugge, it is the better for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. If the householder have <hi>refertam villam,</hi> they shall fare the better, that be in the house.

                  <p>Then <hi>pray for us,</hi> and that heartily, in the Church and in your houses: <hi>that the Word of God may runne, may have free passage,</hi> may have nothing to stay the running, that it may be glorified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all England, to the joy and comfort of us all. Pray for the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend fathers of the Church, that they may use the Sword of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which God hath put into their hands to the cutting downe of all pernicious weedes, of Anabaptisme, Brownisme, Popery, in this garden of the LORD IESUS. <hi>Pray</hi> for all, faithfull Preachers and Ministers whatsoever, that all the people from the highest to
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:12681:326"/>
the lowest may know CHRIST, and live obediently to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. One principall reason why there be so many disorders in the Church is this, because the people have no care of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, seldome or never commend them in their <hi>prayers</hi> to the God of heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Earnest prayer was made by the Church for Saint Peter:</hi> and the <hi>Ephesians prayed</hi> for <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> till they wept againe: but there is no <hi>praying</hi> for our <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters.</hi> If it had beene said, prate of us, the people would readily have put that in practise: they make the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> their table talke, they <hi>speake evill of the Rulers of the people</hi> in all places. If it had beene sayd, prey upon us, wee should have had a number of preyers. That which the Papists gave to the Ministers, they that be called Protestants, take from the Ministers. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not have the <hi>lands of the Priests</hi> touched in the time of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and scarcity. We in the time of a plenty take away their lands. Heeretofore the leane kine devoured the fat, and were more ill favoured: now the fat devoure the leane and are never satisfied. Heretofore the people gave their very earrings to the Priests: now they are ready to pull the coate over the Priests eares. Every one in the parish will prey upon him: but scarce one will <hi>pray</hi> for him.</p>
                  <p>If it had beene sayed, pry into us, we would have done it with a narrow eye: the foot of a Preacher shall not slip, but he shall be taken tripping by and by: a moate shall be made a beame, a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill a mountaine. But he doth not say, prey upon us, prate of us, pry into us, but <hi>pray for us:</hi> and as ye love the glory of GOD, the beauty of Sion, the peace of Ierusalem, the salvation of your owne soules, <hi>pray for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there be that will <hi>pray</hi> for the Ministers, but it is because they are bound to <hi>pray</hi> for their enemies. <hi>There is one, Michaiah,</hi> sayd <hi>Achab, but I hate him.</hi> So some will say, indeed wee have a Minister, but he is ever rubbing on my soares, therefore <hi>I hate him.</hi> Yet because CHRIST sayes, <hi>pray for them that hate you,</hi> I will <hi>pray for him.</hi> I but thou must <hi>pray for him,</hi> as for the greatest friend in the world, that thy soares being lanched with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of GOD, they may bee suppled with the oyle of GODS mercy in CHRIST, and thou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the day of Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>Heere wee may see the wonderfull <hi>humility of Saint Paul:</hi> hee was a <hi>master-builder</hi> of the Church, had seene CHRIST, he was adorned with singular gifts of learning, and of piety, he spake with tongues more then al: he was taken up into the third heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was a man deepe in GODS bookes, in <hi>prayers</hi> often, in fastings often; he had travelled all the world over in the propagation of the Gospell of CHRIST. A man would have thought that his owne <hi>prayers</hi> had beene sufficient, hee needed not the <hi>prayers</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Indeed the <hi>prayers</hi> of Prophets, of Preachers are of great force with God.<note place="margin">Gen. 20.7.</note> The LORD told <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Prophet, he should <hi>pray for him.</hi> Yet the <hi>prayers</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:12681:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christians are also to be desired. <hi>Vis unita fortior.</hi> The <hi>prayers</hi> of the people and Ministers joyned together will the sooner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with the Lord. The King may adscribe much, to the request of one of his privy Counsell: yet hee rejects not the petition of the meanest Subject. The Preachers are of Gods privy Counsell: He revealeth his secrets to them: yet <hi>the prayer of a righteous man is avayleable, if it bee servent. Cornelius</hi> was no Minister: yet <hi>his prayer went up into remembrance before God.</hi> The head needes the ayde of the foote: the King needs the <hi>prayers</hi> of the Subjects, the Minister of the people. Therefore let us all require <hi>the prayers</hi> one of an other.</p>
                  <p>But why should wee <hi>pray for you?</hi> you are bad men: God will not heare our <hi>prayers</hi> for you. It is not so: <hi>for wee trust wee have, &amp;c.</hi> Some take it to be an argument, <hi>à pari. We have discharged a good conscience towards you in all things,</hi> delivering unto you all things necessary to salvation: therefore discharge you a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science againe in <hi>praying</hi> for us. But it is rather a procreant cause of their <hi>praiers.</hi> We are holy men, such as feare God, as <hi>labour to keepe a good conscience,</hi> and to live honestly: therefore <hi>praie for us.</hi> You are to <hi>praie</hi> for all, chiefely <hi>for them that be of the household of faith.</hi> Wee are of that household, and bring forth the fruits of faith, therefore <hi>pray for us.</hi> Vngodly men that have no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science had most need to be <hi>praied for:</hi> yet we may <hi>pray</hi> more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the godly: God will sooner heare us for them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby wee are given to understand, that it behooveth all Christians, especially Ministers, to bee <hi>assured of a good conscience</hi> in all their doings. Nothing is more terrible then an <hi>ill conscience.</hi> It is the onely hell, as <hi>Luther</hi> calls it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us first search out what a <hi>good conscience</hi> is: then what be the things wherein a Minister must keepe a <hi>good conscience.</hi>

First for the <hi>conscience</hi> in generall. It is called <hi>conscientia,</hi> sayes <hi>Bern. quasi cordis scientia:</hi> that etymologie is not to be rejected, if it be taken with his meaning. <hi>Scientia,</hi> sayes he, is when the heart knowes other things; <hi>conscientia, quando cor novit se.</hi> Yet as any may see according to the nature of the word, <hi>conscience</hi> is a knowledge with an other. The Hebrewes have no fit name for it: in all the old Testament the word <hi>conscience</hi> is not to be found. Yet the old translation hath foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted it into the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.22. <hi>Non est in nostra conscientia quis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerit eam in marsupijs nostris:</hi> as also, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. It is in the booke of Wisedome and Ecclesiastic. but they were written in Greeke. But the Hebr. put [<hi>leb] the heart,</hi> for it. <hi>Davids heart smote him,</hi> that is, his <hi>conscience. Give not thine eare to every word that men speak of thee, for thy heart knoweth that thou also hast cursed others,</hi> that is, thy <hi>conscience.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 It is not a part of the will, but of the understanding: not of that which wee call theoricall, but of that which is termed practicall. Therefore it is in worke and action. As a dead man is no man, but <gap reason="foreign">

This the law written in our hearts teacheth us. Now comes <hi>conscience</hi> and doth her duty.

                     <hi>good conscience</hi> is. One defines a <hi>good conscience</hi> thus. <hi>Quae habet in corde puritatem, in ore veritatem, in actione rectitudinem:</hi> and it is not amisse; yet it expresseth not the power of a <hi>good conscience.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.7.</note> which ought in some measure to be in us all. That wee may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be assured, that we have a <hi>good conscience,</hi> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> had, let us examine our <hi>consciences</hi> in these things. First for our entrance into the ministery, then for the execution of our ministery being entred.</p>
                  <p>First, let us examine our <hi>conscience</hi> about our entrance into this high and magnificent calling: wherein two especiall points are to be observed; namely the gifts passive and active.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Let us call our selves to accompt what passive gifts we have received from GOD Almighty. A Bishop, sayes <hi>Nazianz.</hi> is not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a vaine and empty name, he must be well furnished in some measure with gifts fit for the office. <hi>A Scribe</hi> sayes CHRIST, <hi>that is taught to the Kingdome of Heaven, must be as a rich householder, that is able <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to tumble out of his treasury</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, such are all Ministers of GODS sending. <hi>Ezra was a perfect scribe in the law of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezra. 7.12.</note> So Artashastes doth entitle him in the beginning of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>To Ezra the perfect Scribe of the law of the Gods of heaven. Apollos</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>mighty in the Scriptures. Saint Paul</hi> boasted of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe after an heavenly manner, <hi>I thanke my</hi> GOD, <hi>I speake with tongues more then they all:</hi> But a number there bee, that thanke GOD they speake but with one tongue, namely their mother tongue. Indeed the man of GOD ought chiefely to bee seene in GODS booke, and though he have never so great skill in Logicke, Rhetorique, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he must <hi>dissimulare eloquij venustatem,</hi> when he speaks to the people, as <hi>Saint Ierom.</hi> sayes: yet for all that, he must not bee a rudesby, a meere stranger in them. <hi>Moses</hi> that man of GOD was brought up <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in all, no art excepted: and this <hi>Saint Stephen</hi> records, to his singular commendation. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> was not to seeke in <hi>Aratus, Epimenides,</hi> and others. <hi>Meletus Bishop</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whom alluding to his name, they called <hi>mel Atticae,</hi> hee was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in all acts, as Euseb. testifies of him. <hi>Didymus</hi> used rhetorique, poetry, philosophy. <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> was an excellent divine in his age; for his learning in these externall arts, he was called an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Plato. Origen</hi> was wonderfull in them, in so much as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> his enemy was compelled to admire him for it. The Papists at this day, many of them, give them their due, are very learned men.
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:12681:328"/>
Oh that GOD would turne the edge of learning the right way!</p>
                  <p>And shall the Ministers of our Church bee unlearned? wilt thou leape into <hi>Moses</hi> Chaire, or rather into <hi>Christs</hi> Chaire, and hast no gifts in any comparable measure to teach the people out of it? The King in the Gospell sayd to the man that came to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without the wedding garment, <hi>Friend, how camest thou hither?</hi> So will hee say to all saucy and insufficient Ministers, <hi>Friend, how came you hither?</hi> who made you the dressers of my vineyard, that have no skill to dresse it? who made you dividers of my word, that mangle it, and cannot cut aright? who made you builders of my house, that know not how to square a stone, or frame a piece of timber for my house? Dancers have their Schoole, sayes <hi>Nazianz.</hi> Fidlers and Musitians are trained up to it: and is the ministerie, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? Is it such a light thing, that whosoever will, as it was in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, whether hee bee a Weaver, a Tapster, a Taylor, may bee a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister? it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Sometimes he must be taught, sometimes confuted, comforted, reprooved: and <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> None fully. The great Doctours in Divinitie, must bee Schollers all the dayes of their life: yet if thy conscience tell thee, that thou hast no gifts in any acceptable measure, how canst thou say with Saint <hi>Paul, I am assured I have a good conscience in all things,</hi> when not in the first thing, in the gate and porch to the ministery?</p>
                  <p>The best furniture of all is a sincere and upright heart. As God gave <hi>Saul</hi> an other heart, when hee advanced him to the kingdome: So the Lord gives a good heart to all good Ministers. Learning and knowledge is as water in the well: a good heart is as the bucket to draw it out for the watering of <hi>Christs</hi> Garden: if this bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, even a learned man will doe little good in the ministery. Therefore examine with what heart thou camest hither: to feede thy selfe; or the lambes of <hi>Christ?</hi> to enrich thy selfe, or to make them rich in Faith?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us come to active gifts. When wee have the <hi>Testimonie of a good Conscience,</hi> that the Lord in some measure hath given us gifts from Heaven: Let us consider what gifts wee give on earth, whether <hi>Lady Pecunia</hi> be the <hi>janitrix</hi> that lets us into the Church or not? whether wee come in by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or <hi>Simon Peter? Qui vendunt vel emunt praebenda Ecclesiarum, dicuntur tales à Simone, Simoniales. Simonie</hi> is well defined by <hi>Brulifer,</hi> to whom the rest of the Schoole-men agree: <hi>Est studiosa voluntas emendi, vel vendendi aliquod spirituale, seu spirituali annexum. Pactum,</hi> is not onely <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> a compact or agreement betweene the Patrone, and a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, or any other for them: but <hi>Simonie</hi> is <hi>peccatum voluntatis</hi>; as the heart commits adultery, if thou lustest after a woman; as the heart commits murder; if thou hatest thy brother, thou art a murtherer. So not the hand onely, but the heart commits <hi>Simonie,</hi> if thou hast a lustfull desire after a benefice in an unlawfull way:
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:12681:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
In their judgement thou art a <hi>Simonist.</hi> And this they proove by the Father of <hi>Simonists:</hi> There was no <hi>pactum</hi> betweene <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the Apostles, but onely <hi>voluntas.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: hee made an offer of money to them; and that was condemned. If thou hast a desire in thine heart to get a benefice by any sinister meanes, thou art a <hi>Simonist:</hi> then almost in this age, who can say hee is assured to have a <hi>good conscience</hi> in this thing?</p>
                  <p>Yet further to lay it open, let us come to the branches of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</hi> It is committed foure kinde of wayes.</p>
                  <p>The first and the greatest <hi>per pecuniam:</hi> which no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> reports as a monstrous thing in his dayes: I heard a Minister say, <hi>Centum solidos dedi, ut Episcopalem gratiam ass equerer.</hi> But how would hee have wondred, if hee had lived in our time, when wee may heare that some have given <hi>centum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> for a benefice? when <hi>solidi</hi> are turned into <hi>minae,</hi> what doth this but <hi>minari,</hi> the vengeance of God to the Ministerie?</p>
                  <p>The second way is <hi>per adulationem</hi>: when as a Minister which is the Doctour of the truth, hath no truth in him, but will lye, flatter, cosen and dissemble, doe any thing for a Benefice. This is <hi>Venenum mellis dulcedine palliatum,</hi> poyson wrapped in honey: yet as many Popes came to the Popedome by poyson; so many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (so woefull is our time) come to a benefice by this poyson. They cannot bee assured with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that they have a <hi>good conscience</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>The third way is <hi>Per importunas preces ambientium,</hi> by the importunate suit of Ministers, either by themselves, or by their great friends for a benefice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Est orare Ducum species violenta jubendi:</hi> The request of great men in high places is a violent kinde of commanding: hee that comes thus to a living, in their opinion, cannot avouche, that he came to it with a <hi>good conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is, <hi>Sordidum obsequium,</hi> a base kinde of service performed by a Minister. As the devill confessed in the maide, <hi>he is the Servant of the high God,</hi> the Ambassadour of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it were <hi>Christ</hi> in the Church. <hi>Yee received mee,</hi> sayes Saint <hi>Paul, as an Angell of Christ,</hi> yea, as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe: and it is a shame for <hi>Christ,</hi> for <hi>Christs</hi> deputy or vicegerent, that susteines his person, to be too servile to any. To them may bee replyed, that Sentence of the Apostle, <hi>If I labour to please men, I cannot be the Servant of Christ</hi>: and have wee not many, that by this base ladder climbe up to the livings in the Church? Heretofore <hi>Cornelius</hi> threw down himselfe at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> feete; but now a <hi>Peter,</hi> yet in truth a <hi>Pseudo-peter,</hi> throwes himselfe downe at the feete of a meane Gentleman for a Benefice. This is a kinde of <hi>Simonie,</hi> as the very Schoole-men have affirmed, an horrible vice: hee that is tainted with it, cannot protest with Saint <hi>Paul, I have a good conscience in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth excellently paint out this sin, I would to
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:12681:329"/>
GOD all Ministers would have his words engraven in their hearts. If thou comest in by <hi>Simonie, Caro suscepit dignitatem, anima per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit honestatem: Caro dominatur populis, anima servit daemonibus: Caro Sacerdotium comparavit, anima detrimentum paravit:</hi> and what shall it availe a Minister <hi>to win the whole world, and loose his owne Soule?</hi> O it is a comfortable thing for a Minister, if hee may truly protest with the Prophet, I have not thrust in my selfe to bee a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour over this people, neither have I desired the day of miserie, Lord thou knowest; to be set over a people, to have the charge of many Soules, for the which we must answer at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if a man will faithfully discharge his Office, it is rather a miserie then a felicitie: hee shall have many difficulties to wrastle withall. Every drunkard, fornicatour, adulterer, &amp;c. if his vices bee ripped up, will bee against him. Wherefore if thou hast thrust thy selfe into this miserie, GOD will leave thee to defend thy selfe: if thou hast beene thrust in by him, hee will defend thee.</p>
                  <p>But as for this vice of <hi>Simonie,</hi> I will shut it up with those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which were not amisse to be imprinted in the hearts of us all.</p>
                  <l>Haec duo damna feres, si tu sis <hi>Simonis</hi> haeres,</l>
                  <l>Mortuus ardebis, &amp; vivus semper egebis.</l>
                  <l>These two losses shalt thou beare, if thou beest <hi>Simons</hi> heyre,</l>
                  <l>A beggar live shalt thou heere, and after burne in hell feere.</l>
                  <p>Of the one, that for the most part they bee beggars, all the world sees it: as for the other, wee shall feele it to our woe, if wee doe not repent.</p>
                  <p>So much for the <hi>good conscience</hi> which wee must have from our entrance into our places. Now let us come to the exequution of our calling being entred. Wherein wee must examine our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> about two things, our preaching, and our life. In our preaching must bee observed the matter of our preaching, and the manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the matter, let us with a watchfull and circumspect eye see what wee deliver; what foode wee minister to CHRISTS Lambes, what bread wee breake to the people. Let there bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Sermons at any time, that is contrary <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, to sound, sincere, and upright doctrine. As there was not a blemish, <hi>nor a soare</hi> by all probability in <hi>Absaloms</hi> body, <hi>from the crowne of his head to the soale of his foote:</hi> so let there be no blemish, so farre as is possible, no sore of corrupt doctrine, from the beginning of our Sermons to the end. Let all bee conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Analogie of Faith, as the Apostle speaketh. Let us have never a drop of doctrine, but wee are sure it flowes from the fountaine of GODS Word. A lamentable thing it is to consider, how many Preachers in the light of the Gospell, partly for the ostentation of their owne wit and learning, partly on an unstayed affection and unsetled judgement deliver dangerous points, that make much hurlie burlie among the people. <hi>Inter curas maxima cura est refraenare curiosos:</hi> they are to bee avoyded, <hi>etiamsi nescio

                  <p>Deliver those things rather that may pierce the hearts of the people to Salvation, then that which may tickle the eares of the people with a carnall delight, and to damnation in the end. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. As in a Countrey Village, where be many Farmers to inveigh against Lords and Land-lords, in the eares of the people, to declaime against the vices of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in the Church, to lay open the blemishes of the state and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement: ô this is as honey to them. A famous Preacher, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Preacher, I warrant you hee cares for none.</p>
                  <p>Alas, what profit have the people by this? applie every plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to every soare. Speake that which may be most fit for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that auditorie, to whom thou speakest. Labour to beate downe Poperie, Brownisme, which sprouteth too fast: bring whom yee can to the Church, but scare none from the Church, give no occasion by your preaching to runne out of the gates of Sion.</p>
                  <p>Above all things in your Sermons have a Christian regard to the peace of the Church wherein yee live, which as a loving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reacheth out to you the dugs of the Word of GOD, which you may sucke to your comfort. <hi>Pray for the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> sayes the <hi>Psalm.</hi> and if wee must pray for it, wee must preach for it. Therefore say I, preach for the peace of Ierusalem wherein ye live, that wee may see the peace of it, if it be the will of GOD, all the dayes of our life. Of this preaching wee shall have great comfort to our <hi>consciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us have an eye to the manner of our preaching. In it let us seeke the glory of our master, not our owne glorie. A great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Preachers have more respect to their words, then to the matter; to the sound of a syllable in the eares of the people, then to the sounding of the trumpet of the Gospell in their hearts. I will not denie, but that the man of GOD may bee eloquent: the Holy Ghost himselfe is most eloquent in the Scripture.

                  <p>For our preaching in the exequution of our office, that shall suffice: now let us come to our life; which is either generall, as common to all Christians; or speciall, as peculiar to our selves.

                  <p>Take heede of the <hi>thousand witnesses:</hi> nay, of the thousand armies, as <hi>Luther</hi> calls it: If thou beest arraigned of fellony, murder, treason, at the barre of an earthly judge, and but two witnesses come against thee, Lord have mercy on thee, thou art gone: and how shalt thou quake before the barre of GODS tribunall seate, when a <hi>thousand witnesses</hi> shall step out against thee? then there is nothing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but that fearefull voice, <hi>goe thou cursed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Wee of the Ministery are much subject to the tongues of men: we are set on an hill, and the eyes of all are converted upon us. If there bee but a little spot in the face, it is quickly espied, and a great matter is made of it: yea, let us walke as warily as we can, give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any, yet men will take offence; and the best Ministers, though living under the protection of a gracious Prince, we may escape the clawes of men, yet certainely not the best of us all can escape the jawes of men: and let not that trouble us; for if all could not give CHRIST a good word, <hi>some sayd hee was a good man, others, nay, but he deceiveth the people:</hi> then let not us thinke that bee sinfull wretches, to have every mans good word. In all speeches and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, let us have recourse to our <hi>consciences,</hi> and heare what they say of us. If all the world commend us, and our <hi>consciences</hi> condemne us, we can have no comfort. On the contrary side, if all the world speake evill of us, and our <hi>consciences</hi> speake good to us, we need not to care for any of them all. Let us remember that worthy speech of a worthy Father, <hi>nec malam conscientiam sanat praeconium laudantis, nec bonam vulnerat opprobrium criminantis.</hi> We are wont to say, if I have
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:12681:331"/>
GOD and the King on my side, I care for no man in England. So may we say, if I have GOD and a cleare <hi>conscience</hi> on my side, I care for no man in all the world. The Papists say, it is unlawfull for a Minister to marry. Some Protestants say, it is inconvenient for Ministers to marry: and indeed their maintenance being so small, it is so: yet for all that I say, it is both lawfull and convenient, nay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all Ministers to marry; for all without exception. But wot ye to what wife? namely to a good <hi>conscience.</hi> If thou beest mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to her, if thou hast her at home to comfort thee in the house of thine heart, though thy living be never so small, thou shalt live mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilously well; yea, more at hearts ease then King <hi>Richard</hi> the third did in his Kingdome: but if thou beest a minister, and hast a <hi>Xantippe</hi> at home, the worme of <hi>conscience</hi> gnawing on thee, for they bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to thy Benefice, for thy bad living in the same, <hi>si inde te eijcit fumus malae conscientiae,</hi> alas poore man, whither shall thou goe? wilt thou run away from thy selfe? whither soever thou goest, thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryest thy <hi>conscience</hi> with thee, and that will keepe a yelling against thee, in <hi>domo, in foro, in mensa, in lecto,</hi> and in all places. Wherefore let us all be assured, that we are at peace with our <hi>conscience,</hi> that wee have this loving Wife to cheere us up wheresoever wee bee: what is our rejoycing, sayes <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> save the testimony of a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let a man be lying on his death bed, let some say to him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man what faire and beautifull houses thou hast, what goodly Lordships, what lands and possessions, what bags of silver and gold: remember in what credit, honour and reputation thou hast lived on the face of the earth: will this comfort him thinke you? truely but a little. But if his <hi>conscience</hi> say to him, as <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> did to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou hast walked before the Lord with an upright heart, this will comfort him and make his heart to skip for joy in his belly: <hi>recta vita esca conscientiae,</hi> a good life is the meate of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> Live well in thy calling, this is meate and drinke to thy <hi>conscience:</hi> this shall comfort thee at the houre of death.</p>
                  <p>When CHRIST had exhorted His Disciples to watching and prayer, because the day of Iudgement was uncertaine: in the conclusion of His speech He turnes Him to the people and sayes, <hi>and the things I say to you, I say to all, watch.</hi> Even so in the shutting up of this exhortation, that which I have sayd unto my brethren in the Ministery, I say to you all, bee all assured that yee <hi>have a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all things.</hi> Let the Magistrate be assured, that he hath a good conscience: that he hath winked at no <hi>sinne</hi> for favour, nor punished any for wrath, malice and displeasure: but as the Iudgement is Gods, so he hath executed it with all <hi>good conscience.</hi> Let the father keepe a good conscience in a religious education of his Children, not suffer them to run at randome, as <hi>Heli</hi> did: but bring them up in the feare and nurture of the Lord. Let the Master keepe a <hi>good conscience</hi> in the usage of his servants, knowing that hee also hath a Master in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Let them that have the oversight of the Clergy committed to
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:12681:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them <hi>keep a good conscience</hi> in that office, looking alwayes to the maine point, the feeding of the flocke of CHRIST. Let them use the Ministers as Christs Ambassadours, reverently, at least in regard of that heavenly person Christ Iesus, whose person they susteyne. Let the Proctors, Advocates, all officers in the court be assured they <hi>have a good conscience in all things.</hi> Let them not pill and pole, but bee content with honest gaines for their paines: let them not make worke for the inriching of the Court, when there neede none. <hi>Francis Spira</hi> an Italian, who himselfe once had beene an advocate in such Courts, complaineth of it, and his <hi>Conscience</hi> made an out-cry against him for it, when hee dyed in desperation. Let all Christians in their places bee assured they <hi>have a good conscience in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the world, the love of mony makes all to <hi>make shipwracke of a good conscience.</hi> The Divell offered Christ all the Kingdomes of the world, to worship him: but if he offer us but a groate or six pence, we are ready to worship him. Money makes all, in Church and Common wealths to smother the checke, of <hi>conscience,</hi> to nip them in the head, and not to regard them: but though we can put <hi>conscience</hi> to silence in this life, hee will open his mouth against us in the life to come. When we dye, as a father observeth, we must leave all books behinde us. <hi>Saint August.</hi> workes, <hi>Saint Basils</hi> workes, the booke of the Court, yea and the Bible, the Booke of bookes: but the booke of our <hi>consciences</hi> we must carry with us: and that when it is opened, shall either accuse us or excuse us at that day: therefore let us looke well to this booke heere, let us examine it, as the Father willeth us, let us conferre it with the booke of life, let us put out all the blots that bee in it, that it may speake for us, not against us, at the dreadfull day of judgement.</p>

                  <p>By this <hi>bloud</hi> He came to be the <hi>Shepheard</hi> of the Church: and this is that <hi>bloud</hi> that ratifies GODS everlasting <hi>Covenant.</hi> The <hi>Covenant, I am thy</hi> GOD, <hi>and the</hi> GOD <hi>of thy seede,</hi> is an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant.</hi> Such as the man is, such is his bond and word.

Yet in respect of His hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, GOD is sayd <hi>to have brought Him from the dead:</hi> which He did after a glorious manner; the Angels waiting on the Sepulcher, the earth trembling, the graves opening, sundry of the <hi>Saints</hi> rising with Him and appearing to many.

All the breath went out of His body: it was wrapt up in linnen cloathes, layed in the Sepulcher, there it continued three dayes and nights; yet <hi>God brought Him againe from the dead:</hi> Hee was seene of His Apostles and others; fourty dayes together; they beheld the print of the nailes in His hands and feet, they eat and dranke with Him, and looked on Him, when Hee went into Heaven. Even so the same <hi>God shall bring us againe from the dead.

                  <p>WEE have heard of the person to whom he prayes: now to the thing for which he prayes: It is <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all good workes:</hi> the which is first set downe: then amplified.</p>
                  <p>It is comprised in these words: <hi>make you perfect, &amp;c.</hi> Hee doth not say, in faith, but <hi>in workes: workes</hi> are a demonstration of faith: <hi>shew me thy faith by thy workes. Except your righteousnesse exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall not enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</hi> Their righteousnesse was to say, not to doe. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.3. ours must be, to say and doe too: else wee shall not set a foote into the Kingdome of heaven. <hi>Not every one that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto mee, Lord, Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore let us annexe workes to our faith. The Lord <hi>makes us perfect in workes,</hi> that our election may be sure.</p>
                  <p>He doth not pray to GOD to make them <hi>perfect in some good workes,</hi> but <hi>in all.</hi> As he sayd, <hi>homo sum, humani nihil à me alienum puto:</hi> So let us say, <hi>Christianus sum, nullum Christianum opus à me alienum puto. Herod did many things,</hi> but because hee did not all, he was not saved. Heere some trees bring forth Peares, some Plumbes, some Apples, some Almonds: There is no tree that bringeth forth all fruit. But every Christian must be as <hi>a tree plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the rivers of waters, that bringeth forth all fruit.</hi> We must be ready for <hi>every good worke:</hi> wee must have prayers, and almes, deedes, zeale, meekenesse, humility, patience, we must <hi>abound in every good worke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 He doth not say, the Lord cause you to begin in <hi>every good worke,</hi> but <hi>God perfect you, &amp;c.</hi> We must labour to aspire to <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> daily more and more, as <hi>Iac.</hi> 1.4. So let zeale, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let every grace have his <hi>perfect worke. Vsus promptos facit,</hi> use makes perfectnesse: <hi>scribendo disces scribere</hi>; use thy selfe to writing, and in the end thou shalt write well: use legs and have legs; so use thy selfe to <hi>good workes,</hi> and <hi>be perfect in good workes. Milo</hi> by using to carry a Calfe when it was young, did beare it when it was old: So let us exercise ourselves in <hi>good workes, from our youth,</hi> as the young man sayes, at the length it will bee easie to attaine such a <hi>perfection</hi> as is acceptable to God. Let us use our selves to pray, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, morning and evening. Let us use our selves to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture as the <hi>Bereans</hi>; to Preaching, as Christ; to fasting, as <hi>Anna</hi>; to give to the poore and needy, as <hi>Dorcas</hi> and <hi>Cornelius.</hi> At length we shall attaine to some <hi>perfection</hi> in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is amplified, 1. By the rule whereby our <hi>workes</hi> must bee framed, that is the will of God. Christ sayd, <hi>not my will, but thine be done.</hi> So must every Christian say, our will is to live at ease, to wallow in pleasures,<note place="margin">Amos 6.</note> to take the Tabret and Harpe, <hi>to eate the Calves out of the middest of the stall,</hi> to rejoyce with the instruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:12681:334" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Our will is never to taste of any misery, to have no losses, crosses, sicknesse: if possible, not to have our finger ake. But let us entreat the Lord, that wee may doe His will, to say with them. <hi>Acts</hi> 21.14. <hi>The will of the Lord be done.</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. <hi>The will of God is your sanctification.</hi> The Lord so <hi>perfect us to every good worke,</hi> that we may <hi>possesse our vessels in holinesse and honour,</hi> that we may <hi>serve Him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is amplified by the manner of our <hi>working.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which is well pleasing in his sight:</hi> not for any worthinesse of ours, but through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in whom God is <hi>well pleased</hi> with us: for without him we can <hi>please God</hi> in nothing. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> both offered Sacrifices, yet God was <hi>pleased with Abel,</hi> not with <hi>Cain.</hi> The Pharisee and Publican, both praied in the Temple, yet the one was heard, and the other was not. Why? because one was in Christ, not the other. Let us desire the Lord to accept of our poore and <hi>imperfect workes,</hi> for the worthinesse of Christ, in whose name they are presented to him.</p>
                  <p>He concludes with a doxologie, a song of praise and thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to Christ the <hi>great Shepheard,</hi> which is <hi>God above all, blessed for ever, to him be glory for ever and ever:</hi> He it is <hi>in whom wee were chosen before the foundation of the world, in whom is our life breath and being:</hi> He it is that in unspeakable love came downe from the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of heaven into the dunghill of the earth for our sakes, that vouchsafed to take flesh of a woman for us, to be borne in a Stable, layd in a cratch, to endure the speaking against of sinners, to be called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> a bibber of wine, a friend of Publicanes and sinners, to be blindfolded, buffetted, spit upon, cruelly whipped, to be pittifully nailed, hand and foote to the Crosse, to susteine the wrath of his Father, to dye, to be buried, to rise againe, to ascend into heaven, there <hi>making intercession</hi> for us: therefore to him be praise for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>He it is, that though he bee absent in body, yet hath not left us Orphanes, poore fatherlesse children: he hath given us his spirit, to be a father to us, to guide us into all truth, an heavenly Comforter, to comfort us in all distresses, to <hi>seale</hi> us up to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: He hath left us His Word, the foode of our soules, the sword of the Spirit to defend us from all enemies of our salvation: Hee hath given us the Sacrament of His blessed Supper as a perpetuall memory of him, wherein we may daily see him: the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> are as pledges of his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> that we may eate him spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be one with him, and he with us. He it is that hath given us his Angels to pitch their tents about us, to take our soules at our dying day, and to carry them into the kingdome of heaven. Therfore let us say with cheerefull hearts, <hi>to him be praise: worthy is the Lord Iesus the great Shepheard of the sheepe, to receive all honour and glory, prayse, power and might, now and for ever, Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Such is the pride and perversenesse of our nature, we cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to be told of our faults: like gauled horses, wee are ready to winch and kicke at it. Therefore this caveat is very needfull: <hi>Suffer</hi> your selves meekely and quietly, to bee reprooved for your sinnes: <hi>Suffer</hi> the Preacher to tell you of your covetousnesse, your pride, malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of your drunkennesse, fornication and adultery, of your negligence in comming to Church: of the little care that is had for the good of the Towne; every man is for himselfe, none for the Towne. <hi>Suffer</hi> your selves to be admonished of these things, it is good for you. <hi>Ye suffer fooles gladly, sayes Saint Paul: yee suffer</hi> stage players to tell you of your faults, and ye laugh at it; and will ye not <hi>suffer</hi> Preachers? ye <hi>suffer</hi> the Physition to give you sowre potions, yee send for him and reward him for it: and will yee not <hi>suffer</hi> the Physition of your soules to bee sharpe with you for your salvation?</p>
                  <p>Ye <hi>suffer</hi> Chirurgions to cut you: and will yee not <hi>suffer</hi> us to lanch the soares of your sins, that the corrupt matter may issue out? <hi>Suffer the words of exhortation,</hi> and magnifie God for them. <hi>Blessed be thou, and blessed be thy counsell,</hi> sayd <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abigail:</hi> So when the Preacher tels us of that which is amisse, and <hi>exhorts</hi> us to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; let us not fret at it, carry a spight against the Preacher: but let us say, blessed be thou, ô man of God, and blessed be thy Counsell, blessed be God that sent thee to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we should <hi>suffer</hi> even with thankesgiving <hi>the word of exhortation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason is, because he hath beene <hi>briefe in it.</hi> I have not beene long rubbing of your soares. I have told you of it in a word. Therefore <hi>suffer</hi> it rather. Yet now adayes some unwise hearers commend longitude: hee stood upon it long, againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; he was an houre, two, three houres: peradventure he might have spoken as much in a quarter of an houre.

               <p>If the officers had seene some of Christs writings, they would have beene ravished with them: but much more with his voyce, the voyce is a shrill trumpet to waken one another. <hi>As yron shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencth yron, so doth man sharpen the face of his friend.</hi>

In writing, there is but a halfe joy; in mutuall speaking there is a full joy: <hi>Sermo est index animi,</hi> the speech is a glasse, wherein we may behold the minde; by that we may freely open our mindes one to another, more freely than wee can by writing. <hi>Paul</hi> longed to see the <hi>Romanes,</hi>

Her sister is called <hi>elect</hi> in the same sence that she was, because of faith and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit that were in her as signes of her election. Did not her sister send greeting to her as well as her children? It may be her children were now with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> for their further instruction, so was not the mother. They should have used a more reverent tearme, their duty or service to be remembred to their Aunt. It is too familiar to send salutations.

               <p>The inscription pointeth out the party writing, and the party to whom he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: the person writing is described, as before, by his office, <hi>An Elder,</hi> a chiefe governour in the Church. For a more ample discussing of it, the reader is to be referred to the former Epistle, <hi>verse</hi> 1. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to whom he writeth, is set forth by his name: and by the speciall love Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> beares to him: Whereof there is first an expression, <hi>Welbeloved</hi>: then an explication how hee loveth him, <hi>in truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His name is <hi>Gajus,</hi> some collect out of the seventh <hi>verse.</hi> that he was a Iew; as if he were opposed to the Gentiles that be there mentioned, yet not he, but they that came from him, whom hee entertained, are apposed to the Gentiles. By his name he should rather be a Romane; for <hi>Gajus</hi> or <hi>Cajus</hi> is a Romane name, <hi>G</hi> and <hi>C</hi> are commutable letters.</p>
               <p>To let all conjectures passe, there be three of this name in Scripture. <hi>Gajus</hi> of <hi>Macedonia, Act.</hi> 19.29. <hi>Gajus</hi> of <hi>Derbe, Act.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Gajus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. Whom <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, whom he termeth his <hi>Hoste, the Hoste of the whole Church, Rom.</hi> 16.23. By all probability this was hee, who continued his hospitality to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> dayes. Christ saith of the woman that powred

                  <hi>there shall also this that she hath done be spoken of, for a memoriall of her: The memoriall of the just shall be blessed,</hi>

                  <hi>but the name of the wicked shall rot. Origen</hi> by dedicating most of his bookes to <hi>Ambrose</hi> a wealthy Noble man, which was his Patron: and <hi>Hierome</hi> by doing the like to <hi>Estochium</hi> a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Virgin, and bountiful to good uses, continue the remembrance of them to all ages, and the fame of <hi>Gajus</hi> shall last, so long as the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> lasteth, this should be a spurre to others to the like.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gajus</hi> was deepe in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> bookes, and in his heart too, he calls him his <hi>Welbeloved,</hi> he gave not this title to the Lady to whom he wrote; some say to avoyde suspition of familiarity with her,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.12.</note> being a woman, a frivilous excuse: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Persis</hi> and <hi>Apphia</hi> beloved,<note place="margin">Philem. 2.</note> without any feare of that.</p>
               <p>Others suppose because it was too familiar, and did not agree to the dignity of a Lady, what needeth all this? he gave her a more magnificent title, when he stiled her <hi>Elect,</hi> this was a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort and honour too to <hi>Gajus,</hi> that he was beloved of such a worthy man as Saint <hi>Iohn, The Disciple whom Iesus loved.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THe other part of the entrance is a precation or wish: where 1. an inculcation or repetition of his beloved, that hee might have the greater assurance of it; and because there might seeme to be some defect in the former sentence, here hee makes a supply of it, I wish unto thee.</p>

                  <hi>I wish that thou mayest prosper,</hi> in thy children, in thy servants, in thy sheepe, in thy cattle, in thy corne, in thy wine, in all things appertaining to thee.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 13.14.</note> hee had 318 in his house that were able to encounter with the enemie. <hi>Isaac</hi> waxed mighty in a strange country, encreased and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, he had flockes of sheepe, heards of cattle,<note place="margin">Gen. 26.13.</note> and a great houshold; even so much as the Philistines had envie at him. <hi>Iacob</hi> with a staffe passed over <hi>Iordane,</hi>

               <p>God gave to <hi>Salomon</hi> that which hee asked not,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 3.13.</note> riches and honours,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 10.26.27.</note> so as among Kings there was none like him in all his dayes, hee had 1400 charrets, and 12000 horsemen; <hi>hee gave silver in Ierusalem as stones, and Ceders as wild figtrees. Iob</hi> had 7000 sheepe, 3000 Camels, 500 yoke of Oxen,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.3.</note> 500 she Asses, insomuch as he was the greatest man in all the East-Country. <hi>Hester</hi> of a poore banished maide, fatherlesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse became a Queene. <hi>Daniel</hi> was made the third man in the Kingdome: hee plucked <hi>Ioseph</hi> out of prison, and made him ruler of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee tooke <hi>David</hi> from the sheepe-coates, and sent the Scepter of <hi>Israel</hi> into his hand.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Indeede prosperity sometimes proves hurtfull:<note place="margin">Prov. 1.32.</note>

In adversitie wee are humble: in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie wee are proud: in adversitie we pray: in prosperitie we play: in adversitie we seeke God, in prosperitie we forget God. All the while that <hi>David</hi> was in persecution and in wars, hee was a chaste man: when hee came to take his ease, and to walke idly on the roofe of his palace,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.2.</note> then he was caught in the snare of

               <p>Yet if it hurt, the fault is not in it, nor in God that sent it, but in our selves that abuse it, as if a friend should give a man, a brave and excellent sword, and he should kill himselfe.</p>
               <p>As for his estate he wisheth that he might <hi>prosper</hi>: so for his body he wisheth that he may be in <hi>health,</hi> which in it selfe is an invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able jewell. <hi>Sed carendo magis quam fruendo,</hi> we know not how to prize it, but when we want it. 1.

               <p>WE have had the entrance. Now to the matter of the Epistle. Where 1 there is the substance of it. 2.The conclusion of it. The substance hath two branches, a Commendation; an Admonition, <hi>v.</hi> 9. He commends him for two vertues that glistered in him: the one is <hi>Sincerity, v.</hi> 3, 4. the other is <hi>Hospitalitie.</hi> 5. his <hi>Sincerity</hi> is set forth by the joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was ravished in regard of it. The joy is first spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>v.</hi> 3. then amplified, <hi>v.</hi> 4. In the specifying of this joy, there is, 1. The greatnesse of it. 2. The ground of it.</p>
               <p>He did not envie it as <hi>Iosuah</hi> did the prophecying of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> but he joyed in it not a little, but greatly, vehemently, as the <hi>Wise men rejoyced with an exceeding great joy,</hi> when they saw the starre againe. There is, <hi>gaudium in carne,</hi> in the flesh: that is,<note place="margin">Mat. 2.10.</note> the adulterers joy; <hi>gaudium in vindicta,</hi> in revenge, that is, the malicious mans joy: <hi>gaudium in mundo,</hi> that is the worldlings joy: <hi>gaudium in Christo,</hi> that is, the Christian mans joy. We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the good things that be in others.</p>
               <p>The ground of his <hi>rejoycing</hi> was a report that came to him of <hi>Gajus, when the brethren came.</hi> Preachers and common Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that were with <hi>Gajus, and testified to the truth: boare witnesse of the truth that is in thee.</hi> 1. Of thy sincere dealing and liberality to all. The good things that be in others must not be smoothered, or buried in silence, our tongues must be as trumpets to sound them abroad; that, which the woman did to Christ, in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a boxe of precious oyntment on his head, must be
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:12681:350"/>
spoken of throughout the world, the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>zeale</hi> of <hi>Phineas,</hi> the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> the <hi>Centurions</hi> Synagogues, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> almes, and the bountifulnesse of <hi>Gajus</hi> shall be propagated to all posterity.</p>
               <p>Fame is like a ship that receives all passengers, like a wagon, that entertaines all, good and bad. Bad things goe abroad, and good things goe abroad, but here is the difference;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bad things goe speedily, good slowly; the one flies like Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; the other creeke like Snailes. <hi>Davids</hi> adultery went further then his sweet and heavenly songs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The one are inlarged, the other diminished; the one halfe of <hi>Salomons</hi> wisedome,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 10.7.</note> came not to the eares of the Queene of <hi>Shebah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The one all heares of: but a few of the other. Thousands heare of a false report: as that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacht against the Law and <hi>Moses</hi>:<note place="margin">Acts 21.20.</note> hundreds do not heare of the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Bad things goe without ceasing; men are like flies that are ever insisting upon soares: the report of good things is like an hue and cry, that quickly fals downe in the Countrey.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The one we tell of with delight: we take little pleasure in talking of the other; the one shall be at ordinaries, the other shall finde never an ordinary, yet we ought rather to testifie of the one rather than of the other. God and his Angels take delight in the one: the devill in the other. Let us witnesse of the vertues wherewith God hath adorned any. It shall redound to his glory, and it shall be a spurre to pricke on others to the like.</p>
               <p>This is illustrated a <hi>pari. Even as thou walkest in the truth.</hi> 1. In the truth of the Gospel, which thou dost adorne by thy good workes: Thou dost not content thy selfe to beginne in the truth, but thou walkest in it, like a good traveller, till thou come to the end of thy journey to the Celestiall Canaan.</p>

               <p>IN his resisting of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> is to be considered. 1. What he did resist. 2. Who resisted. 3. The manner of his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>That which he withstood was a letter written by Saint <hi>Iohn: I wrote to the Churches</hi>; that is to the company of the faithfull in thy city, which may well be <hi>Corinth,</hi> for it was a factious citie, full of Sects and Schismes. The vulgar translateth it, <hi>Scripsi for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitan; peradventure I had written.</hi> But <hi>Erasmus</hi> guesseth shrewdly, and truely. The word [<hi>Forsitan</hi>] was foisted by some unlearned Clarke into the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I wrote,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, to the Church:</hi> And he speakes it by the way of a <hi>Prolepsis. Gajus</hi> must reply: Why? Didst thou not write to us all this while about the entertaining of these men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I wrote,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>: but my writing was not regarded. This Epistle of Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> is not now extant,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.31.</note> no more peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are some which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote. But wee have so much Scripture by divine providence as is sufficient to salvation: we neede not flie to unwritten verities.</p>
               <p>Now let us take a view of the partie resisting. He is described by his name, and by his peevish quality. His name was <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> Some read <hi>Dietrepe; Quasi</hi>

                  </gap> overturning God; then it fits him well, for he was an overtwharter of God and all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse; but it is <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, nourished by God. And <hi>Homer</hi> cals Kings <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> suis.</hi> Sometimes men have sutable names: The Name of Iesus agreed wonderfull well to our blessed Saviour, <hi>for he saves us from our sins, and there is no Saviour besides him. Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Philotimus</hi> were both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their names, both pure worshippers of God. But some times mens names are different from their doings. <hi>Iudah</hi> is a good name, of <hi>Iudah, a praiser of God,</hi> yet he that betrayed Christ, had that name. <hi>Simon</hi> is a good name; <hi>Shamaang, Obedience</hi>: yet <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was disobedient, the fountaine of all heresies. So this <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had a good name; but he himselfe was a bad man. Good names may be meanes to make men good, but they doe not make them good without the blessing of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie.</p>

               <head>VERSE 12.</head>
               <p>WEE have had the bad man to be eschewed. Now to the good man, that is to be followed: That is, <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade of a <hi>Demetrius</hi> the father of <hi>Antiochus</hi> that once reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Israel, in the bookes of the <hi>Maccabes</hi>: There are but two mentioned in the new Testament: The Silver-smith, that made shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi> and raised a tumult in <hi>Ephesus</hi>: and <hi>Demetrius</hi> here spoken of:<note place="margin">Act. 16.24.</note> Who he was cannot certainely be defined: By all probability he was one of the Preachers before mentioned: who at this time was with Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>; and as some thinke, was the carrier of this Epistle. Whatsoever he was, he was a good man, opposed to <hi>Diotrephes</hi>; he was a proud man; this an humble man: he an hard hearted man, that shut up the bowels of compassion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst poore strangers: this is a mercifull man to his ability, ready to entertaine strangers: he himselfe against Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>: this was a lover and a reverencer of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> God will not have us to be utterly dejected by the examples of wicked men:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7.</note> he stirreth up some good men, that may countervaile them. As the Iewes had a <hi>Haman</hi> to pull them downe; so they had a <hi>Mordecai</hi> to lift them up: As Christ had many enemies among the Pharisees: so he had some friends among them, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea.</hi> As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a Smith against him in <hi>Ephesus</hi>: so hee had the Towne-Clerke of <hi>Ephesus</hi>; by Gods providence to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the tumult, as <hi>Gajus</hi> might grieve for <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> so he might rejoyce in <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Demetrius</hi> had an excellent report. 1. Of all men in generall. 2. Of the truth itselfe. 3. Of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in speciall.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Demetrius</hi> is witnessed of all men; all have witnesse to him to be a good man, neither is it a lying, but a true witnesse: the truth it selfe doth testifie it, his deedes being answerable to the generall report that goeth of him.</p>
               <p>Yea, and I too doe justifie the same. He shall have my pen, my hand to testifie the same.</p>
               <p>I but thy testimony is of no great weight, for that I appeale to your owne knowledge.<note place="margin">Iohn 21.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye know,</hi> having had so long experience of me, <hi>that my record is true.</hi> Christ knew it, the faithfull ever since have verified it: and you your selves know it to be true; he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earnest in the commendation of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But is this such a praise to <hi>Demetrius</hi> to have the good report of all men: Our Saviour seemes to be of another judgement. <hi>O be to you, when all men speake well of you; for after this manner did their fathers to the false prophets.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.26.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That is spoken of men-pleasers, which accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to all mens humours, sooth up all in their sinnes, that they may get the good will, and good word of all, as appeareth by the
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:12681:360"/>
example of the false prophets alleadged: <hi>Demetrius</hi> was none of that ranke.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Here by <hi>all men</hi> is meant all good and godly men, although a good man sometimes may in some things so carry himselfe, that the very wicked shall be compelled to speake well of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As <hi>Demetrius</hi> had the testimony of men, so he had the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth it selfe; the truth did beare witnesse of him, as well as men.</p>
               <p>There be two things which we ought all to procure, <hi>bona con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia,</hi> a good conscience in respect of God, <hi>&amp; bona fama,</hi> and a good name, a good report in regard of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A good name is sweet and comfortable, it is preferred before the most precious things that men have in greatest estimation, <hi>A good name is to be chosen above great riches:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 22.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and loving favour is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove silver and gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 It is profitable, <hi>A good name maketh the bones fat,</hi> an ill name maketh a man leane, a good name maketh a man fat, he eates,<note place="margin">Pro. 15.30.</note> hee drinkes, he sleepes the better for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It secures a man, while he is alive, they that have a bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for their injurious dealing, are shooted at, and maligned; they goe in some sort in danger of their lives; they that have a good report walke cheerefully and safely.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It is a consolation to a man, even on his death bed, hee hath the lesse then to vexe and trouble his minde.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It leaves a sweet savour after us, When we be dead it is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doriferous oyntment, the house wil smell of it a good while after. Therefore let us so live, that we may be well reported of, so far as it is possible of all men. I say, so farre as it is possible. For in truth it is impossible,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.8.</note> the best of us all must make account to passe through good report and ill report into the kingdome of heaven.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour himselfe had not the good word of all: <hi>Some said he was a good man, others said nay to it, but he deceiveth the people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.12. 1 Sam. 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>It is no good report, that I heare of you,</hi> said <hi>Eli</hi> to his sonnes, that lay with the women assembled at the doore of the tabernacle of the Congregation: Let us not be justly ill reported of for our grosse Idolatry, abominable swearing, lying, killing, whoring, for our execrable covetousnesse and oppression, that will make us stincke in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>THe conclusion of the Epistle: Consisting of an excusation for his short writing; of a Christian farewell; and of loving and mutuall salutations: The excuse is altogether the same with the former, in the 12. of the 2 Epistle. The Christian fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
