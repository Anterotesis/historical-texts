            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And this, Royall Sir, is my humble requeſt to your ſaered Majeſty at this time; That you will graciouſly accept a</hi> mean gift <hi>from a</hi> mean giver,
<pb facs="tcp:170395:3"/>
               <hi>and by your royall return of juſtice and bountie to enable me to ſerve God, and your Majeſty with better; God himſelf inviting you thereto by his example, who allowed even of</hi> poor freewill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, <hi>made to him of purpoſe, to obtain his bountifull returns of ſome eminent benefits or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And yet</hi> a mean gift, <hi>Sir, I call this of mine, not that the</hi> work it ſelf <hi>ſhould be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, but</hi> my work about it; <hi>which is but a Tranſlation. For the Book though in bulke but ſmall, in its concernments is very rich; and, as highly commendable in it ſelf, ſo not much leſs in the Author. In its natural language it made its firſt addreſs to Cardinal</hi> Mazarine, <hi>in order to have ſet his Majeſty of</hi> France <hi>on conqueſt of the great Kingdome of the</hi> Amazone <hi>to himſelf. But having theſe five years at least, that now it hath been abroad, not made uſe of it that way, it comes now by me to beg your Majeſties favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, in hope of that large retribution to your ſelf, when your Majeſty ſhall think fit to apply your thoughts to it, for which it was intended to another. It was by an old ſervant of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Royall Fathers, and Gandfathers,</hi> I. L. D. <hi>brought over, and communicate to one of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties moſt expert Seamen,</hi> C. W. <hi>who from his youth up, and often times ſince, hath been in, and knowes perfectly all the coaſts of the</hi> Southern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. <hi>Both theſe are very confident, at leaſt wiſh heartily, and my ſelf with the like affection do now humbly preſent it alſo, That your Majeſty would ſo conſider of that great Empire, as if it</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170395:4"/>
               <hi>were already your own; as it may be with much eaſe, if your applications be ſeaſonable, and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its worth. For it is poſſeſt by the barbarous Natives only, except in two</hi> Skirts; Braſile <hi>on the Eaſt, where the</hi> Portuguaiſe <hi>pitched; and</hi> Peru <hi>upon the Weſt, where the</hi> Spaniard <hi>is divided from the</hi> Inland <hi>by the tract of the</hi> Andes, <hi>or</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliere hills: <hi>but in the</hi> Peninſular <hi>great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent your Majeſty may dreſſe an</hi> Empire <hi>of near nine thouſand miles in circuit, of the pleaſanteſt, fertileſt, and richeſt continent in the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for air, waters, or ſoil; to which no Prince can pretend, much leſs lay a claim. For the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of that River by the</hi> Portugaiſe, <hi>and</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, <hi>were more to ſatisfie their curioſity, than that they could then hope for a conqueſt. And the Natives not only in their forlorn condition, but by ſingular junctures of providence, call for the Chriſtian Religion from us, while others ceaſe from that duty, as the man of</hi> Macedon <hi>did</hi> Paul <hi>to help them while he was hindred to go into</hi> Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, <hi>Act. 16.7, 9, 10. and others have been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hitherto to go to them for ſuch end; but they may alſo eaſily be made to receive your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Government with friendſhip, if wiſely dealt with. For while neither</hi> Portugall, <hi>nor</hi> Spain, <hi>nor</hi> France <hi>purſued the deſign here offered, God in in his providence amidſt, your Majeſties and your good Subjects troubles, ſeems not obſcurely to have been deſigning this for you, and your</hi> Brittain; <hi>as may be hoped from</hi> ancient prediction, <hi>not liable to exception from the ſolideſt and ſobereſt wits (as
<pb facs="tcp:170395:4"/>at another occaſion I may fullier clear, if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty command it) and ſo much the more, as his providence hath prevented your projecting, having already made way and brought to paſs for your Majeſties intereſt an opportune and conſiderable Colonie, by that noble Lord</hi> Willoughbee <hi>of</hi> Parham, <hi>to his great travels, hazards, and vast expenſes; both ſeeming to concurre with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid prediction, and to point out your Majeſty for the layer of ſuch a foundation both to Chriſt, and your ſelf.</hi>

               <hi>The Author of this work is a French Earl of a moſt ancient Nobility and deſcent from thoſe famous and honourable Commanders in the holy Warres, who for their wiſe conduct and rare valour were imployed in places of great truſt, and tranſmitted them with the Coat of arms and name of</hi> Pagan, <hi>(which was the badge of their great exploits in mating and killing the</hi> Pagans, <hi>or</hi> Infidels) <hi>to their ſueceſſors of the ſame</hi> name <hi>and</hi> family, <hi>as the Author himſelf ſhowes at large in the Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his rare Book of Fortifications, to another noble branch of the ſame family: of whoſe rare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments for</hi> gentile <hi>and</hi> manly learning, <hi>and</hi> Souldiery, <hi>leſt I ſhould here preſume too much upon your Majeſties patience, I ſhall leave further account of him to my Epiſtle to the Reader, and only preſent your Majeſty with the ſumme of what he ſayes to the</hi> Cardinal <hi>about the conqueſt; and that is;</hi>

                  <hi>of ſieges. There is need only of preparations fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for planting of five Colonies at the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. The firſt whereof is to be in the</hi> Iſle of the Sun, <hi>for guarding the beſt entrie into the great Rivers mouth. The ſecond on the famous</hi> Boſphore <hi>or</hi> Strait <hi>thereof, to defend, or keep this Rivers paſſage. The third on the renowned</hi> point <hi>of the</hi> Comanares, <hi>for the beſt ſeat of that whole Empire. The fourth near to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of</hi> Swana, <hi>whereby to be maſter of the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine there. And the fifth and laſt on the mouth of the River of</hi> Maragnon, <hi>to watch over the Frontier of that ſide of the</hi> Andes. <hi>And in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ſuch a firſt eſtabliſhment, there might eaſily be added the</hi> alliances <hi>of the Illuſtrious and renowned Nations of the</hi> Homagues, <hi>of the generous and noble</hi> Yorimans, <hi>of the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and redoubted</hi> Topinambes; <hi>and order given for a</hi> Fleet-volant <hi>of about twelve men of Warre, continually to be viſiting, and going between theſe Colonies: becauſe the diſtance by ſailing, of the fartheſt of them from the others, will be at the leaſt a thouſand Spaniſh leagues and alwayes upon the channell of the great</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone <hi>it ſelf.</hi>

My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and any eſtate I ſhould have had by him, I loſt through the troubles of the times; and have wanted them now theſe ſeventeen years; for repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, and coming hither to wait for it, I left one place of conſiderable value in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and ſpent here in three years attendance for repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what I could then bring with me; and then embracing another place here in</hi> England, <hi>not much worſe than the former, was not only again put from it, before I had enjoyed it full two years to an end, for keeping my fidelity to your Majeſty in refuſing to ſubſcribe an engagement, or allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (for ſo it was indeed, whatever they called it) to another Soveraignty; but ſuffered alſo four or five years baniſhment, to the almoſt irreparable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of my health and eſtate both; yea, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all preferments from the uſurpers, and the leaſt compliances with them, both before my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and now for ſeven years after, though I was wooed thereto, and might have got conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable advancement with eaſe, could I have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it with complyance; but would never ſo much as commence ſuit under them; though but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſome debts, or defending my ſelf from others unjuſt purſuits. And that theſe loſſes, Sir, wherein conſiſted all my eſtate, and that a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one too, when your Majeſty ſhall know the
<pb facs="tcp:170395:6"/>particulars, ſhould make me poor, is little wonder; and that poverty through its diſadvantages, and my former diſparity of life, ſhould ruine my health, is as little wonder; and that all the diſadvantages, that a ruined health, and poverty can bring a man to, ſhould diſable me to do ſuch thing as otherwiſe I could, and would have done, to preſent your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with, is yet as little ſtrange, as the former: but that I ſhould yet be alive, poor as I am, to offer this poor gift unto your Majeſty,</hi> that is the wonder. <hi>And indeed it is Gods good hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, whom I hope he hath reſerved for doing himſelf, and your Majeſty ſome greater ſervice, before I be called hence. For, Royall Sir, God hath not made me ſo</hi> poor <hi>in gifts of minde, (of which as I may not brag, but by glorying in him, and in my infirmities or ſufferings for him; ſo may I not</hi> ungratefully <hi>conceal, leſſen, or undervalue to his diſhonour, what they are, but with modeſty confeſs, when juſt occaſion flagitates and extorts it from me) through his bleſſing, if your Majeſty will but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize me (I ſhall not ſay</hi> Mecaenas-<hi>like; for that is too little for you, though it was truely ſaid of him,</hi> Mecaenas atavis edite regibus! <hi>but</hi> Anguſtus <hi>like rather, beyond whom himſelf your Majeſty is in this alſo, that you can number more Kings of your Progenitors, than were in all the Roman race of Kings, and Emperors both, either before, or after</hi> Auguſtus <hi>to this day) I hope to honour your Majeſty with ſuch gifts of mine own ſtore, as never a King in Chriſtendome for theſe ſixteen hundred years, ever had Subject, that did
<pb facs="tcp:170395:6"/>the like, though many have attempted,</hi> abſint &amp; jactantia, &amp; invidia verbo: <hi>but your Majeſty muſt midwife them, and my ſelf both into the world again, and then by Gods aſſiſtance ſhall I renew my ſtrength and youth, as the Eagle,</hi> &amp; ſublimi feriam ſidera vertice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If here it be wondred, that thus I implore your Majeſties juſtice and favour, and made not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a privater addreſs, for repairing of my loſſes; I ſhall humbly and truely profeſs, that I have not left privater wayes unattempted; but finde all ſo obſtructed with difficulties, and non-conſiderancies, or cold layings to heart of my caſe, that neither the health of my body, nor the ſtrength of my purſe would ſuffer me to hope for much good otherwayes, and from Courtiers, than thus by uſhering in my Petition; and then I hope more ſeaſonably, and ſuccesfully to reap the fruits of a privater appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. I thought often of that courſe, that the poor Widow took with</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Macedon, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great: who when ſhe had attempted by</hi> Courtiers, <hi>and</hi> Favourites <hi>to get juſtice done her, but could not prevail with them to preferre her buſineſs to the</hi> King; <hi>reſolved to attaque him her ſelf, the beſt ſhe could, come of it what would; though of him at worſt, ſhe hoped much better, than of any of his Courtiers, as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo do of your Majeſty now. Caſting her ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his way, when ſhe knew, he was to ride out, with high vociferations ſhe cryed after him,</hi> Help my Lord, O King; help O King! <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to ſtand, and ſee what ailed her; ſhe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170395:7"/>
               <hi>deſired him to read and anſwer her Petition with juſtice. He anſwering that it was unfit then, and that he had not leaſure for it; ſhe replyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him boldly, That then</hi> he ſhould not be at leaſure to be King, <hi>if he could not have leaſure to right his meaneſt Subjects, when all their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and endeavours were otherwayes fruſtrate and wearied out. Upon which he was ſo far from being diſſatisfied with her, that rather admiring her reſolution, he moſt generouſly and heroickly gave her a preſent hearing, and full right of her wrong. Sir, my way is not ſo courſe, as hers was, but by a gift (which both with God, and all nobleſt ſpirits among men, finds acceptance) though but a poor onee, to have the ſofter acceſs to your Majeſties favour, and a cordialler conſideration of my caſe, when it comes to your Majeſty in a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way; and an eaſier grant of privacy for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate imparting your Majeſty with ſome things, which is more for your Majeſties good, than for my particular. Thus wiſe</hi> Abigail <hi>not only pacified</hi> David <hi>towards an unthankefull and churliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, <hi>but made way for her ſelf for ſuch a ſurpluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of favour, as ſhe little dreamed of, to become a Kings wife, and royal bedfellow, and her iſſue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the entail of the Crowr, before all other of</hi> Davids <hi>children, except</hi> Bathſhebaes. <hi>It is re ported of</hi> Alexander Severus, <hi>the Emperour, b</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:170395:7"/>debitorem? Why ask you nothing of me? Would you have me to die in your debt? <hi>Sir, leſt I preſume too much upon your Majeſties great affairs, in exceeding the bounds of an Epiſtle to ſo great a Prince, for the length whereof already I humbly beg pardon, my hopes and deſires are that you ſhall not come ſhort of any of thoſe Worthies, or of the moſt heroick Princes, but ſurmount them all, in all royall endowments, to your becoming the Crown and rejoycing of all the</hi> reformed, <hi>in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their intereſt, which is Gods, and becoming their</hi> uniter <hi>and</hi> head, <hi>that you may be</hi> Carolo magno major, <hi>as undoubtedly you will, if thus you do: and which that you may do, Long may your Majeſty live in all piety, plenty, and peace; or elſe juſt and happy triumphs here; and hereafter in the joyes and triumphs of heaven, where there is nothing but glory, triumphs, and joy without end.

                     </hi> Muſt give thee ſome more account of the Author of this Booke, and of its worth, and of my ſelf, his Tranſlatour, and ſo bid thee farewell. About the Author, I ſhall not repeat, what hath been ſaid of him before, in my Dedication to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for his juſt commendation, and of this Book of his in particular, but referre thee thither, if thou art deſirous to know it. I ſhall here only adde, That he was in great employment and favour with the late King of <hi>France, Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, for his great parts of conduct and valour in his ſervice; wherein unfortunately he received a ſhot of a Piſtoll in the left eye, whereby it was quite loſt, and the conjugation of the optick nerves ſo cruſhed, that he hath loſt the uſe of both now above theſe twenty yeares: yet, which is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:170395:9"/>is ſtill penning new Books, and in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks eſpecially, which indeed needs leaſt the outward ſenſe; amongſt which is that maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, The ten Books of Geometricall Theorems, wherein he compleated and demonſtrated ſo many diverſe, and diſtinct parts of Mathematicall Sciences. His Book of the theory of Planets is Geometrically demonſtrated, without any mixture of Phyſicall equations, by which <hi>Reignoldus</hi> and <hi>Kepler</hi> laboured ſo much to perfect the Geometricall, wherein their deferents, and Epicicles could not ſerve their turn. But this Gentleman hath found out both the center of the Planets, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated their motions to be ellipticall, which no man afore him could attain to. And in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his theory, he publiſhed Aſtronomicall tables two yeares ago, wherein with great facility and exactneſs, the motions of all the Planets may be ſupputate, the Eclipſes of the two great lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and the celeſtiall configurations: and in conſequence to them, a facile method of finding out the true longitudes, both by ſea, and land. His more than ordinary skill in Geography, may be ſeen by his two Advertiſements to Geographers, at the end of this Booke, and by the Book it ſelf: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with great judgement and brevity he hath given an excellent, and the clearcſt deſcription of a great part of <hi>America,</hi> that any where is to be had: he having collected this out of all the beſt relations, and diſcoveries, that were extant; and corrected their errors, adding a Mapp of his own. All which his Pieces here mentioned, and in my Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb facs="tcp:170395:9"/>to his Majeſty ſhall be by me made Engliſh Denizens, if this be well accepted, and the other required. The Books are not here to be had for money, but from ſuch, as himſelf gifted them to; amongst whom is an old ſervant of his Majeſties, my <hi>L. D.</hi> from whom this Book came, and who ſtill keeps a correspondence with him, and is gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every Piece, that be publiſheth. The Author is ſtill a privy Counſellour to his now Majeſty of <hi>France;</hi> and as his <hi>naturals</hi> appear to have been great, ſo alſo they have been much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, and elevated by his <hi>Gentlemanny</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he hath induſtriouſly followed; and conſiſts in theſe dayes (the greater the fault of <hi>Pedants,</hi> that make any learning ungentile; as indeed none is where it hath a <hi>gentile</hi> client) chiefly in <hi>Politicks,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> with their appendants, as conducible to a Gentleman, and a Souldier: and after he was diſabled from <hi>Field-action,</hi> by the loſs of his ſight, ſome theoreticaller Mathematicks alſo. This is not rare in <hi>France,</hi> That <hi>Grandees</hi> there are well verſed in ſuch ſtudies, as by Duke <hi>de Roha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> Intereſt of Princes, and <hi>Perfect Capitaine,</hi> and many other <hi>French Gentlemens</hi> Pieces of a like nature, may appear. And it were to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That elſewhere alſo, Grandees and Gentry were both as well trained up, and had as good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſuch peculiar <hi>Academies,</hi> where all gentile, and Souldierly exerciſes, and requiſites for conduct and command, are taught, as the French have; and the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> to his
<pb facs="tcp:170395:10"/>immortall praiſe (himſelf having been bred in the <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Benjamin</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> where I my ſelf ſaw him at his exerciſes) to the Weal of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and from his own eſtate, was going to enrich the confederate Provinces; that as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a School of Warre, for experience and practice, especially about ſieges, and taking in of Towns; ſo they might be for breeding alſo to field-ſervices, and all warlike atchievements.</p>
                  <p>Yet the French are ſo far from envying others, that attain to any perfection in theſe things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, or elſewhere, that there is no where rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier preferment for their merits, or more honour done to ſuch, as I could inſtance of late memory; which is <hi>truly noble.</hi> For there is a <hi>money-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> or <hi>Gentry,</hi> that is now crepe into the world, through abuſe, and peſters it with many inconveniences, having nothing of the <hi>thing,</hi> but the <hi>name</hi> only, and <hi>empty</hi> titles; nor of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of <hi>virtues,</hi> and with <hi>virtue,</hi> without which <hi>true Gentry,</hi> or <hi>Nobility</hi> cannot be, nor ſubſiſt, had it never ſo much <hi>riches, antiquity of deſcent,</hi> or <hi>windy</hi> titles from <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> For <hi>true Gentry</hi> is <hi>virtus generis, vertue running in a blood,</hi> and either increaſing, or deſcending in a <hi>race,</hi> or <hi>breed.</hi> It's <gap reason="foreign">

But want of breeding to noble thoughts, and ends; and inſtruction to inure to chaſt and continent love, and not to deflore ſo much as their fancies, before the due and lawfull time; abuſe alſo of marriage to baſe ends and by-reſpects, eſpecially of <hi>money;</hi> and imprudent choices in ſundry other reſpects, grown common with prodigality, luxury, and many other vices, have in theſe Countreys and times flatted and unspirited all natural nobleneſs and generoſity either into a ſoft effeminacy, or ſowr vineger of <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> imbittered with the gall of many other vices, inſtead of the <hi>generous</hi> wine, they came of.

High birth and fortunes, are in themſelves, both of them, the good bleſſings of God, and are in honour with all perſons of honour, where ever they are, or have been in any, that have ſuitable vertues, but have parted with fortunes for vertues ſake. But for a Gentleman whoſe fortunes are become unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his ranke, whether by his own fault, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or by neither, but by wrong, or misfortune, for reparation of an eſtate, ſo far to forget himſelf, as to make money his <hi>leading motive</hi> in a choice, is <hi>ignoble</hi> enough, and ungenerous, and can hardly expect better fruits of his way. We know, he was a wiſe man, that ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O land, when thy King is the ſon of nobles!</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>10.7.</hi> And he that ſaid, <hi>Nam genus, &amp; proavos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipſi, vix ea noſtra voco,</hi> in oppoſition to too much ſtanding on, or vaunting of deſcent without competent vertue and wiſdome to correſpond with it; ſaid alſo, <hi>Et Mi genus ab Jove ſummo,</hi> to ſhow his eſteem of deſcent; and with virtue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; especially of ſuch a deſcent, as claimed to the beſt, that could be reckoned to.

<pb facs="tcp:170395:12"/>if he can do it truely, and hath juſt occaſion and circumſtances to extort it from him, would ſhow but himſelf too modeſt at beſt, and almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, eſpecially if he had a better <hi>Jupiter</hi> in place to make both his addreſs and claim to, than the other had. For as low as my fortunes are, I can claim to the beſt blood in <hi>England,</hi> and that by <hi>England,</hi> and neither very far off, nor in an ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate way. Neither need I to be aſhamed of my fortunes (though hitherto, which was my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have been aſhamed of them, whereas I ought not to have been aſhamed, but of ſin) ſeeing I part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them willingly, for retaining to vertue, and a good conſcience. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told me, that <hi>all things come alike to all;</hi> and that the <hi>race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong, nor bread to the wiſe, nor riches to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all,</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>9.2, 11, &amp;c.</hi> I was never lower yet, than that great and noble <hi>Generall,</hi> of that great Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> was unjuſtly brought, to his maſters no little dispraiſe, <hi>Beliſarius</hi> of immortall renown.

<pb facs="tcp:170395:13"/>as contrary to the firſt founders of a noble race; who, though they cannot claim <hi>deſcent,</hi> yet are beyond moſt of thoſe, that can: ſince it is more to <hi>give,</hi> or <hi>make</hi> a noble deſcent, than to <hi>receive</hi> it, and moſt <hi>cadets,</hi> prove oftner <hi>cadents,</hi> than <hi>culminants,</hi> and ſeldome equall their <hi>found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> but <hi>unſpirit</hi> themſelves, and <hi>evaporate</hi> to a <hi>vappidneſs</hi> of money—or <hi>prediall-gentility.</hi> I mean not ſo much that, which is bought with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (for that may be ſo, where it deſerved to have been given) as that which hath nothing but riches to ſuſtain it. <hi>Cicero</hi> anſwered <hi>Saluſtius</hi> his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of an upſtart, well, (if we ſuppoſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives to be theirs) <hi>Ego meis majoribus virtute praeluxi; Tu tuis turpiter offudiſti tenebras.</hi> And as for occupations, and offices, though ſome be juſtly accounted more <hi>fordid,</hi> and <hi>illiberall;</hi> others more honourable and gentile; yet all that are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, coming from God, and from his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as theſe mentioned, and implyed, <hi>Exod. 31.3.</hi> &amp;c. none joyned with virtue, can juſtly <hi>ignobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> any.

Thus <hi>David</hi> wiſhed rather to be a doorkeeper in the houſe of his God (a Porter of the Temple) than to be a King in the Tents of wickedneſs. And to <hi>Moſes</hi> his poſterity, though King in <hi>Jeſhurun,</hi> yea
<pb facs="tcp:170395:13"/>more than a King, a King, Prieſt and Prophet, which is more than ever we read of any other (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Chriſt, of whom be was therein a ſingular Type; ever a typicall <hi>Mediatour,</hi> for be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <hi>Aaron</hi> to his Prieſthood, which without being <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he could not have dine) yet there was no more allotted to them, but to be <hi>chief Porters</hi> in the houſe of God. What calling meaner than a <hi>Butcher?</hi> Yet the High-Prieſt, the ſecond perſon in the Kingdome, and ſometimes, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the firſt, was by his calling a <hi>ſacred Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> and if I be not miſtaken, as I hope in my Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reſearches I may ſhow, that I am not, the King himſelf in ſome caſes, was ſuch a ſacred Butcher in ſome ſort, in that he killed his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; and it was an high, and an eminent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him too; and ever bad been accounted, as the <hi>priviledge of the firſt-born,</hi> where the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of dignity, and of power was by divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, before the <hi>Jewes</hi> policy was erected. A Preacher of this City, that now bears his head high, when a Gentleman ſhowed him, (as I have heard from the Party) a Tract by him done into Latine, and ſubſcribed in the Title-page, <hi>Per A. B. Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> &amp;c. he very ſmatterer-like, and pedantick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewryed his ignorance, that <hi>nobilis</hi> in Roman and pureſt Latine phraſe, that we could have, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> but he would not underſtand it otherwayes, but according to the <hi>Angliſm</hi> that he was acquainted with, whereby <hi>Nobleman</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to Barons, Vicounts, Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother perſon of quality in this City (as I have
<pb facs="tcp:170395:14"/>heard the Story) riſing from a mean degree to great fortunes, had a diſtreſſed Gentleman (without the Gentlemans own knowledge) recommended to his company and Table: and thereupon the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen himſelf inviting him too, he well accepted of it, and was as well taken with; and upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther converſe, ſo well, that he juſtly apprehended ſome more than ordinary favours towards him, if he would lay hold on them. To lay hold he was moſt willing, and did; but reſolved to proceed cantiouſly and ſlowly, for many Reaſons, which if they had known, or had the patience, till diſcreetly they might have been opened to them, they would have allowed of. But they conſtruing this <hi>ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for <hi>neglect,</hi> were offended, and that ſo far, that at length (the Gentleman not finding it beſt to alter his procedure) the Citizen diſcharged him his houſe, though upon a contrary pretence. He took this as an high affront, as indeed it was. And they coming to know their miſtake, invited him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but ſo unſufficiently, the Maſter of the houſe being excepted from being the <hi>inviter,</hi> though he had been the <hi>diſcharger,</hi> that the Gentleman would not thereupon come ſo ſoon, as it ſeems, they expected him; but he did caſt himſelf to meet with them, where he might either have a fuller invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them that had the right, or opportunity to tell them, what an one their <hi>Deputy</hi> had given him. But he found them in a new diſcontent and miſtake upon refuſall of that invitation, which increaſed to ſuch <hi>diſtance,</hi> that it could not be removed, through their too high carriage; which he diſdained
<pb facs="tcp:170395:14"/>the more, the higher it was; untill at length going about to beget a right underſtanding again, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch another ſignall affront, as he vowed never to enter their houſe, untill be knew he had a <hi>full</hi> and free invitation that came from him that diſcharged him. Matters ſtanding thus now, the Gentleman, to whom I could not deny ſuch a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, for many reaſons; requeſted me, <hi>That thus in a cloud</hi> to others, I would find a way as ſoon as I could, to <hi>uncloud</hi> his buſineſs briefly to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned, that they might make ſuch uſe thereof, as they ſaw good. And I have choſen this way of examples ſubjoyned to the diſcourſe of <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,</hi> by way of Apology for my ſelf, and firſt opening my condition from that obſcurity it lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to prevent, or repulſe the curriſh ſnarls of <hi>clowniſh Pedants,</hi> and <hi>Schioliſts.</hi> My intent in this Tranſlation, is (beſide what I have expreſt to his Majeſty) the propagation of Religion, and the good of <hi>England.</hi> But if Religion be not better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and attended, and proſecuted by underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, than it hath been at home, it may juſtly fruſtrate all, and caſt us in as great confuſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as it did at home. But becauſe this would require more length, than this Epiſtle is now fit to be drawn unto, and I may have another occaſion for it perhaps, ere long; I heartily recommend all to Gods bleſſing, and thy good acceptance, and bid thee farewell.</p>

The Provinces are all ſo mightily, peopled, and their habitations ſo thick, that from the laſt village of one Town, one may hear the noiſe of ſuch as travail from the firſt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of anopher.

               <p>SEing neither Steel nor Iron are found at all in the Weſt-<hi>Indies,</hi> we muſt not marvell, if the <hi>Americans</hi> of this great Kingdom have no other Arms, but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Javelots; about which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are marvellouſly expert, not only for making them of hard wood, and ſharp pointed, but alſo for ſhooting and caſting them with ſo great force, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they pierce through and through the body of their enemies, which they hit. The ſame neceſſity makes them alſo uſe ſtones well brought to an edge, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe ſhells, for Axes, and Hatchets, and their inſtruments of travelling: the one for great wood, and the other for leſs, and houſhold Utenſils. But they uſe the horn of certain little Beaſts, faſtned to little hefts, for their finer works, which they make upon wood with marvellous skill. As for the Commerce of all theſe peoples on this great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> and on other Rivers that run into it, they perform
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170395:22"/>it in Boats, which they call <hi>Canoès,</hi> that are made all of Cedar, and all of one piece, as in other places of the <hi>Indies;</hi> but with more eaſe, and better, than elſewhere; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this great River during its overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, brings down ſo great a number of great Trees, that theſe peoples have no more to do to come by them, but every one to lay hold on, and ſtay as many as he deſires, at his Houſe, there to cut and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, as he thinks meet. As for Cloathes, ſuch as uſe any, have them all almoſt of Cotton: and for ſuch as go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (which are the greateſt part) neither exceſſive heat, nor rigour of cold forces them to cover themſelves in that ſort.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170395:23"/>by mans hand, which they adore as their gods, attributing to ſome of them the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over waters, and giving them a Fiſh for their mark: to others the power over fruits, and ſeeds of the earth. They have alſo ſuch as they take for gods of Armies and Battels; and they openly avouch that theſe deities came down from Heaven to live with them, to do them good, and procure their profit. They have neither Temples nor Ceremonies, wherewith they adore them, but leave them careleſly in ſome corner of their Houſe, untill they have occaſion to uſe them. But when they take water to go to Warre, they place on the Poup of their Veſſels, their god of Armies; and ſo they uſe the others in like ſort. They have alſo <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> or <hi>Wizards</hi> among them, of great eſteem; who ſerve them for Counſellors as well for Religion and Phyſick, as for Law and policy; and in the year <hi>1639,</hi> the <hi>Portuguais</hi> found an <hi>Indian</hi> in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that called himſelf the ſon of the <hi>Sun;</hi> who coming to a peaceable and loving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them, was not ſatisfied with the grounds of our Belief, but going away without renouncing his own impoſture, ſaid, that every night he went by the Spirit to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170395:23"/>conſult the <hi>Sun</hi> for the government of the following day. Finally, all theſe peoples are of a good nature, nimble and quick of body, and of colour not ſo tawny and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt as thoſe of <hi>Braſile.</hi> They are of quick apprehenſion and underſtanding, and are very expert in their hands for all ſort of works. They are naturally ſweet and meek, officious and tractable; and they converſe familiarly with ſtrangers without any fear. They are every way ſo docile and teachable, and ſo little poſſeſt with malice, that from hence the eaſineſs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due them, as well to Laws and policy, as to Chriſtian Religion, may be gueſſed at.</p>

               <p>AFter that the great <hi>Amazone</hi> hath made his channell like unto that of the greateſt Rivers of the world, by the conflux of the foreſaid three Rivers, he goes on his way through the vaſt and fertile fields of <hi>America,</hi> alwayes towards the Eaſt, and without longer ſtraying from under the Line, than five or ſix degrees at the moſt,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170395:26"/>on the Southſide, or that of the antarctick Pole. Yet drawing his now-ſlow waters after him, by infinite turnings and windings in plains and fields of ſo large and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he caſts out his arms on every ſide to receive the more eaſily the Rivers which from all parts come unto him, and that with ſuch admirable agreement, that the leaſt of his armes receive alway the leaſt Rivers and Rivulets; and the greater the greater: and if Rivers come to him, that are bigge and made great by a courſe of more hundreths of Leagues together, he there ſhuts up all his waters into one channell, to receive thoſe greater worthily, and as it were with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtate and magnificence. As for his length from his ſource to his mouth at the <hi>Atlantique</hi>-Sea, following the courſe of his wide channell, it is diverſly reported. The fore-mentioned <hi>Areillane</hi> makes it of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred, and Father <hi>D' Acogna</hi> of one thouſand two hundred ſeventy ſix <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Leagues, according to the juſteſt meaſures that we could gather from the Relations of this Author, who contradicts himſelf often through forgetfulneſs, and not taking heed.

But I could wiſh that Father <hi>Acogna,</hi> the Authour and eye-witneſſe of a part of theſe relations,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170395:35"/>were more cleanly and underſtandable in them. For not having been able to find either cartes, or books to help my cares that I have to unfold theſe ambiguities, I my ſelf therefore reſt not ſatisfied in this behalf with mine own work. Without ſtaying therefore to cenſure a Perſon of his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and merit, by reaſons which I might, and the curious may themſelves perceive in his writings, I ſhall take me to my Subject, and tell you, that from the Town of <hi>Cofana</hi> in the Province of <hi>Kixo,</hi> to the Eaſt of the <hi>Andes</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> and to the North of the line, comes forth the <hi>Coca,</hi> a navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which quickly renders himſelf on the North-ſide into the beginnings of the great River of the <hi>Amazones;</hi> which as yet in theſe parts having his ſtream too rapid and violent, hath not therefore at this place ſo convenient a navigation himſelf, as other Rivers, that enter into his large bed on the ſide of the Antarctique or South Pole. The firſt whereof paſſing on as it were about three daies journeys from the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vila</hi> of the ſame Province of the <hi>Kixos,</hi> renders himſelf in ſhort while, and under the name of <hi>Payamino,</hi> into the great River, on the South-ſide thereof, and below the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170395:35"/>entrance of the <hi>Coca,</hi> though the diſtance is not known, nor ſet down. But about eighteen leagues from the Town of <hi>Kito,</hi> beyond the <hi>Andes</hi> of the great <hi>Cordelier,</hi> is the mount <hi>Antezame</hi> on the South-ſide of the line; from the foot of which the River of <hi>Napo</hi> coming forth, and running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rocks without being navigable untill he come to a Port, or Haven of the ſame name well nigh unto <hi>Archidona,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yet more eaſie to be navigated four leagues beneath that, as well for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Channell, as for the leſſe rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and violence of his ſtream: and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing in this condition his way to great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he enters thereinto about thirty leagues only from <hi>Archidona.</hi> But concerning the mouth of this River, you may look the ſeventh Chapter of this Book; unto which I will here adde, that the foreſaid <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Napo,</hi> where the <hi>Indians</hi> have an habitation, is the beſt embarquing place, for all thoſe that from the Province of <hi>Kito,</hi> would ſail or go into the great <hi>Amazone.</hi> And as to this pleaſant fair, and great enough Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Napo,</hi> it hath this prerogative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, to rolle alongſt with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt the ſands of his current, good

But though both theſe Rivers have their courſe from Weſt to Eaſt; yet that of the <hi>Aguarique,</hi> which is the Southerlieſt, comes firſt to the great River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Chevelues,</hi> or long-hair'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that after a courſe of more than an hundred leagues (all along Navigable) through happy, fertile, and well-inhabited Regions, as all the reſt of the Realm of the great <hi>Amazone</hi> is. Now the mouth of this conſiderable River, (the Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>The River of Gold,</hi> becauſe he draws much of it along his bank-ſides) is on the North-ſide of the great River of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones,</hi> and about an hundred ſeventeen leagues from his own Sources and Spring-heads, and likewiſe under the line. But the River of <hi>Putomaya</hi> taking a courſe much more ſtragling and wandring, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good many more Nations than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes alſo hereby his Navigation more conſiderable, and of greater Portati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a courſe of farre greater extent, and a greater number of Rivers, that on all ſides
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170395:37"/>arrive unto him alſo. And after he hath fertilized ſo many great champain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by the freſh vapours of his waters, and by his ordinary overflowings, as all Rivers of <hi>America</hi> do; he opens and enlarges himſelf near unto a leagues bredth at his entry into the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> and about four hundred fifty three leagues from his own Sources, or Well-heads. Now the mouth of this River of <hi>Putomaya,</hi> which carryes along with him gold alſo, as moſt others do; is on the North-ſide of the great River, and hath two degrees and thirty minutes of Southern latitude, having runne under the line a great deal more than the half of his courſe, and under the ſame meaſured (in his bankes and windings at leaſt) the ſpace and length of more than three hundred fifty leagues. Thus the commerce of the great River of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazones</hi> will in time coming receive no leſſe enlargement by the happy Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Aguarique,</hi> and of the <hi>Puto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maya,</hi> than by other great and famous Rivers (which promiſe him the ſame encreaſe) as well for the richeſſe and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Countries of the Town of <hi>Paſto,</hi> as for the ſituation of the ſame, which is

               <p>ONe of the principall and moſt famous Rivers, that the <hi>Andes</hi> of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliere</hi> ſend forth towards the South of the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> is without all doubt the <hi>Maragnon,</hi> as well for the rich and noble Province, whence he takes his beginning, as for the renown of his name, whereby he is ſo celebrious in the Hiſtories of this New-world: foraſmuch as <hi>Joſeph Acoſta,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Herrera,</hi> give this name often both to the great River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> it ſelf, and to the River of the <hi>Orenoc;</hi> and the <hi>Portuguaiſe</hi> of <hi>Braſile</hi> give the ſame name alſo to another conſiderable enough River, which looſeth himſelf in a great <hi>Bay,</hi> or <hi>gulph,</hi> which they call the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Maragnon,</hi> in the North-moſt Government of the Kingdome of <hi>Maragnon,</hi> called for this ſame cauſe by that title alſo. But to the end that the diverſity of ſo many Rivers, and places called by this name, may not beget confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in my Geography; I ſhall for ever leave it to this one alone, and famous River, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170395:40"/>I now ſpeak of, the name of <hi>Maragnon;</hi> a River well known from all Antiquity in the great Empire of <hi>Peru,</hi> by this name. He hath this ſingular in the way of his courſe, that whereas he takes his beginnings to the Weſt of the great Mountains of the <hi>Cordeliere,</hi> and not from its ſelf, yet he ceaſes not to paſs through them, and to draw all his deep waters towards the Eaſt of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> His famous ſources honour the Lake of <hi>Boubon</hi> with the prerogative of his riſe. This Lake is in the Countries of <hi>Guanuco,</hi> a Colony of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and in the Province of <hi>Lima,</hi> the richeſt and firſt of all the Empire of <hi>Peru,</hi> the moſt rich place of all the world. Its longitude is of three-hundred and two degrees, and thirty minutes, on the terreſtriall Globe; and his latitude of ten degrees, and four minutes, antarctick or meridionall; and his diſtance from the royall Town of <hi>Lima,</hi> forty Leagues. So this famous River of <hi>Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> coming forth of this foreſaid Lake, waters the long and fertile Valley of <hi>Sauſſa,</hi> and cutting or croſſing the Kings high way beween the Towns of <hi>Guanuco,</hi> and <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangue,</hi> under Bridges made of cords and wood with a marvellous artifice, he paſſes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170395:40"/>through the whole <hi>Andes</hi> of the <hi>Cordeliere;</hi> from whence coming out again at laſt much more mighty than he was, by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all confluence of Rivers, that on all ſides arrive unto him, he paſſes along the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Mayn</hi> to the Eaſt of the <hi>Cordeliere;</hi> and after his having ſaluted as it were, the Town of St. <hi>James of the Mountains,</hi> ſtill made broader, deeper, and very ſwift and rapid in currant, he afterwards ſpreads him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abroad at pleaſure and with more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in diverſe fair Provinces, and amongſt Nations puiſſant and warlike. In end fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his courſe, ſtill growing bigger, and more impetuous and rapide, than one would think that he could be navigable, he powres out all his waters into the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> at the Southſide thereof, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving four degrees of Southern latitude at that place; and three hundred and ſeven degrees, and fifty minutes of Longitude; and about two hundred fifty ſeven Leagues from the ſources of the great River of the <hi>Amazones.</hi> His own length is about three hundred Leagues, reckoning by his banks; and as for his navigation which I take, ought not to be reckoned further, than after that he hath paſſed the <hi>Andes,</hi> it will not fail one
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170395:41"/>day to bring the greateſt riches of all <hi>Peru,</hi> to the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> for the ſame reaſons, that we have heretofore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and in the Chapter of the <hi>Boſphore,</hi> by name.</p>

But ſo ſoon as theſe Natives of this Village perceived the greedineſſe of the Souldiers after or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of gold, they preſently thereafter hid all that they had, and no more was ſeen after that; no not at the return of the ſame <hi>Portuguais</hi> in <hi>an</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred thirty nine, who could never obtaine but one pair of theſe Ear-pendants by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with the <hi>Indians,</hi> which Father <hi>D'Acogna</hi> himſelf bought, to let them be ſeen in <hi>Spain.</hi> But the great Nation of the <hi>Suanes,</hi> which extends it ſelf to the great <hi>Caketa,</hi> fills all the Fields that are on the other banke of the North of the great <hi>Amazone:</hi> but with this remarke, that their Plaines are a great deal lower, than the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Grounds and Fields of the <hi>Coroſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi> in whoſe Province are the Mouthes of the great and fair Rivers of <hi>Tapy</hi> and <hi>Catua,</hi> this laſt forming and faſhioning <hi>Lago-verde,</hi> with the great <hi>Amazone.</hi> And alongſt theſe two Rivers, as one goes up them, dwels the great Nation of the <hi>Pacuanes.</hi>

               <p>THe great Province of <hi>Suane</hi> heretofore mentioned, hath this ſingular glory amongſt all the others, that are honoured by the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> to carry Gold within her bowels. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mountain that nouriſheth in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſo great a treaſure, hath about two degrees of South latitude, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventeen degrees of longitude.

And the precious Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Gold (for ſo the Natives of the Countrey call it) which waters its foot, draws abundance of this rich Mettall with him, in form of graines of Corn, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bigger billetts. It preſently disburdens its ſelf into the <hi>Yopura,</hi> another conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able River, which likewiſe looſeth himſelf into the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> on the North-ſide, at three degrees of South
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170395:48"/>latitude, and five hundred eighty four leagues, from the Sources of the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Whence it follows that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce ſo advantageous of the great <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone</hi> with this famous Mountain of <hi>Suane,</hi> is made the more commodious by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of this River of <hi>Yopura,</hi> by going up him into the River of Gold; and that the ages to come will one day make famous theſe places with rich Towns and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifique Inhabitants. For the preſent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Peoples of theſe Countries, the <hi>Managues</hi> are thoſe, that traffique with this Gold, the weight whereof, and its fineneſſe makes it ſo perfect, that it is the moſt excellent of all <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that buy of it, by exchange of other things for it, make of it little long Plates, which they hang at their Noſes, and Ears: and this rich Ornament is ordinary and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in all theſe Provinces, according to the report of the Savages. But the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (beſides the <hi>Suanes</hi>) that are neareſt to the treaſures of this rich Mountain, are the <hi>Aguaynes,</hi> the <hi>Mocunes,</hi> the chief of all ſuch as dwell to the Eaſt of the <hi>Suanes,</hi> and cultivate the fertile Fields, that are watered by both the Channells of the <hi>Araganatube.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170395:49"/>of the <hi>Portuguais</hi> themſelves paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long did perceive it. They are of a good ſtature, of a fair body, and well formed.

They are alſo ſo numerous for multitude, that never any ſaw at one time ſo many <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> together.

For whileſt the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais</hi> going up the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> ſail'd along by this Province, every day there came to them above two hundred <hi>Canoes,</hi> full of Women and Children, with Fruits, Fiſhes, Meales, and other ſuch like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, which they changed with the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais</hi> for <hi>axes</hi> and <hi>knives,</hi> whereof they have great eſteem, as all others <hi>Indians</hi> of the new world. The <hi>Yorimans</hi> inhabite not only the main Land of this Province, but fill alſo the great Iles that the great <hi>Amazone</hi> makes by ſundry of his Armes ſtretched forth. The firſt Village of this Warlike Nation, is on the mouth of a

Its Fields and Plaines are higher than that they are ſubject to the overflowings of theſe Rivers, or of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall height unto them; yet fertile and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in all things. The River of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zurura,</hi> which enters into that of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones</hi> on the North-ſide, makes here Lakes and Ilands very pleaſant: and the divers Nations of this great Province, are no leſſe conſiderable for the plenteouſneſſe and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of their Countrey, than for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of their life.

Secondly, we ſhall ſay that it is admirable in fertility of its Grounds, in the beauty of its bankes, in the multitude of its Habitations, whereof the moſt mighty is in the Eaſtmoſt point of it, and hath three degrees of South lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170395:58"/>being bound yearly to furniſh them with Stone-axes, to fell their Woods, and great Trees; and with other uſefull Inſtruments of the ſame matter for labouring and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Ground; wherein the <hi>Topinam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> are marvellous expert and diligent, as appears in all their plaines and champain Grounds. But on the other North-banke of the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> the Province of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panta</hi> preſents it ſelf, happy enough in all things. It hath for its confines on the Weſt the Province of <hi>Camſuare;</hi> on the Eaſt it paſſeth the <hi>Boſphore;</hi> and on the North its frontiers on the famous Region of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazones;</hi> which I paſs over as well as other doubtfull reports, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugalls</hi> have heard of it, as they paſſed along the great River.

All theſe rich Mountains are under the line, and about an hundred leagues only from <hi>Cayene,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> have had Colonies. But the commerce of them will be more opened, and more commodious, by the navigation of the River of <hi>Coropa,</hi> becauſe about ſix daies journeys from the ſame Village, that carryes its name, <hi>Coropa</hi> receives another little River coming from the Mount <hi>Yaguare,</hi> that brings with it abundance of Gold, in forme of graines and billetts.

               <p>SEeing the Province of <hi>Guyana</hi> ends the great River of the <hi>Amazomes</hi> on his North-ſide; and Geographers have gained no great knowledge of it as yet; we ſhall ſpeak of it in manner following. On the Eaſt it hath for its limit the great mouth of the <hi>Amazone,</hi> from the River of <hi>Genipapa</hi> to <hi>Cap-north;</hi> on the North, it is waſhed with the great <hi>Atlantique</hi>-Sea, for the ſpace of three hundred Leagues, from <hi>Cap-north,</hi> to the Ile of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> and on the Weſt, the great River of the <hi>Orenu</hi> ſerves for its coufines: but on the South it is kept in by a ridge of Mountains parallel to the Sea-coaſt, which ſeparate it from the Provinces of <hi>Camſnare,</hi> of <hi>Apanta,</hi> and of <hi>Corepa,</hi> already mentioned. Now, theſe Mountains (though not yet known) are not imaginary, but reall and effective according to the naturall diſpoſition of all theſe Countries, ſeeing the Rivers of <hi>Viapoco,</hi> of <hi>Cayene,</hi> of <hi>Maruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> of <hi>Sequebe,</hi> and other conſiderable ones of <hi>Guyana,</hi> which run all from the South to

But returning to that Eaſt part of <hi>Guyana,</hi> which buts on the mouth of our famous River; we will firſt tell you, that it begins from that of <hi>Genipapa,</hi> conſiderable enough both for the greatneſs of his bed, and for the fine gold, that he draws along with him in his waters: whence it follows by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conjecture, that the mountains of his fource, and the plains of his neighbourhood, are no leſs rich, happy, and fertile, than in all the reſt of <hi>America.</hi> Now the coaſt or this Province from <hi>Genipapa</hi> to the <hi>Cap-nord</hi> (which forms the great mouth of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon</hi>) is very uneven in its bank, and very dangerous in its navigation, becauſe of heights and lowes, that are here ſometimes found. But theſe difficulties are not in coming down the great River, untill after you have paſſed, and neceſſarily taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the place of <hi>Corupa,</hi> one of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> on theſe banks,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170395:63"/>about twenty eight Leagues from the place, where the great River begins to open his mouth. But becauſe <hi>Cap-nord</hi> ends the North ſide of this great River, we ſhall tell you again, that it hath one degree and forty five minutes of North latitude, according to the tenth Chapter of this book; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the grounds about are very low, and covered with woods; the Sea very rageing, and not very deep; the Sands moveable, and often covered with Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, or weeds. And as to the reſt of this coaſt, as you go from <hi>Cap-nord</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupa,</hi> ſee the Relations of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> reported by <hi>Johne Laet</hi> in his <hi>America,</hi> where you may finde the knowledge of it little either neceſſary, or delectable.</p>

But in this, as in other points, the great River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> is no leſs admirable, than ſingular. For being framed as it were to receive in times coming the greateſt and richeſt commerce of all the world, how could it hinder, that its great mouth ſhould not be defamed by Robbers or Pirates, as well as the Gulph of <hi>Mexico?</hi> Now the ſame providence that hath heaped upon it more than upon all the Rivers of the earth, ſo many marvellous advantages and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives; would not in this either make it leſs perfect; having by a certain and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſall and ordering of its Iles, ſides, and lowes, or flats, reduced its navigation into one only Channell, and rendred the other paſſages as it were unprofitable; and by his impetuous currants (which carry his

               <p>FOraſmuch as hiſtoricall Relations are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilier underſtood, if they follow Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall ones, we have changed the order of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that went before us, &amp; begun at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After that <hi>Gonſales Pizarro</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Province of <hi>Kito,</hi> had firſt of all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (puſhed on by the ſame ambition to find gold and ſilver in the vaſt Countries of the great <hi>Amazone</hi>) paſſed the high and dangerous Mountains of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliere,</hi> and diſcovered the Province of <hi>Kixo,</hi> his Lieutenant Generall <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Areillana</hi> finding himſelf well far engaged (and that in <hi>Challops</hi> only) on ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and great Rivers; and not knowing any ſure way of going up again, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170395:66"/>to his Generall, who with them that were with him, ſuffered an extream great want of Victuals; he would ſtay at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place, where the River of <hi>Napo</hi> loſeth himſelf in that great one of the <hi>Amazones;</hi> where cauſing his men to build another Bark, greater, and more convenient than his others, for a long navigation, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an ambitious deſire to purchaſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to commit his life and fortune to the uncertain currants and waters of that great River. This admirable voyage and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for ſo many circumſtances, was begun on the eighth of the Moneth of <hi>January</hi> in the year 1541, and continued with ſo much good luck and happineſs, that this great and marvellous River was wholly navigated, and firſt diſcovered by this ventorious Knight, from whom alſo the River had the name of <hi>Areillane.</hi> In paſſing over the Provinces of the <hi>Caſſique</hi> or Lord <hi>Aparia,</hi> this Prince received him very courteouſly, and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed him to take heed in his way of travell, of certain <hi>Amazones</hi> and warlike women, the renown of whom, though they were very far from him, yet ceaſed not to give him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them. Finally in his courſe he had diverſe ſucceſſes, ſometimes good, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170395:67"/>bad, according to the fear or fearleſs confidence of the Nations, that ſaw him with aſtoniſhment paſs along upon the great River. And after having known not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admiration, the <hi>Rio-negro,</hi> he ſaw in the Moneth of <hi>June, Indians</hi> in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber upon the banks thereof; and at the head of them armed women, which ſeemed to command and lead them to warre: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Areillana,</hi> and himſelf, were ſo perſwaded of the truth of theſe <hi>Amazones,</hi> that they publiſhed the report of it with ſuch confidence, that from thence the name did remain to this great and memorable River. Laſtly, after ſundry fortunes, and much wearineſſe, on the 26. of the moneth of <hi>August</hi> of the ſame year 1541. he went out at the great mouth of this great River, and making ſail towards the Weſt along the coaſts of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> and <hi>Paria,</hi> Provinces of the ſame <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> on the eleventh of the moneth of <hi>September</hi> he happily attain'd the Iſle of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bagua,</hi> near to that of <hi>Marguarite,</hi> both of them inhabited by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and then rich in the fiſhing of Pearls.</p>

               <p>AS all the Authours, that have imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their watchings to deſcribe largely unto us the things of <hi>America,</hi> were neither good enough Geographers, nor good enough Geometricians, to diſintangle the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that grows ordinarily in ſuch matters; ſo they have but too often fallen into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, that make their Hiſtories confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and into obſcurities, that robs their Readers of poſſibilities to underſtand them. Such as would take advantage at depreſſing them, will ſomewhat ſtrange at my cenſure of them: but I ſeeking nothing but truth,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170395:69"/>and not after vain-glory in my works; will paſſe on to my ſubject of this famous River; the diſcovery whereof was no more eſſayed from <hi>Spain</hi> its ſelf, after the diſgraces of <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Areillana;</hi> but by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> it was under the conduct of <hi>Pedro d'Orſua</hi> in the year 1560. by the orders of the Viceroy there, who gave him a little Army in a fleet well enough equipped. The embarkment for this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was on the River of <hi>Maragnon,</hi> the neereſt to the Town of <hi>Lima;</hi> the chief of that Province. But a few moneths after their departure, the ſouldiers mutinied againſt their General, and put him to death; and <hi>Lope d'Aguirre,</hi> the boldeſt of them all, took the title of King upon him, and made himſelf to be obey'd of ſome, by threats; and of others, by promiſes. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing out the navigation of <hi>Maragnon</hi> therefore, and alwayes going down that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he entred into the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> and ſuffering himſelf to be carried down by the currant of his ample channel, he ſtayed chiefly at the mouth of <hi>Rio-negro:</hi> where coming to conſider of the greatneſſe of his crime, and the danger he had to fall into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of the North-ſea, if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170395:69"/>he went once out of the great River; he ſo addreſſed his whole Fleet in <hi>Rio-negro,</hi> as having no other deſigne than to rove up and down ſo many Rivers, and paſſe through ſo many Countreys, only to ſuſtain his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But fortune leſſe blind than his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, thruſt him in his courſe of ſailing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River of <hi>Orenoc,</hi> which coming to end in the <hi>Atlantick-ſea</hi> over againſt the Iſle of the <hi>Trinity</hi> (ſubject to the Crown of <hi>Caſtile</hi>) he was preſently there made to ſtay, partly by his own ſouldiers, partly by the Catholick Kings officers, and led to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which his felony deſerved; his houſes alſo in <hi>Peru,</hi> by the ſame ſentence were razed, and ſo continue and ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yet in our dayes. But a voyage ſo ſurprizing for Geographers, and ſo ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Authors that have gone before me, becauſe not able to take up the ſtrange order of all theſe Rivers, could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hitherto cleered, than by the preceding Chapters of this Book, eſpecially the 16, and 17. And the onely difficulty which preſents it ſelf now, is onely in the <hi>leap</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> of <hi>Orenoc,</hi> diſcovered 1531. by <hi>Diego de Ordas;</hi> as alſo 1536. by <hi>Alphonſe de Herrera,</hi> coming from <hi>Tinity</hi>-Iſle. <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170395:70"/>becauſe the Province of <hi>Moxa,</hi> of their neighbourhood, furniſheth the abundant Sources of it. And the firſt amongſt them, that had a thought of it, (after the <hi>Inca's,</hi> that had attempted it in vain) was <hi>Gomez de Tordoya,</hi> having got the priviledge from the Count of <hi>Niebla</hi> the Viceroy of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru.</hi> He failed not preſently to make the neceſſary expences for it, and by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advances to order all its preparations. But his power expiring by the removall of the Count of <hi>Niebla;</hi> and his Succeſſor (that was of the Houſe of <hi>Caſtro</hi>) confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it upon <hi>Gaſpar de Sotelle,</hi> confounded all things by this change. This laſt to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize his own credit, had aſſociated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the <hi>Inca Topacamare,</hi> of the race of the ancient Kings, that dwelt at <hi>Bileo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bambe.</hi> And if the too great number of Souldiers, that voluntarily offered to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, had not caſt ſome ſuſpicion into the head of the Viceroy, and the ſpirits of the ſupream Counſell, who manage this conqueſt with an extream great jealouſie; <hi>Gaſpars</hi> enterpriſe had not been broken, and the ſame priviledge granted to <hi>Johne Alva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> of <hi>Maldonado.</hi> Who having finally <hi>An.</hi> 1566. paſſed the Mountains of the

By his own boldneſſe he paſſeth the Mountains and the Forreſts of thoſe unknown places, and being followed by ſixty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers, he prevents his competitor by a precipitated march.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170395:71"/>When he had attain'd the River of <hi>Amaru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maya,</hi> and known that the Fleet was not yet paſſed, he reſolved to wait on it in that place, and to fight it, as he did, ſoon as it arrived. The medly was ſharp, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured three daies; the valour in the two parties was equall; and the number of the ſlain and hurt was ſo great in this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rencountre, that the <hi>Chonques,</hi> (a Neighbouring People) caſting themſelves in Armes upon the reſt, put all to death, with <hi>Tordoya,</hi> none eſcaping in this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conflict, but the Generall <hi>Maldonado,</hi> Father <hi>Diego Martin,</hi> a <hi>Portugall;</hi> and <hi>Simon Lope,</hi> that was excellent in artillery: who, after having ſtayed two years amongſt theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> returned by I know not what way of accommodation, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Moxa,</hi> of the dependance of <hi>Cuſco,</hi> whither they went afterwards.</p>

               <p>THe ſad events of the Fleet of <hi>D'Orſua,</hi> and <hi>De Maldonado</hi> did no more ſlacken the courage, than ſlaked the greed of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in reſearch of immenſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imaginary Treaſures of the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazone.</hi> They were long enough time both in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> quiet, and moved not for this conqueſt. Only in the year 1621, the King <hi>Don Philip</hi> the fourth, ſent Powers to the royal Audience of <hi>Kyto,</hi> to treat of fitting conditions, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this River, with thoſe of his Nobility, that were employed in places and charges of that Province. But by that time all theſe Orders (in order to Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that the Serjeant Major <hi>Vincent de Villalobos,</hi> Governour of the Province of <hi>Kixo,</hi> had made for any that took that charge; and during the making whereof, for the longſomeneſſe of the goings, and comings of Poſts, and of conſultations or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to be uſed in ſuch rencontres, the

Now the rumour of theſe goodly and noble Propoſitions of the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> paſſing preſently into <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile,</hi> the emulation of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> made them preſently make the like about the ſame, in the Court of the Catholique King there, who was yet in poſſeſſion of their Kingdom. So that upon the warmth and zeal that <hi>Benito Maciel</hi> Governour of the Province of <hi>Maragnon</hi> witneſſed that he had for the diſcovery of the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> by that ſide of its mouth that bounded his Government; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were ſent him 1626, in the ordinary conditions. But his generous deſignes were yet hindered by the Warres of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Portugalls</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Pernambouk,</hi> of the ſame Kingdom of <hi>Braſile,</hi> and Frontier to that of <hi>Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> who feared not a little the diſaſters of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170395:73"/>it. Mean while the orders of this conqueſt are redoubled by the cares of the King <hi>Don Philip.</hi> They are alwaies ſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Maragnon;</hi> and <hi>Francis Coeille</hi> of <hi>Carvaille,</hi> who had then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, received them 1633, and 34: who notwithſtanding coming to conſider, that in parting his Forces, for to ſend ſome of them, or conduct them himſelf, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the great River of the <hi>Amazones;</hi> that the reſt that ſtayed in the Province, would not be able to guard it againſt the aſſaults of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who from the year 1630, had taken the famous Town of <hi>Olynda,</hi> of the Province of <hi>Pernambouk,</hi> and poſſeſſed the neigbouring coaſts; the expedition for the diſcovery was by him wiſely delayed.

               <p>IN end fortune being wearied, ſo long to croſſe a deſign, that <hi>Spain</hi> had travelled with, with ſo much care; caſt her favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eyes on the perſon of <hi>Pedro Texeira</hi> Captain Major of <hi>Para</hi> in <hi>Braſile,</hi> that his courage and prudence coming to ſecond the choice that ſhe had made of him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to ſo many Subjects of merit, he might arrive at the glory to have been the firſt, to make the whole great River of the <hi>Amazones</hi> feel the heavy and victorious Fleets of the Catholique King. Now the neceſſity of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> ſelf-defence, who had the expence and diverſion of a continuall Warre in the midſt of <hi>Braſile</hi> to maintain, could not allow to this noble expedition, Forces more conſiderable, than thoſe that parted from the Town of <hi>Para</hi> the twenty eight of the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> in the year 1637, under the conduct of Captain Major <hi>Pedro Texeira</hi> (of the ſame Nation) followed by fourty ſeven Barkes,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170395:75"/>both great, and well armed; by ſeventy <hi>Portugall</hi> Souldiers, and one thouſand two hundred <hi>Indians</hi> fitted to the Warre; by eight hundred Women and Vallets; and furniſhed with proviſions meet and neceſſary for ſo long, and doubtfull an enterpriſe. The dexterity of the Marriners and Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the favourable help of the windes, broke the firſt difficulties, that the Fleet could have had, to gain without loſſe and danger the true channell of the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazone.</hi> But in departing from the coaſts of the Province of <hi>Maragnon,</hi> and of the Countries that are ſubject to it, the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls</hi> could no longer know neither the bank-ſides, nor the right wayes and courſes of the great River, becauſe of ſo many crooked Armes of his, that he caſtes out, and thereby frames his many Iſlands. So that the Navigation becoming longer, by following waies uncertain, and not before known; and the troubles and toyles inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from a Sea-Army, that muſt often diſembark, to camp on the firm Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weary the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to diſtaſte them from further purſuing of the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Already many of them ſtole away, to regain (as well as they could) the Land
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170395:76"/>of their Nativity; and thoſe that ſtayed peaceably behind in the Barkes, or in the Camp, ceaſed not to make their mindes known by their murmurings: in ſo far that the fear of a greater deſerting of him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Generall occaſion of juſt unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he ſet himſelf to find out more ſure waies to prevent this diſorder, ſince puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſeverity kept out hardly to their duty the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Vallets</hi> of his Army. He was but yet half way come in his Voyage; but feign'd that he was near enough the place, where the Fleet ſhould arrive. And the better to perſwade them to this, he ordered eight Barkes well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht and well armed, to go before, and as it were to make the encampments for the body of the Army to follow, in places where it was to Land. But in truth, his intent was in this, only to find out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the beſt waies, that were to be held in the great River, and by theſe ambiguities to keep all his men in breath.</p>

The wildeſt amongſt them fled to the Mountains, or leſſer Hills; the leſſe fearfull ſtood unmoved upon the Bankes; the more confident came and traffiqued with the Camp: but the valienteſt, no more than the others, never armed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleet, nor againſt her Avantcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers or Vantguard: which already very far advanced, becauſe of its lightneſſe, was tracing and following on the channells of the great River, the waies that were ſtreighteſt, and leaſt oblique, and marked forth the addreſſes, or directions, on the Bankes, by Trophees ſet up, or by Enſignes ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

So pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the Voyage with his Vantguard of eight Barkes armed, he attained with as much diligence, as good luck, the Port of <hi>Payamine</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Kixes,</hi> the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> in the year 1638, while the Captain Major with all the reſt of the Fleet followed the traces advices, and addreſſes, that <hi>Olivera</hi> left at the places, where he had reſted with his Vantguard: whence the Souldiers of his Army, receiving every day comfort, they thought alway, that the morrow was to be the laſt of the Voyage. Thus entertain'd with this hope, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the River of the <hi>long-hair'd</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on the Mouth of which, <hi>Pedro Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cira</hi> made fourty <hi>Portugalls,</hi> and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Indians</hi> of his Troopes, to encamp,

At the firſt, the Camp had good correſpondence with the <hi>Savages</hi> of that Countrey; it had victuals and proviſions enough for buying. But this peaceable commerce could not laſt long, becauſe of the late death of Captain <hi>John de Palacies,</hi> who was defait by the <hi>Savages</hi> of this Countrey and Province. Some of the Camp deſired to revenge it, and chaſtiſe their boldneſſe; but others feared to get hard meaſure and rough handling from them. Thus the leaſt occaſion coming to ſow the diſcord, and three <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> having been put to death by the Natives; theſe fierce people put themſelves in arms, to defend their own lives, and their Countries. In ſo great a danger, the <hi>Portugalls</hi> loſt not their courage; and as having been uſed to this long before, not to ſuffer ſuch a licentiouſneſſe amongſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Indians</hi> where they were; they ſet themſelves preſently to puniſh them for this.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170395:80"/>And after they had killed ſome of them, and taken alive more than ſeventy, they kept them as ſlaves, untill they all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, or eſcaped by flight. But after this the <hi>Portugalls</hi> could have no proviſion but by the point of their Sword, and by continuall excurſions of their men, ſent from their Camp; both giving and receiving alſo a great deal of hurt, above all in their Veſſels, whereof ſome were ſaccaged, or ſpoil'd, and the leſſe ſtrong of them quite undone by theſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But in the ſnares and ambuſhes, as many <hi>Portugalls</hi> as were taken alive, their throats were cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut, which amounted to ſome conſiderable loſſe to them; though that of the enemies was far greater. Thus the prudence and valour of <hi>Pedro d'Acoſta,</hi> the courage and fidelity of <hi>Pedro Bayon,</hi> and as well the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as obedience of the Souldiers, can never receive their juſt enough praiſes, for having maintain'd their Camp thus in the Province of the long-hair'd People, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven whole Moneths, and without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther News from their own, than the return of the Fleet, upon which they went all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board again.</p>

               <p>ALl things being ready, and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking at an end towards the end of <hi>February</hi> 1639, the Fleet of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> began their Return from the Haven of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi> on the River of the ſame name: and after having ſailed thirty leagues on the current of this River ſtrong and ſwift enough, it entered into the great River of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zones,</hi> at the <hi>Junto</hi> of the Rivers, a much celebrated and famous place, whereat the adventurous <hi>Areillana</hi> gave the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to the whole diſcovery. In going down, the courſe of the great <hi>Amazone</hi> ſerved them for Sailes, and the Marriners or Rowers leſſe troubled with work reſted them often, and ſleeped ſweetly by reaſon of the murmuring noiſe the billows made, that puſht forward their Ships. All the Peoples alſo and Nations upon the bankes, are pretty favourable to it: commerce of victuals and of merchandiſe, being opened to it on all ſides. The civility of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magues</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:170395:81"/>appeared to it very pleaſant; and the generoſity of the <hi>Yorimans,</hi> ſeemed yet more obliging. But arriving at <hi>Rio-negro</hi> the twelfth of <hi>October</hi> 1639, the undiſcreet greedineſs of the <hi>Portugalls</hi> ſtays the courſe and happineſs of theſe civilities, and of their own good voyage. The <hi>Portugalls</hi> could get no riches in <hi>Braſile,</hi> but by the number of their ſlaves; and the Souldiers being angry for having gained nothing in all this long expedition, force the Captain-major to leave the great River of the <hi>Amazone,</hi> and to enter into that of <hi>Rio-negro,</hi> to take from them there by force of Arms their ſlaves, which are in great multitudes among the Nations that inhabit on that River. The Sails were already ſpread, and the Eaſt wind blew on their poup, and the fear of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled licence made many fear a greater change; when Father <hi>Chriſtopher d'Acogna</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite, puſhed on by an ardent zeal to ſee the accompliſhment of ſo long and hazardous an enterprize, preſents himſelf to the Generall <hi>Pedro Texeira,</hi> and gives him a proteſtation written and ſealed with his own hand, as on the behalf, and for the intereſt of the Catholick King: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him, to remove the Souldiers from

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the River of <hi>Thermodoon</hi> be puft up any more with the glory of its conquereſſes; ſeeing the River of <hi>Coruris</hi> is as famous for her fair ſhe-Warriors. His famous ſources are honoured with their rich habitations.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170395:83"/>The Mountains of <hi>Guyana,</hi> fertile in mines of gold and ſilver are their confines on the North-ſide; and the Mount <hi>Yacamabe,</hi> proud above all the reſt, is in the midſt of their fair and fertile Valleys. The firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of them, came to them from the generous Prince <hi>Aparia</hi> 1541, who told the firſt wonders of them to the adventurous <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Areillana:</hi> and the conſent of all the Nations of the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> in favours of this report, as true, hath from them given the name for ever to this admirable River. For all this, the gueſſes at this matter are not very certain; but the famous actions of the goodly Ladyes of <hi>America,</hi> during the warrs of all theſe conqueſts, do not a little confirm the appearances thereof. For theſe have often appeared in Arms at the head of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talioes, as is to be ſeen in the Hiſtories of <hi>Acoſta,</hi> and of <hi>Herrera:</hi> and in fighting with their own hands, they have ſuſtained the aſſaults of the enemies, and oblieged the <hi>Indians</hi> at the ſame time to imitate the effects of their great courage. The valour of that noble Laſs which 1536, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Bogota,</hi> ſlew five <hi>Spaniards</hi> with arrows ſhot from her own hands, before
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170395:83"/>ſhe fell dead at their feet, will for ever be renowned. And thoſe goodly and great women, which preſented themſelves armed on the head of the <hi>Americans,</hi> upon the Bank of the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> near to <hi>Coru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> (as we have related before) gave much credit to the firſt opinion of theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazones</hi> of the new-world. This is not yet enough for us to perſwade our ſelves of the truth of theſe valiant and warlick La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: the royall audience alſo of <hi>Kito,</hi> hath ſometimes received conſiderable informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. That audience a long time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed its cares to have ſound out the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe <hi>Amazones;</hi> and the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that to them were made thereof at ſundry times, agree all in this point: That in the vaſt fields of this <hi>America,</hi> there was one Region peopled with <hi>warrioreſſe women,</hi> which living and maintaining themſelves without men, had no communication with them, but on ſome certain dayes of the year, to have by them children, or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters like unto themſelves. And in the Town of <hi>Paſto</hi> ſubject to the ſame audience, an <hi>Indian</hi> woman gave aſſurance, that ſhe her ſelf had been in their Countrey; and by her other Relations agreed with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170395:84"/>circumſtances. But the moſt ſingular teſtimonies of it, that have been given to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or <hi>Portugalls,</hi> was 1639 in deſcending the great River, and in the great habitation of the <hi>Topinambes,</hi> and Eaſt-point of their famous Iſle. This Nation as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as valiant, was never wearied with reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wonders of theſe <hi>Amazones.</hi> They ſpoke of their policy, and of their valour, much like what the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> have ſung of the policy and valour of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazones</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And not to ſtay longer on this diſcourſe, be it true, or be it fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, I will conclude it with this renowned name of the <hi>Comapoyares,</hi> under which the <hi>Amazones</hi> of <hi>America</hi> are every where known only.</p>

               <p>BUt can one thus put an end to this work, without doing incomparable wrong to the River of the <hi>Amazones?</hi> Can one paſs with ſilence, and without reproach
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170395:84"/>the reſt of ſo many wonderfull advantages, and prerogatives; or without injuſtice the admirable effects, wherewith prodigall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture honours and glorifies it? No certainly; and contrary to my firſt purpoſe, I conſent to paſs lightly over again theſe matters, howſoever pleaſant and provoking to ſtay more upon them; referring to the weak curioſity of an ability limited and given to ſuch things, the vain reſearch of Animals, Fruits, and Plants, of this unmeaſurable Countrey. In which neither doth the heat ever choak; nor the cold ever ſeaze it; the Air is alwayes alike, becauſe its Winter (as in the reſt of <hi>America</hi>) proceeds of no other occaſion, but from inundations, which hinder the productions of the earth, or retard them for ſome Moneths: and not from any receſſe or withdrawing of the Sun, which every day there riſeth, and ſetteth at the ſame hour. What marvels ſhould not one be perſwaded of, from an heaven ſo benign and favourable? Let none after this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to know that the conſecrated Hoſties of the Father <hi>Jeſuites</hi> for their Maſs, are kept freſh and ſound during ſo long a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, on the waters (which comes not ſo to paſs elſewhere) and let none refuſe any
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170395:85"/>longer to believe, that Flies and other ſuch troubleſome Beaſts, are not met with in theſe places, as in others under the torride Zone, where they are ſo ordinary, and every where ſo many, that the abode in thoſe places would be much happier, were it not for the inconveniences that theſe very Beaſts infeſt them with. But what ought the land and grounds then of ſo noble a climate to be? Doth not this alſo agree to all the other prerogatives of this admirable River? And as the baſe and foundation of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſes of all theſe Provinces, muſt not this alſo be equally goodly and rich in all its parts? All its banks are enriched and crowned with fair trees alwayes green, and of incomparable greatneſs. The field and champany grounds are large, and all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with flowers diverſe and variable. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where its Valleys are enameled with green, and alwayes moiſt. Its hills and mountains are all loaded with woods and forreſts pleaſant to behold. Plants and Simples are every where in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; alſo honey of Bees, that ſerves both for nouriſhment and for medicine: and which is yet more marvellous, a ſort of oyl ſo excellent, that it no wayes gives place to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170395:85"/>the balm, and that the moſt precious of the ancient world, for all ſorts of hurts.</p>

               <p>AS to the moſt ordinary aliments, that ſerve for nouriſhing innumerable Nations, and infinite peoples, that labour the unmeaſurable fields of the Realm of the great <hi>Amazone;</hi> the firſt in order of nature are diverſe and various fruits, which the happy and rich grounds of thoſe Countries bring forth; like indeed for kind to thoſe of all the reſt of <hi>America;</hi> but more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ingreater plenty, and of better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. After them, follow Fiſh, in ſo great abundance and multitude, not only in the great River, and others leſs, but alſo in an infinite of Lakes, which the ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordments and overflowings of their Rivers, make in the neighbouring plains; that one needs never fail to take them with their hands only; and yet more eaſily, when by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Rivers, the Lakes are dried up by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170395:86"/>the heat of the Sun. In the great diverſity of ſo many Fiſhes, as in the reſt of the new world, the Sea-Veal, or <hi>Seal,</hi> and the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe, are not the leaſt conſiderable, whether for greatneſs, ſubſtance, or delicacy. And the fiſhing of them is wonderfull, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, as alſo the way to keep them both, long time alive. Laſtly comes the hunting of Veniſon, as of all other leſſer prey, or game, whether with Hair, or Feather, in the ſame abundance, and with the ſame eaſe, that in all other parts of <hi>America.</hi> But the Partridges, and the Hens of it, came from <hi>Peru,</hi> whither the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had at firſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them. And for a witneſs infallible of all theſe admirable circumſtances, we need but to alledge the example of the Camp of the <hi>Portugalls:</hi> which lodging every day on land, during ſo long a voyage, as well in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, as coming down the great <hi>Amazon,</hi> never failed to ſend preſently the half of their men, ſome of them to hunt with dogs; ſome of them to fiſh with arrows (the other half remaining to ſet up their hutts, and draw their trenches) whence they returned in a few hours ſo loaded with fiſh, and leſſer beaſts of prey of all ſorts, that all the Camp had ſufficient, and in abundance. But as

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170395:87"/>they ſurprize the ſight of ſuch as conſider them; Father <hi>d'Acogna</hi> having meaſured himſelf one of the greateſt of them, of more than ſix ells in circumference. Next to them we ſhall mention <hi>Ebeny,</hi> and the wood of <hi>Braſile,</hi> both ſo precious, and ſo much ſought after; which are ſo perfect there, and in ſo great multitude in all theſe fields, that they can never be ſpent. In the third place, we ſhall mention the <hi>Cocos</hi> tree, ſo thick along all thoſe Banks, that the very Hutts of the Camp of the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> were made of no other than of the fair branches of theſe. They bear the beſt fruit of any in all the <hi>Indies;</hi> and with a little travail they can yeeld each of them, ſeven or eight crowns every year. After theſe comes Tobacco, which would be better, and more abundant in all thoſe Provinces, than in all the reſt of the world, if it were followed here with a happy culture. After this Canes the Sugar, whereof more excellent comes, and more abundant than elſewhere, would never fail, nor dry up, becauſe of the inundations, which keep the fields alwayes freſh, by the number of Lakes, which are there made thereby; and whereby milles and other engines to that purpoſe, might
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170395:87"/>eaſily be made, by the conveniency of the woods, and of the running waters of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rivers; whence it would come to paſs, that the work about it would be leſs expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and the revenue by it would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ordinary.

            <p>A firſt Advertiſement to Geographers, upon the Longitudes of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOraſmuch as the knowledge of the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes of the Globe of the Earth, is as important, as neceſſary, in the Theory, and practice of Geography, of the Sphere, of Aſtronomy, of Navigation, of Aſtrology; it muſt not be thought ſtrange, if ſo many excellent perſons, and knowing men have ever bended themſelves to eſtabliſh theſe the moſt perfectly; or, to ſay better, the leaſt imperfectly, that was poſſible to them. But as the difficulties of it have never been well overcome, at leaſt to the Uſe and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; ſo I cannot now conſent to the laſt Cart, and recenteſt Topography of South-<hi>America,</hi> touching this Longitude: in which Cart there is but fifty eight degrees, and twenty minutes of difference between <hi>Port Vieux</hi> (or old) and <hi>Cape</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> where South-<hi>America</hi> is broadeſt, and longeſt. For as before, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made its breadth but of fifty one degrees, and the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> of fifty five, (both the one, and the other being moved thereto by reaſons of State and policy, becauſe of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170395:88"/>debate about the <hi>Moluccoes</hi>) and after them, the moderner obſervers of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitudes, extend it to fifty eight, as we have ſaid: ſo this change could not have been made, but by obſervation of Eclipſes made under divers Meridians. Whence it follows alſo, that this new Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of the Weſt-coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> is not yet exact enough, becauſe of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that are ordinarily found in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomicall Obſervations; whether through the fault and littleneſs of the inſtruments, or the negligence of the Obſervers, who ſeek the hours and minutes of them, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrolabes, and not by the way of Sphericall Triangles: to ſay nothing of the difficulties about Parallaxes in the Eclipſes of the Sun, and of the Phenombres in the Eclipſe of the Moon, which hinder the taking exactly of the time of her immerſion, and emerſion, under and out of the ſhadow of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But to let it be ſeen, that I am not the only man, that take to my ſelf this licence, to ſuſpect and give little truſt to the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Obſervations, ſo as thereby definitively to regulate Longitudes, with neglect of itinerary diſtances, which (being well managed) often ſupply in ſome ſort
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170395:89"/>the others too great incertitude: I ſhall here ſet down the examples, which <hi>John Kepler;</hi> that famous Aſtronomer, thought good himſelf to ſet down at the end of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Towns, of the <hi>Rodolphine</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that he might ſhow the varieties of the difference of Longitudes, found out by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Obſervations of the ſame Eclipſes, between the Meridians of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimberg,</hi> as followeth. <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> makes it of thirty ſix minutes of an hour, or of nine degrees of the equator; and with him, many more. <hi>Stafler,</hi> and <hi>Verner</hi> of eighteen minutes of an hour, or of font de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and an half. <hi>Shoner, Mercator,</hi> and <hi>Hondius,</hi> regulate it to twelve minutes of an hour, or to three degrees. And leaving others, <hi>Kepler</hi> himſelf hath reduced it to four minutes of an hour, or to one degree only. So that the varieties of the difference of theſe two Meridians, in ſo little a diſtance, as they ſtand in, coming to eight whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; with how much more reaſon may we doubt of the true Longitude of the Weſt-coaſts of the South and North-<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica?</hi> Now theſe diverſities are no leſs frequent every where elſe, as may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the difference of the Meridians of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170395:89"/>ſame <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſet down in Authors of Aſtronomy, and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy. For <hi>Kepler</hi> the laſt and painfulleſt of all, reduces it to ſixteen degrees; and according to others, it amounts often to thirty. Which notwithſtanding we have made an eſſay to remedy (as much as the matter doth permit) in our Geographicall Tables, by more exact cares and reſearches, than thoſe of this curious Author <hi>Kepler</hi> himſelf; which being not yet Printed, yet <hi>Monſieur Morin</hi> the Kings profeſſor of the Mathematicks, hath not thought ill to draw out of them, that which he hath ſet at the beginning of his Abridgement of the <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine</hi> Tables, as preferable to any other Catalogue of Towns, that he could then meet with to ſerve his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After theſe Reaſons brought, I would now willingly conſent, that the Longitude of the Weſt-coaſt of <hi>America</hi> were made ſhorter by ten degrees at leaſt, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Longitudes of the Town of <hi>Kito,</hi> and of the Point of <hi>Zaparara</hi> were made of fourty ſeven degrees, and ſo the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the one to the other, in a ſtraight Line, of nine hundred fourty Geometricall Leagues. And this would agree better,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170395:90"/>and not be ſo far different from the total number of meaſures obſerved in the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great River of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the eighth Chapter of this Book; through all which (that we might change nothing, out of our own opinion) we have ſet down the Longitudes, according to the ordinary and recenteſt Carts of South-<hi>America.</hi> But ſurely it ought to be made broader by Geographers, that ſhall go over it again, to find place there for all that we faithfully relate unto them in this work, that ſo the great <hi>Amazone,</hi> and ſo many other Rivers, that run unto him, and Provinces, that are diſcovered upon them, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly be lodged, and in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall extent. In which caſe the Eaſt-coaſt of this ſame <hi>America</hi> to the turn of the <hi>Cape</hi> of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> ſhould be kept in the ſame degrees and minutes of its longitude; and all the reſt from thence towards the Weſt, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented unto ten degrees, and compaſſed in the juſt and fitting Geometricall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well in regard to Meridians, as to the Longitudes. And the ſame ampliation being made over North-<hi>America,</hi> you will find his Eaſt-coaſt drawn back by four or five degrees, conformably to the aſſurances
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170395:90"/>that the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave, that ſail'd to <hi>Virginia;</hi> and to the report of <hi>John Laet</hi> in his third Book of <hi>America.</hi> Whereunto I offer my ſelf willingly to contribute my cares and ſtudies, in favours of ſuch, as will undertake it; making uſe, and ſerving my ſelf, in all theſe Geographicall procedures, with the precepts of the true, and new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the eighth Book of my <hi>Geometricall Theorems,</hi> Printed 1654, as well for the Longitudes, as itenerary diſtances: which I there ſhew, that they ought alwayes to be in great Circles, and not in parallells, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to certain proportions. Which laſt is a Rule altogether contrary to the truths of Geometry, however Mathematicians, and Geographers, that preceeded the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Book, have generally taught the Maxime of it, without adverting, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo notable an errour; <hi>That the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt distance from one point to another, on the Globe of the Earth, is alwayes deſcribed, or led by a great Circle,</hi> &amp;c.

            <head>A ſecond Advertiſement to Geographers about the reſtitution of Longitudes.</head>
            <p>BUt to get a perfecter knowledge as well of the Longitudes, that fit <hi>America,</hi> as thoſe that concern the Eaſt-<hi>Indies;</hi> we have reſolved to ſet down here a method to find them eaſily by the motion of the Moon, upon firm land, in this manner. 1. Draw on a right horizontall Plain, that is very ſmooth and white, a very exact meridian Line: and with the ſame exactneſs obſerve the height of the Pole, by a quadrant that can mark minutes, and if poſſible, half mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; as it is eaſie now to get ſuch an one, by the new inventions of dividing the Alhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dades of it. 2. On the night of the full Moon, take the horizontall height of a fixt Star, untill the ſhadow of a Plummet hung, made by the Moon, ſhall be juſt upon the Meridian; but with this caution, that the height of the Star obſerved, be at leaſt of thirty degrees, to avoid refractions; and that the ſame Stars diſtance from the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian be reaſonable enough for a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs. 3. Seek the true diſtance of the foreſaid Star from the Meridian of your
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170395:91"/>Hemiſphere by this Rule. As the Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle contained in the Sinuſes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the elevation of the Pole, and of the complement of the declination of the Star, is to the quadrat-ſide of the whole Sinuſe; ſo the Rectangle contained in the Sinuſes of the ſumme or totall, and of the difference of the half of the complement of the obſerved height of the Star; and of the half of the difference of the complement of the declination of the Star, and of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the elevation of the Pole, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the quadrat-ſide of the Sinuſe of the half of the true diſtance of the Star from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian. But if the declination and right aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Star, which you make uſe of for this aſtronomicall Obſervation, be not ſet down to your hand, in the ſame Table of its longitudes and latitudes; you ſhall find it by the Rules of my ſixth Book of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall Theorems aforeſaid, whither I refer you. 4. Double the foregoing half of the diſtance found, and ſubſtract that from the right aſcenſion of the Star obſerved, if it be in the Eaſtern part of the heavens; but adde it to its right aſcenſion, if the Star be in the Weſt part of the heavens: and the ſumme of the addition, or the reſidue after
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170395:92"/>the ſubſtraction, will be the true right aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Meridian of the Moon, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, minutes, and ſeconds of the equator. 5. In the Ephemerids, or in the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Tables, take the Node of the Moon aſcendant, or deſcendant, in ſigns, degrees, minutes, and ſeconds of the Ecliptick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hour of your obſervation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your beſt eſteem: to wit, that which is neareſt to that right aſcenſion of the Moon, or of the midſt of heaven, which is all one. But in the Rule of the precedent Article, if the Pole be North, the declination alſo of the fixed Star muſt be Northern; and contrarily. 6. With the ſame right aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Moon and of the Meridian, take alſo in the ſame Tables, (or by the ſixth Book of my Theorems) the midſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in ſigns, degrees, minutes, and ſeconds in the Ecliptick; and the Angle of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian and of the Ecliptick only in degrees, minutes, and ſeconds; which we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hereafter call <hi>the midſt of heaven,</hi> to ſhun a longer title, or repetition. 7. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from the <hi>midst of heaven,</hi> the Node of the Moon; or from the Node of the Moon, the midſt of heaven, that you may finde alwayes leſſe reſidue than ninety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170395:92"/>and this diſtance of the Node of the Moon from the midſt of heaven, will be the baſe of a Sphericall Triangle-Obliquangle, whereof the leſſer Angle will alwayes be of five degrees, and no minutes; and the greater Angle alwayes the Angle of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and of the Ecliptick of the foregoing Article, according to the ſeventh Book of my Theorems. 8. Seek the Arch of the Meridian contained between the Orbite of the Moon and the Ecliptick Circle, by this Rule. As the totall <hi>Sinuſe,</hi> or <hi>Sine,</hi> is to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the diſtance of the Node of the Moon in the midſt of heaven; ſo is the <hi>Sine</hi> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the perpendicular. And as the totall <hi>Sine,</hi> is to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the complement of the preceding diſtance; ſo is the <hi>tangent</hi> of the Angle of five degrees, to the <hi>tangent</hi> of the complement of the Angle ſought for. 9. Take the difference of this Angle ſought for, and of the Angle of the midſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and you ſhall have the ſecond Angle ſought for, in degrees, minutes, and ſeconds. Then as the total <hi>Sine</hi> is to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the complement of the ſecond Angle required; ſo the <hi>tangent</hi> of the complement of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent perpendicular, is to the <hi>tangent</hi> of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170395:93"/>the complement of the Arch of the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, contained between the midſt of heaven, and the center of the Moon. 10. Finally, as the <hi>Sine</hi> of the Angle of five degrees, is to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the precedent Arch of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian; ſo the <hi>Sine</hi> of the Angle of the midſt of heaven, is to the <hi>Sine</hi> of the argument of the latitude of the Moon: which argument, you muſt ſubſtract or adde to the Node of the Moon, according to the diſpoſall of the probleme, for getting in ſigns, degrees, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and ſeconds, the place of the Moon in her Orbite, 11. With the precedent argument of the latitude of the Moon, take in the aſtronomick Tables its reduction to the Ecliptick in minutes and ſeconds, that you may either ſubſtract, or adde the ſame (according to the title of the ſame Tables) to the place of the Moon in her Orbite; and you ſhall have the true longitude, or the true place of the Moon in the Ecliptick, in ſigns, degrees, minutes, and ſeconds. As alſo in the ſame Tables, her true latitude, (if you deſire it) with the ſame argument; ſeeing in all theſe obſervations, the Moon is alwayes near her copulations. 12. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the two longitudes of the Moon, found out in this manner, on the ſame night, but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170395:93"/>in diverſe Meridians, and take the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them: as alſo her hourly motion, at the time of both the obſervations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hours, minutes, and ſeconds of hours, that ſhall agree to the degrees, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes and ſeconds of the Ecliptick of that difference, being turned into degrees and minutes of the Equator, will give the true difference of the Longitudes contained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Towns, where the two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations have been made.</p>
            <p>Now all the ſecret of this eaſie and new method, conſiſts in this, that the center of the body of the Moon is neceſſarily in the Circle of the Meridian, when ſhe is full, or very near her oppoſition, the ſhadow of the Plummet-Line, coming juſt upon the true Meridian-Line of the place, where the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is made: and in this; that nothing more being required to be added, but the plain heighth of one fixt Star, and without Parallax, the operation may be made in any Moneth of the year, without ſtaying for a tedious reſtitution of Aſtronomy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being put to the charges of great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Horizontall and Verticall, which are otherwiſe neceſſary to the practice of this Science of finding out longitudes, which
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170395:94"/>
               <hi>Nonius, Horoncius, Friſius, Kepler,</hi> and <hi>Morinus</hi> the perfectlyeſt of them all, have painfully travelled in. But this is enough for the Geographers, and Mathematicians, that are diſperſed over the world, and ought to labour in the reſtitution of Geography: to whom notwithſtanding I could wiſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter knowledge of Aſtronomy, and of Trigonometry, that they might the more eaſily arrive at the glory of perfecting this goodly ſcience, no leſs pleaſant, than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
            <p>And for concluſion, we ſhall in favours of an Aſtronomer, that will make this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Moon in his own particular, that he may compare it, with that of the Rodolphine Tables; tell him, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of the Town of <hi>Rome</hi> on the globe of the earth, is fourty degrees; and that its Meridian is the ſame, that it hath in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphine Tables, which are the beſt of all other aſtronomick ones, if you correct but the equations of the Center, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls of the Planets, by the fifth Book of our Geometricall Theorems. As alſo for the choice of the equation of the time, if you uſe that equation, which proceeds from the difference of the two right aſcenſions, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170395:94"/>wit, of the <hi>middle place,</hi> and of the <hi>true place</hi> of the Sun, in the Ecliptick; becauſe that amongſt ſo many divers and various e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quations of the time, that the moſt excellent Authors have yet given, or eſtabliſhed, that alone ſeems to me Geometricall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; as we have ſaid elſewhere; and that the errours of other wayes will amount ſometimes to four of five degrees, in longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes upon the earth. But as the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that doctrine depends on the equall motion of the Sun in the Ecliptick, and not at all in the equator, the opinion that we have of it, is more from the appearances of truth, than from any deſign we have to contradict.</p>
