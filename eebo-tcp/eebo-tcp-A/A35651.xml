            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>
               <hi>PAinter,</hi> prepare thy Pencill yet once more,</l>
            <l>And taking Prospect from the <hi>Belgian</hi> Shore,</l>
            <l>Draw me Two Royal Fleets, conjoyn'd in one,</l>
            <l>Ready to part that Stake that's to be won;</l>
            <l>Cover the Sea, and all their Squadrons draw</l>
            <l>In such thick Forrests as the Sun ne're saw:</l>
            <l>Thence back into the Land casting thy Eye,</l>
            <l>Draw all the Beacons flaming in the Skye;</l>
            <l>And, if thou can'st, draw the confused Roare</l>
            <l>Of People running to defend their shore:</l>
            <l>Paint all that Fear and Consternation can</l>
            <l>Raise in the Visage of despairing Man,</l>
            <l>And let the Figures a proportion hold</l>
            <l>With Mothers loosing Sons, and Misers Gold.</l>
            <l>But e're these Colours in the life thou lay,</l>
            <l>Turn thy designing Face another way;</l>
            <l>Look from the <hi>South-West</hi> Coast there creeps along</l>
            <l>An Adverse Fleet, as numerous and as strong;</l>
            <l>Wary, yet Bold, who long conceal'd had lain</l>
            <l>Fenc'd in by Sands, the Citadels o'th Main;</l>
            <l>But griev'd to see their Country thus opprest,</l>
            <l>Like Lyons rouz'd, come rampant from their rest,</l>
            <l>Stretching for strength; And as along they stand,</l>
            <l>Refresh their men, and check their fears on Land;</l>
            <l>Who heartned thus, on Board in Clusters crou'd</l>
            <l>To have a share in their defence grown proud,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93382:3"/>
Vowing to chace these Objects of their fear,</l>
            <l>And make them for their Insolence pay dear:</l>
            <l>" Cowards will turn if you too hard pursue;</l>
            <l>" Then think what Courage in Despair will doe.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Painter</hi> close the Scenes, and shew thy Skill,</l>
            <l>Teaching thy Pencil some hid Arts to kill;</l>
            <l>Look how the <hi>Royal</hi> Fleets stand both prepar'd</l>
            <l>To act so much more than the Assailors dar'd;</l>
            <l>That lest they should in Courage seem behind,</l>
            <l>Rather then wave the Fight, they'l lose the Wind.</l>
            <l>But least the Blood and Horrour thou must paint,</l>
            <l>In such a dismal Fight, should make thee faint,</l>
            <l>Spread some few dashes over like a Cloake,</l>
            <l>And hide these Cruel Scenes in Fire and Smoake:</l>
            <l>Only be kind to every Gust that blew,</l>
            <l>And then some Brave Commander set in view.</l>
            <l>First draw <hi>D'Estrees</hi> appointed to receive</l>
            <l>The Charge that Furious <hi>Bankaert</hi> came to give;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Bankaert</hi> who led the <hi>Zealand</hi> Force that day,</l>
            <l>Who us'd to be the first that forc'd their way;</l>
            <l>But with that glory they must now dispence,</l>
            <l>The White Flag carried so much Innocence,</l>
            <l>That maugre all opposure it could find,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>D'Estrees</hi> 'tis said charg'd through and Gain'd the Wind;</l>
            <l>There bravely daring his Proud Foe he stayes,</l>
            <l>And all the Terrour of the Fight surveys;</l>
            <l>" Thus Hawks by hovering o're their heads would fright</l>
            <l>" The hardy Bustard which they doubt to strike.</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Estivall</hi> by Partial Canon fell,</l>
            <l>And prov'd not like his Ship <hi>Invincible,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Bevilly, Sepville, Dailly, <hi>many more,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Gave all the marks undaunted courage wore:</l>
            <l>But see what 'tis to fight 'gainst Thick-skin'd <hi>Dutch,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They seem'd not t'have receiv'd the smallest touch:</l>
            <l>" Thus Fellons mark'd with a cold Brand, will shout,</l>
            <l>" Clap their mouth too't, and quickly bite it out.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93382:3"/>
The <hi>Prince</hi> could not the like advantage find,</l>
            <l>For subtle <hi>Ruyter</hi> kept too close the Wind;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ruyter,</hi> who long his Countreys Guard has bin,</l>
            <l>Piecing their Lyon's tayl with his Fox-skin,</l>
            <l>The <hi>Fabius</hi> of the <hi>Holland</hi> Commonwealth,</l>
            <l>Hovering in clouds and charging foes by stealth;</l>

            <l>Judges aright, Advantage is no shame;</l>
            <l>Therefore for it with setled courage waites,</l>
            <l>Then acts his part, and leaves the rest to fates.</l>
            <l>So now his Canon on the <hi>Prince</hi> he plyes,</l>
            <l>Who briskly fights, though seemingly he flyes;</l>
            <l>And whilst <hi>De Ruyter</hi> presses in his wake,</l>

            <l>Cannot but think when they were once engag'd,</l>
            <l>The Elements themselves must seem enrag'd;</l>
            <l>" As Friends, turn'd Rivalls in a Female suit,</l>
            <l>" Make Iealousie from Kindness spread its root;</l>
            <l>" Rivalls in Honour the same course pursue,</l>
            <l>" And love that Glory which they would undoe.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Spragg</hi> and <hi>Trump</hi> with Equal Souls Endow'd,</l>
            <l>Thought each to th'others Glory seem'd a cloud:</l>
            <l>Both Hearts of proof, but with this difference, <hi>Spragg</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Could only act, <hi>Trump</hi> can both act and brag.</l>
            <l>Draw them then, <hi>Painter,</hi> as they did Engage</l>
            <l>In Flames their Thirsty Honour to asswage,</l>
            <l>Draw Bullets making through each others side,</l>
            <l>Harbours, where Shallops might in safety ride:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93382:4"/>
Till <hi>Trump</hi> at last a furious Chain-shot flings,</l>
            <l>Gives <hi>Spragg</hi> the Check, and cuts away his wings;</l>
            <l>But make him still the Battail to renew,</l>
            <l>By changing Ship, and forcing <hi>Trump</hi> to't too.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Painter,</hi> now th'unlucky Pencill burn,</l>
            <l>Or in unhappy sables let it mourn,</l>
            <l>Curs'd be those shot so fatally did range.</l>
            <l>To force brave <hi>Spragg</hi> unto a second Change:</l>
            <l>And <hi>Trump</hi> himself, if he's to Honour true,</l>
            <l>Will Execrate that hand the Bullet threw;</l>
            <l>Which led by fate did through the St. <hi>George</hi> flye,</l>
            <l>And made an Admiral in a Cock-Boat dye.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Trump</hi> Ignorant of his Rival's Fate, still plyes</l>
            <l>To burn the unwing'd Ship, or make it Prize,</l>
            <l>Briskly he do's on its Defendants bear,</l>
            <l>But found, alas! that OSSORY was there;</l>
            <l>He knew his Courage, and from Fame had learn'd</l>
            <l>How Brave he was, and yet how unconcern'd:</l>
            <l>Thought it no blemish if Retreat he made</l>
            <l>Before that Valour, Honour only sway'd.</l>
            <l>Yet e're he parts the <hi>Henrietta</hi> Yatch</l>
            <l>The last Effects was of his Fury taught;</l>
            <l>This little Vessel full of Spirit, Gay</l>
            <l>Without, as any Lady of the May;</l>
            <l>Within Deckt with a Valiant Soul, whose Heart</l>
            <l>Could not admit him from his Adm'ral part;</l>
            <l>His Love adventring past his Strength, is drencht,</l>
            <l>And in the briny Wave his Passion quencht.</l>
            <l>Poor Triumph! where the odds so mighty were;</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Amsterdam</hi> shall make't a Man of Warr,</l>
            <l>Kill all were sav'd, but ne're tell how the rest</l>
            <l>Strove to revenge so small a thing opprest.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Kempthorne</hi> who in all Fights has Wonders wrought,</l>
            <l>Sends a large Ship to <hi>Neptune</hi> for a draught;</l>
            <l>Whilst <hi>Washbourn</hi> thinking that did not suffice</l>

But who can every single Action tell,</l>
            <l>Each strove in Fight each other to excell;</l>
            <l>And though describing it exceed all Art,</l>
            <l>Yet <hi>Haward, Courtney, Iennings,</hi> felt the smart.</l>
            <l>In short, these did what ever Men could do,</l>
            <l>But wisht in vain Others had done so too.</l>
            <l>Mean while the <hi>Prince</hi> again renew's the Fight,</l>
            <l>And holds it on till the approaching Night:</l>
            <l>And now afresh were Acts of Horror done,</l>
            <l>Till the <hi>Dutch,</hi> tired with the declining Sun,</l>
            <l>Did by a swift Retreat to their own Coast</l>
            <l>Confess they had but little cause to boast,</l>
            <l>Acknowledging the summe of all their gain,</l>
            <l>Was Two Brave Captains and Three Admirals slain.</l>
            <l>But when they hear how <hi>Spragg</hi> and <hi>Reeves</hi> are gone,</l>
            <l>They'l think our Valour still by theirs Out-done.</l>
            <l>Now <hi>Painter</hi> do but draw some few strokes more,</l>
            <l>But change thy Fancy from the Sea to Shore,</l>
            <l>Draw me a City <hi>Coffee-House,</hi> and there</l>
            <l>Let all the tattling croud in rounds appear,</l>
            <l>Venting according to each several Vein,</l>
            <l>The Malice or the Whimsey of their Brain;</l>
            <l>Let one accuse our Courage, t'other show</l>
            <l>How thus it might be done, or so, or so:</l>
            <l>Whilst yet so Dull and Ignorant they bee,</l>
            <l>Except in Paint, they ne're saw Ship nor Sea;</l>
            <l>But if those Mad-brain'd Fools appear in sight,</l>
            <l>Who yet dare argue that the <hi>Dutch</hi> won't fight,</l>
            <l>And of their Folly won't convicted bee,</l>
            <l>Draw me an Act to send them all to Sea.</l>
