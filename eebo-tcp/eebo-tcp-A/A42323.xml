         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>HOW difficult a thing it is to produce form out of things, <hi>shapeless</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi>
and to prescribe limits to things <hi>confused,</hi> there is none but may
easily perceive, if he shall take but a sleight view of the <hi>Chaos-like</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation
of things not only diverse but repugnant in Nature, hitherto
concorporated in the generous Profession of <hi>Heraldry:</hi> as the forms of the pure <hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies,</hi> mix'd with gross <hi>Terrestrials; Earthly Animals,</hi> with <hi>Watery; Savage Beasts,</hi>
with <hi>Tame; Whole-footed Beasts,</hi> with <hi>Divided; Reptiles,</hi> with things <hi>Gressible; Fowls of
Prey,</hi> with <hi>Home-bred;</hi> these again, with <hi>River-Fowls; Airy Insecta,</hi> with <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
also things <hi>Natural,</hi> with <hi>Artificial; Arts Liberal,</hi> with <hi>Mechanical;
Military,</hi> with <hi>Rustical;</hi> and <hi>Rustick</hi> with <hi>Civil.</hi> Which confused <hi>mixture</hi> hath not a
little discouraged many persons (otherwise well affected to the study of <hi>Armory</hi>) and
impaired the estimation of the Profession. For redress whereof my self (though
unablest of many) have done my best, in this my <hi>Display of Heraldry,</hi> to dissolve this
deformed <hi>Lump,</hi> distributing, and digesting each particular thereof into his peculiar
<hi>Rank;</hi> wherein, albeit the issue of my Enterprise be not answerable to the height of
my desires, yet do I assure my self my labour herein will not be altogether fruitless;
forasmuch as hereby I have broken the <hi>Ice,</hi> and made way to some after-comers of
greater Gifts and riper Judgment, that they may give a fairer body to this my delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rough draught, or shadow of a new-fram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d method. For if men of greatest skill
have failed to give absolute form to their works, notwithstanding their best endeavours,
with little reason may such perfection be expected from me, whose <hi>Talent</hi> is so small, as
that I am forced to build wholly upon other mens Foundations; and therefore may be
thought to have undertaken an idle task, in writing of things formerly handled and
published by persons of more sufficiency and greater judgment. Notwithstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:55096:5"/>
who knoweth not, that as every man hath his proper conceit and invention, so hath he
his several drift and purpose, so as divers men writing of one self <hi>Argument,</hi> do han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the same diversty? which being so, what letteth that every of us, writing in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
kind, may not without offence to other, use our uttermost endeavours to give unto
this erst unshapely and disproportionable profession of <hi>Heraldry,</hi> a true <hi>Symmetria</hi> and
proportionable correspondence of each part to other? Inasmuch (if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
both they and my self do all aim at one mark, which is, so to adorn and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this Science, as that it being purged from her wonted deformities, may become more
plausible to many, and be favourably entertained of all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which could not be otherwise
better effected, than by dissolving of this <hi>Chaos-like</hi> or confused Lump, and dissever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of each particular thereof from other, and disposing them under their peculiar
Heads, which is the full scope of these my <hi>Travels.</hi> Now to the end I might the bet-accomplish
this <hi>Task,</hi> after I had carefully collected the chief <hi>Grounds, Principles, Rules,</hi>
and <hi>Observations</hi> that <hi>Ger. Leigh, Boswell, Ferne, Bara, Chassaneus,</hi> and other best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Authors</hi> in their several <hi>Works</hi> have written touching the <hi>Rudiments</hi> and first <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Armory;</hi> then did I seriously bethink my self for the orderly distribution of those
their dispersed <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> so by me collected, and digesting of them into
some form of <hi>Method,</hi> or at the least into some <hi>Methodical resemblance,</hi> wherein I hope
I have in some sort accomplished my desire, and have for thy better understanding
and apprehension (<hi>gentle Reader</hi>) first distributed this work into <hi>Sections,</hi> and those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Chapters,</hi> briefly shewing their several substances and orderly connexions; and
throughout the whole I have begun with the <hi>Genus</hi> of each kind, and severed them into
their <hi>Species,</hi> which also are subdivided into <hi>Individua's,</hi> annexing particular <hi>Rules</hi> to
each several sort. Moreover, I have added <hi>Definitions, Divisions,</hi> and <hi>Etymologies</hi> of
the Artificial terms peculiarly pertaining to this <hi>Art,</hi> bestowed the chief <hi>Grounds,
Principles, Rules</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> under their proper Heads, and manifested their use

sense and vigor, in default whereof they would become destitute of all force, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that saying of <hi>Aretius, Praecepta, quantumvis bona &amp; concinna, mortua sunt, nisi ipse

<hi>Analogical Table,</hi> briefly comprehending the substance of each subsequent <hi>Section,</hi> and
that with such coherence that each of the said <hi>Tables</hi> answereth in a Relative respect of
the one of them to the other; so as all of them do <hi>jump</hi> together in an universal cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as by their particular references doth manifestly appear, whereby I have brought
to pass (though with long and difficult labour) that in this my <hi>Display of Heraldry,</hi> thou
mayest easily find (bestowed according to <hi>Order</hi>) whatsoever thou desirest concerning
the <hi>Principles</hi> of this <hi>Profession:</hi> So that thou in short time, and with much ease, mayest
reap not only a profitable <hi>Gleaning,</hi> but a plentiful <hi>Harvest</hi> of this my long and painful

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hosoever shall address himself
to write of matters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or of any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of importance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth,
that before he enter
thereinto, he should reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
determine with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in what order he will
handle the same: So shall he best accomplish that
he hath undertaken, and inform the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and help the memory of the Reader. For so
doth <hi>Chassaneus</hi> admonish us; saying, <hi>Priusquam
ad scientiam perveniatur, bonum est, modum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribere
docendi, &amp; ordinem; quia per ordinem
res intellectae magis delectant animos, mentes
nutriunt, sensus magis illuminant, &amp; memoriam
reddunt, clariorem.</hi> Such order and course of
Writing doth also procure in the Reader a facility
of apprehension, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> noteth; saying, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliùs

quam quae sparsìm &amp; confusìm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Order is, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth inform us;
saying, <hi>Ordo est parium, dispariumque rerum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributio.</hi>
This Order is twofold; the one of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the other of Discipline: the order of Nature
(as Doctor <hi>Casius</hi> noteth) is a progression from
Simples to things Compound: contrariwise, the
order of Discipline is a proceeding from things
Compound to Simples. As touching the order
that I have prefixed to my self in this Display of
Heraldry, you shall understand, that forasmuch as
the handling of one of these alone, sufficeth not to
the effecting of my intended Method, I must of
force make use of them both in some sort accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their distinct kinds. Wherein albeit the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Nature in right should have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as the more worthy, <hi>quia Natura regitur
ab intelligentia non errante:</hi> nevertheless in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
my principal purpose tendeth to the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of a form of Discipline, whereunto these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
which we call Arms must be reduced, and
therein to manifest rather their Location than
their Generation, their Use than their Essence,
their Shadow than their Substance; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to prefer the latter (which serveth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
for my purpose) before the former, which
tendeth thereto but collaterally; whose dignity
notwithstanding I purpose regardfully to observe,
when I shall come to the distribution of things
Natural in their proper places.</p>
               <p>But before I enter my Method, I hold it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
(though I do somewhat digress) by way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55096:8"/>
of introduction to the better conceiving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of that which shall be herein handled,
briefly to offer to the consideration of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reader, some few things of necessary note,
touching the Subject of this Work: Such are
those ensigns or marks which we call Arms in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and in Latine <hi>Arma;</hi> which being a word
of equivocation or ambiguity, needeth some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
<hi>Digredi enim quandoque licet ex cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
non autem divagari:</hi> for so it is very requisite,
to the end it may be certainly known in what
sense this word is to be here taken, <hi>quia discenti
ponenda sunt vera &amp; certa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore to be observed that this word
<hi>Arma</hi> in Latine is sometimes taken for very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
instruments, and in this sense doth Doctor
<hi>Casius</hi> use the same, where he saith, <hi>Arma belluis
natura dedit, ut Leoni dentes, Serpenti aculeum,
&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes it is taken for all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
pertaining to Mechanical Trades, as
<hi>Arma Rusticorum, Rastra, Ligones, &amp; hujus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>odi.</hi>
Also <hi>Arma Coquinaria, lebes, patella, tripus,
olla, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Virg. Aeneid.</hi> 5. speaking of the
necessaries pertaining to Shipping, saith, <hi>Colligere
arma jubet, validis<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> incumbere remis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it is taken for all sorts of warlike
instruments; and in this sense doth Doctor <hi>Casius</hi>
take it, saying, <hi>At hominibus arma industria
finxit, eóque finxit, ut pro imperio rationis eis
uteretur.</hi> But this word <hi>Arma</hi> here meant is not
understood in any of these significations, but must
be taken in a metaphorical sense, for that they do
assume a borrowed name (by way of figure call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Metonymia Subjecti</hi>) from the Shields, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
Banners, Military Cassocks, and other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Instruments, whereupon they were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
embossed, embroidered or depicted: which
kinds of furniture and habiliments are peculiar
unto Martial men and professed Souldiers, to
whom only it pertaineth to bear Armour; which
even at this day we do usually call by the name
of Arms. And of them in process of time did
these ensigns or marks receive their denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were called <hi>Arma,</hi> in English Arms, as
<hi>Abra. Fra.</hi> noteth, saying, <hi>Arma appellantur,
quòd olim solis militibus data fuerunt, qui arma
gerere solent. Nam cum ista sit gloria armis, ut
instrumentis comparata, placuit ipsam quoque
mercedem arma appellare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudius Fauchet</hi> saith, that Arms have their
Appellation or Denomination, because Military
men bare their Devices, or Inventions depicted
upon their Coat-Armours, and in and upon their
shields: <hi>Claudius Fauchet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arms were called <hi>Symbola,</hi> which signifieth
Signs, Tokens, or Marks, given in time of Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or of Civil Tumults, by Captains to their
Souldiers, or by the Authors of Rebellion to
their pernicious Associates and Confederates, for
distinguishing of particular persons, as well among
themselves, as from their Enemies; for the better
avoiding such inconveniencies (as I shall presently
shew when I come to speak of them, and use of
Arms.)</p>
               <p>These Armorial Notes (so much in use with us
at this day) are oftentimes called <hi>Insignia,</hi> which
name, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> supposeth, proceeded of
the barrenness of the Latine tongue; his words
are these, <hi>Insignium nomen ex linguae Latinae
videtur fluxisse inopia, &amp; certè vix aliud vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
huic magis quadrat, quod haec praecipuè vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis
&amp; gentilitatis sive nota sive signum sit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far the extent of this word <hi>Insignia,</hi> or
Ensigns, doth dilate it self, we may perceive by
this, that it compriseth generally all Signs, Marks,
and Tokens of Honour, due to well deserving
persons, either in respect of their Government,
Learning, Wisdom, Magnanimity, &amp;c. These
albeit they have no government annexed to
them, yet have they in them much honour, and
estimation, as were those Pontifical Ornaments,
and Ensigns, wherewith <hi>Simeon</hi> the High Priest
was adorned and furnished at such time as he
went to meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> by means whereof his
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry was appeased. In the like sort did Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
attire himself, when he went to meet <hi>Attila</hi> the
<hi>Scythian</hi> Prince; who having subdued the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and destroyed <hi>Aquileia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
came forwards to <hi>Rome</hi> with like intent. So also
did Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> mitigate the fury of <hi>Totila,</hi> as
if there lurked some secret force and majesty in
the very Ornaments and Ensigns.</p>
               <p>Of the number of these Ensigns, are those
notes, marks, and shapes of Animals, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men used to adorn the Crests of their Helm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
withal, to make themselves more eminent in
the Field: and to the end there might be better
notice taken of their valorous actions, when they
encountred their Enemies in Battel: or should
draw on their Forces to fight. Whereof we shall
have cause to speak hereafter in place more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
when we shall come to Treat of them
particularly.</p>
               <p>The use of these was yet extended farther than
the adorning of Shields and Helmets only: For
Ships also and other Navigable Vessels, were also
garnished and beautified in their Fore-decks, yea,
and that in very ancient time, for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Ship from another; as we may see,
<hi>Acts</hi> 28. 11. Where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he went in a Ship
whose badge was <hi>Castor and Pollux.</hi> Also the
Fore-deck of the Ship that carried away <hi>Europa,</hi>
had a form of a Bull painted thereon, which gave
occasion to the Fable, that a Bull had stollen away
<hi>Europa.</hi> Neither did the Ancients only use this,
but it hath been a received Custome in all Ages
sithence, and yet continued with us unto this day.
Hereof it cometh that we give the Ships the
names of the things that are depicted upon them,
as the Bull, Bear, Lyon, Tyger, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Arms then as they are here meant, according
to their Original and first Use, may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined:
Arms are tokens or resemblances, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some act or quality of the Bearer. Or thus,
These Signs called Arms are nothing else but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
and Testimonies of Nobility and of
Worthy prowesful exploits performed in Martial
services, especially if they be ancient, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55096:8"/>
by a Noble and Renowned Prince; And
this is according to their use in the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
the Great,</hi> and since, until of later times;
But according to their modern (I mean since the
time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth) and present use,
Arms may be said to be Hieroglyphical or Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Symbols or Signs, testifying and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
the Nobility or Gentry, acquired by the
vertue and good service performed by their Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or some of his Ancestors, either in Martial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
abroad, or by their Learning and Wisdom,
which they attained to, by spending their bodies
and spirits in continual study, to make themselves
fit for the patronage and defence of the Weal-Publick
at home.</p>
               <p>How great the dignity and estimation of Arms
ever hath been, and yet is, we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by this, that they do delight the beholders,
and greatly grace and beautifie the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are erected; so also they do occasion their
spectators to make serious inquisition, whose they
are, who is the owner of the house wherein they
are set up, of what Family their Bearer is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and who were his next, and who are his
remote Parents or Ancestors.</p>
               <p>It is very probable that these Signs, which we
call Arms at this day, howsoever in former Ages
they have been named (whether Emblems or
Pictures, graven, painted, or embossed, or notes
representing some secret or hidden Mystery; as
Hieroglyphicks, or Enigmatical, or hidden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits)
they were external notes of the inward
disposition of the mind, manifesting in some sort
the natural qualities of their Bearers, yet so as
they were hidden from the vulgar sort, and
known to the judicious only, experimented in the
knowledg of the natural vertues and dispositions
of Bodies Celestial, of Animals, and of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>These in their beginning and first institution,
were not bestowed upon vulgar persons, neither
were their intendments fitted for common capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
but such as were extracted out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and very entrails of Nature, and were neither
obscure to the Learned, nor over-familiar to the
Common sort.</p>
               <p>Between Arms and Names there is a certain
conformity, so that as it is a thing unlawful for a
man (but upon great occasion) to change his
name; <hi>Sic neque arma</hi> (saith <hi>Chassan.</hi>) <hi>mutare
licet, nisi magna &amp; honorifica causa accesserit;</hi> and
another saith, <hi>A Nominibus ad Arma bonum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducitur
Argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are sometimes Arms born that may
seem to have been devised (in their first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
according to the Surnames of the Bearers, as
a Bear for <hi>Vrsonne,</hi> three Castles for <hi>Castleton,</hi>
three Conies for <hi>Conesby,</hi> &amp;c. Whether these be
either better or more ancient than other Arms, it
is a question of more difficulty to be resolved, than
commodious if it were known.</p>
               <p>If there were two distinct Families of one Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
yet bearing several Coat-Armours, it is no
consequence that they are originally issued from
the same Ancestours; for their agreement of
their Surnames may be said to be a probability,
but yet it is no proof, that they are both extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the same Ancestours, unless there be
withal a resemblance of their Coat-Armours,
which are the express notes of distinction.</p>
               <p>In case where there are two Families, diverse
in Name, and issued from several Parents; and
both of them do bear one and the self same Coat-Armour,
and the Name of one of them is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Coat-Armour, and the other dissonant
from the same; the same being in question to
whether of them this Coat doth properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
it may be probably conjectured, that he is
interes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Coat-Armour whose appellation
is agreable therewith; rather than he, whose
name hath no conformity with it. For Names
were instituted for differencing of each person
from other severally, according to the saying,
<hi>Sicut Nomina inventa sunt ad cognoscendos ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines:
Ita Arma &amp; Insignia ad recognoscendum
homines sunt inventa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If two men of several Families shall bear one
Coat-Armour, and have their abode in one
Country or Territory; and one of them can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no more proof why he doth arrogate the
propriety thereof, than the other can; in such
case the cause shall be questioned before the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
or before such as do from him derive their
authority, for the hearing, examining, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
cases of this nature; Otherwise, if
either of them can prove that his Ancestors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the same of the Kings Gift, as a remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for service done, the Arms shall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be his.</p>
               <p>Also there is between these Arms and their
Bearers a kind of Sympathy or natural participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of qualities, insomuch as who so dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
or unreverently useth the Arms of any man;
seemeth to have offered indignity to the person
of their Bearer, so as (according to some Authors)
their owner shall right himself against such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
or wrong-doer, <hi>Actione Injuriarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the Antiquity of these Signs which
we call Arms, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Osyris</hi> surnamed <hi>Iupiter the Iust,</hi> Son
to <hi>Cham</hi> the Cursed Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> called of the
Gentiles <hi>Ianus,</hi> being banished from the blessed
Tents of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet;</hi> by reason of the
Curse fallen upon his Father, was constrained to
seek some remote place wherein he might settle
himself, his children, and people: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he assembled a great Army, and appointed
<hi>Hercules</hi> his Eldest Son Captain. And in this so
ancient an expedition of Wars, as well <hi>Osyris</hi>
himself as <hi>Hercules, Macedon</hi> and <hi>Anubis</hi> his
Sons and others, did Paint certain Signs upon
their Shields, Bucklers, and other Weapons;
which Signs were after called Arms: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<hi>Osyris</hi> bare a Scepter Royal, insigned on
the top with an Eye; <hi>Hercules</hi> a Lion Rampant
holding a Battle-axe; <hi>Macedon</hi> a Wolf, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubis</hi>
a Dog. And we find in <hi>Homer</hi> and in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
that the Hero's had their Signs or Marks,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55096:9"/>
whereby their persons were distinctly known, and
discerned in Battel, as well as their Kings and
Commons had their Publick Ensigns: For the
<hi>Athenians</hi> bare the Owl, the <hi>Persians</hi> an Anchor
or Sagittary stamped on their Coins the <hi>Romans</hi>
bare in Eagle, Minotaur, and sundry other shapes,
which (according to <hi>Pliuy</hi>) they bare in Battel
unto the time of <hi>Marius,</hi> who bare in his Ensign
an Eagle, Argent, Figured and Embossed, <hi>Sus une
haute longue,</hi> as may be seen in ancient Medals,
and chiefly in which is found this world, <hi>Allocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> saith, that anciently the
<hi>French</hi> Kings did bear, Argent, three Diadems,
Gules. Others say they bare three Toads, Sable,
in a field, Vert, <hi>alias</hi> Sinople, which cannot be
good Armory, as the Masters of that Mystery do
hold, because of Colour upon Colour.</p>
               <p>Whence they received those Arms is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known, unless they had them from the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their opinion is more probable who by the
Blazon of the Shield of <hi>France,</hi> would shew that
the first <hi>Franks</hi> consisting of <hi>Sicambri</hi> (a people
of <hi>Germany,</hi> inhabiting the Marches of <hi>Frizeland</hi>
towards <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Gelderland</hi>)
gave unto them Azure, which resembleth the
water (which being calm representeth the colour
of the Heavens) and therein three Flowers <hi>de Lis</hi>
Or, which do grow plentifully in those Marches,
and do flourish in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others affirm, that the same was sent by an
Angel from Heaven to <hi>Clovis,</hi> the first Christian
King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> in his History mentioned
no such thing, neither doth it appear that they
bare those Arms before the time of King <hi>Pepin,</hi>
but after the time of <hi>Lewis le Grosse:</hi> at which
time it seemeth that Armories began to become
hereditary, and were transferred from Father to
Son in each Family.</p>
               <p>In the first assumption of these Signs, every
man did take to himself some such Beast, Bird,
Fish, Serpent, or other Creature as he thought
best fitted his Estate, or whose nature and quality
did in some sort quadrate with his own, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
himself was in some respect in quality like,
or wished to be resembled unto. <hi>Ex iis quibus
quisque maxime delectatur qualis etiam sit ipse
cognoscitur.</hi> The reason is, for that no man is
delighted but with things that are like himself.
Therefore wherein any man is specially delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
himself also is found to be in quality much like
unto them. Zanchius <hi>de immortalitate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum</hi> 133.</p>
               <p>Whereof it cometh that our Souls albeit they are
naturally delighted with things that please, and
delight the External Senses, yet shall we find that
by how much the mind is more generous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by so much the more doth it apprehend a
more solid delight in things pertaining to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
faculties, than in such as pertain to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
senses, as we may see in those Arts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Phantasie is chiefly exercised; whereby
they receive a greater contentment of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the mind, that is to say, as well Moral,
as Natural, and Supernatural Philosophy. For
like as our exteriour senses are delighted with
corporal, and corruptible things; so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
are our minds affected to things Spiritual and
eternal, and are wonderfully delighted in them
by reason of the Sympathy of their natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
<hi>Similitudo non currit quatuor pedibus
(ut aiunt in Scholis</hi>) many things may be like,
yet nothing like in all points or respects.</p>
               <p>As their Institution is not new, but very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
derived almost from the beginning of the
world; so their use was not limited, or restrained
to some few particular Nations, Kingdoms and
Countries, but most largely spread all the World
over, insomuch, as there is no Nation, Country
or People, so savage or barbarous, but that they
have their particular Signs, whereby they may
particularly and distinctly be known and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from others. As in Example.</p>

and shapes of savage and cruel beasts, as also their
Targets, and other Military Instruments suited
accordingly, and that in such multitudes, and in
such glorious and glistering manner, that they
dazled the eyes of the beholders.</p>
               <p>Neither were these Signs particularly restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto Nations, Countries, and Provinces but
they were so universal, as that there was no
Tribe, particular Person or Family, but had their
Armorial Signs or Notes, whereby they were not
only distinctly known, and discerned from other
forreign Tribes and Families; but also apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned (amongst themselves) one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by means of interposition of some minute
or small differences, which after-comers were
forced to devise for the preservation of Common
peace and unity, when the multitude of Bearers
(through long tract of time) increased exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.</p>

the Celestial Spheres, the Scituation of the Earth,
and the adjacent Islands, the Seas with the ebbing

better occasion offered to speak more at large
hereafter. Also <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> (as <hi>Pindarus</hi> the

overpass.</p>
               <p>These Signs or Tokens were in their first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
rough-hewen (as I may term them)
and rude, as also those other notes of signs that
we now call Badges or Cognizances: so as they
may be said to have been rather painted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
than exquisite tokens of honour, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
signs or badges: in the time of their first
institution they received divers denominations,
as Signs, Ensigns, Tokens, Marks, Cognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when in After-ages they had
been polished and refined, then were these To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
or Signs, that had been formerly (after a
rude fashion) handled together, more carefully
distinguished, so as those which we now call
Crests or Cognizances, worn upon the helmets
of Military persons in the field, were distinctly
known from those that were born in the Shields
and Targets, which we now call Arms in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and in Latin <hi>Arma.</hi> Men of ancient times
devised and invented many things ingenuously
and with great care and consideration, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them not; but recommended them to
posterity, to be by them brought to perfection,
according to that saying, <hi>Invenit antiquitas,
posteri perfecerunt,</hi> neither doth this derogate
ought from the studious, and industry of the
Ancient, neither is this any indignity unto them;
<hi>Non erubescat antiquitas</hi> (saith <hi>Chassaneus</hi>) <hi>si
quid melius horum quae ipsa tradidit, Novitas
adinvenit:</hi> for nothing is devised and perfected
at an instant, but it is continuance of time, and
much labour and industry that brings it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>These Signs, Marks, Notes, Ensigns, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else you please to name them, are not all
of one sort, for some of them may be applied
to peace, and others to military use; and of
each of these there are divers kinds or sorts:
For some of them are express notes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and authority or jurisdiction, others have
no authority at all annexed to them.</p>
               <p>Like as there is an absolute Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
Royal, free from all limitation, and
another said to be a mixt government; yea, and
that as well in Civil Policy, as in Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction: so are also the Ensigns several, as
well those that pertain to the City, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
as also those that belong to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Government.</p>
               <p>Those Ensigns that are remote or exempted
from Government and Authority are diverse,
according to the diversity of conceipts of the
first institutors or devisers of them. For some
of them are in manner Vulgar and Common,
and such as may fall to the lot of a person of
mean condition: others again of more subtile
and deep invention; exquisite, beautiful, and
honourable, and are remunerations or rewards
of some noble exploits, of meer divine wits, or
of some rare or excellent vertue, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of memorable and worthy deserts.</p>
               <p>I know some are of opinion that these tokens
or signs, which we do call Arms, were utterly
unknown to the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi>
and their memory not to be found with their
Nations: They do confess that the <hi>Romans</hi> did
make the same use of their Images that we do
at this day by our Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> to produce them
for testimonies of their generous race.</p>
               <p>Some other are of opinion, that they were
excogitated and brought in use by <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great and the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and some again do
suppose, they began in the time of <hi>Frederick
Barbarossa,</hi> but the contrary appeareth by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical
proof, as I have even now shewed:
well may their opinion stand with reason, that
do hold, that the discipline of Arms in the
Reign (or rather) during Imperial Government
of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, was brought to some kind of perfection,
and withal more generally propagated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed,
according to that saying of <hi>Abra. Fra.</hi>
Carolo <hi>Potentissimo Imperante haec &amp; distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs
explicata fuisse, &amp; frequentiùs usurpata elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cescit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal end for which these signs were
first taken up, and put in use was, that they
might serve for notes and marks to distinguish
tribes, families, and particular persons, each
from other; but this was not their only use, for
that they served also to notifie to the ingenuous
beholder of them (after some sort) the natural
quality and disposition of their Bearers; and so
behooveful was this invention thought to be,
and their use so reasonable, as that they have
been entertained of all succeeding posterities,
among all Nations, and continued (even to this
day) without any immutation or alteration of
their primary institution. These Armorial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
thus ingeniously devised had a further use;
for they served also for the more commodious
distribution of Nations, Tribes, and Families,
into Regiments and Bands; as also for assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
conducting, and governing of them in
martial expedition, and distinguishing (as I
have shewed) of particular persons in wars, as
well amongst themselves as from their enemies;
because it often falleth out by reason of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Armour and Weapons, of Discipline of
War, and of Language and Voice (in default of
such signs) that much treachery is wrought, and
many men after battle or skirmish do make
their retreat to the troops of the Enemy, to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55096:10"/>
danger of their surprise, or loss of life: So then
it is clear that this is one use of these Notes, or
Marks of distinction called Arms, that if a man
shall meet or encounter us, we do forthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by the note or mark that he beareth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be friend or enemy; and for some of
those uses and ends which I have formerly
shewed, These Armorial Ensigns have received
approbation in the highest degree, even from
the mouth of God himself (who, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> a Form of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conducting the <hi>Israelites</hi> in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
towards the Land of the Promise, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
command the use of Armorial Signs, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Filii Israelis quisque juxta vexillum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
cum signis secundum domum Majorum suorum
castra habento:</hi> which order he required to be
observed not only in the conduction of them in
their journey, but also in the pitching and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their Camp.</p>
               <p>In which precept we may observe, that God
maketh mention of two sorts of Ensigns; the
one general, the other particular; and that these
latter were no less needful than the former; for
the orderly governing and conducting of so
huge and populous a multitude as the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were, in a journey so long, and withal subject
to infinite dangers. The first sort of these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
God calleth <hi>Vexilla,</hi> that is to say Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
or Banners, which served for the conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their several Regiments. For the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
consisted of twelve Tribes which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into four Regiments; that is, to wit, three
Tribes to each Regiment, of which every one
had a particular Standard, which as they differed
in colour one from another, so did they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
comprehend in them several and distinct
Forms.</p>
               <p>Here may arise a twofold question concerning
these Standards before mentioned; the one,
what colour each of them were; the other,
what forms and shapes were depicted on them.
As to the colour, <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the second of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
saith, <hi>Qualia sunt ista Vexilla in Textu
non habetur, sed dicunt aliqui Hebraei quod
Vexillum cujuslibet Tribus, erat simile colori
lapidis positi in rationali, in quo inscriptum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
nomen ipsius</hi> Reuben, <hi>&amp; sic de aliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to their several Forms, <hi>Martinus
Borhaus</hi> in his Commentary upon the same
place, hath this saying, <hi>Tradunt Veteres in</hi>
Reubenis <hi>vexillo Mandragoram depictam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse,
quam ille in agro collectam matri</hi> Liae <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerat;
in</hi> Jehudae <hi>Leonem, cui illum benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo

Imago, qui serpenti &amp; colubro a</hi> Jacobo
<hi>comparatus erat, fiat</hi> Dan <hi>coluber in via.</hi> And
in Conclusion he saith, <hi>Sit fides penes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sort of Ensign according to <hi>Calepine,</hi> is
called <hi>Vexillum quasi parvum velum, &amp; acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur</hi>
(saith he) <hi>pro signo quo in exercitu vel
classe Imperatores utuntur.</hi> The use of these
Standards doth consist herein, that they being
born aloft upon a long pole or staff apparent to
every mans view, the Souldiers may be thereby
directed (upon all occasions of service) and by
the sight of them may be dissevered and united
at all times, as the necessity of the service shall
require. Of this use, <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the second
of <hi>Numbers</hi> saith, <hi>Vexilla in perticis elevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
ut ad eorum aspectum bellatores dividan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
&amp; uniantur:</hi> for like as a Ship is guided in
the surging Seas by the Stern or Ruther, even
so are the Souldiers ordered in their Martial
Exploits by their Standard or Ensign.</p>
               <p>The other sorts of Ensigns God calleth <hi>Signa
secundum domum Majorum suorum:</hi> whereby
is meant (if I be not deceived) the particular
Ensigns or Tokens of each particular Family,
and of the particular persons of each Family.
For so do I understand that exposition of <hi>Lyra</hi>
upon the same place, <hi>Signa propria sunt in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus
&amp; scutis, quibus bellatores mutuò se
cognoscunt, &amp; suos ab Adversariis distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here we must put a difference between
these words <hi>Arma &amp; Insignia,</hi> and we must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
those things that are proper to Arms
from such as pertain to Ensigns.</p>
               <p>Arms therefore being taken in the largest
sense (as I have hitherto in this Discourse used
the word) may be said to be either Publick or
Private.</p>
               <p>Such are said to be Publick Arms, as have
some Soveraign authority or jurisdiction annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are such Arms as are born by
Emperours, Kings, and absolute Princes, and
free Estates, having Soveraign authority and
power within their several Empires, Kingdoms,
and Territories. These in propriety of speech
cannot be aptly said to be the Arms of their
Stock or Family, whereof they are descended,
but do rather represent the nature of Ensigns,
than of Arms, in regard of the publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them annexed; as also in respect that
whosoever shall succeed them in those supream
Governments shall bear the same Arms, as the
express Notes and Testimonies of such their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Jurisdictions, though they be extracted
from Aliens or forraign Families. For so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Eagle the peculiar Arms of the house
of <hi>Austria,</hi> nor the Lions of the Family of
<hi>Plantagenet,</hi> nor the Flowers de Lis of the
house of <hi>Valois.</hi> And these Arms or Ensigns
may no man else bear, or yet mark his Goods
withal, unless it be that in token of Loyalty he
will set up the Kings Arms in his house, and
place his own Arms underneath. And there
are certain Ensigns of Dignity and Office which
every man having the same Dignity or Office
may lawfully bear, as the Ensigns of a Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
the Ensigns of a Bishop. And these are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to those only that have the exercising of
such Dignity or Office; if any other shall ufurp
the bearing or use of them, he incurreth the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55096:10"/>
crime of Forgery. Private Arms are such as
are proper to Private persons, whether they
be numbred in rank of the greater Nobility, as
Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
having no soveraign or absolute power:
or of the lesser Nobility or Gentry, Knights,
Esquires and Gentlemen; neither yet are they
Ensigns of any ordinary dignity, but peculiar to
their Family, and may be infinitely transferred
to their Posterity.</p>
               <p>For Arms or Armorial Tokens pertaining to
some particular Family; do descend to every
peculiar person extracted from the same Agna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether they be heirs to their Father or
Grandfather, or not. Sometimes the bearers
of these do so greatly multiply, as that they
are constrained for distinction sake, to annex
some apposition over and above their Paternal
Coat to them descended, for differencing the
persons. <hi>Quod licitum est, sicut nomini addere
praenomen,</hi> which they may no less lawfully do,
than to add a Christian name to a Surname, to
distinguish two Children issued from one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>These Arms are sometimes composed of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things, as of some kinds of Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Sun, Moon, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of four footed Beasts, or of Birds, or of
Serpents, or of Fishes, or some other Reptiles,
or else of some kind of Vegetables, as Trees,
Shrubs, Flowers, Fruits, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or else
of some solid things, as Castles, Towers, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or of things pertaining to Arts
Liberal, or Trades Mechanical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again they are compact of none of these,
but do consist only of the variations of simple
Colours, counterchanged by occasion of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Perpendicular, or whatsoever other Line
used in Coat-Armour, whether the same be
Straight, Crooked, Bunched, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby
passing through the Escocheon, either Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Oblique, or Direct, the Colours become
transmuted or counterchanged; of all which I
shall have occasion to speak hereafter in their
particular place.</p>
               <p>If question happen to arise touching the right
of some desolate place, or ruinated building, if
in digging up the ruines, or taking up of the
foundation thereof, there be found any known
Coat-Armour; the questioned place shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to appertain to that Family, to whom
that Coat-Armour belongeth.</p>
               <p>If any man be attainted or convicted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for betraying his Country, or of Heresie,
to the end he should be branded with a greater
note of infamy, his Arms are rased, broken
down and utterly defaced.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it falleth out that if a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
be extinguished by the death of the last of
the same (deceasing without issue) whereby the
bearing of the Arms proper to that Lineage is
from thenceforth abolished: The Arms are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
in the grave, together with the Corps of
the Defunct.</p>
               <p>After long tract of time, these Tokens which
we call Arms, became remunerations for service,
and were bestowed by Emperours, Kings, and
Princes, and their Generals and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the field upon Martial men, whose
valorous merits even in justice, required due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of Honour answerable unto their
worthy acts, the remembrance whereof could
not better be preserved and derived unto poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than by these kinds of honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
The first we read of, that made this
use of them was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being
moved thereunto by the perswasion of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
his Schoolmaster: who having observed his
magnificent mind in rewarding his Souldiers to
the full of their deserts, did at length prevail
with him so much, as that he caused him to
turn the Current of his Bounty another way,
and to recompence his Souldiers with these
Marks or Tokens of Honour; which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on them as Hereditary testimonies of
their glorious merits. In later Ages <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fourth the Emperour, gave Arms also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Learned men, and such as had performed any
memorable service, or excellent work, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bartholus,</hi> being a most expert man in
the Laws, and one of the Council of the said
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, received in reward for his
Arms from the said Emperour, this Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<hi>viz.</hi> Or, a Lion rampant his tail forked,
Gules, which afterward descended successively
to his Children and Posterity. But <hi>Bartholus</hi>
(though he were a most singular and perfect
Civilian) because he was unexperienced in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Discipline, durst not at first assume the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those Arms: But afterwards upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advice he bare them, knowing how unfit it
was to refuse a Reward given by so Potent an
Emperour. And this was a noble Institution of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, that not only the Skilful
Professors of the Civil Laws, but the Learned
Proficients, and the Judicious Students in other
Arts and Professions, might receive remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for their Vertues, <hi>Honos enim alit Artes,
omnesque incenduntur ad studia glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Abra.
Fra. pag.</hi> 76. And without all doubt there is
great reason that Arms should be distributed
unto men renowned for their Learning and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who with expence, even of their Lives
and Spirits in continual Study, to enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
fit for to serve the Weal publick at home,
by Magistracy, and Civil Government, wherein
they may no less merit reward of their Prince
at home, by their politick managing of Civil
Affairs, than the Martial man abroad with his
brandished slaughtering Sword; sithence they
oftentimes in their Civil Government, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
limits to Martial affairs also, how far they
shall extend their power, according to that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Cicero; Offic. 1. Parvi sunt foris Arma,
nisi est consilium domi</hi> And this is the cause
that Arms are given for remuneration in later
times, as well to Learned and Religious men,
as to Martial men; yet not so much for their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55096:11"/>
valour, as for their wisdom, and to honour
them withal, according to the saying of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Author, <hi>Arma dantur viris Religiosis,
non propter strenuitatem, sed propter honorem,
quia honorabile est Arma portare; ut Doctor
in legibus viginti annis per legem Armorum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Miles, non tamen propter ejus strenuitatem,
sed propter ejus dignitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The examples of these two Great Potentates
before mentioned, in remunerating their well
meriting Souldiers, faithful Servants and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and learned Subjects, with these Signs or
Symbols called Arms; the one, <hi>viz. Alexander</hi>
the Great, for service done in Wars; the other,
namely <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, for politick mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Civil Affairs by learning and wisdom at
home, have been imitated by divers Emperors,
Kings and Princes of succeeding Ages, using
therein the ministry of the Office of Heralds;
as subordinate Officers thereunto appointed
and authorized, reserving always to themselves
the supream jurisdiction of Judging and Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
persons according to their Deserts;
but using the ministry of the Heralds, as for
sundry other uses of great importance in a
State, so also for the inventing and devising of
congruent tokens of Honour, answerable to the
merits of those that shall receive the same: to
do which although there is a power seeming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
committed to them by the Soveraign;
yet the same is restrained into a power ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is to devise with discretion Arms,
correspondent to the desert of the person, that
shall be thought worthy to have these honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
badges or tokens of honour bestowed upon
him.</p>
               <p>Now sithence we have had cause here in this
Chapter to make mention of a Herald, it shall
not be amiss to shew what this word is, and its
natural signification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here-heaulte.</hi> by abbreviation (as <hi>Verstegan</hi>
noteth) <hi>Herault,</hi> as also <hi>Herauld,</hi> doth rightly
signifie the Champion of the Army; and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be a Name of Office, he that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
hath the special charge to denounce Wars,
or to challenge to Battle or Combat: in which
sense our name of <hi>Heraulte</hi> approacheth the
nearest to <hi>Fecialis</hi> in Latin.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>SO much of such Notes as are necessary to
be observed for the better understanding
of these things that shall be hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
touching the Subject of this Work.
Now we proceed to the practick exercise of
these Armorial tokens, which pertain to the
function of Heralds, and is termed Armory, and
may be thus defined: Armory is an Art right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prescribing the true knowledg and use of
Arms.</p>
               <p>Now like as in things natural the effects do
evermore immediately ensue their causes, even
so division which is a demonstration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and power of things, must by immediate
consequence follow definition, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the nature of the thing defined. Division
is a distribution of things common, into things
particular or less common. The use thereof
consisteth herein, that by the assistance of this
division, words of large intendment and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
are reduced to their definite and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
sense and meaning, that so the mind of
the learner be not misled through the ambiguity
of words, either of manifold or uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.
Moreover it serveth to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the understanding of the learner, and to
make him more capable of such things as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<hi>Ea enim quae divisim traduntur facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
intelliguntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The practise hereof shall be manifested in
the distribution of the skill of Armory, with
all the parts and complements thereof through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this whole Work.</p>
               <p>This Skill of Armory consists of Blazoning,
and
Marshalling.</p>
               <p>Albeit I do here make mention of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling,
or conjoyning of divers Arms in one
Shield, or Escocheon; nevertheless, sithence it
is far besides my purpose, for the present to have
further to do with them (in this place) than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to nominate them; for distributions sake, I
will reserve this kind of Marshalling or conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Arms of distinct Families in one Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
unto a more convenient time and
place, peculiarly destinated to that purpose, and
I will proceed to the explication of those things
which do concern the first member of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution,
<hi>viz.</hi> Blazoning.</p>
               <p>Blazon is taken, either strictly for an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Arms in apt and significant terms, or
else, it is taken largely for a display of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Bearers of Arms: in which sense
<hi>Chassaneus</hi> defineth the same in this manner,
<hi>Blazonia est quasi alicujus vera laudatio sub
quibusdam signis, secundum prudentiam, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,
fortitudinem &amp; temperantiam.</hi> A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
French Armorist saith, that to Blazon is to
express what the shapes, kinds, and colour of
things born in Arms are, together with their apt
significations.</p>
               <p>Like as definitions are forerunners of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even so divisions also have precedence of
rules. To speak properly of a rule, it may be
said to be any straight or level thing, whereby
lines are drawn in a direct and even form. In
resemblance whereof, we here understand it,
to be a brief precept or instruction for knowing
or doing of things aright, as witnesseth <hi>Calepine,</hi>
saying, <hi>Regula per translationem dicitur, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
rerum praeceptio,</hi> that is to say, a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
or ready instruction of matters.</p>
               <p>Rules are taken for brief documents prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
for the delivery, or apprehension of some
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55096:11"/>
Art or Science; by these the wits and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men are much comforted and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
according to the saying of <hi>Seneca, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii
vis praeceptis alitur &amp; crescit, non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quam scintilla flatu levi adjuta, novas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
persuasiones adjicit innatis, &amp; depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatas
corrigit.</hi> The force of wit is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and augmented by Rules or Precepts;
like as a spark is kindled with a soft and
gentle fire, and do add new inducements and
perswasions to those that are already appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and correcteth such as are depraved
and vicious.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore, by due order of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that I should annex such Rules as
are peculiar to blazon <hi>in genere.</hi> For other
particular Rules must be reserved to more
proper places.</p>
               <p>The aptest Rules for this place, are these
immediately following: In Blazoning you must
use an advised deliberation before you enter
thereunto; for having once begun, to recal
the same, doth argue an inconsiderate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
meriting just reprehension.</p>
               <p>The more compendious your Blazon is, by
so much is it holden the more commendable;
<hi>Quia quod brevius est semper delectabilius
habetur.</hi> Therefore you must shun multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of impertinent words in your Blazon,
<hi>Frustra enim fit per plura quod fieri potest
per pauciora.</hi> But herein you must observe
this Caution, that whilst you labour to be
compendious, you omit nothing material or
necessary to be expressed: For as the one doth
eclipse the understanding, so the other is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to memory, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> noteth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Omnis sermo, si sit brevior quam opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet,
obscurat intellectum, si autem longior,
difficile erit retentioni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must take special heed to words in
Blazon, for a different form in Blazoning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Arms cease to be the same; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitas
enim nominis inducet diversitatem
rei, in tantum quod nomina sunt significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
rerum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must not be too full of conceits in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
nor overforward in speech.</p>
               <p>You must use no iteration or repetition of
words in Blazoning of one Coat:</p>
               <p>Especially of any of these four
words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>Of,</item>
                     <item>Or,</item>
                     <item>And,</item>
                     <item>With.</item>
                  </list>
For the doubling of any of these, is counted
a great fault, insomuch as the offender here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is deemed unworthy to Blazon a Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>In Blazoning you must have regard of the
things that are born in Arms: as also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they may be resembled, whether they
be natural or artificial, and so to commend
them accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the Blazoning of any Coat, you must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore
observe this special Rule. First to
begin with the Field, and then proceed to
the Blazon of the Charge, if any be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if the Field be occupied with sundry
things, whether the same be of one or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds, you must first nominate that which
lieth next and immediately upon the Field,
and then Blazon that which is more remote
from the same. What Field and Charge are
shall be shewed in their proper places; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
oportet discentem credere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chassaneus</hi> holdeth, that where the Chief
of an Escocheon is of one colour or metal,
or more, you shall blazon the Chief first;
but I hold it more consonant to reason, to
begin with the Field (because of the priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof in nature, as also in respect that
it is the Continent) rather than with the
Charge, which is the thing contained, and
so consequently last in nature. Nevertheless
the French Armorists for the most part do bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
the Charge first, and the Field after,
which is a course meerly repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
by whose prescript order, the place
must have precedence of the thing placed,
and the continent of the thing contained:
wherefore our Heralds manner of blazon is
more agreable to reason than theirs. There
be divers forms of blazon: A certain Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who lived in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth, used to blaze Arms by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
parts of mans body, as <hi>Ab. Fra.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>pag. 63. Malorques,</hi> a French-man,
made use of flowers for this purpose. <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
an English-man, who lived in the time
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, performed it by
the days of the week. But in former times their
Predecessors used only these three kinds follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
first, by Metals and Colours; secondly, by
precious Stones; and thirdly, by the Celestial
Planets. Out of which sundry forms, I have
made choice of these three last which are
most ancient and necessary, in respect that
these, above all other, do best fit my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
which is, to apply to each particular
state of Gentry, a blazon Correspondent.
As for example, to Gentlemen having no
title of dignity, blazon by Metals and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
to persons ennobled by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
by precious Stones: and to Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Monarchs, Kings and Princes, blazon by
Planets.</p>
               <p>The two last of these three selected forms
are not to be used in the blazoning of the
Coat-Armours of Gentlemen that are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to some degree of Nobility, unless they
be rarely qualified, or of special desert.</p>
               <p>These selected forms of blazon, do seem to
imply a necessity of their invention; to the end
that as well by blazon, as by degree, Noblemen
might be distinguished from Gentlemen, and
persons of Majesty, from those of Noble
Lineage, that so a due <hi>Decorum</hi> may be
observed in each Degree, according to the
Dignity of their Persons; for that it is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55096:12"/>
thing unfitting, either to handle a mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in a lofty stile, or a stately Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a mean.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>SO much of the Definition and general
Rules of Blazon. Now will I proceed
to the distribution thereof.</p>
               <p>The principal means of teaching, and the
chief part of Method consisteth in distinction,
therefore in the explanation or unfolding of
this Fabrick of Arms or Armorial Signs, I
will use some manifest kind of distribution.</p>
               <p>The blazon of <hi>Arms</hi> consisteth
in their Accidents,
and
Parts.</p>
               <p>I call those notes or marks Accidents of
Arms, that have no inherent quality or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Substance or Essence of them,
but may be annexed unto them, or taken
from them, their Substance still remaining;
for so doth <hi>Porphyrius</hi> define the same, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Accidens potest adesse &amp; abesse sine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti
interitu.</hi> Accidents may be said to be
Cosin-germans to Nothing: For so, after a
sort, doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckon of them, saying,
<hi>Accidens videtur esse propinquum non enti,
Metaph.</hi> 6. For they have no being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but as they are in things of being, or
annexed to them. As the same Author fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noteth, <hi>Metaph. 7. Accidentia non sunt
entia, nisi quia sunt entis.</hi>

               <p>Accidents and Forms do agree in this point,
that both the one and the other of them
being separated from the Substance, yet is not
the Substance thereby altered from that it
was, but remaineth still the same; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
many men to think that Forms were
Accidents. These cannot alter the matter
or substance, because they are not of the
main, but come upon the by, as it were.
<hi>Nihil enim transmutat materiam, nisi sit in
materia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accidents are in the subject,, as <hi>passio in
patiente,</hi> according to that saying, <hi>Accidens
ut est in subjecto, non idem est in subjecto,
sed ut est passio ejus, est sibi idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Accidents as are here meant
are these, <hi>viz.</hi> Tincture,
and
Differences.</p>
               <p>Tincture is a variable hue of Arms, and
is common, as well to Differences of Arms, as
to the Arms themselves.</p>
               <p>And the same is distributed into Colours,
and
Furrs.</p>
               <p>Colour may be said to be an external die,
wherewith any thing is coloured or stained,
or else it may be said to be the gloss of a
Body beautified with light.</p>
               <p>And the Colour here mentioned is
both General,
and
Special.</p>
               <p>By general Colour, I understand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and natural colour of each particular
thing, whether the same be Natural or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial,
of what kind soever that are depicted
and set forth in their external and proper
beauty. In this respect all colours whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
(without exception) may seem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to this Art, for so much as there is
nothing in this world subjected to the sight
of man, but either is, or aptly may be born
in Arms; so spacious and general is the scope
of Armory. In blazoning of things born in
their natural or proper colour, you shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
term them to be born proper, which is a
blazon sufficient for things of that kind, and
well fitting their property or nature, for
there are no terms of blazon allowed to things
born after that sort.</p>
               <p>By special Colours, I mean such colours,
as by a certain peculiar propriety (as it were)
do belong to this Art of Armory.</p>
               <p>These are both
 Simple,
and
Mixt.</p>
               <p>Simple Colours are those, whose existence
is of such absolute perfection (in their kind)
as that they need not the participation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other colour to make them absolute, but
do communicate their natural qualities to all
other colours, to make them perfect, in which
respect they are called <hi>elementa coloris,</hi> as
shall be shewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>And those are White,
and Black.</p>
               <p>To these in right belongeth the first place
amongst colours, because in the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they were before all other colours: <hi>Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
enim sunt compositis incomposita:</hi> and are
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> called <hi>Elementa colorum,</hi> saying,
<hi>Albus &amp; niger sunt elementa colorum medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum.</hi>
Only White and Black are accounted
simple Colours, because all other colours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
are raised either of an equal or une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
mixture or composition of these two,
which are (as I may term them) their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
parents. These are said to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
parents of all other colours, in respect
they have their original being from these,
either in an equal or disproportionable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore I will begin with them,
and so proceed to the rest that we call <hi>colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
medii,</hi> in respect of their participation of
both. Now for as much as practise is the
scope of Doctrines (to the end those things
that are, or shall be delivered, may be the
better conceived or born in memory) I have
thought good to manifest them by particular
examples of ocular demonstration, in the plainest
manner that I can devise, <hi>Quia qualis est rerum
demonstratio, talis futura est hominum scientia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55096:12"/>Examples and Demonstrations are of
great power and efficacy to illustrate and
bring things to light, wherein brevity, the
prop and aid of memory and sweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of facility, is highly commended, as <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi>
noteth, saying, <hi>Nihil est ad res illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minandas
illustrius exemplis, in quibus bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas
adjutrix memoriae, facilitatis socia,
semper est commendata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
White is a colour
that consisteth of very
much light, as it is of
<hi>Scribonius</hi> defined, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedo
est color simplex
in corpore tenuiore mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
luminositate constans:</hi>
to which Black is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
Note, as colours
may be resembled to
things of greatest No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
or Reputation, so is their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
accounted of accordingly.</p>
               <p>The colour White is resembled to the
light, and the dignity thereof reckoned more
worthy than the Black, by how much the
light and the day is of more esteem than dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the night, whereunto black is likened.
Furthermore, white is accounted more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
than black, in respect of the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
use thereof. For men in ancient time
were accustomed to note things well and
laudably performed (and esteemed worthy to
be kept in memory) with white, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
whatsoever was holden reproachful
or dishonourable, was noted with black, as the
Poet noteth, saying,
<q>
                     <l>Quae laudanda forent, &amp; quae culpanda vicissim,</l>
                     <l>Illa prius cretâ, mox haec carbone notasti.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, white challengeth the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of black (according to <hi>Vpton</hi>) in respect
of the priority of time, for that it was in
nature before black, which is a deprivation
thereof: Like as darkness, whereunto black
is resembled, is an exemption of light, <hi>Omnis
enim privatio praesupponit habitum.</hi> Finally,
<hi>Vpton</hi> preferreth white before black, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that white is more easily discerned, and
further seen in the Field.</p>
               <p>This colour is most commonly taken in
Blazon for the metal Silver, and is termed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
wheresoever the same is found, either
in Field or Charge. This metal representeth
Water, which (next to the Air) is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
of all the Elements, and in Armory it
is termed Argent, for that it approacheth
near to the Luminary Bodies. To this metal
is given the second place next to Gold, in
regard that the Armory cannot be good, that
hath not in it either <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver:</hi> It
also, for another cause, bare the resemblance
of Water, which scoureth, cleanseth, and
putteth away all filth and uncleanness: For
in Blazon it betokeneth innocency, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life and chastity; amongst Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it is likened to flegm. As for the esteem
of this metal Silver, we may observe in all
Ages, that Emperours, Kings, and Princes
had, and yet have, their Vessels of chief use
of Silver. As for the abundance of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
you may read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. how every
man brought unto <hi>Solomon</hi> presents, being
<hi>Vessels of Silver and Vessels of Gold, and
Rayment and Armour, and sweet Odors,
Horses and Mules from year to year. And
the King gave Silver in Ierusalem as Stones,
&amp;c.</hi> Such was the plentiful abundance of
this metal in the days of <hi>Solomon.</hi> In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Arms, it is accounted a fault wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
blame to Blazon this otherwise than Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
but in doubling of Mantles it is not
so taken: for therein it is not understood
to be a metal, but the skin or furr of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Beast called a <hi>Lituite,</hi> so named (as I
conceive) of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> now called <hi>Luten,</hi> a
part of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> confining upon <hi>Polonia.</hi>
This Furr hath been heretofore much used
by the ancient Matrons of the honourable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London,</hi> even by those that were of
the chiefest account, who ware the same in a
kind of Bonnet, called corruptly a <hi>Lettice Cap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
Black is a colour
contrary to White, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
little participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of light, and is of
<hi>Scribonius</hi> thus defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Nigredo est color in
corpore crassiori exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae
luminositatis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps.</hi>
Whereby it is
apparent that black is
of less perfection than
white. For what thing soever there is that
hath in it either light or heat, or else a life,
either Animal or Vegetable, the same being
once extinct, the thing it self becometh forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
black, which is said to be the colour of
horrour and destruction; for which respect
mourning Garments are made of that colour,
that doth most significantly represent the
horrour of death and corruption, <hi>Farnes.</hi> 3.
104. This colour is called in blazon Sable,
of the Latin word <hi>Sabulum,</hi> which signifieth
gross sand or gravel, in respect of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and earthy substance, wherein it abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
above all others. And this colour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
far inferiour in dignity to white, and
is likened to darkness, called in Latin <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,
eò quod teneant, id est, impediant ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,
&amp; visum prohibeant.</hi> Note that the rest
of those special colours before mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
white and black, are called <hi>Colores me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii,</hi>
for that they have their primary Essence
from these, either by an equal or uneven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation
or mixture of these two together:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55096:13"/>
and in regard of these two extremes, from
which they have their being, cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be called <hi>Colores, nisi per participationem.</hi>
This colour is in Heraldry blazoned Sable,
and is expressed in Graving by lines hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
cross each other.</p>
               <p>Now as touching <hi>Colores medii,</hi> or mixed
Colours, it is to be understood that they are
raised by the contemperation or mixture of the
two Simples formerly handled, as may appear
by the Definition of <hi>Scribonius,</hi> who saith,
<hi>Mixtus color est, qui ex Simplicium contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratione
producitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All mixt or midling Colours, that we call
<hi>Colores medii,</hi> are reckoned more Noble, or
Ignoble, by participation; that is to say, as
they do partake more or less of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of white, which is resembled to light;
or of black, which hath a resemblance of
darkness, or deprivation of light.</p>
               <p>Of these according to <hi>Scribonius,</hi> some are <list>
                     <item>Exactly compounded of
both Simples.</item>
                     <item>Declining more to the
one than to the other, in
an unequal proportion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
That Colour which
is said to be exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
doth partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the two Simples
indifferently in a just
proportion, as Red;
which <hi>Scribonius</hi> thus
defineth, <hi>Rubedo est co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
aequali simul Albedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis
&amp; Nigrediuis combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione
constans.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Colours (next after Metals) this Colour,
Vermilion, or Red, hath the prime place,
forasmuch as it representeth the Fire, which
of all other Elements, is the most lightsome,
and approacheth nearest to the quality and
vertue of the Sun: In regard whereof it was
ordained, That none should bear this Colour
(which betokeneth nobleness of Courage,
and valorous magnanimity) but persons of
honourable birth and rank, and men of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
desert. This colour inciteth courage and
magnanimity in persons that do grapple to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in single or publick fight. We read,
that those that strengthened their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
with Elephants, when they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them to fight, they produced before
them resemblances of this martial Colour, as
the blood of Grapes and of Mulberies. This
Colour is likened to the precious Rubie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Vertues it is compared to magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
or boldness of Courage. And amongst
the Complexions it is resembled to Choler.
In Armory it is called Gules. And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in Graving by Lines drawn streight
down the Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This Colour is
bright Yellow,
which is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of much White,
and a little Red, as
if you should take
two parts of White,
and but one of Red.
This colour in Arms
is blazed by the
name of Or, which
is as much to say as <hi>Aurum,</hi> which is Gold: And
it is commonly called Gold Yellow, because it
doth lively represent that most excellent Metal,
the possession whereof inchanteth the hearts
of Fools, and the colour whereof blindeth
the eyes of the Wise. Of the excellency of
this Metal, <hi>Hesiodus</hi> hath this saying: <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
est Corporibus sicut Sol inter Stellas.</hi>
And therefore such is the worthiness of this
Colour, which doth resemble it, that (as
<hi>Christine de Pice</hi> holdeth) none ought to
bear the same in Arms, but Emperours and
Kings, and such as be of the Blood Royal,
though indeed it be in use more common.
And as this Metal exceedeth all other in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
purity, and fineness, so ought the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
(as much as in him lieth) endeavour to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is expressed in Graving by Pricks or Points.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This Colour is Green,
which consisteth of more
Black, and of less Red,
as appeareth by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition;
<hi>Viridis est color
Nigredine copiosiore, &amp;
Rubedine minore contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratus.</hi> This Colour is
blazoned Vert, and is
called in Latin <hi>Viridis,
à vigore,</hi> in regard of the strength, freshness,
and liveliness thereof; and therefore best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth
youth, in that most Vegetables, so
long as they flourish, are beautified with this
verdure: and is a Colour most wholesome
and pleasant to the eye, except it be in a
young Gentlewomans Face. This Colour is
expressed in Graving by Lines drawn towards
the right hand.</p>

Blew is a Colour which
consisteth of much Red,
and of little White, and
doth represent the Colour
of the Skie in a clear Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shining
day. This in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
is termed Azure. <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleus

Purpure is a Colour
that consisteth of much
Red, and of a small
quantity of Black, and
is thus defined; <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pureus
color est, qui à
multa Rubedine, &amp; pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciore
Nigredine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscetur.
Chassaneus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
formerly handled
those former six Colours,
viz. White, Black, Red, Yellow, Green, and
Blew, saith, that of them all (being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and mixed together according to
proportion) this Purpure Colour is raised.
This Colour usually hath no other name in
Blazon.</p>
               <p>Purpure Colour hath some resemblance of
a withered red Rose, which after long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
the glorious lustre thereof fading,
becometh somewhat blackish, as if it
were a proportionable commixture of Red
and Black together. This Colour hath its
Denomination of a certain Fish called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Purpura,</hi> a kind of Shell-fish, whereof
in times past, great store have been found
near to that famous City of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> situated
next to the Sea-coast in the Country of
<hi>Phoeuicia:</hi> this kind of Fish hath in the mouth
of it an excellent and precious liquor, or juyce,
of singular use in dying of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loaths, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and use whereof was first found out
by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> for which cause this Colour
is called <hi>Tyrius Color.</hi> They must be taken
alive, and that chiefly in the Spring Season,
at which time the juyce is most plentiful in
them at other Seasons it is more scarce:
They are gathered alive, and cast together
on a heap, that so by their continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they may vent out this rich liquor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their spirit, which done in some
near place or other provided for the clean
keeping thereof, it is taken up and spared
for necessary purposes. This <hi>Colour,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time, was of that precious esteem, as
that none but Kings and Princes, and their
Favourites, might wear the same, as we may
see, <hi>Dan. 5. 16. Now if thou canst read the
writing, and shew me the interpretation
thereof, thou shalt be clothed with Purple,
and shalt have a chain of Gold about thy
neck.</hi> Also, 1 <hi>Macchab. 10. 20. And</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander

saw his Honour as it was proclaimed,
and that he was cloathed in Purple, they
fled all away.</hi> Hereof (perhaps) it cometh
that this Colour is found of so rare use in
Armorial Signs. Moreover it is said; <hi>And
the King commanded that they should take
off the Garment of</hi> Jonathan, <hi>and cloath him
in Purple, and so they did, 1 Macchab.</hi> 10.

Tawny (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is a Colour of Worship,
and of some Heralds
it is called Brusk, and
is most commonly born
of French Gentlemen,
but very few do bear
it in <hi>England.</hi> In Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
it is known by the
name of <hi>Tenne.</hi> It is
(saith he) the surest
Colour that is (of so bright a hue, being
compounded) for it is made of two bright

The last of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
mixed Colours,
we do commonly call
Murrey, but in Blazon,
Sanguine, and is (as
most truly saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
a Princely Colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed one of the
Colours appertaining of
ancient time to the
Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> It
is a Colour of great estimation, and very
stately, and is in use in certain Robes of the
Knights of the Bath. Some Heralds, of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Judgment, do hardly admit these two
last mentioned for Colours of Fields, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they are reckoned Stainand Colours.
Yet some Coats of Arms there are, and those
of reverend Antiquity, whose Fields are of
those Colours, for which respect they have
been allowed for Colours of Fields, as Sir
<hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi> in his <hi>Glory of Generosity,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
This kind of bearing, <hi>Leigh</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

Houses, that have of long time born Tawny
in their Arms; the one of them he nameth
<hi>Hounzaker,</hi> and the other <hi>Finers.</hi>

<hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Furrs (used in Arms) are taken for the
Skins of certain Beasts, stripped from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and artificially trimmed, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
doubling, or lining of Robes and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
serving as well for State and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
as for wholsome and necessary use.
And these thus trimmed and imployed, are
called in Latin <hi>pellicei, à pellendo,</hi> of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, (quite contrary in sense, though
like in sound, to <hi>pellices, à pellicendo,</hi> for
drawing all to them) because they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and resist the extremities of cold, and
preserve the Bodies that are covered with
them in good temperature.</p>
               <p>These are used as well in doublings of the
Mantles pertaining to Coat-Armours, as in
the Court-Armours themselves.</p>
               <p>Furrs do consist either
of One colour alone,
or,
More colours than one.</p>

That Furr that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth

in doubling is taken
for the <hi>Lituits</hi> Skin,
before spoken of, <hi>p.</hi> 11.
An example whereof
we have in this Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon.
Some perhaps
will expect, that in
the handling of these
Furrs, I should pursue the order of <hi>Gerard
Leigh,</hi> who giveth the preheminence of
place unto Ermyn, for the dignity and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
thereof: but that form suiteth neither
with the Method that I have prefixed to my
self; nor yet with the Order of Nature,
which ever preferreth Simples before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds,
because of their priority in time:
For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>Priora sunt composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
incomposita:</hi> which order, as it is of all
other the most reasonable, certain, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
so do I endeavour by all means to
conform my self, in these my poor Labours,
thereunto: <hi>Natura enim regitur ab intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentia
non errante.</hi> Note that this, and all
other the Examples following throughout
this Chapter (as they are here placed) must
be understood to be doublings or linings of
Robes, or Mantles of State, or other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein (according to <hi>Leigh</hi>) they
all have one general Name, and are called
Doublings; but in Escocheons they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Nine proper and several Names.
What those Mantles are, shall be shewed
hereafter, when I come to the handling of
the second Member of Division before made.
In the blazoning of Arms, this Colour is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore
termed Argent, unless it be in the
description of the Arms of one that is <hi>Reus
Laesae Majestatis:</hi> but being a doubling, it is
no offence (saith <hi>Christine de Pice</hi>) to call
it White, because therein it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
only as a Furr or Skin.</p>
               <p>Furrs consisting of more than
one Colour, are either of Two Colours,

Ermyn is a Furr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of White, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
with black
spots. <hi>Albane</hi> Earl of
<hi>Brittain,</hi> unto whom
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror
gave the Earldom of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> and Honour
of <hi>Middlesham,</hi> bore
this Coat. You must
Blazon this by the name
of Ermyn, and not Argent powdred with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This is the Skin of a little Beast, less
than a Squirrel (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) that hath his
being in the Woods of the Land of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
whereof he taketh his name. The tail
thereof is of a Thumbs length, which is of
colour brown. The Aegyptians did propose
this little Beast for an Hieroglyphick of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity,
<hi>Farnes. lib. 2. fol.</hi> 15. So greatly is this
little Beast affected unto cleanness, as that she
had rather expose her self to the hazard of
being killed, or taken by the Hunters, than
she would pollute her Coat with the filth of
the Bird-lime laid before the entrance of the
Cave to take her at her going in. <hi>Leigh,</hi> in
the former part of his <hi>Accidence, fol.</hi> 132.
seemeth therein to contradict himself, in that
he affirmeth Ermyn to be no Colour, but a
Compound with a Metal, and serveth as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
only. For mine own part, I do not see
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55096:14"/>
how in doubling of Mantles it should be
reckoned a Metal, for that all doublings or
linings of Robes and Garments, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not altogether, yet chiefly are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the repelling of cold and weathers
drift: to which use Metals are most unfit, as
King <hi>Dionysius</hi> declared, when coming into
a Church where the Images were attired in
most rich golden Robes, he took them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
saying, <hi>Such Garments were too cold
for Winter, and to heavy for Summer.</hi> A
fair pretence to cloak his Sacrilegious Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice.
The same Author in his said <hi>Accidence,
fol.</hi> 75. making mention of this Furr, taketh
occasion to commend a late prescribed order
for the distribution of this rich and rare Furr,
according to the dignity of the persons to
whom the wearing thereof is allowed, which
is this; That an Emperour, a King, or a
Prince, may have the powdering in their
Apparel as thick set together as they please:
a Duke may have in his Mantles cape, only
four Raungs or Ranks of them: a Marquis
three Raungs and a half: an Earl a cape of
three Raungs only. In some Coats these are
numbred, but then they extend not to the
number of ten. These rows or ranks before
named are of some Authors called Timbers
of Ermyn: for no man under the degree of
a Baron, or a Knight of the most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Order of the Garter, may have his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doubled with Ermyn.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This is that other
Furr, before mentioned,
to consist of a mixture
of White and Black,
and hath some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the former:
but differeth in this;
that where that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of White powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with black; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
this is Black
powdered with White. But neither in that,
nor in this, shall you make any mention in
Blazon of any such Mixtures, but only use
the name appropriated to either of them,
which doth sufficiently express the manner of
their composition to the understanding of
those that are but meanly skilled in Blazon;
the name peculiarly allotted to this Furr, is
Ermyns.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Boswell</hi> is of this Opinion, That Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn
and Ermyns ought never to be sorted
in Arms with the Metal of their colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he) they are but Furrs, and
have no proper Blazon with any Metal. Yet
doth he particularly Blazon the Coat of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,
fol.</hi> 106. in the Atchievement of the Right
Honourable Lord, Sir <hi>William Cecil</hi> Knight,
late Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> where he
might fitly have taken exception against such
bearing, if he could have produced any good
ground for warranting such his Opinion; in
default whereof he there passeth the same
over with silence, knowing that Antiquity
and Custome (which hath the vigour of a
Law, where there is no Law written) are
powerful in things of this nature: he secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relinquisheth his Opinion, forasmuch as it
is manifest, that not only <hi>Walcot,</hi> but <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,</hi>
and many others, both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
have used such bearing without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
Of those Furrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, that are
compounded of Yellow
and Black, this is the
first, and is termed in
blazon, Ermynois, whose
Ground or Field is Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and the Powdrings
Black. Though this be
rich in Arms (saith
<hi>Leigh</hi>) yet in doubling
it is not so rich. Of the use of this Furr,
<hi>Bara</hi> maketh mention in his Book, entituled,
<hi>Le Blazon des Armoiries, p.</hi> 14. and <hi>Edel.
Hiryssen,</hi> in his Book, entituled, <hi>Le Iardyn
d' Armoiries,</hi> in the Arms of <hi>Leefwelt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This is that other
Furr composed of the
same Colours, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
in a contrary
manner to the former;
for whereas that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of Yellow pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with Black, this
is Black powdered
with Yellow; and in
Blazon is termed Pean.</p>
               <p>These are other sorts of Furrs or Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
consisting also of two only Colours,
which as they are much different in form,
so do they also receive a diverse Blazon
from these before specified, which are these
that follow, and their like.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Verrey,
Or and Gules, by the
name of <hi>Ferrers,</hi> and
is the Coat of <hi>Io. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>
of <hi>Walton upon
Trent</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi>
Esquire. In Coats of
this sort of bearing, in
case where it may be
holden doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should have the precedence, the Colour
or the Metal; the Metal must have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
as the most worthy. The French
men, from whom we do borrow our terms
of Blazon, do call all sorts of Doublings or
Furrs of this form, by the name of Vaire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55096:15"/>
perhaps, <hi>Quia ex diversis coloribus alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
variantur.</hi> To this sort of bearing, there
are no other terms of Blazon allowed. If
your Vaire doth consist of Argent and Azure,
you must in Blazon thereof, say only, He
beareth Vaire; and it sufficeth: but if it be
composed of any other Colours, then you
must say, He beareth Vaire of these or those
Colours. The Latin Blazoners, making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this sort of bearing, do thus describe
them, <hi>Portat arma variata ex pellibus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis
&amp; caeruleis,</hi> accounting them for Skins of
little Beasts. For that in ancient times they
were used for linings of Robes, and Mantles
of Senators, Consuls, Emperours and Kings,
and therèupon are skilfully termed Doublings.
Of this use of them, <hi>Alex. ab Alex. Genial.
dierum, lib. 5. fol.</hi> 285. saith, <hi>Legimus Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam
depictas penulas induisse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it was permitted to men grown
to years, to use a kind of short Cloak, called
<hi>Penula,</hi> in time of wars, though it were in
substance but sleight and thin: For <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Severus</hi> the Emperour, in favour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
men, did grant them a Priviledge for
wearing of this kind of Garments: <hi>Wolf. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,
lib.</hi> 8. The Garments of the <hi>Tribune</hi> of
the People, and of the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Sect, were
most commonly this <hi>Penula</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
like as also was <hi>Sagum,</hi> which was a
Souldiers Cloak or Cassock, and <hi>Endromis,</hi>
which was an hairy Garment much like an
Irish Mantle and Hood. These were apt
Garments for repelling of Cold. These were
not Habits beseeming an Emperour, or chief
Commander to wear; nevertheless we read
that <hi>Caligula</hi> ware oftentimes <hi>Depictas Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulas,
Alex. lib.</hi> 5. Amongst the rest this
is to be observed, That Consuls were habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sometimes in Coat-Armors, called <hi>Palu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenta,</hi>
and sometimes in Kirtles called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beae,</hi>
which was a kind of Garment worn by
Kings under their Mantles of State. So that
they were sometimes said to be <hi>Trabeati,</hi>
and sometimes to be <hi>Paludati,</hi> according to
these several Habits. Also the <hi>Lictores</hi> were
Officers that usually attended these Consuls,
and were like unto Sergeants, or Ministers
appointed to inflict corporal punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Offenders, and were most commonly in
number Twelve. These also attended the
Consul to the wars, invested also with Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>Concerning those <hi>Depictae Penulae</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, they are said to have been
in use with Emperours of later Ages, that
were addicted to wantonness and delicacy,
whereof <hi>Tranquillus</hi> in <hi>Caligula,</hi> writeth in
this manner, <hi>Vestitu, calceatuque &amp; caetero
habitu, neque patrio, neque anili, ac ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rili
quidem, ac denique non humano semper
usus est: saepe depictas gemmatasque Penulas
indutus. Wolf. Lazius in Comment. Reip. lib.</hi>
8. 857. If you observe the proportion of this
Vaire, you shall easily discern the very shape
of the Case or Skin of little Beasts in them;
for so did ancient Governours and Princes of
the World (saith Sir <hi>Iohn. Ferne in Lac.
Nob. pag.</hi> 68.) line their pompous Robes with
Furr of divers Colours, sewing one Skin to
another, after the plainest fashion. There is
yet another kind of Furrs much differing from
all other the Furrs before expressed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in shape, but in name also, as in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This sort of Furr or
Doubling was (as <hi>Leigh</hi>
noteth) of some old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
called Varry Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and Varry Tassa,
which (saith he) is as
much to say, as a Furr
of Cups; but himself
calleth it Meire, for so
he reckoneth it well
Blazoned, very ancient, and a Spanish Coat.
But I hold it better Blazoned, Potent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpotent,
for the resemblance it hath of the
Heads of <hi>Crowches,</hi> which <hi>Chaucer</hi> calleth
Potents, <hi>Quia potentiam tribuunt infirmis,</hi>
as appeareth in his Description of Old Age,
in the <hi>Romant of the Rose.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>So eld she was that she ne went</l>
                  <l>A foot, but it were by potent.</l>
               </q>
               <p>So much of Furrs consisting of two Colours
only: now of such as are composed of more
than two Colours, according to the Division
before delivered.</p>
               <p>Such are these, and
their like, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <list>
                     <item>Ermynites.</item>
                     <item>Vaire of many Colours.</item>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This, at the first
sight, may seem to be
all one with the second
Furr, before in this
Chapter expressed, but
differeth in this, that
herein is added one
hair of Red on each
side of every of these
Powderings. And as
this differeth little in
shape and shew from the second Furr, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Ermyn; so doth it not much differ from
the same in name, that being called Ermyn,
and this Ermynites.</p>
               <p>The other Furr that is composed of more
than two Colours, is formed of four several
Colours at the least, as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55096:15"/>
                  <figure/>
This differeth much
from all the other Furrs,
and (according to
<hi>Leigh</hi>) must be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned
Vaire; this is
composed of four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
colours, <hi>viz.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
Gules, Or, and
Sable. Here I will
note unto you a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule that you must carefully observe,
not only in the blazoning of these Furrs, but
generally of all Coat-Armours, <hi>viz.</hi> that you
describe them so particularly and plainly, as
who so heareth your Blazon, may be able
to trick or express the form and true por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
thereof, together with the manner
of bearing, no less perfectly, than if he had
done it by some pattern thereof laid before
him.</p>
               <p>Although I have here in the Blazon of
this kind of Furr, as also in the Table of
this first Section put a difference between
these three words, Vaire, Verrey, and Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
in ascribing to every one of these a
particular property in the Blazon of Furrs
differing in Metals and Colours; in which I
must confess, I have followed <hi>Leigh;</hi> yet I
do for my own part rather agree with Sir
<hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi> who in the 86. <hi>pag.</hi> of his Book
entituled <hi>Lacy's Nobility,</hi> writeth, <hi>That there
is no other blazon allowed to a Doubling or
Furr of this nature, than only</hi> Vaire, <hi>or vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;</hi>
for which word <hi>variated</hi> I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that our English Blazoners use <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi>
from the French Masculine participle,
<hi>vaire;</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Ferne</hi> there further saith,
<hi>That these differences of terms,</hi> Verrey, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
<hi>and</hi> Vaire, <hi>are meer phantasies of</hi> Leigh
<hi>his Blazon, and newly by him devised, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any authority of Writers to inferr the
same: And that before</hi> Leigh <hi>his time, all
Authors had called this sort of Furr or Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
Vaire: <hi>And if it be varied, or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Argent and Azure, then it is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no Colours named: but if it consist
of any other Colour, then it is blazoned</hi> Vaire,
<hi>of such and such Colours.</hi> And I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in this my present Edition, always
blazon a Furr of this nature, of what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and Colours soever composed, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it consist of two Metals and two
Colours, Vaire or Verrey, always naming
the Metal and Colour, except it consisteth
of Argent and Azure: And thus concluding
the Chapter of Tinctures, being the first kind
of Accidents of Arms, I will now go on to
the second sort.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto handled the first part of
the distribution before delivered touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Accidents, viz. Tincture: I
will now go forward to handle that other
member of the same, namely, Differences;
shewing first what Differences are; and so
proceed in order to the Division of them.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to the definition and
division of them, it is not unnecessary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That Arms may be resembled to Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
numbers, for like as in numbers, the
addition, or subtraction of an unity, maketh
the said number to receive a diverse form
from that it hath before; in like manner by the
apposition to, or exemption of any one thing
from the Coat-Armour, be it either difference,
or whatsoever else, the Coat-Armour is not
the same, but varieth from that it was before.
This variation (occasioned by the addition or
exemption of some adventitious thing) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
altereth not the substance of the
Coat-Armour, but maketh the same to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in form only from that it was before;
for these adventitious Appositions are of the
nature of Accidents, whose property is <hi>Adesse
&amp; abesse sine subjecti corruptione;</hi> as I have
formerly shewn out of <hi>Porphyrius, p.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Differences have no existence of themselves,
but are of the quality of Adjectives, which
need the ayd and support of some substantive,
to be annexed to them, and were devised,
for the distinguishing of Coat-Armour, of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, of one and the same family
each from other among themselves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that saying of <hi>Chass. Differentia sunt
quaedam aceidentia per se non existentia, quae
inducunt diversitatem separativam, per quam
dignoscuntur talia Arma, in quibus sunt inserta,
ab armis alterius.</hi> But I will proceed to the
definition and division of Differences.</p>
               <p>Differences are extraordinary additaments,
whereby Bearers of the same Coat-Armour
are distinguished each from other, and their
nearness to the principal Bearer is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>Of Differences some are <list>
                     <item>Ancient,</item>
                     <item>Modern.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those I call ancient Differences, that
were used in ancient time for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not only of one Nation or Tribe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but also to note a diversity between
particular persons, descended out of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and from the same Parents. Such are
Bordures and Imborduring of all sorts. The
Bordures that were annexed unto Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
in the beginning were plain, and (in
all likelyhood) were of some one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
or Meals before spoken of: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in process of time (by reason of the
multiplication of Persons and of Families)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55096:16"/>
men were constrained to devise other sorts
of Bordures, to induce a variety, whereby
each particular person might be distinctly
known, and differenced <hi>ab omnibus &amp; singulis
ejusdem domus &amp; familiae.</hi> Of these there
are divers forms, as by these examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The first devised Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
were born plain,
after the manner of this,
which is thus blazoned.
He beareth Argent, a
bordure Gules. Here
you shall not need to
mention the plainness
of the bordure; for when
you say a bordure of
this or that colour or metal, and no more,
then it is always understood to be plain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the same be not so expressed. But if it
have any other form than plain, in such case
you must not omit to make express mention of
the fashion thereof.</p>
               <p>The plain Bordure, used for differing of Coat-Armour,
is resembled to those Fimbria's, or
Bordures, that Almighty God, by the mouth
of his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> commanded the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to wear about the skirts of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to put them in mind of their duties
touching their observation of his Precepts;
In respect that the people were yet rude,
and unexercised in obedience, therefore was
this Ordinance prescribed unto them; as St.
<hi>Hierom</hi> noteth in these words: <hi>Rudi adhuc
populo, &amp; hominibus ad obedientiam insuetis,
per Moysen imperatur à Domino: ut in sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
memoriae quod praecepta Domini recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur,
per singulas vestimentorum fimbrias
habeant cum cocco Hyacinthini coloris Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
ut etiam casu huc illucque respicienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
oculis, mandatorum Coelestium memoria
nascatur.</hi> Of these Bordures were the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
reproved by Christ, because they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the use thereof, by wearing them,
not for the putting of them in mind of the
observation of Gods Precepts, but for a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and their own vain ostentation, and to
the end they would seem more strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
observers of Gods Precepts, than others
were.</p>
               <p>The Content of the Bordures (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is the fifth part of the Field. Also it is to be
observed, that when the Field and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or Tract about the same, drawn (as
in this example) be both of one Metal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or Furr, then shall you not term it a
Bordure, but you shall say, that he beareth
such Metal, Colour or Furr imbordured.
<hi>Leigh</hi> reckoneth this sort of imborduring
here spoken of, to be of the number of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Brethren; but <hi>Bartol</hi> (saith he)
hath committed the distribution thereof to the
Heraulds.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the Compound Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
above specified, I will give some few
Examples of other several forms of simple
Bordures; (<hi>Quia simplicia priora fuerunt
compositis</hi>) as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Bordure ingrailed, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
This word <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grailed,</hi>
is derived from
the Latin word <hi>Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dior,</hi>
which signifieth to
enter, or go in: <hi>Quia
ista linea ex qua confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur
Bordura, Campum
plus aequo ingrediatur.</hi>
Or else it is derived of <hi>Gradus,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a step or degree, and thereof it is
called a Bordure ingrailed; <hi>Quia</hi> (as <hi>Vpton</hi>
noteth) <hi>ejus color gradatim infertur in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum
Armorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next sort of Bordure that I will note
unto you, is a Bordure invecked; and the same
is formed as appeareth in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This Bordure is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
meerly contrary to
the last precedent, and
is blazoned in this
manner. He beareth
Or, a Bordure invecked,
Gules. As the former
doth dilate it self by
way of incroaching
into the Field, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
this doth contract it self by inversion
of the points into it self; in regard whereof
(it seemeth) it receiveth his denomination,
and is called Invecked, of the Latin word
<hi>Inveho,</hi> which signifieth, To carry in: <hi>Qv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a
ipsa linea gibbosa, in borduram plus aequo
invehatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This Bordure differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in form from both
the other, and is thus
blazoned; he beareth
Gules, a Bordure indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Argent. Mr. <hi>Wyrly,</hi>
in his Book intituled,
<hi>The true use of Arms,</hi>
treating of the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
life, and languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death of Sir <hi>Iohn de Gralhye, Capitol de
Buz,</hi> and one of the Knights elected at the
first foundation of the Garter, by that victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
make mention of one Sir <hi>Perducas Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth,</hi>
to whom this Coat-Armour did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
appertain, and describeth the same in
this manner.</p>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55096:16"/>Sir <hi>Perducas Dalbreth</hi> to the French return'd,</l>
               <l>Who Guly Shield about his neck did fling,</l>
               <l>Wrapt with dent Bordure silver shining.</l>
               <p>This Bordure is said to be indented, because
it seemeth to be composed (as it were) of
Teeth, whereof the same hath a resemblance
as well in property as in form: For Teeth
(especially those of Beasts of ravenous kind,
or of prey) have that part of their Teeth
next to their Gums, broad and strong, and
their points sharp, after the manner above
specified; and they are called in Latin, <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
a demendo</hi> (as <hi>Isidorus</hi> noteth) which
signifieth to take away or diminish, <hi>Quia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid
de cibis semper demunt.</hi> In the same
manner also do every of these Indentings,
entring into the Field, lessen and take away
some part of them as they go.</p>
               <p>Note that all sorts of Bordures are subject
to charging with things, as well Artificial,
as Natural; as by examples following, in
part shall appear; wherein I purpose not to
be curious, either in their number, or yet in
their order; but as they shall come to
hand, so will I set them down in their proper
places.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Bordures simple. Now of such
as are compounded, as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Bordure counter-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned,
Or, and Gules;
which is as much to
say, as compounded of
these two Colours coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
placed. Note
that Counter-compony
consisteth evermore of
two Tracts only, and no
more. Note further, that the manner of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing
of Coat-Armours by Bordures is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient; but if you respect their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
forms and charge, they are not so.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Bordure purslew, Verrey.
Note here, that this
term Purflew, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the Furrs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
handled, so often
as they are used in Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures.
Therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
you shall find a
Bordure of any of these
several kinds, you must (for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Blazon) express by name of
what sort of Furrs the same is, if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be
a peculiar name appropriate thereunto. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if it be one of those kinds that have
no certain name, whereby it may be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known from the rest; or if it be so, that
the Bordure be composed of some such of the
Furrs, as do comprehend under one name,
divers and distinct Colours, then must you
of necessity particularly name the Colours
whereof every such Bordure is so composed,
except it consisteth of Argent and Azure, as
this doth, and then it sufficeth to call it only
Verrey, as in this Example I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Bordure checkie, Or,
and Azure. Albeit this
hath a near resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Counter-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pony
before handled,
yet it is not the same,
for that never exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two Tracts or Panes,
and this is never less
than of three: Therefore you must take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
heed to the number of the Tracts in
Blazon, else may you easily err in mistaking
the one for the other. And this Rule hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not alone in Bordures, but also in Bends,
Fesses, Barrs, &amp;c. born after those manners.</p>
               <p>

flourished in Martial Prowess in the days of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and went with him
to the Holy War.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find the Bordures
charged with things living, as in these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Argent,
a Bordure Azure, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Enaluron of
Martlets, to the number
of eight, Or. In your
blazoning of Bordures
of this kind of bearing,
you must mention what
sort of Fowl or Bird
your Bordure is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withal; for that this term serveth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for all kinds of Bordures charged with
things of this kind.</p>
               <p>A like Bordure doth <hi>Iasper</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
bear, that was half-brother to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and was created Duke of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55096:17"/>
                  <hi>Bedford,</hi> by that most prudent Prince, King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Bordure Gules, charged
with eight Lioncels pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
Or. Such a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
is set forth for
<hi>Hamlyne Plantagenet,</hi>
that was Base-brother
to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
This term <hi>Enur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
is proper to all Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
charged with any Beasts, whose kinds
must be specially observed, and expressed in
Blazon, for the more certainty thereof.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find two of these sorts
of Bordures before handled, commixt in one,
as in these next Examples following.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Bordure quarterly, as
followeth: The first
Gules, Enurny of three
Lioncels passant gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
Or. The second,
Azure, Verdoy, of as
many Flowers de Lis,
Or. The third as the
second: The fourth as
the first. Such a Bordure did <hi>Henry Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Devon,</hi> and Marquess of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
bear, (who lived in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth) environing the Royal Arms of
<hi>England,</hi> which he received as an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Honour. And this Coat-Armour
may also be thus shortly blazoned, Argent, a
Bordure quarterly <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Bordure, quarterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Purflew, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn, and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compony,
Or and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure.
Such a Bordure
did <hi>Henry Fitz-Roy</hi>
bear, who was Duke of
<hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
as also Earl of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham.</hi>
He was base Son unto King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth. Sometimes you shall find Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
charged with Leaves or Flowers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vegetables, as in Example:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Bordure, Or, charged
with Verdoy of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foils,
slipped to the
number of eight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Note that this term
Verdoy is appropriated
to all Bordures charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Leaves, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Fruits, and other
the like Vegetables<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Wherefore to make your
blazon more certain, it behoveth that you
should expresly mention what kind of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
the Bordure is charged withal.</p>
               <p>Otherwhiles you shall have Bordures charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with other sorts of things <hi>inanimate,</hi> or
without life, as in this next example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Bordure Sable, charged
with Entoyre of eight
Besants. Such a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
did <hi>Richard Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet,</hi>
King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
and Earl of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi>
bear, that was Son
unto King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
Brother to King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Third. Note, that this term Entoyre is
proper to all Bordures charged with dead
things. Therefore you must name what kind
of Entoyre the Bordure is charged with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Roundles, Crescents, Mullets, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulets,
or whatsoever other dead thing. A
Besaunt, or (as some call them) a Talent,
is taken for a Massive Plate or Bullion of
Gold, containing (according to <hi>Leigh</hi>) of <hi>Troy</hi>
weight, 104 l. and 2 Ounces, and is in value
3750 l. sterling, and had for the most part no
similitude or representation upon it (as some
hold) but only fashioned round and smooth,
as if it were fitted and prepared to receive
some kind of stamp. But others are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that they were stamped, and that they
were called Bezants (or rather Bizants) of
<hi>Byzantium,</hi> the place where they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
coyned. Note, that whensoever you
shall find any Bezants or Talents born in
Arms, you shall not need to make mention of
their colour in blazoning of them, because
they be evermore understood to be Gold.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find Bordures gobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
of two Colours, as in this next Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
a Bordure gobonated,
Or and Sable: And
such a bearing is so
termed, because it is
divided in such forts, as
if it were cut into small
Gobbets.</p>
               <p>As this Bordure is gobonated, so shall you
find Bordures, either Bendy, or Bendwaies, or
charged with Bends, as in this next Escocheon
in part may appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55096:17"/>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Bordure Sable, charged
with three Bends, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. I give it this
blazon in respect that
the Sable doth surmount
the Argent, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(as it were) in
stead of a Field: but if
they both were of even
pieces, then should I have termed it a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Bendee, or Bend-ways, of so many pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Argent and Sable, or Sable and Argent, as
it should happen.</p>
               <p>There resteth yet one Example more of
Bordurings, which I have here placed, to
the end the same may serve in stead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular demonstrations, otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the full understanding of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
several sorts of Diapering that may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Bordures, as in Example;</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Bordure Gules, diaper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Entoyre, Enurny,
Enaluron, Verdoy, &amp;c.
Note, that you may
have Diaper of any
two, three, or more
of these, or any other
their like, in one Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bordures, but also Fields of Coat-Armours,
are found diapered. That Field or Bordure is
properly said to be diapered, which being
fretted all over, hath something quick or dead,
appearing within the Frets. And albeit things
having life and sense, or their parts, may be
born diapered: Yet Plants, Fruits, Leaves,
Flowers, and other Vegetables, are (in the
Opinion of some Armorists) judged to be
more fit for such kind of bearing.</p>
               <p>This kind of bearing Diaper in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is sometimes seen in Coats of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Belgia,</hi> but very rare or never in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> noteth. <hi>Diaper</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is known of every man to be a
fantastical work of knots, within which are
wrought the signs or forms of things, either
quick or dead, according to the invention of
the Work-master, as is well known in</hi> Ipres,
Bruges, <hi>and some Cities of</hi> Heynault. In the
blazon of such Coats you must first name the
Colour or Metal of the Field.</p>
               <p>As touching their first several Charges impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon these Bordures aforehandled, I should
not (I acknowledge) have made mention of
them at all in this place (the order of my
Method respected) <hi>sed propter necessitatem
nonnunquam recedendum est à regulis.</hi> But
the occasion offered to treat of the differences
of Bordures in this place, enforced me to make
untimely mention of those Charges, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
I might yield some satisfaction to the
Reader touching these variable forms, which
I could no way better perform than by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
Examples: <hi>Exempla enim ponimus, ut
sentiant addiscentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, that I take here only
mentioned a Bordure and Imborduring, for
ancient Differences, yet I do not thereupon
conclude, that Antiquity was not acquainted
with any other than these: but the Reason,
that I do not particularly here discourse at
large of those other ancient Differences, is,
because the use of divers of them now, as
Differences, is antiquated; and some of them
are now used, as Ordinaries, or some other
Charge of the Field, which I shall afterward
handle, but not here, because it sutes not
with my intended Method; others of those
ancient ones are still in use, as Differences, but
to demonstrate some other younger Brother
than anciently they did, and therefore now
termed modern, by changing of their first
use. Let it therefore suffice only to name
some of those first sort here mentioned, as
Orles, Cotizes, Bends, &amp;c. Which how they
then were disposed of, in the Terminal, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,
and Fixal Coat-Armours, I refer you
to Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> and others, who have writ
plentifully of them. In those elder times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
the variation of Metal or Colour, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Charge, yea, sometime change
of the Charge, or of part of the Charge, were
used for distinctions of Families, as you may
observe in divers Authors, and in the Coat-Armours
of younger branches of many ancient
Families.</p>

               <p>HItherto of the ancient manner of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing
Coat-Armours: Next, such as
we call modern Differences, come in
order to be handled. I call those modern
Differences that are of a latter institution, and
put in use sithence the invention of Bordures.
Such are these that follow, and their like,
viz. the File, Crescent, Mullet, Martlet, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulet,
Flower de lis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What these Files are, I cannot certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, because I find that divers Authors,
and those very Judicial in matters of this
kind, do diversly judge of them, according to
their several conceits. <hi>Vpton,</hi> a man much
commended for his skill in blazon, and of
some Armorists supposed to have been the
first that made observation of their use (but
they are therein much deceived, for that
such use was made of them many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Vptons</hi> time) calleth them Points, such
as men usually fasten their Garments withal,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55096:18"/>
and saith, they may be born either even or
odd, to the number of Nine. <hi>Budaeus,</hi> an
ancient Writer, affirmeth them to be Tongs,
and that they may be born but odd. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatus</hi>
in his <hi>Parergon</hi> nameth them Plaitez
or Plaits of Garments. <hi>Bartolus</hi> calleth them
Candles. Some other <hi>Authors</hi> call them Files,
and others Lambeaux or Labels. In this so
great uncertainty, I forbear to determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, seeing those so Learned cannot
certainly resolve among themselves what they
are. Only concerning their divers manner
of bearing, these Examples following will
give light: wherein I will begin with their
single bearing, and so I will proceed to their
Compound use.</p>

a File, with one Label,
Gules. This form of
bearing is found in the
Chappel of the Castle
of <hi>Camphire,</hi> alias <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir,</hi>
in <hi>Zealand.</hi> Such
is the dignity of the
File, as that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds
in their sound
discretion, have caused many poor decayed
Gentlemen, and Persons newly risen, to lay
aside the bearing thereof, because of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the same, being such, as the Son of
an Emperor cannot bear a difference of
higher esteem, during the Life of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpton</hi> saith, that Files are not born for
Arms, but for differences of Arms: <hi>Tales
lingulae sive labellae</hi> (saith he) <hi>non dicuntur
proprie signa, sed differentiae signorum.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
in practise it falls out otherwise,
as in this Coat here expressed, and others
following may be seen. For we find that
Labels are born both single and manifold,
without any other manner of Charge; so
that it is clear that they are born sometimes
for Arms, and not always for differences of
Arms, as by the second Escocheon following
more plainly appeareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
File of three Lambeaux,
Argent. <hi>This</hi> (saith
<hi>Leigh</hi>) <hi>is the first of the
nine Differences of
Brethren, and serveth
for the Heir or eldest
Son, the Father living.
Honorius</hi> saith, That
one of the Labels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth
his Father, the other his Mother, and
the middlemost signifieth himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a File of five points, or
Lambeaux, Azure. This
seemeth to me a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Coat of it self, for
I find the same ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set up in a Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>window
in the Church
of <hi>Estington</hi> in the
County of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
and is born by the name of <hi>Henlington.</hi>
Whence may appear that this File is born as
a Charge sometimes, and not for a difference
of Coat-Armour always. The File of five
Lambeaux, saith <hi>Leigh,</hi> is the Difference of
the Heir whilst the Grandfather liveth; but
his Grandfather being deceased, then he leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this, and taketh that of three, which was
his Fathers difference. But herein his Rule
faileth; for that they have been anciently
born with five points for the difference of
the eldest Son, in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the First, as appeareth by divers Seals, and
other good authentick proofs of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Note, That as the Bordures before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
so also these Files are oftentimes
charged with things, as well quick as dead,
whereof I will give you some few Examples in
these next Escocheons.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent, a
File of three Lambeaux,
Azure, each charged
with as many Flowers
de lis, Or. Such a File
did <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,
Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> bear,
(over the Arms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>)
who was Son to
<hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
whose Father was <hi>Edmund,</hi> surnamed
<hi>Crookback,</hi> that was first Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi>
and Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
File of three Lambeaux,
Argent, each charged
on the dexter side of
the foot thereof with
a Canton, Gules. A
like File did <hi>Lionel
Plantagenet</hi> bear (who
was third Son unto
King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third) over the Arms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
saving that those Cantons were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the highest part of his Labels afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Label of the Heir apparent</hi> (saith
<hi>Wyrly</hi>) <hi>is seldom transferred unto the second
Brother, but when the Inheritance goeth to
the Daughters of the eldest Brother.</hi> In
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55096:18"/>
which case, it was permitted unto him, to
bear the File as Heir-male of his Family,
and as one that remained in expectancy of
the Inheritance, if the Issue of his Neeces
should fail. Note, that the second Brother
might not intrude himself into the absolute
Signs of his Family, the Inheritance being
in his Neeces or Kinswomen. <hi>Hugh de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi>
being a second Brother, and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
did bear a Label for their difference up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like occasion, and for the reasons here
mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Vert, a
File of three points
parted perpale, Gules
and Argent, on the
first six Towers, Or;
and the second as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lionceaux rampant,
Purpure. Such a File
was born by <hi>Edward
Plantagenet,</hi> Son and
Heir to <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langly,</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
which <hi>Edward</hi> lived in the time of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, by whom he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Duke of <hi>Aubemerle,</hi> and was slain in the
Battel of <hi>Agincourt</hi> in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a File of three Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux,
Gules, each
charged with as many
Towers, Or. Such a
File did <hi>Robert d' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tois</hi>
bear, who guided
K. <hi>Edward</hi> the Third
in all his wars against
the French. This <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
was a Frenchman, and was thought to
have been the first that moved King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third to make his challenge to the
Crown of <hi>France.</hi> Many more Examples
might be given of the divers manners of
bearing and charging of Files, but these here
expressed may suffice to inform the Reader
that they are no less subject to Charges than
the Bordures before expressed: as also to
move him to take a more strict observation of
them, as they shall come to hand.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as it hath been anciently que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
(and for ought that I could ever see,
resteth as yet undecided) by <hi>Bartholus, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi>
and other Judicious persons of their
times, Whether Files or Labels should be born
with even points, or odd? some holding that
they could not be born but odd, others
maintaining they might be used indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as well even as odd. In my former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
I followed the stronger Opinion, and
in all the precedent Examples have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
patterns of unequal points. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
not so resting satisfied, I have sithence
endeavoured to examine their use (the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Interpreter of things doubtful) to which
end I took occasion to peruse certain Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanean
notes of Seals, which I had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
long ago: by which Seales it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they had been anciently used to be born
as well even as odd; whereupon (out of my
desire to clear all doubts, and to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing as perspicuous and manifold as I
could) I resolved to cut such Seals as came
to my hands, for the better approbation of
this my assertion, and content of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and withal to set them down according to
order of even bearing, <hi>viz.</hi> two, four, six, &amp;c.
before I would conclude this Chapter of Files.

He beareth Argent,
two Cheverous, Gules,
on a quarter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
a File of four
points of the first. This
Coat was, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
taken out of an
old Mass-book at <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
in the County of
<hi>Chester,</hi> wherein they
were found, fair limmed, many years ago;
as appeareth by a Book of Visitation of that
Shire, remaining in my own hands extant to
be seen: which Visitation was made by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Flower,</hi> alias <hi>Norroy,</hi> King of Arms of
the North part beyond the River of <hi>Trent,</hi>
who was associated and accompanied therein
with <hi>Robert Glover, Somerset</hi> Herauld, his

               <p>This Coat might have been more aptly
placed hereafter in the second Section, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Ordinaries of divers kinds, born one
upon another; but that I desire to place all
my Labels of even points together without
interruption, though I digressed somewhat
therein by giving way to necessity, albeit
with breach of Rule and Order; <hi>Nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

receditur à Regulis.</hi> This form of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55096:19"/>
bearing of Files with four points, is also
warranted by Rolls of great Antiquity; as
appeareth by the Coat of Sir <hi>Thomas Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi>
that bare Azure, six Lionceaux Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
Or, a File of four points, Gules, which
I do here pass over, as well for brevity,
as for impertinency thereof to this place, in
respect of the Lions, the principal charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Note here a strange bearing of a File.</p>

               <p>This Example serveth to confirm my form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
assertion, That Files are not only born
for differences, but sometimes for the only
charge of the Coat-Armour, as appeareth by
the Coat of <hi>Henlington,</hi> whereof I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Example elsewhere: And herein we may
observe a rare form of position thereof in bend
Sinister.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
I have also seen a
like File of three points
born dexterways in Bend
for the only Charge of
the Field, as in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scocheon,
which may
receive this blazon, He
beareth Argent, a File
of three points in bend,
Sable. This Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

               </p>
               <p>For the shunning of multiplicity of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
I will give an instance of a Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
comprehending both sorts of Files, <hi>viz.</hi>
even and odd points, which for that it is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and unmixt with any ordinary or common
Charge, may serve in stead of all: As in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Or, three
Files born bar-wayes,
Gules; the first having
five points, the second
four, the last triple
pointed: Here I am
constrained to say Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pointed, lest by the
iteration of the word
Three, I should break
the Rule given, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. This is, as I take it,
a Dutch Coat, born by the name of <hi>Laskirke,
quasi lis Ecclesiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if any man will demand of me, why
I do spend my oyl and travel in things of
so small moment? To such I answer, that so
long as I travel to find out the truth, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
my travel well bestowed, though the
matter be of never so small importance,
<hi>Suave enim est in minimis etiam vera scire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another form of bearing of
Files, diverse from these before mentioned,
which albeit the same be not in use with us,
but seemeth to be a National Custome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> Nevertheless,
sithence I have undertaken to treat amongst
things of the use of blazoning of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I would not willingly omit any form of
bearing, or other remarkable thing, that
might make either my self or the Reader
more expert in the use of Blazon. This form
of bearing Files, which I will now shew you,
is not distant some little space from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Chief (after the most usual fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
but groweth immediately out of the
Chief it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Azure,
a File issuing out of the
Chief, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission
at all, and is
thus blazoned in <hi>French,
Il port d' Azure, un file
de Gules, movant du
Chief.</hi> These Armori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
differences are in
<hi>France</hi> observed upon
the Robes of Honourable persons issued out
of Princely Families amongst themselves;
such Robes (I mean) as are given them,
either at the Marriages or Funerals of Kings
and Queens. As for Example; It hath been
noted that the Lambeaux, Gules, upon the
Mantles of <hi>Orleance,</hi> have been adorned with
<hi>Flowers de lis.</hi> The Lambeaux of <hi>Artois</hi>
with Castles, Or. Those of <hi>Anjou</hi> moving
out of the Chief, only Gules.</p>
               <p>In like sort divers other Noble Houses of
<hi>France, viz.</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> of <hi>Berry,</hi> and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencon,</hi>
have Bordures either plain or engrail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or charged with Besants, those of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux</hi>
Bastons, Or, and Argent, and they of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> Bastons, Gules.</p>
               <p>Here may rise a Question not unworthy our
observation, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether like as the eldest
Brother is preferred before the second, so
the Son of the Eldest Brother shall in like
sort be preferred, or take place before his
Uncle? And this hath been holden a great
and difficult Question a long season; until at
length, <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Trevere</hi> with his Barons, this matter
was there questioned, he ordained that the
cause should be decided by Combat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Nephew hardly obtained the Victory;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55096:19"/>
because it was deemed to have proceeded by
the secret Judgment of God, it was decreed
that from thenceforth the Nephew should be
preferred before the Uncle. Of this mind
are <hi>Nich. Boerius, Lucas de Penna,</hi> and <hi>Iohn
de Montolero,</hi> that the Nephew should take
place.</p>
               <p>The like Question hath risen in <hi>France</hi>
between the Second Daughter, and the Son
of the Eldest Sister, as well in <hi>Avignon,</hi> a
City of <hi>Narbone</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as in other parts
thereof, which remained long undetermined.
At length it was finally adjudged in the Court
of Parliament (holden at <hi>Paris</hi>) for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,
for whom also it was likewise decreed
in the City of <hi>Avignon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man shall demand of me, How it
cometh to pass that the Diminutions or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Arms beforementioned, are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
born, not only in forraign Countries,
but also in one self Nation? Or why there
is not one set form observed in the use of
them with all Nations? I answer, That it is
not possible, because of the infinite actions of
men, which are no less infinitely subject to
mutability, and therefore can by no means
be reduced to a Set-form of bearing universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to that saying of an uncertain
Author, <hi>Res sunt infinitae, infiniteque muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,
idcircò praecepto generali comprehendi
non possunt.</hi>

                  </gap>rences beforementioned,
other sorts of Modern Differences were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
for the distinguishing of Brethren and
Persons issued out of one Family, which for
the reach they extend unto, do more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
express, (and as it were) point out
with the finger, how far their several bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are distant in degree from their Original
Ancestors; as also, how each of them stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Degree one to another among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as by the Examples ensuing may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

add three other, to make up the number of

<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been evermore one Observation
with Nations in bearing of Arms, that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular Family (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>)
did bear Arms, different in substance from
those of other Families, so those that are
descended of the self same Bloud, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bear the Arms of that House and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
whereof they are descended, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner each from other (not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but in Accidents) for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Line of Agnation. And the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of these Differences, albeit they seem
to make some alteration in the Coat-Armours
whereunto they are annexed, yet is the same
but meerly Accidental, the Substance still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
as it was before; the Nature of these
Appositions being such as is of all other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
<hi>Vt possint abesse, &amp; adesse sine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti
interitu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these Differences annexed to Coat-Armours
are of some Authors termed (and
that not improperly) <hi>Diminutiones Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
in respect they do derogate from the
Dignity of the Arms whereto they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as expresly manifesting them to be of
less esteem than those from which they are
derived: <hi>Multiplicitas enim individuorum,
in eadem specie diminutionem arguit.</hi> But
doubtless, the conceit of Apposition of these
Differences to Coat-Armours was grounded
upon the necessity (the common Parent of
all Inventions) as well that thereby all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
bearing of Arms might be avoided; as
also that the Prerogative of the Eldest Son
should be preserved inviolable. And for this
cause hath the Eldest of every Noble and
Generous Family, his peculiar manner of sole
and plain bearing, which he will in no case
permit any other man to use, though he be
of the same Family and Surname, but with
addition of some kind of Difference, because
the sole bearing of Arms pertaineth only to
the first begotten: <hi>In primogenito enim</hi> (saith
<hi>Lyra) tanquam in capite stat, &amp; remanet splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
geniturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the Dignity of the Firstbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<hi>Tremellius</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon
the 49th of <hi>Genesis,</hi> maketh mention of two
chief Prerogatives due unto <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ben,</hi> had he
not defiled his Fathers Bed; the one of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
whereby he had his Brethren in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto him; the other of Strength, by
reason of his double portion of Inheritance.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chassanaeus</hi> saith, <hi>Ea quae acquiruntur
Primogenito, acquiruntur titulo universali,
item acquiruntur ut constituto in dignitate.</hi>
For these respects the Arms of the Family
ought to remain entire to the Eldest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the second, third, and fourth begotten
Sons cannot arrogate to themselves any such
Prerogative, and therefore may not bear their
Coat but with Difference.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, these Differences here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, are of some Authors called <hi>Doctrinae
Armorum;</hi> and that very aptly, in regard
that by the apposition of them to Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
our understanding (upon sight of them)
is informed from what Line of Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Bearer of such Difference doth abstract
himself, whether from the Line Ascending,
Descending, or Collateral; as also in what
Degree he standeth; as, whether he be the
second, third, or fourth begotten Child of such
a Parent. And such apposition in no less
lawful, than is the addition of Names of
Baptisme unto the Surname of the Family:
<hi>Sicut enim nomina inventa sunt ad cognoscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos
homines, ita arma vel insignia ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milias
&amp; personas distinguendas singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet a further use of these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
in that they serve to prevent and
avoid Dissentions, Debates, Challenges, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
and Slaughters. For as to all Brethren
there is but one Surname allowed; yet for
Difference, that one of them may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from another, there is added unto
each Brother a <hi>Praenomen,</hi> or Name of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
so is it necessary, that since the Coat-Armour
of the Ancestor is competible to all
the Children (as the Mark of the Family
whereof they are descended, that a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
should be added to the Coat-Armour
of every Brother, to mark and limit out to
all mens sight the diversity of their Birth
and Line whereupon they depend, that so
all occasion of Challenge may be prevented,
when each man knoweth not only his place
of precedence, but also his nearness and place
of title to the Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly, among the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Bordures, used demonstrations of
Differences in the Blood Royal, of some of
the younger Sons of Kings, I hold it fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude this Tract of Differences, to
give a little touch of the necessity why these
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55096:20"/>
should be more eminent than those of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
use, with Persons of inferiour Estate.
First, in regard that if the Coat-Armour of
others should have too near a conformity
and resemblance with the Soveraign Ensigns,
the Vulgar sort perhaps might (in some cases
or pretences) be seduced to follow such a one
as were not their King, to the great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the State, and no less peril to the
Person of their lawful Soveraign. And not
only is it so in Coats pertaining to the Blood
Royal, but also in other inferiour Callings:
For in ancient time (saith <hi>Wyrly</hi>) when men
could not sufficiently distinguish their Coat-Armours
by changing their Devices into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Colours, for the Number of Leaders,
that many times were of one House or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
then were they forced to very their
Marks by the said Additions. And very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should you see in those times, Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
Mollets, of such small things born for
a Difference: or if any such were, they were
made so large; that they might easily be
discerned by the distance of forty foot. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
the Soveraign Estate and Dignity
being compared with the quality of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Difference will be found so great
between them, and the one so far surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other of them, as that Reason it self
willeth that so great a Difference should be
put between the Royal Ensigns and the Arms
of a Subject, as there is between their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Degrees, since those Ensigns are
the Marks of their worthiness and esteem.</p>
               <p>For these and other respects, it hath been,
and yet still is in use, that in Addition of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to the Arms of Kings younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the skilful Heralds have given some of
the Honourable Ordinaries, for more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Distinctions, as a Fess, Chief, Bend,
Pile, Bordure, and such like, as we may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
see in divers ancient Coats born by
such Noble Personages as have descended
from the Collateral Lines of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning those Modern Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expressed in the form of Six Ranks, <hi>p. 25.
viz.</hi> Crescents, Mollets, Martlets, &amp;c. not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their institution was ingenious,
yet hath tract of time discovered their use
to be dangerous, especially in Martial Affairs,
by reason of their darkness and unapparent
forms, occasioned by imposition of one Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
upon another; the peril whereof hath
not a little extenuated their estimation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
their invention is not therefore to
be condemned, inasmuch as the Events have
not fallen out answerable to the intention of
their first Deviser: Neither can it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justly said to be done without ground
of Reason, as a certain Author noteth: <hi>Si fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Here it is to be observed, that Differences
do in no ways appertain unto Sisters, for
that they are reputed to be separated and
divided from the Family whereof they are
descended, inasmuch as when they are once
married, they do lose their own Surname,
and do receive their denomination from the
Family whereof their Husbands are descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And so much doth the word <hi>Soror</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
unto us, as <hi>Sosinus</hi> saith: <hi>Soror est quasi
seorsim nata, &amp; à familia separata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Daughters it is permitted to bear the
Arms of their Father, even as the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth after his Fathers decease, without
any scandal or challenge of their Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for that to Daughters never were any
Differences allowed, and that for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
First, Because their Coats are never, or
very seldom advanced in the Field, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as to that Sex War is reputed odious.
Secondly, For that the Coat-Armour is no
longer born by them than during their life,
for the same extendeth not to their Issue.
Lastly, Because so long as Issue continueth
of any of the Brethrens Lines, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from the Inheritance. Yet in some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ases they shall bear the Coat-Armour to
them and their Heirs; as in Example, If all
the Issue of the Brethren happen to become
extinct, then the Daughters shall Inherit the
Land of their Ancestor? In which case, they
may therewithal assume his Coat-Armour,
and bear the same by themselves and their
Heirs for ever. But betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>es of Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
the Reason whereof is, for that since
by them the Name of the House cannot be
preserved; therefore they are admitted to
the Inheritance equally: and are adjudged
but one Heir to all intents and purposes,
in Laws as well Martial as Civil, without
any eminent Prerogative either of Honour
or Possession, betwixt Elder and Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

               <p>An Escocheon is the form or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Shield of what kind soever, and is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55096:21"/>
so called of the Latin word <hi>Scutum;</hi> which
hath the same signification: whence also an
Esquire, or Page, takes his name of <hi>Scutiger,</hi>
signifying primarily a Target-bearer. And
the Target is not unaptly deduced from the
Latin word <hi>Tergus,</hi> a Beasts hide, whereof at
first Shields were made: whereupon <hi>Pliny</hi>
saith, <hi>Tergus ad scuta galeasque impeuetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
An impenetrable hide fit to make a Shield.
And the Poet <hi>Statius,</hi>

Shields, I will not here speak; every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
almost having their divers makings:

and the greatest amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

who being to pass a River, used his
Shield for his Boat, and his Spear for his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

held more dishonourable for a man to
lose his Buckler than his Sword in Field, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is more praise-worthy to defend a
Friend than to hurt a Foe, as a Noble Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

               <p>Points are certain places in an Escocheon

               <p>The Middle Points are those that have
their location in, or near to the Center of the
Escocheon.</p>
               <p>Such are these, <hi>viz.</hi> the <list>

                     <item>Nombril</item>
                  </list> Points.</p>
               <p>The Fess Point is the exact Center of the
Escocheon. The Honour Point is the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the same in a direct Line. The Nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bril
is next underneath the Fess Point, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
in a like distance from the Fess Point,
as <hi>Gerard Leigh</hi> hath set them down.</p>
               <p>Remote Points are those that have their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
naturally in places further distant from
the Center of the Escocheon.</p>

               <p>The Superior Remote Points are those that

               </p>
               <p>The Superior Middle Point doth occupy
the precise midst of the Chief, between the
two Extremes. The two Superior extreme
Points do possess the corners of the chief part
of the Escocheon.</p>

               <p>The Superior Dexter Point hath his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
near unto the right corner of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
in the Chief thereof. The Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Sinister Point is placed near the left An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of the Chief, in opposition to the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chief; whereunto, as also to the Middle
Chief Point, it answereth in a direct Line.</p>
               <p>The Inferior Points do occupy the Base of
the Escocheon, and thereof have their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and are called Inferior, because
they are seated in the lower parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Of these also there are both

               </p>
               <p>Note, that each of these do answer in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
unto the several Superior Chief Points
above mentioned, in a direct Line, insomuch
as by them the Location of these might be
easily conceived without any further Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, <hi>Quia posito uno contrariorum, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur
&amp; alterum.</hi> Nevertheless, because those
things that are delivered dividedly, are best
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55096:21"/>
conceived and understood, I will particularize
these as I have done the former, beginning
with the Middle Point.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Middle Base Point doth occupy the
exact midst of the Base of the Escocheon,
and answereth perpendicularly to the Middle
Superior and Inferior Points. And in like
sort do both the Inferior Base Extremes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in an Equi-distant
proportion to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes
of the Superior
Points placed in the
corner of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That Extreme
Base Point on the right
hand is named the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Base Point; and that
on the left hand is the
Sinister Base. And for the better explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that which hath been here delivered
touching the Points of an Escocheon, I have
here (because Examples add light) expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the same by manifest Demonstrations,
placing several Letters upon every of the said
Points, according to the Description before-mentioned.
As there is a preheminence in
the priority of nomination of things, so is
there also in their local distribution: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must have respect unto the Points
of an Escocheon, for therein also consisteth
a Dignity, inasmuch as one Point or Place
of the Escocheon, is more worthy than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
whereunto you must have regard in
Blazoning, <hi>Quia à dignioribus semper est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendum.</hi>
What those Points of an Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
are, appeareth in the last precedent
Escocheon, and here made more manifest, as
in Example.

               <p>The knowledge of these Points is very
requisite, in respect, that when divers of
these Points are occupied with sundry things
of different kinds (as oftentimes it falleth
out in some Escocheons) you may be able

               <p>An Abatement is an accidental Mark an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to Coat-Armour, denoting some ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like,
dishonourable, or disloyal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
quality, or stain in the Bearer,
whereby the Dignity of the Coat-Armour is
greatly abased.</p>
               <p>Abatements do consist in <list>
                     <item>Diminution.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Diminution is a blemishing or defacing of
some particular Point or Points of the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
by reason of the imposition of some
stain and Colour thereupon. Note, that all
these Marks of Diminution, in the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
next following, must be evermore of
some one of the stainand Colours, viz. Taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Murrey, and must in no wise be of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
neither must they be charged in any
case, for so should they be Additions of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

other Abatement that
occupieth the middle

that discourteously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
either Maid or

this sort, until such time as he have done
some valiant exploit, worthy to be noted by

former Bearing; which admission must be done
in no less private Assembly than in the Muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Such <hi>Diminutions</hi> as do occupy more than

He beareth Or, a
Point in Point, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine.
Herein you may
see in part how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
it is to know the
Points of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before expressed. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as this one
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
compriseth
these four Points, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Honour, together with the Dexter and
Sinister, and the exact base Points. For it
is very manifest, that the one of these Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
hath his beginning from the Dexter,
and the other from the sinister base Points,
and do meet in an acute Angle in the Honour
point, answering perpendicularly to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
base point. In former Ages this Vice was
chastised by another kind of punishment,
saith <hi>Chassanaus, Quando Miles se male ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit
in bello potest Iudex scutum suum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forari
facere, ut hoc exemplo alii Milites
in praelio sint fortiores:</hi> If a Souldier demean
himself not well in fight, the Judge Martial
may cause his Escocheon to be pierced, to
teach other by this Chastisement, to be more
valorous. But contrariwise, it is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for a man of Arms to have blows ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his Buckler, given by his Foes; as
is memorable in our ancient Country-man
<hi>Scaeva</hi> (the principal man who taught <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caesar</hi> the way to conquer <hi>Britain</hi>)
whose Valour <hi>Caesar</hi> hath eternized with this
acknowledgment, that it was he alone who
saved the Fortification against <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Dyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachium,</hi>
where <hi>Caesar</hi> perused his Buckler,
and found Two hundred and thirty holes
pierced in it. And therefore because the
Dastard dares not come so near the Enemy
to bear his strokes on his Shield, he must
be content to take this piercing of some of his
own side in Arms.</p>
               <p>Those Diminutions that do comprehend
fewer than four.</p>
               <p>Are either of
 <list>

               </p>
               <p>Such are said to comprehend three Points,
whose Lines do bound so many within their
Limits, as in Example.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55096:22"/>He beareth Or, Point Champain,
Tenn. This
is the first of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions,
that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
three Points,
and is formed of one
Arch-line, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his beginning
from the Dexter Base
(and including the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost)
and endeth in the Sinister Base
Point. This is due unto him that killeth his
Prisoner (humbly submitting himself) with
his own hands, though in extreme need it
is allowed by the Law of Arms, rather to
kill, than to hazzard himself to be slain.
<hi>Always</hi> (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Froysard</hi>) <hi>by right of
Arms a man ought to grieve his Enemy,
and good company of Arms is mercy to Knights
and Souldiers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
plain Point, Sanguine.
This Abatement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the same
Points that the last
precedent doth, but
differeth from the same
herein, that the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is framed of an Arch-Line,
and this of a
Right-line. This Abatement is due to him
that telleth Lies, or other false Tales, to his
Soveraign. For if light ears incline to light
lips, harm ensueth; and War is then easily
begun, but hardly allayd again, when mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report
and light credence meet together.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Goar Sinister, Tenn.
This Abatement consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
of two Arch-lines
drawn from the Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Chief, and bottom
of the Escocheon, and
meeting in a sharp An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
in the Fess Point.
This is the third and
last of the Abatements, that occupieth three
Points of the Escocheon, and is due to him
that is a Coward to his Enemy. For we
must conceive that Goars, and likewise Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
are things in use among Women, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Semsters, and therefore are fit notes of
Cowards and Womanish Dispositions. But as
for the Dexter Goar, we must otherwise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of it; for (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) though it be
of Stainand Colour, yet it is exempted out of
the number of Abatements, and it is a good
Coat for a Gentlewoman; many of which Sex
are so far from the stain of Cowardize, as they
will not turn their Backs to men of greatest
Valour; but like the Valiant <hi>Penthesilea,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Audetque viris concurrere virgo,</l>
                     <l>The Damosel fair dares meet the stoutest man;</l>
                  </q>
saith <hi>Virgil 1. Aencid.</hi> But if there be both
Dexter and Sinister (saith he) it is too bad
to be born, for although it be charged, yet
doth it dishonour the thing that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>That Abatement that comprehendeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two Points of the Escocheon, is called a
Gusset, and is formed of a Traverse Line,
drawn either from the Dexter or Sinister
Chief Point of the Escocheon tending to the
Honour Point, and descending from thence
perpendicularly to the extream base parts of
the Escocheon; as in this next Example ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
wherein are expressed both the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Sinister Goars.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
two Gussets, Sanguine.
In Abating (saith
<hi>Leigh</hi>) there is but
one Gusset: and he that
is too much devoted to
the Smock, shall wear
the Gusset on the right
side; but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Idolatry to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
the Gusset on the left side, shall be
his Reward. If he be faulty in both, then
he shall bear both, as in the Escocheon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Such a Coat as this I find born by the
Name of <hi>Coningham,</hi> saving that the Field is
Sable, and the Gussets Argent, and therefore
not to be taken to be of this kind, according
to the Rule touching the Delf.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of such Abatements as do abase
the estimation of the Coat-Armour whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are annexed, in some parts or points
of them only, being the first sort of Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereof we promised to speak.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the last and worst of all the
rest, which is a Coat-Armour reversed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
is a preposterous manner of location
of a Coat-Armour, by turning of the whole
Escocheon upside down, contrary to the usual
form of bearing, after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth light
Blew, four Mollets, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
two in the Fess,
and as many in the
Chief. This Form of
bearing is peculiar to a
Traytor, such a one
(saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) was he
that owned these Arms,
whose name was Sir
<hi>Armery</hi> of <hi>Pavy,</hi> a <hi>Lombard</hi> born, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Captain of <hi>Calais,</hi> and Traytor to King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in selling the same to Sir
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55096:23"/>
                  <hi>Geffrey Charney</hi> for 20000 Crowns. To this
kind of bearing is this form of Blazon (begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the Base first) peculiar, and to no
other, in respect that as this Escocheon stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the Base Point is the highest part thereof.
By this inglorious subversion of the Escocheon
the Dignity thereof is not blemished only in
some points, as the former, but is essentially
annihilated in the whole. In all other Crimes,
though Capital, the Punishment transcendeth
not the person of the Offender, <hi>Quia nullum
delictum patris innocenti filio poena est</hi> (saith
<hi>Chassanaeus) the Innocent Son shall not bear the
punishment of the Fathers Offence.</hi> But in this
which we call <hi>Crimen Laesae Majestatis,</hi> or High
Treason (being an Offence so horrible and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
before God and Man) it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for herein, as well the Children of the
Offenders, as the Traytors themselves, shall
participate of the heavy. Vengeance due to so
great an Impiety, although not in that deep
measure that the Father doth; and that by the
imitation of the Divine Justice; that so men
might be deterred, not only from the actual
committing, but also from the Confederation
and Concealment of an offence so highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
God, and abhorring Nature. For when
a Fact is committed or intended against the
Person of him that swayeth the Soveraign
State (wherein he representeth the Image of
the Divine Government) it is not so much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
against the person of the Prince, as it is
against the Majesty of the Eternal God, whose
Image he beareth. And the welfare of the
Subjects depending on the safety of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
the danger intended to the one, hath in
it a guilt of endamaging the lives of Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>As touching persons convicted of High
Treason in the Justice of the Law of Arms,
for the further coercion of so heinous a Fact as
Treason is, and for a further punishment both
of the Traytor and of his whole Progeny; it
is to be observed, that if a Gentleman of Coat-Armour
hath Issue divers Sons, and committeth
Treason, he hath forfeited his Coat-Armour
for ever, neither may his Issue bear the same,
<hi>Quia eorum memoria destrui debet:</hi> For that
the memory of them may utterly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
For since it is held they may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
killed, seeing they are said to be Enemies
to the King and People, much more is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to prohibit to their Heirs, together with
the Inheritance. their Arms also, and stile of
Gentry: Insomuch, as some are of Opinion,
that the Son loseth <hi>Iura Sepulchrorum,</hi> the
Rights and Ceremonies of Burial accustomed
to Gentry. And of <hi>Marcus Manlius</hi> (who
was condemned of Treason against the <hi>Roman</hi>
State) we find a Law that none should ever
bear that name. A notable Example whereof
we saw of late on the Instrument of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish
Parricide on the late puissant King of
<hi>France,</hi> for the obliterating of the Name and
Memory of such a Villain out of that Kingdom.
And in <hi>Ireland,</hi> such Traytors as are convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Acts and Ordinances of the High
Court of Parliament, are by force thereof ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to suffer damage in their Name, State,
Preheminence, Dignities and Honour to them
due in fore-passed times. As in all their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Lordships, Castles, Mannors, and in all
their Hereditaments whatsoever: Moreover,
that they shall sustain corruption of their Blood
and Family, and both himself and his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are (by force of such Conviction and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
disabled to demand, receive or recover of
any man by descent from any of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
either Lineal, or Collateral; neither are
the Children of persons so convicted, permitted
to make their Pedegree, or to derive themselves
from such Parents.</p>
               <p>Finally, if such an one were invested with
any honourable Dignity, the Laws adjudge
not only his Coat-Armour to be razed, and his
Shield reversed, but also his Spear truncked,
his Spurrs hewen from his Heels, his Horse
docked, his Sword to be broken upon his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
his Crest divided, his Statues pulled down,
his Blood corrupted, and his Body to death (<hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si
speciali Regis rescripto intervenerit gratia,</hi>
without the Kings special pardon) his Family
at an end, his Possessions taken away and (for
a greater terrour) given to some other Family,
whose profitable Service to the King and State
may better deserve it. So loathsome is this
Offence to Nobility, that she cannot suffer the
Marks of him that hath offended in so high a
degree, to possess any place with her Ensigns;
but that the same shall be without all reverence
defaced, and spurned into some base place: So
that by such his Degradation, he receiveth far
greater shame and ignominy, than ever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Honour by his Advancement, according
to the old Proverb, <q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly handled,
in the first Section, the
Common Accidents of an
Escocheon, <hi>viz.</hi> Points
and Abatements: Now
will I proceed to shew
their several kinds.</p>
               <p>Escocheons are either of
 <list>
                     <item>One Tincture.</item>
                     <item>More than one.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those Escocheons are said to be of one
Tincture, that have only some one Metal,
Colour, or Furr, appearing in the Shield of
any Nobleman or Gentleman. Concerning
this form of bearing, it hath been holden of
some Writers a matter doubtful, whether one
Metal, Colour, or Furr born alone in a Shield
be ancient or honourable: Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
such bearing to be false Arms, and not
worth the receiving, except in some special
cases; being perhaps thereunto induced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was reckoned among the <hi>Romans</hi> a
thing reproachful to bear a naked Shield with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Portraiture, in regard it was an usual
thing with men of Valour and Courage to have
their Shields painted.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
White Shields were
accustomed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon such as
were Novices in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Affairs, or (as we
commonly call them)
Freshwater Souldiers,
to the end they might
in future time merit to
have them garnished
with the Titles and Testimonies of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Deserts, until which time such Shields
were reckoned inglorious; as <hi>Virgil</hi> noteth in
his <hi>Aeneid. lib.</hi> 11. <q>
                     <l>Ense levis nudo, parmaque inglorius alba:</l>
                     <l>Quick he was with naked Sword,</l>
                     <l>But white Shield did no praise afford.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Contrariwise, <hi>Leigh</hi> reckoneth such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portraited
bearing to be good, and withal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient, grounding his Assertion (if I be
not deceived) upon 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. where
it is said that King <hi>Solomon</hi> made Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Targets of beaten Gold, and that Six
hundred Sheckles of Gold went to a Target;
as also that he made Three hundred Shields
of beaten Gold, and that Three pound of Gold
went to one Shield.</p>
               <p>Also we read, that <hi>Simon,</hi> the High Priest
of the Jews, sent <hi>Numenius</hi> with a Shield of
great value to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, to confirm
the League of Friendship between them, as
appeareth in 1 <hi>Macchab.</hi> 14. 24. in these words,
<hi>After this,</hi> Simon <hi>sent Numenius to</hi> Rome,
<hi>with a great Shield of Gold of a thousand
pound weight, to confirm the friendship with
them.</hi> And in the Letter of <hi>Lucius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
mention is again made of the Thousand
pound weight of this Golden Shield, 1 <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi>
15. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
That these Shields
were void of Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
conjectured, in
that there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
such might have
been the curiousness
and excellency of their
Workmanship, as that
it might have been
prised above the worth of the Gold it self:
An Example whereof <hi>Ovid, in Metam. lib.</hi> 2.
giveth, where, describing the glorious beauty
of the Palace of the Sun, he saith,
<q>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:55096:25"/>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Argenti bifores radiabant lumine valvae,</l>
                        <l>Materiam superabat opus; nam Mulciber illic &amp;c.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The two leav'd silver gates bright rays did cast</l>
                        <l>Rich stuff, but <hi>Vulcans</hi> Art therein surpast.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, we read that <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
the Emperour, had certain Golden
Shields, whose Bearers were named <hi>Chrysoas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
the Golden Shield-Bearers. And as
touching the Bearers of Shields made of clean
Silver, we read that <hi>Alexander Macedo</hi> had
such, whose Bearers were named <hi>Argyraspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
Silver Shield-bearers, which manner of
bearing (saith <hi>Alex. ab Alex.</hi> they borrowed
of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> Neither is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that these were garnished with any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bossments,
Graving, or Portraitures.</p>
               <p>Now to prove, that not only Metals, but
Colours also, have been anciently born alone
in Shields, I will note unto you the words of
the Prophet <hi>Nahum, Chap.</hi> 2. where it is said,
<hi>Clypeus potentum ejus rubricatus, bellatores
coccinati, &amp;c. The Shields of the Mighty ones
were red, &amp;c.</hi> alluding to their bloody
Fights.</p>
               <p>We also find that the <hi>Grecians</hi> used Russet
Shields. The People of <hi>Lucania</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
between <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Apulia,</hi> had their
Shields wrought of <hi>Osiers,</hi> or Twigs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with Leather. It was the manner
of the <hi>Scythians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to have
their Shields of Red Colour, to the end that
the effusion of their blood should not easily be
discovered (when they received any wound)
either to the discouragement of themselves,
or animating of their Enemies. Moreover,
these Nations used Scarlet and Red Colours in
their Military Garments and Shields, to the

Of this sort of Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I find in a Note
worthy of credit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of many Noble
Personages, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
Gentlemen, that
did attend the Person
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
First (in his Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he made into the parts of <hi>Scotland</hi>
to the Siege of <hi>Kalauerock</hi>) that one <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
de la Brect,</hi> did bear in his Shield only
Gules. Finally, that Furrs also have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in Shields (without any Charge) as well
as Metals and Colours (besides the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi>) I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
many Examples even to this day, were
not the use hereof so vulgar, as that it is
altogether impertinent to give instance therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
You have received a
Rule before, <hi>pag.</hi> 15.
and 17. how you ought
to Blazon a Furr of this
sort. This kind of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Furr without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Charge in the
Field, is both ancient
and good, saith <hi>Leigh.</hi>
And this kind of Furr
is much in use with Persons Nobly descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Gentlemen of good Reputation have
long born the same; as <hi>Ferrars</hi> of <hi>Chartley,
Beauchamp, Somerset, Marmion, Staunton,</hi>
and others.</p>
               <p>Yet will I note unto you one Coat-Armour
consisting of Furrs, for the beauty and rarity
thereof, and the same of no Vulgar bearing,
as you may see in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Verrey,
Ermyn and Gules, by

and is the Coat-Armour
of Sir <hi>Thomas Gresly</hi> of
<hi>Drakelow</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

you may observe

the Metal part charged

many Metals, Colours and Furrs there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed,
so many several Fields of Arms
there be. In Blazoning of any Arms, you
must (according to the Rule given, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.)
first express the Metal, Colour, or Furr of the
Field, saying, He beareth Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. or thus, The Field is Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. but you must not name this word Field,
when you use these words, He beareth; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
He beareth a Field, Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. but you shall only name the Metal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or Furr; thus, The Field is Or, Argent,
Gules, &amp;c. or, He beareth Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. and then proceed to the Blazon of the
Charge, if there be any. The first Metal,
Colour, or Furr that you begin to Blazon
withal, is always understood among our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Blazoners to be the Field. Also in Blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Arms composed of Field and Charge,
if there be several Charges, whereof the one
lieth nearer to the Field than the other, after
you have nominated the Metal, Colour, or
Furr of the Field, then must you proceed to
the immediate Charge that lieth next to the
Field, and after to that which is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly made mention

the Tinctures or Colours of Fields, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
thereby, those special Colours before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
which as by a certain peculiar Right
belong to the Art Armorial; utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
all those that are named general or
proper Colours, as altogether unfit for Fields of

               <p>THese Fields are the parts of Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining:
Charges, which are the parts
contained, are next to be considered.
A Charge, is that thing whatsoever that
doth occupy the Field, and is in the same as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentum
in Continente,</hi> whether it be Sensitive
or Vegetable, Natural or Artificial, and is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
either throughout all the Superficies of
the Escocheon, or else in some special part of
the same.</p>
               <p>The Common Accidents of Charges
Are<list>
                     <item>Adumbration, or Transparency.</item>
                     <item>Transmutation, or Counter-changing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Adumbration or Transparency is a clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
of the Substance of the Charge or
thing born, in such sort, as that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing thereof to be discerned, but the
naked and bare proportion of the outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
thereof, or the outward Tract,
Purfle, or Shadow of a thing; and such kind
of Bearing is, by better Heralds than Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,
termed Transparent, <hi>quasi transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
because the Field, being (as it were)
on the further side of the Charge, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the same, yet the Tincture and Colour
thereof sheweth clean through the Charge,
and that no less clearly than as if it were
through a Glass.</p>
               <p>In Blazoning of Coat-Armour of this kind,
you shall say that the Owner thereof beareth
this Beast, Bird, Tree, &amp;c. umbrated; for that
by reason of the exemption of the Substance
thereof, which was intended to be the Charge,
it affordeth no other representation than the
simple Shadow thereof, which in Latin is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Vmbra,</hi> and thereof is it termed umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And the portraying out of any thing
umbrated, is nothing else but a sleight and
single draught or Purfle, traced out with a
Pencil, expressing to the view a vacant form
of a thing deprived of all Substance, which
must be done with some imperfect or obscure
Colour, as Black or Tawny, unless the Field be
of the same Colour.</p>
               <p>Such Bearing hath undergone the sharp Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of those that judged it to have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by reason of some ungentleman-like,
or unthrifty quality, in regard that the same
representeth a Shadow void of Substance. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are of Opinion, that their Owners were
such, whose Progenitors in fore-passed times
have born the same essentially and compleatly
according to the true use of Bearing: But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as their Patrimony and Possessions
were much impaired, or utterly wasted; their
Nephews and Kinsmen seeing themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their Inheritance, and yet living in
hope, that in future time the same may (by
some unexpected Accident) revert unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or to their Posterities (laying aside all
ordinary differences) chuse rather to bear
their Arms umbrated, that whensoever either
that Inheritance, or any other high Fortunes
should light on their Family, they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
resume the wonted Substance to such
their umbrated form, and so reduce their
Arms to their ancient Bearing. And it is
deemed a far better course (upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
to bear the Arms of their Progenitors,
umbrated, than utterly to reject the same,
whereby it might (within a few Descents)
be doubted much, if not denied, that they
were descended from such a Family.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever is born with Arms umbrated,
must not be charged in any case. In Blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you must never nominate the Colour of
such Tract of the thing that is umbrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do only bear a shew of that
they are not, that is to say, of a Charge;
and therefore is the Colour of such Adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
esteemed unworthy to be named in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55096:26"/>
As touching the distribution of Charges,
it is to be observed, that</p>
               <p>All Charges of Arms are either
 Proper, or, Common.</p>
               <p>Those Charges are said to be proper, which
by a certain property do particularly belong
to this Art, and are of ordinary use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
in regard whereof they are called Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries:
And they have also the Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Ordinaries, in that the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is much honoured thereby, forasmuch
as they are oftentimes given by Emperours,
Kings, and Princes, as Additions of Honour
unto the Coat-Armours of Persons of Desert,
for some special Service already past, or upon
hope of some future worthy Merit. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(as <hi>Leigh</hi> sheweth) they are also called,
Most worthy Partitions, in respect that albeit
the Field be charged in divers parts thereof,
whether with things of one or of divers
kinds, yet is every of them as effectual as if
it were only one by the Soveraignty of these
Partitions being interposed between them.</p>

                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Chief, Argent, by the
Name of <hi>Worsley,</hi> and
is the Coat of <hi>Thomas
Worsley</hi> of <hi>Havingham</hi>
in the North Riding of
<hi>Yorkshire,</hi> Esquire. Or,
a Chief, Gules, is born
by Sir <hi>Martin Lumley</hi>
Knight and Baronet.
When I say that a Chief is determined by
one Line, I mean not, that one single Line is
of it self a compleat Chief, but that the bounds
and proportion of such an Ordinary is design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and limited by such a single Line:
for otherwise, to speak more properly, a
Chief containeth in depth the third part of
the Field; and the same may be diminished,
but in no case divided into halves. The
Chief betokeneth a Senator or Honourable
Personage borrowed from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and is
a word signifying a Head, in which sense we
call <hi>Capitaneus</hi> (so named of <hi>Caput,</hi> the Head)
a Chieftain: though he spake wittily, who
derived the name of a Captain, <hi>à capiendo &amp;
tenendo,</hi> of taking and then holding: For,
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Non minor est virtus, quàm quaerere, parta tueri:</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>No smaller praise is in it,</l>
                        <l>To hold a Fort, than win it.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Head is the chief part in a man,
so the chief in the Escocheon should be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of such only, whose high merits have
procured them chief place, esteem, or love
amongst men. This Ordinary in our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
you see is formed of a streight Line:
you must therefore in the Blazon thereof,
only name the kind of Ordinary (as before
we admonished) making no mention at all of
the streightness of the Line: but if the same,
or any other Ordinary be framed of any other
form than streight, then must you expresly
mention the form of the Line whereof such
Ordinary is composed, be it Bend, Cheuron,
Fess, Saltire, &amp;c. shewing the same to be either
Invecked, Engrailed, Wavy, Indented,
&amp;c.</p>

He beareth Gules, a
Chief Crenel, Argent;
by the Name of <hi>Ryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>
This term is
derived of the French
word <hi>Crene,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the Dent or
Notch in the Horn of a
Bow, or such other
thing. There is a kind
of Bearing much like unto this in shew, but
yet far different from it in kind: Therefore
good deliberation must be used, lest being
carried away with a deceivable appearance,
we do utterly mistake the truth of things in
Blazoning.</p>
               <p>Chiefs are made of all those several forms of
Lines beforementioned, as well as other Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as by the Examples of Bordures before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled,
may in part appear, and shall be more
fully shewed hereafter in other kinds.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Tenn, a
Chief, Or, charged with
a Shapournet, Ermyn.
This tearm Shapournet
(if I mistake not) is
derived from the French
word <hi>Chaperon,</hi> which
signifieth a Hood,
whereof this is a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive,
and beareth a
resemblance. <hi>Leigh</hi> seemeth to take this form
of Bearing to be a kind of Partition, and for
that cause doth extend the dividing Line (as
in this Escocheon) to the extremities of the
Chief; for which cause I have inserted the
same (although untimely) in this place, which
otherwise I would have reserved to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For my own part, I take the same to
be rather a Charge to the Chief, than a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, distinguished from the same only
by a conceited Line of Partition, never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
heard of: which moved me to shorten
the Head of the rising Line, whereby the
middle part hath the more resemblance of a
Chaperon or Hood, in respect that it is made
large below, and so ascending with a comely
narrowness to the top of the Chief: and if the
Chief be the Head, as before we said, what
place can be fitter for the Hood to be on, than
the Head?</p>
               <p>A Chief (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>) may be
honoured of another, as an Addition to the
former, as in Examples:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Chief, Argent, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
of another,
Or. This is accounted
good Armory, and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
a double Reward
given by the Soveraign.
So well may a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
deserve in giving
Counsel to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
that he may be twice rewarded for the
same, as was the Bearer hereof, a French
Counsellor, which when it hapneth, must be
placed in this manner: Those Additions of
Honour that are given in reward for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
or wise Actions, are thought to be placed
most fitly on the chief part or head of the
Escocheon, <hi>Quia à Capite edenda est omnis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
Because all Reason proceedeth from the
Brain. That contrariwise a Chief may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
diminished, this next Example may teach
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Chief, Azure, a Fillet
in the neither part
thereof, Argent. Some
perhaps strictly observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Form of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
Method, will
conceive that this Coat
might have been more
fitly placed hereafter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such Ordinaries as are made of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line. Nevertheless, though it may seem
to be of the number of those, yet in very deed,
one Line being added to the lower part of the
Chief, doth constitute a Fillet, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
must be the fourth part of the Chief, and
must be placed properly and naturally in the
precise lowest part thereof. For a twofold
respect was the name of Fillet given it; the
one in regard of the thing whereunto it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
by reason of the length and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof; and the other because of the
place wherein it is bestowed. For as the
Fillet is shaped long and narrow, for the
more commodious use of women, in trussing
up of their hair, as also for the fastning of
their Head-tires, and restraining of their hair
from scattering about their brows; so is this
very aptly placed on the Chief, which is the
Head of the Escocheon, and doth confine and
encompass the uttermost Borders of the same.
This Head-tire being taken from Women,
may well fit an uxorious or luxurious person,
or such an one, as in matters of importance is
overswayed by a woman: which doth not a
little extenuate and impair their Dignity or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation
amongst those of graver sort; for that
they are deemed to have their head fixed upon
the shoulders of others, and those of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Sex.</p>

<hi>viz.</hi> The Pale, Bend, Fess, Barr, Quarter,

in their several places: First of a Pale.</p>
               <p>A Pale is an Ordinary consisting of two
Lines drawn perpendicularly from the Top to
the Base of the Escocheon, comprehending the
third part of the Escocheon. The content of
the Pale must not be enlarged, whether it be
charged or not.</p>

that it may be parted

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> question: For he giveth an Example of the
bearing of the fourth part thereof, which he
termeth an Endorse, as in this next Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
appeareth: But Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> saith, it
containeth the eighth part of the Pale, which
in effect is all one with the fourth part of the
Pallet.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth or, an
Endorse, Gules. This
Endorse (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is not used but when
a Pale is between two
of them. But Sir <hi>Iohn
Ferne</hi> saith, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confident and bold to
set down such Rules of
Blazon. And that an
Endorse may very well be born in any Coat-Armour
between Birds, Fishes, Fowls, Beasts,
&amp;c. But then (saith he) it sheweth that the
same Coat hath been sometimes two Coats of
Arms, and after conjoyned within one Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
for some mystery or secret of Arms.
And for the approbation of such Bearing, he
giveth an instance of an Escocheon of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or Engislet (so he termeth it) born o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
these four Coats, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Austria, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,
Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which is, Or, an
Endorse between a Lyon saliant, and an Eagle
displayed, Gules.</p>
               <p>Now from the Pale, and the several Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions
thereof, let us come to the Bend, and
the distinct parts of the same. A Bend is an
Ordinary consisting also of twofold Lines
drawn overthwart the Escocheon, from the
Dexter Chief to the Sinister base point of the
same, so that the exact point of the Dexter
and Sinister corners thereof, may answer to the
precise midst of those Equidistant Lines
whereof the Bend is made: As in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Bend, Sable. Which
Arms were anciently
born by <hi>Peter de Má<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
lacu,</hi> or <hi>Mawley,</hi> a
Noble Baron of this
Kingdom, in the time
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third. The Bend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in bredth the
fifth part of the Field,
as it is uncharged; but
if it be charged, then shall it contain the third
part thereof. Of all the Ordinaries there is
none divided like this, as by Example shall
hereafter appear.</p>
               <p>The Bend seemeth to have its Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the French word <hi>Bender,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to stretch forth, because it is extended
betwixt those opposit points of the Escocheon,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Dexter Chief, and the Sinister Base.
Yet in ancient Rules I find the Bend drawn
somewhat Arch-wise, or after the resemblance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55096:28"/>
of the bent of a Bow. Notwithstanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to some Armorists, it doth represent
a Ladder set aslope on this manner, to scale
the Walls of any Castle or City, as shall be
shewed hereafter, and betokeneth the Bearer
to have been one of the first that mounted
upon the Enemies Walls. This Bend drawn
from the right side to the left, is called a Bend
Dexter; but you shall also find a Bend exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn like to this on the contrary side, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Leginning from the left corner of the
Chief, and his termination in the Dexter base
point of the Escocheon, for which cause it is
named a Bend Sinister, as in Example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall illustrate. In Blazoning of Bends,
if the same be Dexter, you shall only say, He
bears a Bend, not using the word Dexter;
but if it be drawn from the Sinister Chief to
the Dexter Base, then you must in Blazon by
no means omit the word Sinister.</p>
               <p>Note, That the Bend, and divers other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
following, are subject to exemption
or voiding. Voiding (as earst we shewed)
is the exemption of some part of the inward
substance of things voidable, by occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Field is transparent through the
Charge, leaving only the outward Edges,
bearing the colour and quantity of the Charge,
as appeareth in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
a Bend voided, Gules,
by the name of <hi>Ireton.</hi>
Note, that if the void
part of the Bend were
of a different Metal,
Colour, or Furr, from
the Field, then should
you term the same, a
Bend bordured, Gules,
(according to the opinion of some Armorists:)
But I am of opinion that it were better Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned,
a Bend of such and such a Metal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or Furr edged. For this Difference do
I put between them, that when it is blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
edged, it must be understood to be an edge
or hem, running along the sides only; but
if it were termed in blazon Bordured, then
must it be conceived that the Bend is inviron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
round, as well the ends as the edges.</p>

He beareth Or, a
Gartier, Gules. This
is derived either from
the French word <hi>Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
or else from the
Norman word <hi>Gartier,</hi>
both which are the
same that we call in
English a Garter, the
form whereof this
Charge doth represent. It is a Name of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
esteem in English Heraldry, and it
gave beginning to the most Renowned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Knighthood, of which Colledge and
Society have been more Kings and Princes,
and princely Peers, than of all the Knightly
Orders besides in Christendom. This contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
half the Bend in bigness.</p>
               <p>Such as do contain less than half
the Bend, are <list>
                     <item>Cost.</item>
                     <item>Riband.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Both which be exemplified in these next
Escocheons.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Gules, a
Cost, Or. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this is the fourth
part of the Bend, and
half the Garter, and is
sometimes called a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
and also a Battoon
(as <hi>Leigh</hi> noteth): But
<hi>Bara</hi> maketh a Cotise
and the Battoon two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
things. The word Cost or Cotise is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Latin word <hi>Costa,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
a Rib, either of Man or Beast. And
<hi>Farnesius</hi> saith, <hi>Costae à custodiendo sunt dictae,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55096:29"/>
Farn.</hi> 1. 45. When one of these is born alone,
as in this Escocheon, then shall you term it in
Blazon a Cost; but if they be born by couples
in any Coat (which is never, saith <hi>Leigh,</hi>
but when a Bend is placed between two of
them) then you may name them Cotizes, as in
Example:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Bend, Verrey, between 2
Cotises or Costs, Gules.
This Coat pertaineth to
Sir <hi>Edmund Bowyer</hi> of
<hi>Camberwel</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Surrey,</hi> Knight.
Not unfitly are these
so termed Costs or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises,
in respect they
are placed upon each side of the Bend, and do
inclose the same, as the Ribs of Man, or of
Beast, do bound and defend their Intrails. And
concerning such Charges or Fields composed
of Verrey, I refer you (for the avoiding of
needless repetition) to the Rules before deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
Note, That as well the Subdivisions
of Ordinaries, as the Ordinaries themselves,
are formed of the several sorts of Lines before
expressed, as may be gathered out of <hi>Vpton,</hi>
whose Opinion you shall hear when we come to
speak of Battoons.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Riband, Gules. This
is that other Subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is derived from
a Bend, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the eighth part
thereof. The Name
accordeth well with the
Form and Quantity of
the same, in that it is
long and narrow, which is the right shape of a
Riband.</p>
               <p>Thus much may suffice touching the Bend
Dexter, and the Subdivision thereof: Let us
now consider the Bend Sinister, and how the
same is subdivided. A Bend Sinister is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
consisting of a twofold Line, drawn
traverse the Escocheon, from the Sinister chief
corner to the Dexter base point; and differeth
(as we said) from the Dexter Bend only in this,
that it is placed on the opposite part of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Bend Sinister, Vert.
You may perhaps some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
find this Bend
born jointly with the
Bend Dexter in one Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
which to look
upon are much like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Saltire. In Coats
of such Bearing, you
must carefully observe which of them lyeth
next to the Field, and that must be first named.
And this Rule holdeth not alone herein, but
also in all other Coat-Armours formed of divers
Charges, whereof the one lieth nearer to the
Field than the other, according to the sixth
Rule of Blazon formerly given.</p>
               <p>The Bend Sinister is subdivided into a <list>
                     <item>Scarp.</item>
                     <item>Battoon.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>A Scarp (as <hi>Leigh</hi> noteth) is that kind of
Ornament (much in use with Commanders
in the Field) which we do usually call a Scarf,
as may be gathered by the derivation thereof
from the French word <hi>Escharpe,</hi> signifying
that Ornament which usually is worn by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men after the same manner from the left
Shoulder overthwart the Body, and so under
the Arm on the right side, as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Scarp, Azure. You
need not in Blazon
thereof make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this word Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
because it is never
born otherwise than
thus. Notwithstanding
this Charge hath some
resemblance of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Note of Illegitimation: yet is it not the
same, neither hath it any such signification,
for that it agreeth not with the Content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor with the manner of bearing the same,
as is plain by this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Battoon, Gules. This
word Battoon is derived
from the French word
<hi>Baston,</hi> which signifieth
a Wand or Cudgel. The
Frenchmen do usually
bear their Battoon (as
it were) couped after
this manner; whereof
I do better allow, than of that form which is
commonly used among us in <hi>England,</hi> because
the same being so born, doth better resemble
the shape or form of a Cudgel or Battoon. And
though this hath the form and quantity of a
Cost, yet it differeth from the same, in that the
Cost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is extended to the extremities of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
whereas the Battoon shall be couped,
and touch no part of the same, as by this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon
appeareth. This is the proper and
most<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>usual Note of Illegitimation (perhaps for
the affinity betwixt Baston and Bastards; or else
for that Bastards lost the priviledge of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and so were subject to the servile stroke)
and it containeth the fourth part of the Bend
Sinister; and being thus born, differeth from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55096:29"/>
all the Subdivisions of the Ordinaries before
manifested sufficiently, what conformity soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any of them may seem to have therewith.
This Mark was devised both to restrain men
truly generous, from the filthy stain of this
base (but common) sin, when they consider,
that such accusation to themselves, and shame
to their Issue, shall never be severed from their
Coat-Armour, which should be the Blazon of
their Honour. For let the spurious Birth have
never so Noble a Father, yet he is Base-born;
and Base will be ever the first syllable in a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards
name, till by his own Virtues he hath
washed off the stains of his Fathers Vice, as
many high Spirits have done; who though so
born, have attained to the highest pitch of
Glory. Every Bastard may have his Battoon
of what colour he will, but not of Metal, which
is for the Bastards of Princes. At the first, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards
were prohibited to bear the Arms of
their reputed Fathers. Then (saith Sir <hi>Iohn
Ferne</hi> in his <hi>Glory of Generosity</hi>) they did
by suit obtain a toleration from Soveraigns and
Kings, to be made Legitimate, and to be
matriculated by the Kings Grant, as Children
lawfully born: which Grant did enable them
to be capable of many Immunities and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
which others lawfully begotten do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy:
and so by such Legitimation they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of all those dishonours which in former
time they were subject unto; and were acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the stain of their Bastardy, <hi>Excepto
quod ex tali legitimatione non admittebantur
ad Iura Sanguinis cum aliis Filiis:</hi> Except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they had not the right of Blood and
Inheritance thereby; to participate with the
lawful Inheritance of their Father, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Iudges 11. And when the womans Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were come to age; they thrust out</hi> Jepthah,
<hi>saying, Thou shalt not inherit in our Fathers
House, for thou art the Son of a strange Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
By pretence of these Legitimations, they
bear the Coat-Armour of their reputed Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
with a sign of Bastardy, now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known to every man, by reason of frequent
use: which mark (as some do hold) neither
they nor their Children shall ever remove or
lay aside, <hi>Ne sordes per errorem inter praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puos
reputentur;</hi> Left the Fruits of Lust should
by errour gain the estimation of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
               <p>It is not lawful for those that are base born
to usurp the Arms of their reputed Fathers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be branded with certain Notes or Marks
proper to men Illegitimate, devised of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to separate and distinguish them from such
as proceed from lawful Matrimony. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it is often questioned, Whether such as
be illegitimated (by Act of Parliament, or
whatsoever other means) may bear, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the bearing of the Arms of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fathers? Some are of Opinion they may:
Others do hold the contrary, unless they do
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear them with the apposition of some of the
beforementioned Notes appropriated to the
quality of their Illegitimate Generation and
Procreation. By Legitimate Issue, is not to
be understood Legitimate only, that is to say,
such as be adopted Children: For there is in
such but a bare imitation of Nature, of such
we have no use in this Land of Adoption or
Arrogation. But of such as are both Natural
and Legitimate; Natural so termed, <hi>Quia na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
aliter generati;</hi> Legitimate, <hi>Ex Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

               <p>Consanguinity is a Bond or Link of Persons
descended of the same Stock, derived from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Propagation: So called, <hi>Consanguinitas,
quasi sanguinis unitas, viz.</hi> the unity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Blood.</p>
               <p>To discern priority or nearness in Blood, two
things must be regarded principally; <hi>viz. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
and <hi>Gradus:</hi> The Line is that, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
together the Persons containing their
Degrees, and distinguishing them in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This is called <hi>Collectio Personarum.</hi>
The other, <hi>viz. Gradus,</hi> sheweth the state
or condition of the distant Persons, how near
they be, or how far distant asunder (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
from their common Stock, or either
from other. This is called <hi>Habitudo distanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

               <p>The Ascending Line is, from me to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Grandfather, and so upwards.</p>
               <p>The Descending Line, is from me to my Son,
Nephew, his Son, downwards.</p>
               <p>The Collateral Line is placed on either side.</p>
               <p>This Line also is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Equal Collateral is that, where equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Persons differ from their Common Stock:
as Brothers and Sisters be equally distant from
their Father: As also Brothers and Sisters Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from their Grandfather.</p>
               <p>The Unequal Collateral is, where one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
another: Such are Brothers, and their
Brothers and Sisters Children.</p>
               <p>Affinity is (after the Laws) <hi>Personarum
proximitas proveniens ex justis nuptiis;</hi> A
nearness of Persons proceeding from lawful
Marriage. So called <hi>Affinitas, quasi duorum
ad unum finem unitas;</hi> A union or consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two that be of divers Kindreds by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
or other Copulation conjoyned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:55096:30"/>By this, Affinity is contracted two manner

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first is thus contracted; My Brother and
I are Consanguine in the first degree, He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a Wife, her they call, <hi>personam additam
personae per carnis copulam.</hi> This is the first
kind of Affinity (contracted by means of my
Brother) <hi>viz.</hi> between his Wife and me, and
the first degree: for thus they be the Kindred
and Degrees) discerned in Affinity, <hi>viz.</hi> by
the persons that be in Consanguinity or Blood,
either nearer or farther off. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</p>
               <p>My Brother is in the first degree to me in
Consanguinity; his Wife in Affinity: My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son in the second, his Nephew in the
third, his Nephews Son in the fourth. They
in Consanguinity: Their Wives in the same
degrees, second, third, or fourth unto me,
but they in Affinity.</p>
               <p>Note that they attain not (in me) by their
addition that, I have attained (by Blood)
in the persons to whom they be added. For
herein, that is to say, in Attinency we be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
in Consanguinity and Affinity. To
make it plain: My Brother is my Consanguine,
his Wife my Affine, only they retain and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
with me the degree, whether it be first,
second, third, or fourth; that I have with the
persons that they be carnally known by, the
which they alter not.</p>
               <p>Consequently they shall be every person in
Consanguinity to my Wife, in Affinity to me,
in what degree in the one, in that degree in the
other. But always in the first kind, be they
Brother, Sister, Nephew, Neece, &amp;c. But to
return to our Battoon. <hi>Vpton</hi> calleth this Baston

of the Bend. It hath yet no certain

the Escocheon; in the midst whereof is the
very Center of the Shield. And it containeth
the third part of the Field, and may not be
diminished, albeit the French Heralds do bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
three bars gemels, for a Fess of six pieces.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Vaire, Or,
and Vert, a Fess, Gules,
by the Name of <hi>Duf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi>
This word Fess
is a French word, and
doth signifie the Loins
of a man. This Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
hath been ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken for the same
that we call <hi>Baltheum
militare,</hi> or <hi>Cingulum Honoris,</hi> a Belt of
Honour; because it divideth the Field into
two equal parts, it self occupying the middle
between both, even as the Girdle environeth
the middle part of a man, and resteth upon
his Loins.</p>
               <p>This Girdle of Honour may seem to have
been in ancient time given by Emperours and
Kings, and their Generals of the Field unto
Souldiers, for reward of some special Service
performed by them: and it is not improbable,
that such a reward it was, that the General of
<hi>David</hi>'s Army, <hi>Ioab,</hi> would have given the
Messenger that brought him news that <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
was hanged by the hair of the Head in an
Oak, if he had slain him; where <hi>Ioab</hi> saith,
<hi>Why hast thou not killed him, that so I might
have rewarded thy Service with ten Sheckles
of Silver, and a Girdle (or an arming
Belt</hi>)? For some translate it <hi>Cingulum,</hi> some
<hi>Baltheum.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> it was
ordained by a Military Law (saith <hi>Alex. ab
Alex.</hi>) that the Souldier that had not killed an
Enemy, <hi>non militari Cingulo, sed capistro cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geretur:</hi>
should not be girt with an arming
Girdle, but with a Halter. And not without
reason is a man adorned with a Military Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
signifying he must be always in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to undergo the business of the Weal Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
for the more speedy performance of
which Charge, he should have his Garments
close girt unto his body, that the loosness of
them should give no impediment to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his assumed Charge and enjoyned
Services. And these Tokens of Chivalry were
so highly esteemed in ancient times, that St.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, in his Age, <hi>Duces, &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,
omnes etiam militantes, operosis Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
auro fulgente pretiosis, ambiunt, &amp;c.</hi> Great
Captains, Princes, and Martial Men, delight
to wear their Belts curiously wrought, and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
with Gold, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As the bestowing of this Military Girdle,
was reputed very honourable, because none
were to receive it but Men of Merit, so also
was it ever accounted most dishonourable for
any just cause to be again deprived of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thereof; neither should such an one be
restored thereunto, but upon very singular and
especial Desert, as <hi>Ferettus</hi> noteth, where
he saith, <hi>Augustus laudabiliter militarem
disciplinam gessit severissime: &amp; privatos mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litari
Cingulo nunquam restituit, nisi illos prae
caeteris virtutum merita insignirent: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
the Emperour got much honour by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of his Military Discipline: for if a man
were once deprived of his arming Girdle, he
never would restore it, unless he performed
some excellent Service above all others. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
there is also one kind of putting
off the Belt, of no less honour, than the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on of it; yea, much more glorious it is,
in that it is the end and perfection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that is, when the Victory is atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Victory being the end of Arming, as Peace
is of Battel. To which purpose is that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
1. <hi>Reg. 20. 11. Ne jactet se qui se accin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,
ut qui discingit: Let not him boast who
girds himself, as he that doth ungird:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we must not triumph (as the saying is)
before Victory; but it being once attained, it
is the Honour of a Generous Mind, to put off
his Belt, and not to Sanguine his Blade with
cold blood. For those Gallants, who in times
and places of Peace, are still drawing their
Swords like Warriours, in times and places of
War, prove (for the most part) peaceabler
and calmer than they should be.</p>
               <p>But if a Knight be disarmed of his Military
Girdle by his Demerits and Offence, he is
therewithal deprived of all Military Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
like as it fareth with a Captain, who (if
he happen to lose his Ensigns) is disabled to
advance any other in the Field, until he hath
either regained the same, or by his Valour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
some other from the Enemy. Which
kind of deprivation of Knights and Martial
Men for any notable transgression, was of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use in times past, and in some places is
continued unto this day with greater severity
and much more infamy than in former times.

The depriving of the Belt (which

is at this day still in use amongst
Knights, and with more ignominy than was
in ancient times: which is nothing else but
that which we call degrading of a Knight. If
any ask me, How this comes about that such
Degradation of a Knight is more infamous
than of old? I answer, it is because it is more
rare, and therefore more remarkable. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
you ask, Why it is more rare than of
old? I answer, because it is more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and therefore Princes more unwilling
to inflict it. Howsoever, the truth is, that
base and unknightly actions and qualities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a base and unknightly chastisement.</p>

He beareth Or, a

These Arms pertain to
the worthy Gentleman
Sir <hi>Thomas Vavasour,</hi>
who, in the Reign of
King <hi>Iames,</hi> was
Knight Marshal of his
Majesties Houshold, and
of the Verge thereto
appertaining; whose Family anciently had the
addition <hi>Le</hi> to their Name, as being the Kings
<hi>Valvasores,</hi> being in times past a Degree not
much inferiour to a Baron, and given to their
Family <hi>ex Regio munere,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

the ancient Inheritance of the said Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>So much of a Fess: now of a Chevron. A
Chevron is an Ordinary, formed of a twofold
Line Spirewise or Pyramidal; the Foundation
being in the Dexter and Sinister base points
of the Escocheon, and the acute Angle of
the Spire near to the top of the Escocheon:
As in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Topaz,
a Chevron, Ruby. This
Coat pertaineth to the
Honourable and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Family of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
now Barons, and
sometimes Earls of
<hi>Stafford,</hi> and Dukes
of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> This
Ordinary is resembled
to a pair of Barge-couples or Rafters, such as
Carpenters do set on the highest part of the
House, for bearing of the Roof thereof; and
betokeneth the atchieving of some business of
moment, or the finishing of some chargeable
and memorable work. This was anciently the
usual form of bearing of the Chevron, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by many Seals and Monuments yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and is most agreable to Reason, that as
it representeth the Roof of a House (though
I am not ignorant that <hi>Leigh</hi> saith, it was in
old times the Attire for the Heads of Women
Priests) so accordingly it should be extended
to the highest part of the Escocheon, though
far different is the bearing thereof in these
days. In which respect it were fit that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Painters, the common Disorderers of
these Tokens of Honour, were better looked
unto; who both in former Ages, and much
more in these days, have greatly corrupted
these honourable signs, by adding their new
fantastical inventions; that so they might make
the things born in Coat-Armour more perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
to the view, or because they would be
thought to be well overseen in Heraldry. For
indeed they want the eye of Judgment, to see
and discern that such is the excellency of these
honourable Tokens, that the least alteration
either by augmentation, diminution, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or whatsoever other means, doth
occasion a change in them so great, as that
they thereby differ from themselves, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their accidental, but also in their substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
parts, and cease to be any longer the same
they were before, and their owners are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
to challenge any propriety or interest in
them, in respect of such alteration. <hi>Modica
alteratio in membro principali magnam alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationem
facit</hi> (saith the Philosopher) A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
alteration makes a great alteration in a
principal part. As the least spot in the eye,
which is the worthiest part of the face, doth
more disfigure the same, than ten times so
much in any other Member of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>The Content of the Chevron is the fifth
part of the Field (according to <hi>Leigh</hi>): but
<hi>Chassanaeus</hi> reckoneth the same amongst those
Ordinaries that do occupy the third part of the
Field. You may have two Chevrons in one
Field (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) but not above; and if they
exceed that number, then shall you call them
Chevron ways. But I suppose they might be
termed much better Chevronels; that is to
say, minute or small Chevrons; for so is their
blazon more certain. This Charge following,
and the Subdivisions thereof, are diversly born,
as well in respect of the divers location, as of
the variable form thereof; for sometimes it is
born on chief, otherwhiles on base, sometimes
enarched, sometimes reversed, sometimes fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
&amp;c. as after by Examples appeareth.</p>

Note that the
lower part of this Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vron
is far above the
ordinary place of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Chevron; for it is
pitched as high as the
Nombril of the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
whereas others
have their rising from or near above the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and Sinister base points. The Ancestors of
this bearer (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) have born the same
otherways, which was for some good purpose
removed, although it were better after the
common manner of bearing. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Accidents incident unto this Ordinary,
<hi>viz.</hi> Transposition, as in this last Escocheon;
Couping, Voiding and Reversing. Of all
which I purpose to give several Examples in

understood that the Field sheweth through

               <p>A Chevronel is a diminutive of a Chevron,

He beareth Argent,

these (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
you may have no more
than three in a Field,
except Partition. The
other Subdivision of the

is a subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Charge derived from a Chevron, and
formed of two Lines erected Chevron-ways.</p>

This containeth the
fourth of the Chevron,
and is not born but by
Pairs, except there be
a Chevron between
them. Well doth the
Name of this Charge,
agree with the use
thereof, which is not only to be born by Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for the most part, but also to have a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vron
between them, which they inclose on
each side.</p>
               <p>The next in order to the Chevron is the
Barr. A Barr is composed of two Equi-distant
Lines drawn overthwart the Escocheon, after
the manner of the Fess before-mentioned, as in
this next Escocheon appeareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This Ordinary dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the Fess,
not only in that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the fifth part of
the Field, whereas the
Fess occupieth the third
part thereof; but also
that the Fess is limited
to one certain place of
the Escocheon, to wit,
the exact Center or Fess point thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Barr is not tyed to any prescript place,
but may be transferred unto sundry parts of
the Escocheon. But if there be but one only
Barr in the Escocheon, then must the same oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
the place of the Fess, as appeareth in
this Escocheon. This Charge is of more esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
than is well considered of many that
bear the same. If you have two Barrs in the
Field, they must be so placed, as that thereby
the Field of the Escocheon may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
five equal parts; so shall each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their just quantity.</p>
               <p>A Barr is subdivided into a <list>

Barr is called a Baru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
which (after the
Opinion of <hi>Leigh</hi>) cannot be born dividedly,

               <p>Azure, two Barrs, Or, is the Coat-Armour
of the ancient Family of the <hi>Burdets</hi> of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickshire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Argent, two Barrs, Sable, is born by <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Brereton</hi> of <hi>Burras</hi> in <hi>Deubighshire,</hi>
Esquire.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of a Barr: Now of a Gyron.</p>
               <p>A Gyron is an Ordinary consisting of two
streight Lines drawn from divers parts of the
Escocheon, and meeting in an acute Angle in
the Fess point of the same. A Gyron (as one
saith) is the same that we call in Latin <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi>
which signifieth a Lap, and is the space
between the Thighs; and thence perchance do
we call the <hi>Groyn;</hi> which name, whether it
be given to this Charge, because it determines
<hi>in gremio,</hi> in the very lap or midst of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
or because it hath a bending like the
Thigh and Leg together, I cannot define.
Gyrons are born diversly, <hi>viz.</hi> single, by cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of six, of eight, of ten, and of twelve,
as shall appear hereafter, where I shall speak
of Arms having no tincture predominating.
For the making this Ordinary, behold this
next Escocheon, where you shall find one single
Gyron alone, which doth best express the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thereof: as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sanguine,
one Gyron issuing from
the Chief Dexter point,
Or. If these two Lines
whereof this Ordinary
is framed, were drawn
throughout to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
of the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
then would they
constitute two Gyrons, as in this next Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
appeareth.
But if this Gyron had stood
in Fess in the Dexter part, and the Gyron Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
then were it the second Coat of the
Lord <hi>de Wolfo</hi> of <hi>Suesia,</hi> whose Daughter was
married to the Marquiss of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and
after to <hi>Gorge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
two Gyrons, Gules. You
need not say, Meeting
in point, the one from
the Dexter Chief, the
other in the Sinister base,
because they do ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
meet in the Fess
point, be they never so
many. Here you see,
that as two Lines drawn, the one Bendways
from the Dexter corner of the Chief part of
the Escocheon, and resting on the Fess point,
and the other drawn Fessways overthwart the
Escocheon, and meeting with the same in the
said Fess point, do make one Gyron: so do
the same drawn throughout, produce two Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.</p>
               <p>So much of a Gyron: Now of a Canton and
Quarter.</p>
               <p>A Canton is an Ordinary framed of two
streight Lines, the one drawn perpendicularly
from the Chief, and the other transverse from
the side of the Escocheon, and meeting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in an acute Angle, near to the corner of
the Escocheon, as in this next appeareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
a Canton, Argent, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Chevron,
Gules, by the Name of
<hi>Middleton.</hi> This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
is termed a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
because it occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but a Corner or
Cantel of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Some Armorists
do hold, That the Canton is a Reward given
to Gentlemen, Esquires, and Knights, for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done by them, and not to a Baron. Some
others notwithstanding are of a different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That a Canton may well beseem an Earl
or a Baron receiving the same at his Soveraigns
hand; yet is the Quarter to be preferred in
Dignity before the same: and before them
both, Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> preferreth the Escocheon
of Pretence, which he calleth an Engislet or
Fessy Target. Note that a Canton parted tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
ways, whether it be from the Dexter
corner, or from the Sinister, doth make two
base Squires. And if the Canton be placed in
the Dexter corner of the Escocheon, you must
in Blazon only name it a Canton, not making
any mention of the local situation thereof: but
if it be placed on the contrary side, then must
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55096:33"/>
you in Blazon add this word Sinister, as he
beareth a Canton Sinister. The Sinister Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
is all one with the Dexter in form, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
and in estimation, but differeth from the
same, both in regard of the local position
thereof (by reason that it is placed in the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
corner of the Escocheon) as also in that
it is not of so frequent use.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of a Canton, now of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Quarter is an Ordinary of like compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
with the Canton, and holdeth the same
places, and hath great resemblance thereof;
insomuch as the same Rules and Observations
that do serve for the one, may be attributed
to the other, <hi>Quia similium similis est ratio;</hi>
of like things the reason is alike. The only
difference between them is, that the Canton
keepeth only a cantle or small portion of the
corner of the Escocheon, and the Quarter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
the full fourth part of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Verrey,
Argent and Sable, a
Quarter, Gules, by the
name of <hi>Estanton.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that (according to
<hi>Leigh</hi>) the Quarter is
for the most part given
by Emperors and Kings
to a Baron (at the least)
for some special or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Service done by him; yet do we find
the same bestowed upon persons of meaner dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for like occasion. Contrariwise, the
Canton (being received at the Soveraigns
hand) may beseem the dignity of a Baron or
Earl, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Having spoken of the Canton and Quarter,
as much as for this present is requisite, I will
reserve some other their adjuncts to a more
convenient place. And will now speak of a
Pile, shewing some variable Examples of the
divers bearing thereof.</p>
               <p>A Pile is an Ordinary consisting of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line, formed after the manner of a Wedge;
that is to say, broad at the upper end, and so
lessening by degrees throughout with a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
narrowness and Taper growth, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
at the lower end in an acute Angle, as
in this next Escocheon appeareth.</p>
               <p>The Pile I take to be derived from <hi>Pilum,</hi>
an ancient Weapon peculiar to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
shaped somewhat like a Dart without Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but thicker at the great end, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
smaller Taper-wise, being about five foot
in length, and sharpned at the point with
Steel: And such were the offensive Arms of
the <hi>Hastati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> of the
Roman Militia affirmeth: And Generals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have born them in their Marches, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to encourage the Souldiers by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples;
all which is proved by the excellent

born by <hi>Richard Hulse</hi> of <hi>Betherden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
Esquire.</p>
               <p>The Pile is an ancient Addition to Armory,
and is a thing that maketh all Foundations to
be firm and perfect, especially in Water-works.</p>
               <p>When there is but one Pile in the Field, it
must contain the third part of the same at the
Chief. This Ordinary is diversly formed and
born, as in these next Escocheons appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent, a
Triple Pile, Flory on the
tops, issuing out of the
Sinister Base, in Bend,
towards the Dexter
corner, Sable. This sort
of bearing of the Pile,
hath a resemblance of
so many Piles driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some Water-work,
and by long tract of time, incorporated at their
heads, by reason of an extraordinary weight
imposed upon them, which gave impediment
of their growth in height.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent, a
Pile in Bend, issuing out
of the Dexter corner of
the Escocheon, Sable
Cotised, Engrailed,
Gules. I have made
special choice of this
Coat-Armour (out of
the <hi>Glory of Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>)
as well for the
rareness thereof, as for that I find the same
there commended for fair Armory, and good
in regard of the variety thereof, for Blazoners
to look upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Pile waved, issuing out
of the Dexter corner of
the Escocheon, Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
Or, by the name
of <hi>Aldam.</hi> As this Pile
waved issueth out of the
Dexter, so also may the
same be born from the
Sinister chief point.
Moreover you shall find them born in Pale,
and sometimes issuing out of the Base with the
point thereof transposed, which I leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
               <p>Now the bearing of Waves, or of things
waved, may well fit those that are tried in the
furnace of Afflictions, which are the Badges
and Testimonies of our election in Christ, who
suffered for us; the Just for the Unjust, to bring
us unto God. Therefore we should bear our
Afflictions gladly, forasmuch as <hi>if we suffer
with Christ, we shall also be glorified with him.</hi>
For so doth the Apostle admonish us, saying,
<hi>That no man should be moved with these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for ye your selves know that we are
appointed thereunto, 1 Thess.</hi> 3. 3. And again,
<hi>Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
of Christ, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55096:34"/>So much of Piles, and their variety, as well
of Form as of Location. There rest yet some
other sorts of Ordinaries, that are composed
of a two-fold Line, not hitherto spoken of.</p>
               <p>Such are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>Flasque.</item>
                     <item>Flanch.</item>
                     <item>Voider.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In some mens conceit perhaps these Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
last mentioned might have been more fitly
placed amongst such as are before handled,
and are composed of a single Line (of which
number these may be well reckoned, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them each one apart by themselves:) but
forasmuch as none of them are born single, but
always by couples; for conveniency I have
chosen rather to sort them with these that are
formed of a twofold Line: and first of a
Flasque.</p>
               <p>A Flasque is an Ordinary consisting of one
Arch-line, drawn somewhat distant from the
corners of the Chief, and meanly swelling by
degrees until you come towards the midst of
the Escocheon, and from thence again decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with a like comly descent unto the Sinister
base points; as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Or, two
Flasques, Azure. This
Reward (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is to be given by a King
for Vertue and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and especially for
Service in Ambassage:
for therein may a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
deserve as well
of his Soveraign, as the
Knight that serveth him in the Field. This is
called an Arch-line, of the Latin word <hi>Arcus,</hi>
that signifieth a Bow, which being bent, hath
a moderate bowing, void of excess of tubero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
This word Flasque is derived either from
the French word <hi>Fleschier,</hi> or from the Latin
word <hi>Flecto,</hi> which signifieth to bend or bow.</p>
               <p>The next in Order is the Flanch, which is
an Ordinary formed of an Arch-line, taking its
beginning from the corner of the Chief, and
from thence compassing orderly with a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
embossment, until it come near to the
Nombril of the Escocheon, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
declining to the Sinister base point,
as in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
two Flanches, Vert.
This (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) is
one degree under the
foresaid Flasque, yet
it is commendable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
This word
Flanch (as some do
hold) is derived from
the French word <hi>Flans,</hi> which signifieth the
flank of a man or beast, that includeth the
small Guts, because that part strutteth out,
<hi>cum tumore quodam,</hi> as it were a blown Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Sometimes you may find this Ordinary
made of some other forms of Lines than plain,
which when it shall happen, you must in the
Blazon thereof make special mention of the
form of Line whereof it is composed.</p>
               <p>Last of all in our Ordinaries, cometh the
Voider, consisting of one Arch-line moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bowing from the corner of the Chief by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
towards the Nombril of the Escocheon,
and from thence in like sort declining, until it
come unto the Sinister base, and hath a more
near resemblance of the bent of a Bow than the
Flanch hath, in that it riseth not with so deep
a compass; as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Tenn, two
Voiders, Or. This is the
Reward of a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for Service by her
done to the Prince; but
then the Voider should
be of one of the nine
Furs or Doublings. Such
Reward (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
might the Dutchess of
<hi>Montfort</hi> have given to her Gentlewoman,
who served her most diligently, not only
while she kept the Town of <hi>Hanybot,</hi> but also
when she rode armed into the Field, and scared
the Frenchmen from the siege thereof. These
are called Voiders, either because of the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness
wherein they do resemble the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
voiding Plates with narrow brims used
at Tables; or else of the French word <hi>Voire,</hi>
which signifieth a Looking-glass or Mirrour,
(which in ancient times were commonly made
in that bulging form) especially considering
they are given to Gentlewomen in recompence
of Service, unto whom such Gifts are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
and withal implying, that Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
so well deserving, should be mirrors and
patterns to others of their Sex, wherein to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
both their duties, and the due reward of
Vertues. His counsel was so very behoveful,
who advised all Gentlewomen often to look
on Glasses, that so, if they saw themselves
beautiful, they might be stirred up to make
their Minds as fair by Vertue as their Faces
were by Nature: but if deformed, they might
make amends for their outward deformity,
with their intern pulchritude and gracious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
And those that are proud of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
should consider, that their own hue is as
brittle as the Glass wherein they see it; and
that they carry on their shoulders nothing but
a Skull wrapt in skin, which one day will be
loathsome to be looked on.</p>

               <p>HAving shewed the manner and making
of such Ordinaries as are composed of
a twofold Line; we will now proceed
to that other Member of the Distribution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
delivered, which maketh mention of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
consisting of Lines more than twofold;
and will shew how they also are made.</p>
               <p>Such Ordinaries do consist of Lines <list>
                     <item>Threefold.</item>
                     <item>Fourfold.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those that are formed of a threefold Line,
are the Inescocheon and the Orle.</p>
               <p>The Inescocheon is an Ordinary formed of a
threefold Line, representing the shape of the
Escocheon; as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
an Inescocheon, Gules,
by the Name of <hi>Hul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve:</hi>
This name of
Inescocheon is proper
only to those that are
born in this place; for
if the same were born
in any other place,
than upon the Fess
point of the Shield, you should term the same
then an Escocheon, and not an Inescocheon;
so must you also, if there be more than one in
the Field. This Escocheon is sometimes termed
an Escocheon of Pretence, as shall appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
This Ordinary containeth the fifth part
of the Field (saith <hi>Leigh,</hi> but his demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
denoteth the third part) and may not be
diminished; and albeit it be subject to some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
by reason of the different forms of
Lines before specified, yet it keepeth still one
setform of an Escocheon, as we shall see by
and by.</p>
               <p>The next in rank of this kind is the Orle,
which is an Ordinary composed of a threefold
line duplicated, admitting a transparency of the
Field, throughout the innermost <hi>Area</hi> or space
therein inclosed. This hath the form of an
Inescocheon, but hath not the solid substance
thereof, being evermore voided, as in these
following Examples appeareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, an
Orle, Azure, by the
Name of <hi>Bertram,</hi>
Lord of <hi>Bothal.</hi> This
word <hi>Orle</hi> seemeth to
be derived from the
French word <hi>Oreiller,</hi>
which signifieth a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and is attributed
to this Ordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the same being of a different tincture
from the Field, and formed only of a double
tract, in regard of the transparency of the
Field within, and the surrounding thereof
without, it receiveth the resemblance of an
embossed Substance, as if it were raised like a
Pillow above the Field. <hi>Vpton</hi> termeth it in
Latin <hi>Tractus,</hi> which signifieth a Trace or
Trail, because the Field is seen both within
and without it; and the Trail it self is drawn
thereupon in a different Colour. If this were
flored (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) then must it be called a
Tressure, which must contain the fifth part of
the Field. And if two of these be in an Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
you must term them a double Tressure,
<hi>Chassanaeus</hi> saith, that the Orle is sometimes
formed of many pieces, and that they are
born to the number of Six.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
an Orle within a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
Gules, by the
Name of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and
is born by the <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
of <hi>Saffron-wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
in <hi>Essex,</hi> and of
<hi>Micham</hi> in <hi>Surrey;</hi> of
which Family is Mr.
<hi>William Rutland</hi> of
<hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the doubling of this plain Orle,
I will not here give Example, for that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to present to your view a threefold Orle
or Tract, which doth include the twofold, as
in this next Escocheon appeareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, an
Orle of three pieces,
Sable. That this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
is born of many
Tracts, it appeareth
by this Example, taken
out of <hi>Vpton,</hi> for the
Readers satisfaction;
where it is said, <hi>Sunt
insuper alii qui habent
istum Tractum triplicatum &amp; quadruplicatum,
ut nuper in armis Episcopi Coenomanensis, qui
portavit pro Armis unum Tractum triplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
de nigro, in campo aureo:</hi> Some bear the
Orle tripled and quadrupled, as the late Bishop
of <hi>Maine,</hi> who bare a tripled Orle, Sable, in
a Field, Or. This Ordinary is born diversly,
according to the several forms of Lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
handled, as may appear in the Examples
ensuing.</p>

                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
an Orle Engrailed on
the inner side, Gules.
I found this form of
bearing observed by an
uncertain Author,
whom at first I suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully
taken, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
mistaken the
trick thereof; but after I had found in <hi>Vpton,</hi>
that in Blazoning of an Orle Engrailed, he Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned
the same, An Orle engrailed on both
sides, I took more special notice of this kind
of bearing, for that such a form of Blazon
(proceeding from a man so judicious in this
kind) seemed covertly to imply a distinction
of that from this form of bearing. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>diversa juxta se apposita magis elucescunt,</hi>
things differing give light each to other, I will
here produce the Coat it self, and the Blazon
thereof, as I find it set down by <hi>Vpton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
                  <hi>Il port</hi> (saith he)
<hi>de Gules un trace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grailee,
de chascun cost
d'Or.</hi> And in Latin
thus: <hi>Qui habet ista
Arma, portat unum
tractum ex utraque
parte ingradatum, de
Auro in campo rubro.</hi>
He beareth an Orle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grailed
on both sides, Or, in a Field, Gules.
And no doubt by heedful observation you may
find these Orles in like sort born Invecked, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milium
enim similis est ratio;</hi> for like things
have the like reason and respect. Note, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Charges, as well Artificial as Natural, are
born Orl-ways, or in Orle; as likewise in form
of Cross, Bend, Chevron, Saltire, &amp;c. the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
whereof I must pass over, until a fit
place be offered to handle Charges of those
kinds. Concerning the bearing of Orles, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of the sundry sorts of Furs, I hold it
needless to use Examples to express them to
the view, for that by consideration of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
sorts of several Ordinaries before expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
their diverse manner of bearing may be
easily conceived: and therefore I will leave
them to observation.</p>
               <p>Hitherto have we considered the making of
such Ordinaries as are composed of a threefold
Line: Our Order calleth me now to speak of
such Ordinaries as do require a fourfold Line
for the effecting of them.</p>
               <p>Of this sort is the
 <list>
                     <item>Cross.</item>
                     <item>Saltire.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Cross is an Ordinary composed of a
four-fold Line, whereof two are Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and the other two are transverse, for so
we must conceive of them, though they are
not drawn throughout, but meet by couples
in four acute Angles near about the Fess point
of the Escocheon; to look upon (if they were
couped, as they are sometimes found) like to
four Carpenters squares; as the Example fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
will demonstrate. This Ordinary is
called <hi>Crux, à cruciando,</hi> or <hi>à cruciatu,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the unspeakable torture and torment
which they do suffer, who undergo this kind
of death. The Content of the Cross is not
the same always: for when it is not charged,
then it hath only the fifth part of the Field; but
if it be charged, then must it contain the third
part thereof. To give you particular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all the different forms of bearing of the
Cross, were as needless as endless, considering
the variety set down by other Authors: I
will therefore content my self with these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>

He beareth Argent, a

               <p>Azure, a Cross, Or: This Coat-Armour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the right worshipful Family of <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
that honourable vertuous Lady, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Shelton,</hi> who was many years of the most
honourable Bedchamber of that glorious Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and was also wife to the right
worshipful Sir <hi>Iohn Scudamore</hi> of <hi>Home Lacy</hi>
in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Knight, Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer
to her Majesties Honourable Band of
Gentlemen Pensioners. This Ordinary is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diversly named, according to the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Lines whereof it is composed: For as it
is the form of Lines whereof it is made, so is
the Denomination thereof. In the ancientest
Institution of the bearing of the Cross (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all controversie) it had this form; which
is taken to be the true shape of the Cross
whereupon our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
whose godly observation and use was in
great esteem in the Primitive Church; though
in latter times it hath been dishonourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by two opposed kinds of Fantasticks:
the one, who so superstitiously dote on it, that
they adore it like their God: the other, who so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55096:35"/>
unchristianly detest it, that they slander the
most godly and ancient use thereof, in our first
initiating unto Christ, as if it were some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
Idol. But the true Souldiers of such
a Captain need not to be ashamed to bear their
Generals Ensign. And this bearing was first
bestowed on such as had performed, or at least
undertaken some Service for Christ and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Profession: and therefore being duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
I hold it the most honourable Charge
to be found in Heraldry. But the form and
bearing hereof (as well as the Chevrons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
spoken of) hath been also depraved
through the inconsiderate handling of common
Painters. For which cause I have caused this
precedent Cross only to be cut after this fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the rest I have ensued the vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
bearing of how used, choosing rather to
sway with the multitude in matters of small
importance, than that I would seem to affect
I know not what singularity; <hi>Nemo enim er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem
arguit, qui cum multis errat.</hi> This
manner bearing of the patible Cross is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Rolls of greatest Antiquity, and it is
most consonant to Reason, that the stem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should be much longer than the cross part,
by how much it was requisite that the same
was to be deeply fixed in the Ground: So then
if we shall compare this ancient bearing with
that of modern times, we shall find this to be
natural, and that adulterate.</p>
               <p>Crosses do receive manifold varieties of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
according to the multiplicity of
their different shapes, and variable properties
of Lines whereof they are formed.</p>
               <p>The bearing of the Cross, is the express note
or badge of a Christian that he bear the same
according to the prescript, rule, and will of his
Lord and Master. For as <hi>Barth.</hi> saith, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signia
ad voluntatem Domini sunt portanda,
&amp; non alias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Crosses may signifie unto us Tribulations
and Afflictions, which (how burthensome so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may seem to the flesh) yet is there
much comfort to be found in them, to those
that make a right use of them, and do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the burthen of them chearfully, and without
recalcitration. For it is the property of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
that have been dandled (as I may say)
in Fortunes lap, and pampered with worldly
delights to forget both God and themselves,
and in their fulness to spurn and kick up the
heel, according to that saying of <hi>Moses</hi> in his
Song that he made a little before his death;
<hi>But he that should have been upright, when
he waxed fat, spurned with his heel: He was
fat, he was gross, he was laden with fatness,
therefore he forsook God that made him, and
regarded not the strong God of his Salvation,
Deut.</hi> 30. 15.</p>
               <p>Since then our Lord and Master (for our
sakes) did willingly take upon him this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and almost unsupportable Burthen, why
should we then, that would be counted his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Souldiers and Servants shrink thereat;
especially since by the Discipline of the Cross,
we are brought to the true knowledge of God,
his Omnipotency, Wisdom, Justice, Mercy,
and all other his Divine Attributes, and of our
own miserable and damnable Estate, through
our adherent and inherent corruption of sins,
as well Actual, as Original.</p>
               <p>A like form of bearing of this, is that Cross
which we find born in the Shield of St. <hi>George,</hi>
but diversly from this, both in Metal and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
which of some Armorists of <hi>Vptons</hi>
time (as himself noteth in his <hi>Discourse of
Arms</hi>) received in those days a very strange
and absurd kind of Blazon, which he there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
down after this manner; the Shield, Gules,
four Quarters, Argent: whose reason herein
(saith he) I do not allow, for that by such
manner of Blazon, the bearing of a plain Cross
shall never be known. Moreover, herein also
may we observe the Blazon hereof to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ròneous,
in that they say, Four Quarters:
which are indeed but so many Cantons; else
should they all four meet in the Center of
the Escocheon. This Ordinary is subject to
voiding and couping, as these Examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
shew.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Cross voided, Azure.
<hi>Panormitan</hi> writeth of
<hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>
(what time he
besieged <hi>Puteoli,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by the Sea side in
<hi>Campania</hi>) that resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
daily to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoar
for his Recreation,
upon a time he chanced to find the Corps of a
man of <hi>Genoua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> that had been cast
out of a Galley; and thereupon alighting spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
from his Horse, caused all others that were
near him to light; and commanded some to dig
a Grave, whilst others covered the naked
Corps: and he himself with his own hands
did make a Cross of Wood, which he sticked
fast at the head of the man so interred; to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that all Christian Offices may beseem the
greatest Kings; and that whatever death we
die, it is not material, so we live to Christ.
So great is the resemblance oftentimes of things
born in Coat-Armour, which yet in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
are much differing, that a man well seen
in Heraldry, may easily commit an error in the
Blazoning of them, as by comparing of this
Coat-Armour with the next will manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:
wherefore you must use an advised de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
in Blazoning, especially of Arms of
near resemblance.</p>

He beareth Or, a
Cross Patee, Sable, Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briated,
Gules. The
reason wherefore this
Cross is called Patee, I
will presently shew you
when I come to speak
of the Shield of <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader.</hi>
This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth near to the
former in respect of the double tract thereof;
yet doth it much differ from the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
forasmuch as the Charge of that is a
twofold Cross, <hi>viz.</hi> one surmounted of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and this a single Cross bordured or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with a hem or edge. Moreover, That
this is not a Cross of Gules, surmounted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
Sable, it is clear, because the edge
that goeth about this Cross is much narrower
than is the space between those two Crosses.
Besides, it cannot stand with the Rules of good
Armory, to bear colour upon colour, or metal
upon metal. This is called a Cross Fimbria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
of the Latin word <hi>Fimbria,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
an edge, welt, or hem for a Garment,
and is to be understood to be of the same
thickness with it, and not to lie either upon or
derneath.</p>

He beareth Ermyn,
a Cross engrailed,
Gules, by the Name of
<hi>Norwood,</hi> and is born

of his Majesties
Body, and Deputy-Governour
of <hi>Tangier:</hi>
And by <hi>Francis Norwood</hi> of <hi>Lackington</hi> in the
said County, Esquire.</p>
               <p>As this Cross is formed of bunched Lines, so
are there others that are composed of sundry
other sorts of Lines before shewed, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will inform you, and as you may in part
see by the Example following.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
a Cross wavy, voided,
Sable, by the Name of
<hi>Duckenfield</hi> in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
In Coats of
such bearing, you shall
not need to say in the
Blazon of them, that
the Charge (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the same be) is
voided of the Field; because when you say on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Voided, and no more, it is always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to be voided of the Field.</p>
               <p>Of all other sorts of Crosses, the Cross wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
is a more special note of Tribulation, in
regard it representeth the turbulent Waves or
Surges of the Seas, occasioned by some turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
gust or flaw of boystrous winds or storms,
causing a success of surging Billows; notifying
unto us consequent Afflictions and Troubles
following immediately one upon anothers
neck, which the Children of God must sustain
with a constant resolution, following therein
the instruction of <hi>Ecclesiasticus 2. 1. My Son,
if thou wilt come into the service of God,
stand fast in righteousness and fear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy Soul unto temptation.</hi> And again,
<hi>Settle thy heart and be patient, bow down
thine ear, and receive the words of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and shrink not away when thou art
assailed, but wait upon God patiently: Ioyn
thy self unto him, and depart not away, that
thou mayest be increased at thy last end,

de Scudamore</hi>
that lived in the time

It is termed
Fitched of the Latin
word <hi>Figo,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to fasten or make sure, because by the
means of the sharpness added to the foot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it becometh more apt to be fastned any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55096:37"/>
where. There is another sort of fitching of
Crosses that have the whole fourth part fige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as in this next Escocheon.</p>

The Field is <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
a Cross Patee on

<hi>Cadwallader,</hi> last
King of the <hi>Britains,</hi>
who slew <hi>Lothaire</hi>
King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwold</hi>
King of <hi>South-Saxons.</hi> I confess in
terming this kind of Cross, a Cross Patee, I
differ from <hi>Leigh,</hi> who calleth it Formy: But
<hi>Chassanaeus</hi> Blazons it Patee, and giveth this
reason thereof, <hi>Quia extremitates ejus sunt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulae,</hi>
because its ends are broad and opened,
<hi>Chass. fol. 28. Bara</hi> is of the same Opinion,
<hi>Bara le blazon des Arm.</hi> 67. and with these
agree many of our Blazoners.</p>

The Field is <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
a Cross Potent fitched,
<hi>Sol.</hi> This kind of Cross
was born by <hi>Etheldred</hi>
King of the <hi>West-Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
who lived <hi>Anno
Salutis,</hi> 946.</p>
               <p>What a Potent is, I
have formerly shewed in
the first Section, <hi>pag.</hi> 16. It may also be Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned
a Cross crowchee, for the resemblance
that it hath of a Crutch, which <hi>Chaucer</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a Potent, which is properly figetive: For
were it that the overthwart or cross part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should be exempted, then would the middle
part shew it self to be a perfect Crutch, used
for the slay and sustentation of feeble and aged
persons. Like as old Age is a blessing of God,
so contrariwise it is a Token of his heavy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
to be cut off before a man shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thereto: As appeareth by that saying of
God unto <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, <hi>Behold, the days
come that I will cut off thine Arm, and the
Arm of thy Fathers House, that there shall not
be an old man in thine house,</hi> 1 Sam. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, <hi>And there shall not be an old man in
thy house for ever,</hi> Verse 32. And further, <hi>And
all the multitude of thine house shall dye when
they be men,</hi> Verse 33. Moreover, it is said in
the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> on the contrary part,
<hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, There shall yet
old men and old women dwell in the Streets
of Ierusalem; and every man with his Staff
in his hand for very Age:</hi> Whereby is meant,
that God would preserve them in life, so long
as Nature might sustain them.</p>

The Field is <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
a Cross Patonce, Sol.
You may read in <hi>Leigh</hi>
his <hi>Accidence of Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
pag.</hi> 59. that King
<hi>Egbert</hi> did bear in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
a Cross of this form
or fashion in his left
hand, and in his Azure
coloured Banner like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Here you may observe how this Cross
Patonce differeth from the Cross Patee (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
before in the Shield of <hi>Cadwalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>)
and also from the Cross floury or fleurtee,
which I shall presently shew you in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thars</hi>
Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly made mention of
Voiding, in the Chapter of Bends, and of one
other Accident, namely Couping, in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fesses, I will now express them both in
one Example in this Escocheon following.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent, a
Cross voided and coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Sable, by the Name
of <hi>Woodnoth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another Accident whereunto this
Ordinary is subject, that is to say, Piercing.
Piercing is a penetration or perforation of
things that are of solid substance. And it is
threefold:
That is to say,
<list>
                     <item>Round.</item>
                     <item>Losengways.</item>
                     <item>Quadrate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As touching Round piercing, you have an
Example in this next following Escocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Cross couped, pierced,
Or, by the Name of
<hi>Grill.</hi> If this Round
in the midst were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other colour than of
the Field, then should
you account the same
to be a Charge to the
Cross; wherefore good
heed must be taken in Blazoning of Coats of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55096:37"/>
this kind, and chiefly of the Orbicular form in
the midst of the Charge; to the end that you
may know when to take the same for a pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and when for a charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Azure,
a Cross Moline pierced
Losenge-ways, Or. This
is the second form of
piercing before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned;
and the Coat
was born by <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
de Molineux</hi> of
<hi>Lancaster,</hi> that lived
in the Reign of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Cross Moline (<hi>Leigh</hi>
saith) that if it stood Saltire-ways, then should
you call it <hi>Ferre de Molin,</hi> that is to say, a
Mill-rind, or the Ink of a Mill: which to me
seemeth a very Paradox, that transposition
(being a thing meerly accidental) should give
a new denomination to the thing transposed,
and consequently alter the essence thereof:
<hi>Quia novum nomen dat novum esse rei;</hi> where
are new names, new things are supposed to be.
It were a thing worthy of admiration, that
Accidents should have such power in them:
For <hi>Aristotle, Physicorum</hi> 1. saith, <hi>Accidentia
possunt miraculose, &amp; non alias mutare subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi>
Accidents change not their Subject but by
Miracle. Addition doubtless and Subtraction,
are of greater force than Transmutation or
Location; yet is there no such power in them
as that they can alter the essence of any thing:
<hi>Quia augmentum vel diminutio</hi> (saith <hi>Chassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>) <hi>circa accidentia contractuum, non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponunt
contractum in diverso esse, neque per ea
intelligitur ab eo in substantialibus recessus:</hi>
the adding or diminishing of Accidents makes
not the thing lose the nature of his being.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leigh</hi> in Blazoning of this form of Cross,
maketh no mention at all of the piercing
thereof, perhaps because it resembleth the Ink
of a Mill, which is evermore pierced. This
is termed Quarter pierced, <hi>quasi Quadrate</hi>
pierced, for that the piercing is square as a
Trencher.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> was Reader of
the said Society in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>

Reader of the same Society in the Reign of
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and afterwards one of
the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to his Majesty
King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: and the said Sir

Grandfather, Father, and Son, were all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

               <p>So much of the Cross, with the Accidents
thereof: Now of that other Ordinary that is
framed also of a fourfold Line, that is to say, a
Saltire.</p>
               <p>A Saltire is an Ordinary consisting of a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line, whereof two are drawn from the
Dexter chief towards the Sinister base corners,
and the other from the Sinister chief towards
the Dexter base points, and do meet about
the midst by couples in acute Angles. I know
the Learned Geometer will find many more
Lines here than I do mention: but (as I said
of Lines in the Cross) this our description
greeth best with Heralds, and our purpose.</p>

born alone in the Escocheon: such are
these precedent Examples before handled.</p>
               <p>By manifold bearing of Ordinaries, I mean
the bearing of divers Ordinaries of the same
kind, whether the same be born of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alone, or else conjunctly with some of
their Subdivisions.</p>
               <p>Which form of bearing

               <p>What is meant by the bearing of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of one kind, one upon another, may be
easily conceived by these four Escocheons next
following.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Ermyn,
a Cross, Gules, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
of another,
Argent, by the Name
of <hi>Malton.</hi> Amongst
the Crosses formerly
exemplified, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an Example of one
much like to this in
shew, but yet much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the same, as you will easily find
by comparing them together: For in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
the Field sheweth through the innermost
parts thereof; but in this it is far otherwise:
forasmuch as herein are two Crosses, whereof
that which lyeth next the Field is Gules, and
the other that is placed upon the same is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
so as in this it can by no means be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be of that kind before handled, for
then should the Ermyns appear in the inner
part thereof, as well as in the rest of the Field,
then might you boldly call the same a Cross
voided, as that formerly handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Vert, a
Cross couped, Argent,
charged with another,
Gules. This Example
doth more apparently
express the double
charge shewed in the
last precedent Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for that the Cross
that lieth next the Field
is made more spacious than the former: and
withal, it doth inform our understanding, that
there is great difference between the bearing
of this, and of the Cross fimbriated, herein,
that in the Cross fimbriated, the edges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
do occupy the least portion thereof; and in
this the surmounting Cross hath the least part
of the same. This therefore cannot by any
means be understood to be a Cross fimbriated,
for so should the guard or edge thereof be larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the thing that is said to be guarded,
which were a very absurd affirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Saltire, Or, charged
with another, Vert, by
the Name of <hi>Andrews.</hi>
What hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
said in the last
precedent Example
touching the Cross,
doth hold also in this
and other like Bearings:
for in things having a
conformity or resemblance one of another, the
same reason holdeth in the one as in the other;
where contrariwise, of things having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
or likeness, the reason is diverse.
This Engine (as <hi>Leigh</hi> noteth) in old time
was of the height of a man, and was born of
such as used to scale the Walls of Cities or
Towns (which then were but low) and it was
driven full of pins fit for that purpose. <hi>Vpton</hi>
saith it was an Engine to catch wild Beasts,
and therefore bestowed upon rich and covetous
persons, that willingly will not part from
their Substance.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to Examples of Ordinaries
of the same kind born one besides another:
such are these next following, and their
like.</p>
               <p>

Lord of <hi>Berchem</hi>

And as there
are Ordinaries of this
kind born in streight
Line, so are they also
born in Lines Unde, as in Example. The bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55096:40"/>
of Piles, Pales, Bends, Barrs, and their
extracted parts, was called of old Heralds,
Restrial, in respect of their strength and solid
substance, which is able to abide the stress and
force of any trial they shall be put unto.</p>

such Ordinaries, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of themselves, or
else by reason of some
charge imposed upon
them, do challenge the
third part of the Field, are exempted from
this kind of bearing one besides another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of such the Field can contain but one of
them at once. But their Derivatives or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions
may well be sorted with them in the
same Escocheon; as a Pale between two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorses,
a Bend between two Cotisses, and such
like of the same kind; as in Example.</p>

As these Cotisses are born plain, so shall
you find them varied after the divers forms of
Lines before expressed, as in these Examples
following may in part be seen: And <hi>Vptons</hi>
assertion (before delivered) touching their
diversity of shape approved; as by practice the
diligent Observer shall easily perceive.</p>

use of that sort of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Anguled Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that in Blazon we
term by the name of
Dancett; and is in shape like to that other
sort of acute Anguled Line, which is there
named Indented, but differeth from the same
only in quantity, wherein these do exceed
those, as being more spaciously drawn than
they.</p>

He beareth Azure,
three Bars waved, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
by the Name of
<hi>Samford.</hi> To the end
I may make plain (by
demonstration) the use
of the several forms of
Lines before expressed;
I made choice of this
Coat-Armour, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
the third sort of bunched Lines there
mentioned. This kind of bearing may put
us in mind, that like as in a tempestuous
storm, the Seas being troubled, do raise their
waves one immediately upon another: So
likewise hath God ordained that one trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
should succeed another to keep his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
in continual exercise, and may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
experiments of his gracious Providence
and Fatherly care, in preserving of them in
all their troubles, and giving them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
event, and happy end of all their
Afflictions; as appeareth <hi>Iob 5. 19. He shall
deliver thee in six troubles, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
the evil shall not touch thee.</hi> It is a
blessed thing to be under Gods correction,
as witnesseth <hi>Iob 5. 17. Behold, blessed is
the man whom God correcteth, therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
not thou the chastisement of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
for he maketh the wound and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it up; he smiteth, and his hands make
whole,</hi> Verse 18. Again, <hi>He delivereth the
poor in affliction, and openeth their Ear in
trouble,</hi> Job 36. 15. By afflictions God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the hearts of his Children to feel their
sins, that they may come to him by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as he did <hi>Manasseth. And if they be
bound in fetters, and tied with cords of
affliction</hi> (Job 36. 8.) <hi>Then will he shew
them their work, and their transgressions
that they have exceeded,</hi> Verse 9. <hi>Behold,
God exalteth by his power; what teacher is
like unto him?</hi> Verse 22. Affliction bringeth
us to knowledge and acknowledging of our
sins, as we may see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 17.</p>

Argent, which is Metal upon Metal, a kind

condemned for false Armory: but such
kind of falsity is evermore meant of Metal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Metal, or Colour upon Colour, placed in

Shields, and those pertaining to distinct

from whom many worthy Persons of

of divers kinds born one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you must observe, that if they be both
of one Metal, Colour, or Furr, their parts
contingent are not severed by purfle, for

what Ordinaries they are, notwithstanding
the defect of the purfle.</p>

to inform the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of studious Armorists, that as

the same kind, are found born one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and withal to occasion them to pry

manners of bearing, which numbers of them

unworthy of more than ordinary Observation.

               <p>HAving performed the Task which our

proper Charges, together with
their making, and divers manner of bearing:
the same orderly Progression now calleth us
to the handling of common Charges, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the second Member of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution.
By common Charges I mean all
such other Charges hereafter following, as are

               <p>Things Natural (according to Philosophers)
are Essences by themselves subsisting: <hi>Res na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis
est essentia per se subsistens.</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
and in manner infinite are these things
Natural, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> noteth, saying, <hi>Multae
sunt, &amp; propè infinitae, non tam res, quàm
rerum species, in Coelis, in Aere, in Terris,
in Aquis:</hi> therefore it is not to be expected,
that I should in exemplifying of them, pass
through all the particulars of them; but only
touch superficially some of their chiefest, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of that innumerable variety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I may manifest in what ranks, and under
what heads, each peculiar thing must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
according to their several kinds, and
so redeem them from all former confused mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Of things Natural, some are <list>
                     <item>Formal.</item>
                     <item>Material.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The formal Nature is most simple and pure,
and consisteth of the propriety of its own
form, without any body at all; of which
sort are Spirits, which (according to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius</hi>
are <hi>Essentiae formatae rationales &amp;
immortales;</hi> Essences perfectly formed, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and immortal: I say, perfectly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to distinguish them from the Souls of men,
whose forming is not perfect in it self, but is
for the informing and perfecting of the Body
and the whole Man.</p>

               <p>Angels, in the Opinion of most men) are
incorporeal Essences of a spiritual Nature, void
of all material Substance. <hi>Angelus</hi> in Latin,
is the same that <hi>Nuntius</hi> is, that is to say a
Messenger; and the same is a name of Office,
and not of Nature, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Psalm</hi> 104. saying, <hi>Quaeris nomen hujus
naturae? Spiritus est. Quaeris officium? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus est.</hi>
Will you know the nature of it?
It is a Spirit. Will you know the Office of it?
It is an Angel or Messenger. The like may
we find (saith he) in man: <hi>Nomen naturae
Homo, officii Miles: nomen naturae Vir, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii
Praetor:</hi> To be a man, is a name of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
To be a Souldier or Pretor, is a name of
Office. Angels are Messengers, by whom God
hath manifested his will and power to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in Christ Jesus: In which respect also the
Ministers of God are called in Scriptures Gods
Angels, and therefore to be honoured as his
Embassadours and Messengers; and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is <hi>Evangelium,</hi> the good Angelical
Message of life eternal with the Angels in
Heaven.</p>
               <p>All Angels are of like spiritual Substance,
of like intelligent faculty, of like will and
choice; In fine, all of them created alike
good, and in nature perfect. Nevertheless,
as all men by nature and natural dignity are
alike, but by accident some of them are of
more esteem and worthiness than others: So
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55096:44"/>
it is also with Angels, inasmuch as some of
them (if we give credit to Philosophers) are
appointed to attend the motion of the Heavens,
others to repress the rage of Devils, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<hi>Iob</hi> 8. Others have charge of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Kingdoms, and to keep under the
rage of Tyrants, as is manifest <hi>Daniel</hi> 20.
Some have charge of some particular Church,
others of Apostles and Pastors, and others of
private Persons, <hi>Psalm</hi> 91. And all of them
are by Scripture said to be <hi>Ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this diversity of Functions, and several
Administrations, it is thought (because some
of these Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces are of higher imployment
than others are) that some of them are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
called Angels, some Archangels, some
Vertues, some Dominations, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
expresly sheweth.</p>
               <p>And albeit these heavenly Spirits be in their
own Nature void of all corporeal or material
Substance, yet is it certain, when it pleased
God so to imploy them, they had assumpted
Bodies for the time, to the end they might
then more effectually accomplish the service
that God had injoyned them. Such Bodies had
the three Angels that appeared to <hi>Abraham,
Gen.</hi> 18. Such Bodies also had the two Angels
that came unto <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. And as God
gave them Bodies for that time, so did he give
them also the Faculties answerable to such Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<hi>viz.</hi> to walk, talk, eat, drink, and such
like. These Bodies and bodily Faculties
were given them, to the end they might more
familiarly converse and discourse with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to whom they were sent, and the better
perform the charge enjoyned them, insomuch
as they did unfeignedly eat and drink, as <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
noteth; whereby they did the better
conceal their proper Nature, until such time
as they should make known unto men what
they were indeed. Hereupon it seemeth the
Ancients of fore-past Ages have used the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Angels in Coat-Armours, according to
those bodily shapes and habits wherein they
appeared unto men, as in Example.</p>

Glory to God on high, and on Earth peace.
This Coat may well beseem any Ambassadour

Furthermore, amongst the persons
there assembled, I find that the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi>
bare for his Coat an Archangel, couped
at the breast, the wings display'd, and signed
in the forehead with a Cross. And that <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,

with his hands conjoyned, and elevated on his

This Coat is said to be
born by <hi>Maellock Krwm</hi> of <hi>Wales.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this form of kneeling well fitteth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
to shew their continual adoring of their
Almighty King, in whose Chamber of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
they daily wait: but that we should
kneel to them, that themselves condemn in
the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Angel-worship. And indeed a madness
it is, when Christ commands us to pray, <hi>O
our Father,</hi> that any should teach us to pray,
<hi>O my Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Angels, Cherubims (whose use in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is less frequent) are to be handled. Of
these I find two Examples of several bearing;
the one out of <hi>Hieron. Bara,</hi> expressing the
sole bearing of a Cherub: another out of <hi>Leigh,</hi>
of a Cherub born upon an Ordinary: to which
I have thought fit to add a Coat of Name,
for a more manifest proof of their use in Arms,
as also to shew that they are born as well

with Ordinaries between them, as upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries.</p>

<hi>Luna.</hi> As to the forms
of those Cherubims
that covered the Ark,
it is of some holden, that they had the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of certain Birds, such as never any man
hath seen; but that <hi>Moses</hi> saw in his most
blessed Vision such shapes upon the Throne of
God. But <hi>Ioseph. Lib. Antiq. Iudaic.</hi> 8. saith,
<hi>Hae Cherubicae effigies quanam specie fuerint

shape these Cherubims were, no mortal man
can conjecture or utter.</p>

shew how speedily they
went about the Lords
business, Cherubim
(according to <hi>Zanchius, lib. 2. de Nomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Angelorum</hi>) is not the name of any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Angels, or Celestial Hierarchy (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would have it) but such as may well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with all Angels: Nither doth that Name
always signifie their Nature, or ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but for a certain reason, even so long as
they do appear to be such, as by those Names
they are signified to be. And it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that Cherub betokeneth the singular
Number, and Cherubim the plural Number.</p>

Sphere that glistereth so gloriously, as
that it dazeleth the sharpest sight of man, and
is called <hi>Caelum Empyreum,</hi> the fiery Heaven;
whereof we shall be better able to judge and
speak, when God shall bring us thither, and
yet our Star-gazers will take upon them to
talk so confidently and particularly of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Bodies, as if they had been
there, and surveyed every corner thereof. This
Celestial Globe (according to <hi>Scribonius</hi>) is
the Mansion Place and Place of all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Natures, wherein the Angels, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the blessed of God, do with endless joy
behold the presence of Almighty God face to
face. To this place (according to the same
Author) were <hi>Enoch, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> rapt
up before their deaths.</p>
               <p>But now for more orderly progression here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
forasmuch as we have occasion here offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to speak of a Sphere, we will first shew
what a Sphere is, and so proceed to the rest.</p>
               <p>A Sphere is a figure or body exactly round
of all parts, and void of all Angles and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The spherical or round form is of all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55096:45"/>
other the most perfect, as also the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
capable, and fit for motion, in as much
as it is void of all corners, which might give
impediment to moving, therefore is this form
most agreeable to the Heavens and Celestial
Bodies, which are evermore in continual and
restless motion. It was requisite then, that
the perfectest Body (such as the Heavens are)
should receive the perfectest form, which is the
orbicular or round figure. <hi>Figura Sphaerica</hi>
(saith <hi>Aristotle, lib, de Coelo &amp; Mundo) est
omnium figurarum nobilior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The motion of the Heavens is the most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and unlaboured of all motions,</hi> Movetur
enim sine labore, &amp; fatigatione, Arist. de
Coelo 2. <hi>As also it is said in</hi> Ecclesiast. 16. 26.
The Lord hath set his works in good order from
the beginning, and part of them be sundred
from the other, when the first made them. He
hath garnished his works for ever, and their
beginning so long as they shall endure: they
are not hungry, nor wearied in their labours,
nor cease from their offices, <hi>Verse 27. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
None of them hindreth another, neither
was any of them disobedient to his words,
<hi>Verse</hi> 28. He buildeth his Spheres in the
Heaven, and hath laid the foundations of
the Globe of Elements in the Earth: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the waters of the Sea, and poureth
them out upon the open Earth; the LORD
is his Name, Amos 9. 6.</p>
               <p>The matter whereof the Heavens are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
hath in it this natural property, not to
be moved violently, neither yet naturally to
rest. As the same Author testifieth in these
words, <hi>Natura materiae Coeli est innatu non
movere violenter, &amp; non quiescere naturaliter,
Lib. de Coelo:</hi> without intermission is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heavens. Therefore are high and
noble Spirits resembled to the Celestial Bodies
according to <hi>Lipsius, Alti aethereique animi,
ut ipse aether, semper gaudent motu:</hi> Men of
etherial or heavenly Spir its cannot be idle, but
are evermore in action, and exercise of things
commendable and vertuous, being thereto
moved and quickned by an honest and free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and affection of the will and desire of
the mind: <hi>Omnia enim honesta opera</hi> (saith
<hi>Seneca) voluntas inchoat, occasio perficit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But vertue hardly receiveth her due merit
at all seasons. Nevertheless, <hi>Saepe honorata
est virtus, etiam ubi eam fefellit exitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The circular Motion receiveth beginning in
it self, and hath the smoothest passage: for in
all other forms you shall find Angels, either
more or less, which do give impediments to
motion, whereby they give occasion of some
stay or rest (as I have said before). There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behooved, that the sincerest Body
should be fitted with the simplest form and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this kind of motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
is signified the very eternity of God,
wherein there is neither beginning nor ending
to be found; and therefore it is rightly said
by the Apostle, <hi>The invisible things of God
are conceived and understood by his creatures:</hi>
as also his Everlasting Power and Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
whereof his visible works are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Characters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> in his description of
God, resembleth him to a Sphere, saying,
<hi>Deus est Sphaera, qui ratione sapientiaque
comprehenditur, cujus centrum est ubique,
circumferentia verò nusquam, &amp;c.</hi> God is
a Sphere that is apprehended by reason, whose
center is every where, and his circumference
no where. For God hath neither beginning
nor ending: he wants beginning, because he
was not made by any, but was himself the
Creator of all things: And he is void of ending,
by reason that he had no beginning: <hi>Nam
quicquid finitur, in sua principiaresolvitur;</hi>
Whatsoever hath an end, the same is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into that it was at the first.</p>
               <p>As touching the Substance of the Heavens,
<hi>Scribonius</hi> saith, that it is <hi>Corpus constans
ex aqua, in firmissimam essentiam instar pellis
extensae concameratum.</hi> It is a Body (saith
he) consisting of Water, in the most solid
Substance thereof spread out Vault-ways like
a Skin.</p>
               <p>Though it may seem to thee (courteous
Reader) that I undertake a needless labour in
manifesting that the glorious Heavens and
Earth, were formed and framed by the most
powerful God, a thing so frequent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, and also so clear, as that no
man can doubt thereof: yet give me leave for
my own particular, who do labour to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
every occasion to publish the glory of the
Eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Omnipotent God (which is the
main and principal end of our Creation) es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
since the Order of my Method requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the same; and that <hi>bonum aliquod saepius
repetitum delectat;</hi> Give me leave, I say, in
this my latter impression, to reprove my self
for my too much neglected duty in my former;
that so, though very late, yet at the last, I
may prefer the Glory of God before the Order
of Method.</p>
               <p>The Moveable Sphere of the Heaven is the
Firmament. The Firmament is that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
moving Heaven, which with his swift Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
swayeth all the Inferiour Orbs, and
is called in Latin <hi>Firmamentum</hi> (according to
<hi>Scribonius) à firmitate,</hi> that is, of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
thereof; meaning (as I conceive) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the durable subsisting of it, or else the
unmoveableness of the two Poles, Artick and
Antartick: otherwise, one self same thing
cannot be said to be moveable and constant,
but in a diverse respect; even as an Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel
in a Clock, though still in motion,
yet both in respect of the metalline solidity,
and of the sure fastning to the Axle, it may
be said to be Firm and Unmoveable. If any
man bear a representation of the Heavens,
in his Coat-Armour, whether the same have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55096:45"/>
the likeness of a Solid or Armil Sphere, they
must be reduced to this head: of this kind did
the famous <hi>Archimede</hi> chuse for his Device,
who before his death, commanded that a
Sphere should be engraven on his Sepulchre.
And such a bearing is honourable for any great
Professor of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> not such witless Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and Fortune-tellers as usually deceive the
World with their idle Predictions; but those
Noble Spirits, whose Eagle-eyes search out
the true Natures, Revolutions, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those Supernal Essences.</p>
               <p>The regardful consideration of the Heavens
and the Ornaments thereof, together with
their certain and orderly motions, should
mightily move and provoke us to raise up our
thoughts, from the love and contemplation of
base and earthly Objects (whereon we usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dote) to the admiration of his unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power and love of his incomprehensible
goodness, who made such a wonderful Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture;
first, to serve for our use in this life;
and afterward, to be our blessed Palace and
Mansion in a better life. For though all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
demonstrate the wisdom of their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Workmaster, yet the <hi>Heavens</hi> especially
<hi>declare his glory, and the Firmament his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-work:</hi>
which made the godly King <hi>David</hi>
to rise out of his Bed in the night, to behold
the Heavens, and thereby to call to mind the
perversity of Man, which never keeps the
course that God prescribeth, whereas those
Bodies, though void of sense, yet from their
first Creation never faltered in their endless
journeys.</p>
               <p>Now since I have demonstrated and laid
open unto you what a Sphere is, the form,
perfection, dignity, property, motion, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof, and the like, I will now shew
unto you an Example of a Shield, illustrated
with manifold variety of Celestial Bodies, &amp;c.
which will be very necessary and commodious
to be inserted in this place.</p>

The Field is Or, a

               <p>These were the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
wherewith the
Shield of that famous

               <p>By this invention did he labour to manifest
unto us, than there is no Shield more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to resist the vehement and violent assaults
of adverse Fortune; that for a man to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
throughout with the compleat Armour
of Cardinal Vertues, so shall he be fitted and
prepared to sustain whatsoever brunt or forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
encounter shall assail them.</p>
               <p>If we shall compare this Shield of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
thus garnished and furnished, with manifold
varieties of things, both Celestial and Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial,
with those Coat-Armours that consist
of Lyons, Griffins, Eagles, and such other
Animals, or ravenous Creatures, we shall find
that to be more available to chase away and
foil all passionate perturbations of the mind,
occasioned by the concurrence of some sudden
and unexpected danger, than any, or all of
these together can be; by how much that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth
a mixture of calamities and comforts
together. For as the Globe of the Earth doth
represent unto us the dreadful and dismal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that attend our mortal state, by reason of
the manifold mutability of things Sublunary,
to the daunting (oftimes) of the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant:
so contrariwise, the Celestial forms do
represent unto us an Antidote or Preservative
against all dangerous events and accidents,
when we call to mind that those Celestial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or rather Gods power in them, is able to
divert or mitigate in a moment all harmful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and dangers whatsoever, be they never
so deadly. For these Celestial Bodies are Gods
mighty and strong Army, wherewith he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
discomfiteth and subdueth his Enemies,
and such as seek the spoil and destruction of
his chosen people: as we may see <hi>Iudges 5.
20. They fought from heaven, even the Stars
in their courses fought against</hi> Sisera. <hi>The Sun
stayed his course at the prayer of</hi> Joshua, 10. 12.
<hi>And the Sun abode, and the Moon stood still,
until the people avenged themselves upon their
enemies,</hi> Verse 13. <hi>And there was no day like
that before it, nor after it, that the Lord
hearkned to the voice of man, for the Lord
fought for Israel.</hi> And again, <hi>Ecclesiast. 46.
4. Stood not the Sun still by his means, and one
day was as long as two,</hi> Verse 14.</p>
               <p>By these visible forms we should be incited
and provoked (upon their view) to invocate
the most powerful God for his aid and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when we find our selves any way
distressed or beset with perils by the Example
of <hi>Ioshua:</hi> He called unto the most High Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
when the Enemies pressed upon him
on every side, and the mighty Lord heard
him, and fought for him with Hailstones,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55096:46"/>
and with mighty power. So should we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
like comfort in all distresses, as <hi>Iosua</hi>
did. Thus should their view put us evermore
in mind, to raise our thoughts to Godward,
and take every occasion to glorifie him, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
him for his aid; and say with the
Kingly Prophet <hi>David, I lift my eyes to the
hills from whence cometh my help, &amp;c.</hi> So
should we evermore in all distresses find the
comfort of his ever ready, and never failing
promise and providence: <hi>For in all things, O
Lord, thou hast magnified and glorified thy
people, and hast not despised to assist them in
every time and place, Wisdom</hi> 29. 21.</p>
               <p>These kinds of Coat-Armours are so much
more noble and excellent, than these that we
receive by descent from our Progenitors (as
remunerations of their vertuous demerits) by
how much they have in them store of Art,
witty Invention, and of efficacy to admonish
and put us in mind to persist in the performance
of our Duties.</p>
               <p>This manner of adorning of Shields doth
<hi>Aldrovandus</hi> commend above all other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishings,
saying, <hi>Nihil aequè atque Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,
ab omnibus adversis tuetur, nihil ejus
explicatu aptius est ad scutum exornandum
&amp; honestius.</hi> There is nothing that doth so
safely protect a man against the damage of
adverse Fortune, as Philosophy doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any thing more fit and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beautifie a Shield withal, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
thereof.</p>
               <p>Emblems, Hieroglyphicks, and Ensigns of
Noble Families, inasmuch as they do instruct
our eyes unto vertue, they cannot be defaced
or blemished without great wickedness: The
reason thereof doth <hi>Farnesius</hi> give in these
words, <hi>Cum virtutum imaginibus tantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus,
quantum mutis praeceptoribus: Si il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
tamen mutae dici possunt, quae in silentio
omni Doctrinâ sunt verbosiora.</hi> Of all the
things that are (saith <hi>Cicero</hi>) there is nothing
in the world that is better, nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
nothing more beautiful and glorious
to behold, and not only that there is, but that
nothing can be thought or imagined to be of
more surpassing beauty than the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>Lipsius</hi> annexeth this addition, examine
the universality thereof, consider the great
and small parts thereof, and you shall find
them composed and compacted in such orderly
sort, as that they cannot possibly be bettered
for use, or more glorious to behold. The
consideration whereof moved King <hi>David</hi> to
break forth in admiration.</p>
               <p>The Spherical Figure is of all other forms
the fairest, the most capable, and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest,
and comprehendeth all other forms.
In a Spherical Line the end is all one with the
beginning, therefore it doth aptly agree with
the noblest and perfectest Body, such as the
Heavens are.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that more apparently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the Spherical or round form of the
Heavens, than doth the Sun by his Circular
motion: <hi>The Sun,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Eccles. 1. 5.
riseth and goeth down, and draweth to his
place where he riseth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the most simple body, the simplest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is due, as also the simplest form and
shape.</p>
               <p>Those things are said to be moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
labour, which are moved without any
intermission or rest, or any appetite or desire
of rest; such is the motion of the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are Circular or Round: in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion there is no rest at all.</p>
               <p>That the World is Orbicular or Round, it
is manifest by the infallible testimony of the
Prophet <hi>David, Psalm 89. The heavens are
thine, the earth also is thine, thou hast laid
the foundation of the round world, and all
they that dwell therein, Psalm</hi> 24. 1. The
Orbicular form that we observe to be in Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies is to them natural, but accidental
to the Elements: according to that saying,
<hi>Figura Sphaerica in Coelestibus essentialiter,
in Elementis verò accidentaliter. Arist. 1. de
Coelo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Star (which is next to be considered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Heaven) is a permanent and constant
Essence, and the more condensat or compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
part of the Sphere, wherein it is fixed,
for the illuminating of Inferiour Bodies: for
albeit it be an usual distinction, that of Stars
some are fixed, and some are planetary or
wandring, yet they are indeed all fixed alike,
and setled in one certain part of the Sphere,
but in respect of our eye, and in reference of
their motions one of another, they have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
aspect, and so have gotten a diverse
name. It is holden that the fixed Stars are
discerned by their sparkling or twinckling, by
reason that our sight being bound as it were by
the forcibleness of their resplendent rays, our
eyes do become wavering and trembling in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them; and for this cause ought all
Stars to be made with their rays or points wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Star, Argent, by the
Name of <hi>Ingleby.</hi> If
this Star were born
Or, which is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Colour, it would
add much more grace
unto it, especially in
regard of the Azury
Field, the proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Heavens, wherein Stars have their
natural Mansion. For a Star, saith <hi>Farnesius,</hi>
is a Mystical Character, or Figure of God, to
whom all Worship and Religion doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appertain; for like as Stars are called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Stellae, a Stando,</hi> because they be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
fixed in the Firmament: so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55096:46"/>
more constant or of more perpetuity
than God, whose sacred Will is the regular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of all things whatsoever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may it be said not unfitly, that they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God and Religion, or otherwise some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
quality shining above the ruder sort of
men, as a Star in the obscurity of the night.</p>
               <p>Now the chiefest, but not the sole end, of the
Creation of Stars, was not alone to give light,
and with their influence to be assisting to the
Sun and Moon, in their procreation, producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fructification of the Seeds, Sets, Plants,
and Herbs committed to the Earth; but also
to the designation and foreshewing of times
and seasons, like as the Sun and Moon were,
as shall be shewed in place convenient hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
As for Example; The rising of the Star
<hi>Arcturus,</hi> placed near to the Bear, called
<hi>Vrsa Major,</hi> or the greater Bear, denoteth
unto us the presence of the Spring.</p>
               <p>This Star sheweth it self after the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> as a manifest
note of the beginning of the Spring, when the
Sun entreth the sign of <hi>Aries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rising of the Pleiades or seven Stars doth
demonstrate unto us that the Harvest Season is
at hand; and so forth of others. We may
read hereof <hi>Iob</hi> 38. where he speaketh of
the influence of these and of other Stars.</p>
               <p>The most part of all the Stars are, as it
were, publishers and proclaimers to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us what we ought to do in each season
concerning the things serving for the use of this
present life.</p>
               <p>Stars are Gods Instruments whereby he
worketh the effects of his Providence in these
Inferiour Bodies; <hi>Instrumento autem utitur
Artifex pro suo Arbitrio;</hi> An Artificer useth
his Tool at his pleasure, and to serve his will.
In vain therefore are the predictions of them
that take upon them to foretell of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
and that shall come to pass in future
time; and will confidently affirm what good
or evil fortune shall befall a man: A thing that
is only known to the secret will of God, and
resteth in his Divine Providence to dispose
thereof at his good pleasure; as appeareth
<hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 24.</p>
               <p>As to the number of points whereof a Star
consisteth, we must observe, they must never
be fewer than six; but when the same is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of more, then must you in blazoning of
them express their certain number: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you shall find a Star formed of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
points, as in this next Example shall
appear.</p>
               <p>

a Coat-Armour (as some

the Charge surmounting

Red, which is an Imperial Colour, and is
sometimes <hi>per Synecdochen,</hi> taken (as the
thing signified) for the sign it self that is
thereby represented: And white, being a

glorious beauty of their Order and Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is said, That it is a Camp pitched on
high, shining in the Firmament of Heaven.
<hi>The beauty of the Heavens are the glorious
Stars, and the Ornament that shineth in the
high places of the Lord. By the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the holy One they continue in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and fail not in their watch.</hi> And the

               <p>Stars are sometimes found pierced, and other
whiles charged; for the difference of which
two forms of bearing, you have had a Rule
formerly delivered. Moreover, it is a Rule
infallible, That the piercing of Stars must be
evermore round; for the piercing square, and
Losenge-ways, are repugnant to the nature of
Stars. Here I will give you a general Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
touching bearing of Ordinaries and
common Charges together.

               <p>This General Rule I have thought good to
set down in this place, here being my first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the handling of common Charges,
and where their mixt bearing with Ordinaries
is first mentioned, to the end that the same
may serve as the stern of a Ship to direct your
understanding, touching such interposed bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any of the common Charges with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries;
because I labour to shun all idle itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and multiplicity of unprofitable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
tending to one and the same end. This
form of bearing shall you find dispersedly, yet
not confusedly, exemplified in this Work, that
will give approbation to the generality of this
note, which doth not warrant this form of
bearing alone in these, but also generally in
all other Coat-Armours of like kind. Of these
several forms of bearing, I have chosen some
particular Examples, as in these next Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheons,
and others, shall follow in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Sable, a
Star of eight points,
between two Flanches,
Ermyn, on a Canton,
Argent, a Sinister hand,
couped at the Wrist,
Gules. This is the
Coat-Armour of Sir
<hi>Iohn Hobart</hi> of <hi>Blick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge</hi>
in the County of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> Knight and Baronet, Heir-male to Sir
<hi>Henry Hobart</hi> Knight and Baronet, Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

from the second Son of Sir <hi>Iames Hobart</hi> of
<hi>Hales-hall</hi> in the said County, Attorney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. Stars are
numbred amongst the Host of Heaven, for that
it pleaseth God sometimes to execute his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the wicked, with no less dreadful
destruction by them than by numerous and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant
Armies, as appeareth by the place of
Scripture by me formerly cited, <hi>Iudges</hi> 5. As
touching the colour of Stars, I hold it sufficient
to name them only when they be born proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in their natural colour, which is Or;
but if they be of any other colour, then the
same must be named. As for the Canton thus
charged, it being an augmentation or remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
given by our late Dread Soveraign
King <hi>Iames,</hi> to such as his Majesty advanced
to the Dignity of Baronet (it being an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Degree by him erected,) One of which
number was Sir <hi>Henry Hobart,</hi> Knight and
Baronet, and late Lord Chief Justice of the
Court of <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> Father to this Sir
<hi>Iohn Hobart.</hi> I shall have better occasion to
speak thereof in the sixth Section, and second
Chapter. When I come to treat of such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
Signs, as by the Soveraigns favour are
sometimes assigned for Augmentations.</p>

on a Chief indented,
Gules, three Stars, by

When you find any
Ordinary charged upon
the Field (having no
other Charge, as in this
Example) you must
reckon their Charging
to be a Dignity unto them, forasmuch as
they are deemed to be thereby greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
In regard whereof they are called
Honourable Ordinaries. Like as this Chief is
charged, so shall you find the Bend, Chevron,
Fess, Saltire, Barr, and all other the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Ordinaries, charged upon, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we observed, and hereafter shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

Ermyn, by the Name

do name three Stars,
as if the Canton were
away, as well to the
end that the manner
of their position may
be perfectly understood
by such Blazon; as also to shew that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
doth not rebate the Star in the Dexter
point, but only doth surmount the same.</p>

both of the said County, Esquires.
These Stars are said to be born in Orle, or Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
but they cannot be properly said to be
an Orle of Stars, because they have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
to fasten them together, but are born
severally and apart one from another.</p>

may put us in mind
of that threefold path
of Religious passage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heavenly <hi>Canaan,
viz.</hi> Moderation and Sobriety towards our
selves, Piety towards God, and Justice towards
men.</p>
               <p>The Stars may signifie unto us a hopeful
success and happy event, in the turbulent
time of tempestuous flaws and turmoils of this
present life.</p>
               <p>Like as in the Winter season the Stars shine
more clear and resplendent than in the Summer
time; even so is the glory and vertue of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and magnanimous spirit more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned in a shattered and broken estate,
than in prosperity.</p>
               <p>Whensoever there is a separation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Charges born in Coat-Armours, by reason
of the Interposition of some of the before
mentioned Ordinaries, then are they not term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ordinaries, but most worthy Partitions;
and they are such (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) as though
the common Charge annexed do occupy more
than one point of the Escocheon, yet every
of them is in as great effect as though it were
one only thing, by the reason of Soveraignty
of the same Partition interposed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a taste of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and variable manner of bearing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
commixt with common Charges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the General Rule formerly given.
As for Example, that common Charges are
born with Ordinaries, you may see in the first
and third of these six Escocheons: That they
be born upon Ordinaries, it is manifest by the
second Escocheon: That they are parted by
Ordinaries interposed between them, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by these last Escocheons: That they
are born in form of Ordinaries, or Ordinary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
it is clear by the fourth Escocheon.
Note, that albeit I have here set down but one
Example of each of these particular forms of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55096:48"/>
bearing, yet must you hold that in every of
these several sorts there are divers other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
kinds of composition of Coat-Armours,
as shall appear hereafter at large unto the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Observer. Furthermore, whereas I have
given only two Examples of common Charges
born with Ordinaries, one Example of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
charged upon, one of Ordinaries inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and one of common Charges born Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary-ways,
or in form of Ordinaries; you
must understand by the first sort, all common
Charges whatsoever, born with a Pale, Bend,
Fess, Chevron, or any other of the Ordinaries
before-named in any sort by the second: all
sorts of Ordinaries charged upon, with any
kind of common Charge: by the third, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of whatsoever sort of Ordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
common Charges. Lastly, by the fourth,
you must understand all sorts of common
Charges born in form, or after the manner of a
Cross, Saltire, Pale, Bend, Fess, or of any other
of the said Ordinaries. These have I here
handled briefly, because I must of necessity deal
more copiously in each particular of them in
places better fitting thereunto.</p>

               <p>THus far of such Stars which we called
fixed: Now of those Planets whose
shapes are of most use in Heraldry; I
mean those two glorious Lights, the one for
the Day, the other for the Night: for, as for
the other <hi>five Planets,</hi> because their aspect is
less to the view, therefore they cannot easily
admit a different form from the fixed
Stars. The Sun is the very fountain of Light,
and (as some Philosophers think) of Heat
also; and all the splendor which the Moon hath,
it borroweth from the Sun, and therefore as
the Sun goeth farther off, or nearer to her, so
her light doth increase or diminish. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both these and the Stars there is a great
conformity, in respect of their sparkling and
resplendent beams, which are in appearance
more evident, and in operation more effectual,
or at least more palpably discerned in these, by
reason of their nearness unto us, than of those
that are from us so far remote. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are unlike, that the beautiful and
blazing brightness of these is oftentimes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the passion of darkning or eclipsing.
Of whose glistering, eclipsing, and variety
of forms, we have bearing, these and other
like Examples following.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Sun in his glory, by the
Name of S. <hi>Cleere.</hi> To
express the Colour of
the Sun, being thus
born, I hold it needless;
for who knoweth not
that the chiefest glory
and highest commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may be given
to the Sun doth consist in this, that he is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with the brightness of his proper beams:
which cannot be better expressed than by the
Colour Gold, or Gold-yellow. But if it be
born of any other than this, which is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
colour, then must the same be expresly
mentioned, as in due place shall appear. The
Sun is called in Latin <hi>Sol,</hi> according to some
Authors, <hi>Vel quia solus ex omnibus sideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
est tantus, vel quia cùm est exortus, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuratis
aliis solus apparet:</hi> for that only he is
so great, or for that when he is risen, he so
darkneth all the rest with his splendor, as that
he alone appeareth in Heaven, as a Monarch
in his Kingdom. Of the glory and excellency
of the Sun, it is said, <hi>Ecclus. 42. 16. The Sun
that shineth, looketh on all things, and all the
works thereof are full of the glory of the Lord.</hi>
And again, <hi>Ecclus. 43. 2. The Sun also, a
marvelous instrument, when he appeareth
declareth at his going out the work of the most
High. At Noon it burneth the Country, and
who may abide the heat thereof?</hi> Verse 3. <hi>The
Sun burneth the Mountains three times more
than he that keepeth a Furnace with continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l
heat. It casteth out the fiery vapours, and with
the shining beams blindeth the eyes. Great is
the Lord that made it, and by his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he causeth it to run hastily.</hi> And if we
consider how many foggy mists it dispelleth,
how many noisome vapours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t consumeth, and
how all Creatures are overcome with the heat
thereof, we shall find that King <hi>David</hi> did
very aptly compare it to a Giant (for strength)
refreshed with wine, (for the heat) to run his
course, for his swift motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Chief, Argent, on the
lower part thereof a
Cloud, the Suns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent
Rays there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
issuing, Proper, by
the Name of <hi>Lesone</hi> in
<hi>Northamptonshire.</hi> The
former Example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Sun is born, doth
represent a visible form of a corporeal shape of
a Body, from which these Rays or Beams here
demonstrated may be apparently seen to issue;
And these are as it were strained through a
Cloud. Sometime one Ray or Beam of this
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55096:48"/>
glorious Planet is born in Coat-Armour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other Charge, as in this next Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure,
one Ray of the Sun,
issuing out of the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
corner of the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
Bend-ways, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
by the Name of
<hi>Aldam.</hi> Here I do not
in the Blazon make any
mention of the three
points or lines which are
on either side of the Ray, for in Nature they
have no Essence, but proceed from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Eye, which is not able to behold so
glorious an object as the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Sun eclipsed, Sable. If
this Colour were not
accidental in respect of
the eclipse of the Sun,
the same should not
have been named. The
Suns eclipse is occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Interposition
of the Moon, which
though it be far less in quantity, yet coming
betwixt us and the Body of the Sun, it doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Beams thereof, and debarreth us of
the sight of them, even as the interposition
of our hand, or any other small body, before
our eyes, doth debar us from the sight of some
greater Mountain. For to think that the Sun
doth lose his light by the Eclipse, as doth a
Candle being extinct, proceedeth out of meer
rustick ignorance: as the like error is in those
who think the Sun loseth his light, or goeth to
Bed every night, whereas it doth only remove
it self from our Horizon, to enlighten other
Countries situated in other parts of the world.
As was well expressed by <hi>Secundus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
who being demanded by <hi>Adrian</hi>
the Emperour what the Sun was, taking his
Table in hand, wrote in this manner; <hi>Sol est
Coeli oculus, caloris circuitus, splendor sine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casu,
diei ornatus, horarum distributor:</hi> It
is the eye of Heaven, the circuit of heat, a
shining without decay, the days ornament, the
hours distributor. The most miraculous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
of the Sun that ever was, happened then
when the Sun of Righteousness, the Son of
God, was on the Cross, when all the Earth
was so benighted at Noon-day, that <hi>Dio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>isius
Aeropagita</hi> a Heathen <hi>Athenian,</hi> cryed out,
<hi>Either the World was at an end, or the Maker
of it was suffering some great Agony.</hi> The Stars
and Planets hitherto spoken of do shine alike,
or after one manner. Now others there are
which shine after a divers sort: such are the
Moon and Comets, which we call Blazing Stars.
Neither are we ignorant, that in proper speech,
and truth of Philosophy, Comets are not Stars,
but Meteors: yet the Vulgar Opinion, and the
received name and shape used in Heraldry, may
warrant me for thus ranking them amongst
the Stars. But as touching the Moon, her
Light is meerly reflective, as the brightness
of a Looking-glass against the Sun; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that her substance is very unequal, as in
some parts of thicker substance, and in some
parts thinner, therefore she is unequally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
by the Sun-beams, which maketh the
weak eye, and weaker judgment, to fancy a
face of a man in the Moon: whence-we have
gotten the fashion of representing the Moon
with a face. But why the Sun should have
the like, I wot not; unless it be that he
should not be out-faced by the Moon, being his
inferiour. The most wise and provident God,
before the Creation of his other works, did
first create the Light, to teach man to lay the
first foundation of all his actions in the light of
true knowledge, thereby to direct his ways
aright, and that his doings be not reproved
<hi>as works of darkness:</hi> especially since God
would not suffer the Night it self to be so
wrapt in darkness, but that the Moon and
Stars should somewhat illuminate it. And
according to the divers apparitions of the
Moon, hath she her divers denominations in
Heraldry; as her Increment, in her increase;
her Complement, when she is at full; her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement,
in her waning; and her Detriment,
in her Change and Eclipse. And according
to these varieties, is she also diversly born
in Coat-Armour, as the Examples following
will shew.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules,
an Incressant, Or, by
the Name of <hi>Descus.</hi>
This is the state of
the Moon from her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into her first
Quarter, which is most
usually the seventh day
after the Change, unto
her full. In which time
she is more and more illuminated, until she
hath filled her Circle. This word Incressant
signifieth the Moons Increment, or increasing
estate; and it may fitly represent the rising
Fortunes of some hopeful Spark, illightned
and honoured by the gracious aspect and
beams of his Soveraign, who is the bright
Sun and Fountain of all the Light of glorious
Nobility, and may confer the Rays of his
Grace on whom it best pleaseth him.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Ermyn,
three Incressants, Gules.
This Coat pertained to
the Family of the

in the County of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Moon in her Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which is as much
as to say, the Moon il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
with her full
light) Proper. Here
you need not to name
the Colour of the Moon
for the Reason before
delivered in the first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Sun. The proper Colour of the
Moon we in Heraldry take to be Argent, both
for the weakness of the light, and also for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt the Blazoning of it and the Sun:
and therefore when we Blazon by Planets, we
name Gold <hi>Sol,</hi> and Silver <hi>Luna.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the use of the Moon, it is said, <hi>Eccles. 43.
6. The Moon also hath he made to appear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her season, that it should be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the Time, and a sign for the World,</hi>
Verse 7. <hi>The Feasts are appointed by the
Moon, the light thereof diminisheth unto
the end,</hi> Verse 8. <hi>The Moon is called after the
name thereof, and groweth wonderful in her
changing.</hi> The Moon is the Mistress by which
all moist, mutable, and unconstant things are
ruled; as <hi>Mulier, Mare, Flumina, Fontes;</hi>
a Woman, and the Sea, Rivers and Fountains;
the ebbing and flowing of the Sea following
the motions of the Moon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, a
Moon decressant, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
by the Name of
<hi>Delaluna.</hi> This is the
state of the Waning
Moon, when she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
from her Full,
and draweth to her
last Quarter, which
is accomplished most
commonly the seventh day after she hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Full, and receiveth a diminution of
her light, to the wasting of the one half
thereof; and from the said seventh day after
her Full, she diminisheth continually more
and more, until she become again (as many
honest men are) <hi>corniculata,</hi> sharp-horned,
and suffereth continually diminution unto the
instant of her Change; and differeth from her
prime state after the Change, only in this, that
the first (represented by the first of these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples)
is turned to the right hand of the
Escocheon, and this other to the left. And
hitherto I have proposed Examples of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
aspects, you shall now see her accidental
form; as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent, a
Moon in her detriment,
or Eclipse, Sable. The Moon is Eclipsed only
at such time as she is at
her full state, and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite unto
the Sun; when by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of the Earth
between them, she seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to our sight, for the time, to be deprived
of her light, through the shadow of the gross
body of the earth. This is a passive form of
the Moon; and such her Passions are called in
Latin, <hi>Labores Lunae,</hi> the throws or pangs
of the Moon. In former time the old Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
thought the Moon was in a Trance, and
used to shout and make a noise with Basons, to
wake her: Or else they supposed she was angry
with them, and therefore they howled till she
looked chearfully on them again. Of this
mutable state of the Moon, thus writeth the
Poet:
<q>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Nec par aut eadem nocturnae forma Dianae,</l>
                        <l>Esse potest usquam, semper hodierna sequente:</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Dame <hi>Cynthia</hi> imitates the Dames of our
Nation;</l>
                        <l>Every day she attires her self in a new
fashion.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Which occasioned a witty Moral related by
<hi>Plutarch</hi> (as I think) how on a time the
Moon sent for a Taylor to make her a Gown,
but he could never fit her, for it was either
too little, or too big for her; which was not
the Taylors fault, but her own inconstancy:
so impossible a thing it is to fit the humours of
one that is fickle and unstable.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find all these several
kinds of Lights before expressed, born toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Escocheon; as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure,
the Sun, the Full Moon,
and the Seven Stars,
Or, the two first in
Chief, and the last of
Orbicular form in base.
It is said that this Coat-Armour
pertained to
<hi>Iohannes de Fontibus,</hi>
sixth Bishop of <hi>Ely;</hi>
who had that (after a
sort) in his <hi>Escocheon,</hi> which <hi>Ioseph</hi> had in
his Dream, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 9. where the Sun, Moon,
and eleven Stars did do him reverence; signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55096:49"/>
his Father, Mother, and eleven Brethren.
For as in Scripture, so in Heathenish Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
also, the Sun and Moon were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Male and Female, and sometimes Man
and Wife; and as the Moon hath all her light
from the Sun, so hath the Wife from the
Husband; and as the Moon is ever lighter on
that side which looks towards the Sun, so
should the Wife study to be fairest in her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
eye. And many Wives in their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
absence do truly imitate the Moon in
this, that they are lightest when their Sun is
farthest from them. Howsoever this marriage
betwixt Sun and Moon was made up, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that once the Banes were forbidden; as
appeareth by one, who speaking of Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> days, and of her Marriage, relateth,
how when the Sun went first a woing to the
Lady Moon, all Nations (especially those of
hot Countries) preferred a Petition to <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
to hinder the Nuptials, alledging, that there
then being but one Sun, yet he scorched and
burned all, but if he should marry, and get
other Suns, the heat would so increase, as all
must needs perish: whereupon <hi>Iupiter</hi> stayed
the match for that time, or at least, was so
propitious, that no issue came of the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of those fiery flames. The several states
of the Moon increasing and decreasing before
handled, are now very rare in bearings, and
in manner antiquated: inasmuch as in these
days, not only their shapes, but their very
names also are extinct, and instead of them
we have another new coyned form, having
neither the name, shape, nor yet so much as
the shadow of the former remaining, as may
be seen in the next Escocheon.</p>

if we weigh the manifold mischiefs that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

this hot Eliment having
little affinity with that watry Mansion. Fire
betokeneth Zeal, and every Sacrifice was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

should burn, that come to offer Prayer or
Praise, and thanks to the Lord. The Holy
Ghost also descended upon the Apostles in fire,

               <p>HAving shewed by particular Examples
the bearing of simple Essences, or (at
the least) of such things as have a
mutual participation of qualities with them;
I will now proceed to the handling of the next
Member of the Distribution, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
Essences, or Natures of mixt Kinds.</p>
               <p>Such are <list>
                     <item>Brute, or without life.</item>
                     <item>Living.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>By Brute Natures I understand all Essences
whatsoever of mixt kind that are meerly void
of life. Such are <hi>Meteors,</hi> which are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
kinds of mixture, which by their strange
Apparitions do move their Beholders to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and these are called <hi>Corpora subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
because they are ingendred aloft in the
Airy Region. The matter whereof these
Meteors are ingendred, is a certain attracted
fume drawn up on high by the Operation of
the Sun and Stars.</p>
               <p>This fume or smoak is <list>
                     <item>Vapour.</item>
                     <item>Exhalation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Vapour is a moist kind of fume extracted
chiefly out of the Water, and therefore is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
dissolved again thereinto, and hence are
watry Meteors.</p>
               <p>Exhalation is a drier kind of fume, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up from the Earth, and apt to be inflamed,
and they are firy Meteors. There are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meteors formed of a mixture of both these
fumes.</p>
               <p>Firy Meteors are forms consisting of hot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
attracted into the Airy Region, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a hot quality, which at length breaketh
into a fire.</p>
               <p>And of these are <list>
                     <item>Simple.</item>
                     <item>Mixt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Simple firy Meteors are of divers sorts and
different forms, whereof there is little use in
Coat-Armour, except of the falling Star,
which of Blazoners is termed a Mullet; which
is an Exhalation inflamed above in the Air,
and stricken back with a Cloud, whereby it is
forced to run downwards in such sort, that
to the Ignorant a Star seemeth to fall. There
is oftentimes found upon the Earth a certain
gelly fallen from above, and dispersed into
divers points, which of many is taken to be
the substance of the Falling Star or Mullet.
Note that such Mullets born in Coat-Armour,
are now most usual of five points, but ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you shall find them born of six points.</p>
               <p>And so I have seen them in divers very old
Rolls, in the Custody of that worthy Knight,
Sir <hi>Richard Saint George,</hi> now <hi>Clarencieux</hi>
King of Arms, whose industrious travel in the
careful Collection of such Antiquities, and his
free communicating of the same to the studious
in that way, merits much.</p>

yet the Mullet in Heraldry hath a more noble

some Divine quality bestowed from above,
whereby men do shine in Vertue, Learning,

Sometimes the round in
the midst of the Mullet
is not of the Colour of

a piercing, but for a Charge of other significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Gerard Leigh</hi> seemeth to prescribe this
General Rule touching Mullets; that if the
same do consist of even points, they must be
called Rowels; meaning (as I conceive) Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of Spurs. But he might more aptly have
applyed the same in particular unto Mullets
pierced, in respect of their nearer resemblance
of such Rowels than those that are not pierced.
Some are of Opinion, that all Mullets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they consist of five or six points, pierced,
or unpierced, are Rowels of Spurs, with this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55096:53"/>
difference, that those which are unpierced, are
Rowels not fully finished or made up by their
Maker; and their Reason is, because that in

this word, used by them in blazon, from a
kind of fish so called; not that which is most
usually known by the name of Mullet, but
another not much unlike in shape to that
thing which is used in Armory; and as I am
informed, is often found upon the Sands, at

This Chevron in blazon
is called <hi>Rompe,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Rompu,</hi> from the
French Verb <hi>Rompre,</hi>
derived from the Latin
<hi>Rumpo, Rumpere,</hi> to
break. Thus have you Examples of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
bearing of these simple Meteors; to wit,
the bearing of them sole, unpierced, pierced,
some of five points, and others of six.</p>
               <p>So much of simple firy Meteors, so far forth
as there is use of them in Coat-Armour: Now
of such Meteors as are of mixt kind, according
to the distribution before delivered in the next
president. These are firy Meteors bred of an
Exhalation somewhat more gross and impure,
than those before specified, by reason of a more
thick and slimy vapour whereof they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</p>
               <p>Meteors of this kind are <list>
                     <item>Thunder.</item>
                     <item>Lightning.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thunder is an inflamed Exhalation, which
by his powerful force breaketh thorow the
Clouds violently, with great noise and terror.
The forcible power thereof is rather appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the ear, than subjected to the sight:
nevertheless, the ancient times have devised a
certain imaginary form whereby they would
express the forcible power thereof, as also of
the Lightning.</p>
               <p>Thunder is supposed to be ingendred two
manner of ways, <hi>viz.</hi> when either a hot or dry
vapour is inclosed in a cold and moist Cloud,
and being unable to contain it self therein, by
reason of the contrariety, it laboureth by all
means to find a vent, and so striving by all
means to get passage, it maketh way with
great vehemency and horror of sound: such
as a glowing Gad of Iron, or any other firy
matter maketh, when water is infused there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in abundance, or that it is therein drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it maketh a furious and murmuring sound.
Such is that weak and feeble sort of Thunder,
that seemeth to be ingendred in some Region
of the Air far remote from us, yielding only
(for a small time) a kind of turbulent noise or
murmuring.</p>
               <p>Or else it is ingendred in a more violent
manner, to wit, when this inclosed dry and
combustible matter, being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lamed in the
Clouds of contrary qualities, doth break out
with vehemency, then doth it yield a terrible
and forcible sound, not unlike a great piece of
Ordnance when it is overcharged. And this
sound, thus ingendred, is called <hi>Thunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sort of sound is used oftentimes Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
as when God threatneth his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against Sin, he is said to thunder them
out. In this sense doth <hi>Petrarch</hi> use the same,
saying, <hi>Deus ideo tonat in Coelis, ut tu in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
bene vivas, quodque amoxe debueras, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
metu facias.</hi> For unless God loved man,
he would never threaten him, but rather pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him; forasmuch as man doth evermore
minister many and those grievous occasions of
execution of Gods Judgments.</p>
               <p>Lightning is a vehement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruption of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Exhalation, proceeding from Thunder;
which though it is in time after the Thunder,
yet is first represented to our senses, by reason
that our sight is far more subtil and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
than is our hearing. And in regard that
Thunder and Lightning do both proceed from
one self cause, they have in such their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

               <p>Hitherto of Firy Meteors; now of such as
be watry.</p>
               <p>Watry Meteors are certain cold and moist
Vapours, copiously attracted by the powerful
operation of the Heavenly Bodies into the Air,
and there transmutated into their several
forms. Of these there are divers sorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Clouds are most usually born in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>A Cloud is a gross Vapour, attracted into
the middle Region of the Air, and there thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by reason of the coldness of the place,
having in it store of matter apt to ingender
water. A Cloud (according to <hi>Zanchius</hi>)
is a moist thick Vapour, attracted from the
waters by the heat of the Sun, unto the middle
Region of the Air, and there thickned by the
coldness thereof, and so continueth until it be
again dissolved by the Suns heat, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into rain, and doth distill down in
drops. <hi>Zanch. de Meteoris aqueis,</hi> 483. The
Clouds are said to be Gods Chariots, as we may
see <hi>Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Chambers in the waters, and maketh the
Clouds his Chariot, and walketh upon the wings
of the winds.</hi> The Clouds are Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein he containeth and retaineth at
his pleasure, the shours of Rain, as in Bottles:
as we may see <hi>Iob 38. 37. Who can number the
Clouds by wisdom? Or who can cease the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clouds are resembled to a Spunge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with water, and God with the hand
of his Providence wringeth the Spunge mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
not pressing out all the moisture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at once, but leasurely, and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
after a gentle and soaking manner. No
Pencil can make a true representation of
Clouds, because every instant and moment of
time, doth add unto them some kind of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
whereby it differeth from that it was
late before: nevertheless, former times have
coyned (of these also) a conceited form, as in
these next Escocheons may be seen.</p>

thin, and unequal
Cloud, by the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Beams of the

of the rare use of the
Rain-bow in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
perhaps may be
for that the Colours thereof cannot be aptly
counterfeited, as witnesseth <hi>Aristotle, Meteor.
lib.</hi> 3. saying, <hi>Soli colores Iridis non possunt
fieri a Pictoribus:</hi> whereby it seemeth of all
other the hardest thing to imitate. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Colours of the Rain-bow (according to
<hi>Scribonius</hi>) are Red, Green, Blew, and Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
The Field hereof is Argent, issuant out
of two petit Clouds in Fess, Azure, a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,
in the Nombril point a Star, proper. The
Rain-bow is a Token of Gods Covenant made
with <hi>Noah,</hi> and in him with all people; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<hi>Genesis 9. 13. I have set my Bow in

the Clouds, and it shall be for a sign of the
Covenant between me and the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> As
touching the Beauty of the Rain-bow, it is said,
<hi>Ecclus. 43. 11. Look upon the Rain-bow, and
praise him that made it: very beautiful is it
in the brightness thereof; it compasseth the
Heaven about with a Circle, and the hand
most High hath bended it, Ibid.</hi> 12. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
worthily is he to be so praised, who
when he could have made a Bow to destroy us,
rather chose to make this Bow to assure us he
would not destroy us. A noble president, to
teach Nobles to use their strength and their
weapons rather to preserve and help, then to
overthrow or hurt those who are under their
power. <hi>Farnesius</hi> saith, that the Rain-bow
appearing in the South, betokeneth Rain; in
the West, it foresheweth Thunder; and in the
East, prognosticates fair weather.</p>

Nature, having life. Mixt Natures that are
living, are Corporeal Essences, endued with
a Vegetable Soul: for here we use this word
Soul, as also the word Life, in his largest
signification. A Vegetable Soul is a faculty or
power that giveth life unto Bodies.</p>
               <p>Whereby they do live After a sort,
or,
Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Such as do live after a sort, or less perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are all sorts of Mettals; which because they
are supposed to grow and increase in the Earth,
we will (for our present use) ascribe life unto
them.</p>
               <p>Mettals are Bodies imperfectly living, and are

               <p>Those that are altogether hard, are Stones

               <p>Stones precious are of that sort that we call
in Latin <hi>Gemmae;</hi> which are of estimation either
for that they are rarely to be gotten, or for
some vertue phansied to be in them, or for that
they are such as wherewith mans Eye is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
delighted by reason of their pureness
and beautiful transparent substance. Of which
kind are the Diamond, Topaz, Escarbuncle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald,
Ruby, and such like. Of which sorts,
twelve of chiefest note were appointed by
God himself to be used in the principal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the High Priest, when he appeared
before the Lord, presenting therein the Names
of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> to shew how
precious in his sight is the People and Nation
which serveth him, as himself prescribeth.
But of all these several kinds, the Escarbuncle is
of most use in Arms, and is born as in these
next Escocheons appeareth.</p>

anciently to the
Earls of <hi>Anjou,</hi> from

a little Coal, because it sparkleth like
fire, and casteth forth, as it were, fiery
Rays. There is another kind of, but fiery Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle,
which Chyrurgions can best handle;
one of those of the Lapidaries is more to be
desired than ten of the other.</p>

the Church Porch
door of <hi>Magnotsfield</hi>

and is born by

of Minerals a Vegetable life, even so, and much
more (saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) is it judged that
Stones have this life; yea, and that they have
a passive capacity of Sickness, of Age, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of Death. Whether this be so or not, sure
it is a pretty device, to advance their estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with those who already too much dote on
them; insomuch, as it was said of the Roman
Empresses, that some of them did ware whole

used by great Persons.
<hi>Iohannes Digionius,</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> gave
for his Device, <hi>Ignitabulum Silicem feriens,</hi>
a Steel and a Flint-stone, which well agreed
with his disposition. This Earl was taken
Prisoner by <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Turk, and when he

much esteemed by the Turk, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him to let him go free, saying, He
foresaw in him, that when he came home, he
would set a great part of Christendom in a
combustion; as indeed he did, by reason of the
murther of <hi>Lewis,</hi> Brother to the French King
<hi>Charles</hi> the sixth; which his murther, the

He beareth, Azure,
three Mill-stones, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
by the Name of
<hi>Milveton.</hi> The Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
representeth unto
us the mutual converse
of human Society; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Milstones are never
occupied single, but by
couples; and each of them
standeth in need of the
others help, for the performance of the work
whereunto they are ordained. Hereupon our
mutual Amities and Assistances are termed in
Latin, <hi>Necessitudines Amicitiae,</hi> because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man standeth in need of some fast and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Friend, by whose counsel and advice he
may be supported for the better compassing of
whatsoever affairs of importance he shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
Of all the rare Stones before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
in my judgment men have cause to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
the Milstone (though here we have
placed it amongst baser Stones) the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stone of all others; yet I would be loath
to wish my Lady to wear it at her ear.</p>
               <p>So much of Mettals or Minerals (for I use the
word in the largest sense) that are hard and
not liquefiable; there are other also which we
reckoned to be hardly liquefiable, in respect of
their brittle nature; such are Alom, Salt, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Chalk, &amp;c. but there is no use of them in
Arms. Because in this Chapter I have spoken
of precious Stones, divers of which are of use
in Heraldry, for blazoning of the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of Nobility (as my self have often occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do in sundry parts of this Work:) before
I proceed further, I will set down those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Stones, as they answer to their several
Mettals and Colours; together with the Planets
also, which I use only in the Atchievements of
Kings and great Princes.

               <p>Forasmuch as I am now to treat of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Animals, and of their particular kinds; I
must excuse my self in two things before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the exemplifying of them: The one,
that there is no cause that any man should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
at my hands an express demonstration of
each particular Species of them; and that I
should run through and display their manifold
and almost innumerable kinds, for that would
be a tedious travel, and (besides) an infinite
and unnecessary charge and cost, and withal
far wide from the project of my prefixed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The other thing (and the same more
pertinent to that I do intend) is, That in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Vegetables and Sensitives, I purpose
only to distribute their several ranks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution,
according to their Order to them
prescribed by Nature, which to express is my
chiefest drift, and the principal scope that I
do aim at.</p>
               <p>Of the perfect sort of Creatures there are
many kinds, whereof some are of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and more worthy than others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their more excellent kind of life, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of soul.</p>
               <p>Of these the less perfect sort of Bodies were
first created; and then such as were of more
perfection. Plants are more worthy than Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and Animals of more reckoning than
Plants: therefore were these first created, and
those afterwards.</p>
               <p>Of Animals wherewith God did adorn the
Air, the Waters, and the Earth, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds, whereof some were more worthy
than others; in the Creation of these did God
observe the same order.</p>
               <p>Between the Creation of Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
it pleased God in his unsearchable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to interpose the creation of the Stars
wherewith he beautified the Heavens, he did
it to this end, to give us to understand, That
albeit the Sun with his light and motion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Stars, do concur in the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Plants and Animals, nevertheless their
Generation is not to be attributed simply to the
influence and power of these Celestial Bodies;
but only to the Omnipotency of God, inasmuch
as by his powerful Word he commanded the
Earth to produce all sorts of Plants and their
Fruits, before the Stars were created.</p>
               <p>From the most fertile and pleasant Garden of
<hi>Eden,</hi> unto the most barren and desolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
may we see and behold the great and
wonderful works of God, and take occasion
to extol his Omnipotency, Wisdom, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
As we may observe <hi>Isai. 41. 9. I will set in the
Wilderness the Cedar, the Shittah tree, and the
Myrhe tree, and the Pine tree; and I will set in
the Wilderness the Firr tree, the Elm, and the
Box together. Therefore let them see, and know,
and let them consider and understand together,
that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and
that the holy One of Israel hath created it, v.</hi> 20.
Hence we may gather that there is no object
so mean that presenteth it self to our view,
but will minister some just occasion to glorifie
God.</p>
               <p>Men are accustomed to attribute the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of these, either to the influence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or to the travel and industry of man;
but these were produced before any other of
like kind could be found upon the face of the
Earth, whereof it might be imagined they
might receive being; for as yet there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fallen any rain to fructifie the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it might produce green herbs, nor as yet
was Man created, that might manure and till
the Ground for that purpose: therefore neither
were they produced naturally, or of their own
accord, nor yet by the Art, Skill, or Industry
of Man, but by the immediate Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God.</p>
               <p>The reason that moved <hi>Moses</hi> to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Plants and Herbs, how that they
were produced by the vertue and power of
Gods Word only, and not naturally, or by the
skill and industry of man; neither yet of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
nor of any other of the infinite number
of things created (<hi>Genes.</hi> 1. 11.) was this,
because the Generation of Plants and Herbs
might be much more doubted of, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
of other things.</p>
               <p>Of the first springing of Trees in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Et germinare fecerat Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Elohim è terra omnem arborem concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem,
id est, visu, &amp; bonam ad escam;</hi> which
words do comprehend all the desirable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Fruit trees: for in them we expect that
their fruits should be either delightful to the
Eye, or that they should be fit for food and
wholsom, and that they be also fragrant and
sweet smelling: For the fruits of Trees, the
better they be, the more odoriferous they
are.</p>
               <p>That the Trees wherewith Paradise was
planted, had all these qualities, it is manifest
by the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> in that he saith, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscibilem
ad visum, &amp; bonam ad escam:</hi>
whereby we gather that the sight is delighted
with things beautiful and glorious, the smell
with sweet and pleasant savours, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with things of sweet and pleasant taste.
And none of these are in themselves evil; for
such was the constitution of <hi>Adam</hi> before he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55096:55"/>
transgressed, that he might have delighted
himself in them all without offence; and to
that end did God create them, that he should
use them with thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> describeth unto us two principal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Garden of <hi>Paradise,</hi> whereby he
laieth before us the pleasantness of the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, and also the beauty and fertility
of the soil. The first of these qualities was,
that it was replenished with all sorts of Trees,
not only most pleasant and delightful to the
eye, but also most pleasant to the taste; for
that they produced the best and sweetest fruits:
The other quality was, that the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the Garden of <hi>Paradise</hi> was
surrounded and invironed with a River, being
distributed into four heads, which did highly
beautifie the same, and made it most pleasant
to the view.</p>
               <p>In this discription <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention of
two Trees of special qualities, that were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the midst of <hi>Paradise:</hi> The one named
the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> the other the <hi>Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first of these had a vivificant power in
it self, the fruit whereof was ordained to this
end; That being eaten, it would enable a man
never to feel sickness, feebleness, old age, or
death, but should evermore continue in the
same state of strength and agility of body:
This was the efficacy and power that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this Tree, whereof it was never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived:
Therefore was this quality after a sort
natural thereunto.</p>
               <p>For this cause was there a Cherub set at the
entrance of <hi>Paradise,</hi> to keep out such as
would enter the same, and eat of the fruit of
the Tree of Life; that he should not always
live that kind of life.</p>
               <p>How behooful the knowledge of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and operations of Trees, Plants, Herbs,
and other Vegetables are, for the extolling and
manifesting the Omnipotency, Wisdom, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
loving favour and fatherly providence of
our most gracious God towards sinful man is,
in that he hath created for the behoof and use
of man, as well touching his necessary food
and raiment, as for recreation and delight,
we may evidently perceive by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
investigation of the vertues and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all sorts of Vegetables: For (besides
other his admirable qualities wherewith he
was richly endued) he had surpassing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the vertues, operations and qualities
of Herbs and other Vegetables; insomuch that
he was able to reason, discourse and dispute,
not only of Beasts, Fowls, creeping things
and Fishes, but of Trees also and Plants, from
the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the Hyssop that
springeth out of the wall, that is, from the
highest and tallest Tree to the smallest Shrub
and lowest Herb. Thus we see the knowledge
and skill in natural Philosophy to be holden in
great estimation in all Ages, insomuch as it
hath been reckoned a study well befitting the
dignity of a King, yea, of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was
the wisest King that ever was, and a Type of
our Saviour Christ. But to return to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable.</p>
               <p>Such are said to be Vegetable, as have in
them a lively power of growing, budding,
leafing, blossoming and fructifying, as Trees,
Plants, Herbs, Grass, &amp;c. And of these some
grow on Trunks or solid Bodies, some upon
flexible Stalks: some again grow upon a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Stem, as commonly all Trees do; some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
manifold Stems, as Shrubs, Roses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Trees are certain Plants springing from a
root with a single Trunk or Stem (for the
most part) shooting up in height, and delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with lims, sprigs or branches. Of these
Trees some are more proper to hot Countries;
as the Frankinsence Tree to <hi>Arabia;</hi> the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum,
Myrrhe, Mace and Nutmeg Trees, as
also the Pepper Trees, and such like, which
chiefly grow in <hi>India;</hi> the Plane Tree in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
and <hi>Arabia;</hi> the Pomegranate in <hi>Africa,</hi>
&amp;c. which I purposely pass over, and will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give Examples of other sorts to us better
known, whether they be Trees fruitful or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.
In giving Examples whereof I purpose
not to observe any precise order, but to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them pel mel one with another, because I
hold such curious sorting them, better fitting a
professor of Physick, or some Herbalist, than
an Armorist; to whom it sufficeth to shew su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,
that these, and their several parts,
are born in Coat-Armour, as well simply of
themselves, as also with things of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as in the Examples following may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Or, on a
Mount in Base, an Oak
acorned, proper, by the
name of <hi>Wood.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, at what
time by his powerful
word he did enable the
Earth to fructifie, and
produce Herbs and
Trees with their varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fruits, said, <hi>Let the earth bud forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his kind, the bud of herb that seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
seed; the fruitful tree which beareth fruit
according to his kind, which hath seed in it
self upon the earth; and it was so.</hi> Whereby
(saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) we are admonished, that they
should be preserved and nourished in the earth
unto the time of seed for our necessary use;
for that they profit little, until they be come
unto their full ripeness. The Oak is of the
strongest sort of Trees, and therefore may best
challenge the first place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:55096:56"/>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
on a Mount in a Base,
a Pine-apple Tree,
fructed, proper, by
the name of <hi>Pine.</hi>
There is a difference
between the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of seed of Trees
and of Herbs, as well
for the propagation,
as for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of their several
kinds; for the herbs do produce their seed in
their stalks without fruit; and the trees do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
theirs in their fruit.</p>
               <p>It is holden of some, that the Pine Tree is
a representation of death; forasmuch as the
same being once felled, or cut down by the
ground, the root thereof is said never to sprout
or spring any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, on a
Mount in Base, a Pear
Tree fructed, proper, by
the name of <hi>Pyrton.</hi> As
God for the necessary
sustenance of man, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
manifold varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of nourishment: so
likewise many sorts
were created, not only
for mans necessity, but also for his delight, both
to eye and taste; as too well appeared by the
first woman, whose rash affection in this kind
all her Posterity hath since rued. But withal,
God teacheth us by these dumb instructers,
that man should not be fruitless, lest he become
thereby fuel only fit for burning.</p>
               <p>Those proposed Examples are of whole
bearing of Trees: Now of their parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
their Leaves, Fruits, Slips, &amp;c. promiscuously,
as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules,
the stem or trunk of a
Tree eradicated, or
mooted up by the roots,
as also Couped in Pale,
sprouting out two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Argent, and is the

Gent. Branches must needs wither
which have neither shelter from above, nor
nourishment from beneath: being therein like
that Roman Embassage, where the one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
had a giddy head, and the other gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
feet; whereof one said, That it had neither
head nor foot.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Azure, a
Cheveron, Ermyn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three Oaken
slips acorned, proper,
by the name of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades.</hi>
By the words
formerly noted to be
extracted out of <hi>Gen.
1. 24. Let the earth bud
forth, &amp;c.</hi> we do gather
(saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) a diverse manner of conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the several kinds of Herbs and Trees
by propagation (through the production of
their Seeds, whereby their particular sorts are
preserved;) the one, that do bring forth their
seed in their stalks without fruit, and Trees do
produce their seed in their fruit.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent,

This Example is of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
nature from all
the former, those bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the signs of their
vegetation and life, but
this being mortified and
unvested of the virdure which sometimes it
had; which is the condition of all mortal men,
whose most flourishing estate must have a
change, their beauty turned to baldness and
withered wrinkles, and they leave all their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or their riches leave them: This is the
end of the Tree, and fruits of our worldly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
but the fruits of holiness will never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and the <hi>righteous man shall be as the tree
planted by the waters of life.</hi> Other Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons

Argent, by the
name of <hi>Penruddock.</hi>
That which I spake of
before touching the
Bend Crenelle, fitted
by Art for the scaling
of a Wall, the same
seemeth to be here naturally found. At the
first approach of King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror,
the green boughs of Trees, born by Souldiers,
served for an excellent stratagem of defence;
and as helpful an instrument of offence to the
Enemy may this trunked Tree be, when other
helps are wanting to the besiegers.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent,
three stocks or stumps
of Trees, couped and

name of <hi>Retowre.</hi> If
the top or boughs be
cut off, yet, the Root
standing, there is hope
of a new growth: but
when the Root is pluckt
up, there remaineth no hope of reviving. And
therefore that was a fearful warning, <hi>Now is
the Axe put to the Root;</hi> which should quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
us to the bearing of good fruits, lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

are the ancientest wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that is, being the
first clothing of our first
transgressing Parents.
And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, that they used not the
Leaves of any other Tree, to shew the torture
and anguish of Repentance, signified by the
roughness and sharpness wherewith this sort of
Leaf is beset. Our Saviour Christ liked not to
see Figg-leaves without fruit, and therefore
cursed the Tree: And accursed will their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

is in shew, and not in substance of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

The Field is Ermyn,

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> It is supposed that
there is great love, and
a natural sympathy betwixt the Elm Tree and
the Vine, because the Vine never prospereth
better than when it groweth by the Elm;
whereas the Elm it self is of all Trees the most
barren. So should those who have few good
parts in themselves, yet at least cherish and
support such as Nature and Art have enabled
to produce better fruits of their Industry.</p>

The Woodbine is
a loving and amorous plant, which embraceth
all that it grows near unto; but without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

different from them in
the manner of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,

One writes, that a little Girle being stung by
a Nettle in her Father's Garden, complained

it would bite them of their own house. Her
Father answered her, That it was the nature

all alike to it. Yet this property it hath, that
the harder you press it the less it will sting.</p>

to have been, (as still
they are) much used in
adorning the Temples

time of our Saviout's Nativity, and
thence to have taken that holy name. There
is a kind of Holly, that is void of these prickles,
and of gentler nature, and therefore called
Free-holly, which in my opinion is the best
Holly: and so it was in his, who saith, That

He beareth Azure,
three Pears, Or, by the
name of <hi>Stukeley.</hi> This
fruit, as other, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for the comfort
of man: But as the
Devil made use of the
Apple to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man; so did the
Devil's Imps use the
Pear to a wicked end, when the Monks of
<hi>Swinsted,</hi> inviting King <hi>Iohn</hi> to a Banquet,
poisoned him in a dish of Pears, though others
write it was in a Cup of Ale.</p>
               <p>Concerning the fruits of Trees, God in the
beginning gave unto man a free scope to use
them without restraint, only the fruit of the
<hi>Tree of Knowledge of good and evil</hi> excepted,
whereof he was prohibited the eating upon
pain to <hi>die the Death</hi> whensoever he should
taste thereof. In this prohibition God would,
that we should not so much respect the fruit of
the Tree, as the Soveraign Authority of him
that forbade the eating thereof; yea, this
chiefly and principally first; and secondly the
fruit, because of the interdiction.</p>
               <p>The end for which God did prohibit <hi>Adam</hi>
the eating of the fruit of the <hi>Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil</hi> was, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God had given him a Sovereign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on earth, yet was he not so absolute a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
and Commander, but that he had a
Lord Paramount, to whose hests he was sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and withal reverence to obey; and that he
should know that God, his Creator, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him, whose will should be unto him the
Rule of all Justice, and whereunto he should
conform all his actions, counsels, and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
that he should evermore have an awful
eye unto him, and always hope in him, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
fear, reverence, and love him. The end
I say was this, That <hi>Adam</hi> should know both
God, and himself: God as his true Creator,
himself to be his Creature; God to be his Lord,
himself his Servant; God a most bountiful and
magnificent giver of all good blessings, himself
God's Foster-child, and such a one as must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that whatsoever he possesseth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from God's free bounty and mercy;
and therefore should render unto him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
praise and thanks for the same, from the
ground and bottom of his heart.</p>

An Apple is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

as <hi>Plin. lib. 15.
cap.</hi> 22. comprehendeth Nuts also under this
name, albeit the same is most commonly taken
for this sort of fruit. If we desire to have
Apples to continue longer upon the Trees than
their accustomed season of ripening, we may
effect the same by wreathing of the boughs
and platting them together one in another, as
<hi>Farnesius</hi> noteth, saying, <hi>Praeter naturae tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
ex arbore pendebunt Poma, si ramuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los

this reason, That by means of such wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and platting the humour is more slowly
concocted or digested, so that they cannot ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
with that maturity, as those which are not
hindred of their natural passage and action.
Hereby we may learn, that Art worketh forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

we beforementioned, as a bearing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of one of the four Elements. As before
we honoured the Milstone with the name of
the chief of precious Stones, so may we justly
give precedence to this Plant above all other
in the World, no one kind of food being so
necessary for preservation of mans life as this;
which therefore the Scripture calls the <hi>staff of
bread,</hi> because it upholds the very being of
mankind. For which cause, as the Heathens
accounted <hi>Ceres,</hi> and others, as gods, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
means to increase Corn; so are those
to be held enemies to mankind, whosoever
through covetousness overthrow Tillage, as by
Inclosures, and depopulations of Villages, &amp;c.
And how inestimable a blessing Corn is, may
by this be conceived, that no Country is said
to have a Famine so long as it hath Corn,
though all other things be scarce: But if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things abound, and Corn be wanting, that
one want bringeth both the name and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

Corn is reckoned one of the chiefest,</hi> Lev. 26.

much inferiour to our
Wheat for use; but for
multiplication, beauty,

it: And of this most undoubtedly true
is the saying of our Saviour, that one Grain
bringeth forth <hi>fifty,</hi> yea an <hi>hundred fold:</hi> and
such should be the increases of God's graces in
us, which are not put into us there to die ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,

Argument here to satisfie a very natural man,

Rie stalks, Sable, by the

Were it that these stalks
had been born in their
proper kind, it would
have beautified the
Coat greatly, and made
the same much more
commendable for bearing, by how much
sweet and kindly ripened Corn is more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and to be desired, than that which is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
and mildew'd; that being a special blessing
of God, and this the express and manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God's heavy wrath inflicted upon
us for our sins; as appeareth in the Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
4. 9. <hi>I have smitten you with blasting and

The Field is Azure, a

pertaineth to
the ancient Family of

whose name was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
written <hi>Grosve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> or <hi>Grosvenor,</hi> as
it is at this day. They
bear this Garbe from
their Ancestors, who were of Consanguinity
to the ancient Earls of <hi>Chester,</hi> as it is proved
in the Record of that famous Suit betwixt Sir
<hi>Richard Scroope</hi> Plaintiff, and Sir <hi>Robert
Grosvenour</hi> Defendant, for their Arms, in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
12. <hi>Regis Richardi Secundi.</hi> For with

one <hi>Gilbert le Grosvenour,</hi> Nephew to the
said <hi>Hugh,</hi> who was Ancestor to the said Sir
<hi>Robert Grosvenour;</hi> from whom is lineally
descended Sir <hi>Richard Grosvenour</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi>
in the County Palatine of <hi>Chester,</hi> Knight and
Baronet, Heir-male of that Family; and is now
born by Sir <hi>Thomas Grosvenor</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> in the

the Arms of <hi>Vlster,</hi> is born by <hi>Walter Gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor</hi>
of <hi>Bishbury</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> Esquire.
A like unto this is born by <hi>Holmeshed,</hi> saving
that the band of that Garb is Vert. There is
a kind of wretched Cormorants, whose Garbs
are so fast bound, that the poor curseth their
merciless hearts. And such an one was <hi>Hatto</hi>
Abbot of <hi>Fulda,</hi> who suffered Rats rather to
eat up his corn, then he would help the wants
of the poor; but his punishment was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thereunto; for the Rats devoured him,
though he guarded himself in a Castle purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
built in the midst of the river <hi>Rhene,</hi>
which is there this day to be seen.</p>

He beareth Gules, 3
Garbs, Or, by the name

was Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi>
and held all that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

and was by King <hi>Henry</hi> the First disinherited.
Here you may observe that I mention not the
bands of Garbs, because they differ not in
Metal or Colour from the Garbs. Sometimes
you shall find these Garbs born with an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

do bear these Garbs for
a difference from the elder House that did bear
Or, only a Fess, Azure. And the reason of
the bearing of their Garbs was, for that they
would make known that they were descended

in of Beans, instead of giving of Voices or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages.
But <hi>Pythagoras</hi> taught his Scholars
to hate the Bean above all other Vegetables,
meaning perchance, that they should shun the
bearing of any Office; though others give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>NEXT after Herbs Nutritive, let us
take a taste of Herbs less Nutritive,
which are either Coronary or Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Coronary herbs are such, as in respect of

of a Regal Escocheon, originally born by the
French Kings, though tract of time hath made
the bearing of them more vulgar; even as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was in ancient times a wearing only for

through custome. Out of these several kinds

you that this Flower is

the Saltire charged containeth the third part
of the Field, according to the Rule formerly

The Field is Sable,
three Lilies slipped,
their stalks, seeds,
blades and leaves, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
These Arms per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the Colledge of
<hi>Winchester,</hi> founded by
the renowned Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
<hi>William Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Winton,</hi>
who contrived those many and most curious
Castles and other Buildings of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the Third's. And besides this goodly Colledge
of <hi>Winton,</hi> built another magnificent Colledge
(called the <hi>New Colledge)</hi> in the University
of <hi>Oxford:</hi> two such absolute Foundations, as
never any King of this Land did the like.
This <hi>Wickham</hi> having finished the Castle of
<hi>VVindsor,</hi> caused to be inscribed on the Wall
of the round Tower, <hi>This made VVickham;</hi>
which caused such as were envious of his high
favour, to suggest unto the King, that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
all the honour of that great Work to
himself: but he pleasantly satisfied the King,
saying, <hi>That he wrote not, VVickham made
this;</hi> but, <hi>This made VVickham;</hi> because by
his service in these Works he had gained his
Sovereign's Princely favour.</p>

The Trefoil is accounted the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's
Almanack, because when it shutteth
in the leaves, it foretelleth rain; and therefore
the Fess Nebule representing the rainy clouds,
is not unaptly joyned with it. This Leaf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grassy, some may marvel I should reckon
it amongst the Coronaries: but they must
know, that in ancient Roman times, amongst

the wearer.</p>

better befit Ladies and Gentlewomen, than
Knights and men of valour, whose worth must
be tried in the Field, not under a Rose-bed, or
in a Garden-plot; therefore the ancient Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
made choice rather of such herbs as grew

few Examples may
suffice to shew that all
others of like kind (which I for brevity sake
voluntarily pass over) are to be reduced unto
this Head of Coronary Herbs; from which we
will now proceed to the Physical, whose chief
and more frequent use consisteth in asswaging
or curing of Maladies and Diseases. And of
these some are Aromatical, which for the
most part, in respect of their familiar and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
nature, do serve for the corroborating and
comforting of the inward parts of man's body,
and for that purpose are oft used in meats; of
which sort are Saffron, Ginger, and such like:
Others are meerly Medicinal, and such as a
man (were it not for necessity) would wish
rather to wear in his Escocheon, than in his
Belly. Examples of which kinds I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
pass over, only as it were pointing out
with the finger unto what head they must be
reduced, if any such be born in Arms. Of the
Plants, Trees, Fruits, and Herbs beforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
some are Forein, and some Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical;
some grow in Mountains, some in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and Fenny Grounds, some by the Rivers,
some by the Sea-coast. Concerning their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
natures, and effects, Philosophers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
and Herbalists do seriously dispute; and
doubtless they are the admirable work of the
most Omnipotent God, who has sent as many
kinds of Medicines, as of Maladies; that as by
the one we may see our own wretchedness, so
by the other we might magnifie his goodness
towards man, on whom he hath bestowed <hi>Fruit
for meat, and Leaves for medicine.</hi>

               <p>HAving hitherto handled that part of our
distribution which comprehendeth
things Vegetable, proceed we now to
the other concerning things sensitive, which
are all sorts of Animals or Creatures indued
with senses. The senses, as likewise the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Soul, are things in themselves not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therefore estranged from the Herald's
uses: But because they reside in bodies of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
parts and qualities from any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned;
therefore in handling of these
sensitive Creatures, I hold it requisite to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with their parts (for of them the whole is
raised;) and these are either the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
or containing, or sustaining.</p>
               <p>But since we are now to speak of things sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
(and amongst them) first of Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Animals and their parts, it shall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to produce some few causes amongst
many, why these Terrestrial Animals and Man
were created in one day, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>sixth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, because God had appointed the Earth
to be the joint habitation of man and beast to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Secondly, in respect of the near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
both of bodily parts and natural
properties, that these Terrestrials have of
Man, in respect either of Fowls or of Fishes.
Lastly, for that very many of them were to serve
for man's ease and necessary use: As Oxen to till
the ground; Horses for his ease in travel; Dogs
to be watchful keepers of his house; and others
for other his necessary and Domestical uses.</p>
               <p>There is no Animal but hath at the least
these parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Head, wherewithal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
food, and wherein their senses have their
residence; a Belly, to receive and concoct his
meat; Intrails, whereby to eject the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
or excrements of aliment; Members also,
serving for the use and exercise of the senses,
and others ordained for motion from place to
place; for without these Members he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive food or nutriment, neither feel
nor move: Therefore there is neither labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55096:63"/>
beast, or beast of savage kind, domestical
reptiles, or other, that can be without these
bodily parts.</p>
               <p>By the name of Soul and Life, wherewith
all sorts of Animals are endued from God, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
teacheth us, that there is no living creature
to be found that hath not either true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
blood, or at the least some kind of hot
humour that is to it instead of blood; <hi>Anima
enim cujusque Animalis in Sanguine est,</hi> as
<hi>Moses</hi> teacheth <hi>Leviticus</hi> 17. and in sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places; and in the common received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of all men, <hi>In humido &amp; calido consistit
vita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is spoken of divers kinds of <hi>Insecta,</hi>
that there is no blood to be found in them, it is
to be understood to be meant of true, perfect,
and natural blood; but of necessity they must
have instead thereof some kind of humour in
them that hath the quality of blood, <hi>viz.</hi> that
is both hot and moist as afaresaid, else can they
not live.</p>
               <p>Concerning Animals in general, it is not to
be doubted, but that all sorts of them, as well
those of savage and ravenous kind, as those of
domestical and labouring kind, as also venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Serpents, of themselves, and of their own
nature, were themselves good, and might be
good to others, and profitable for man's use;
for asmuch as it is said, <hi>Et vidit Elohim quod
bonum:</hi> But in that they are now become noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and painful to man, that is <hi>per Accidens;</hi>
for this is occasioned by the sin and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man, whereby all things became accursed
for his sake.</p>
               <p>The utility or benefit that cometh to man
by these Terrestrial Animals is twofold; the
one pertaining to the Body, the other to the
Soul. The corporal benefit that cometh to
man by them, who knoweth not? For daily
experience sheweth us how beneficial the use of
horses, oxen, kine, calves, sheep, and other
sorts of beast and cattel of all sorts, are for the
service of man; whereof some serve us for
food, some for raiment, some for carriage,
some for tillage, and other for divers other uses.
Of this use of them <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>That God
hath subjected all things to man, Omnia sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecisti
sub pedibus ejus, &amp;c.</hi> and made him
Ruler over the fishes of the Sea, the fowls of
the Air, and the beasts of the Land; whereby
he giveth us to understand, That all sorts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
were created for the divers uses of man,
and each one of them ordained to a several
end. But their spiritual use is farr more noble
and excellent, by how much the soul surpasseth
the body in dignity and worthiness.</p>
               <p>And their use consisteth not alone in this,
that by the consideration of them we are led
to the knowledge of God, and of his wisdom,
power and goodness (for this use have all things
else that are created) as appeareth <hi>Romans</hi> 1.
and elsewhere: But also that in these Animals
God hath proposed to us such notable examples
of imitation, in respect of vices to be eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, the sacred Scriptures excepted, there
is no moral Precepts can better instruct us than
these Animals do, which are daily in our view,
and of which we have daily use: amongst these
we may produce some examples of fishes and
fowls, but many more may we gather from
Terrestrial Animals. And to the end we should
shun the ignorance of things, such especially
as are Celestial, <hi>David,</hi> the Kingly Prophet,
proposeth to us for examples, the Horse and
Mule saying, <hi>Non eritis sicut Equus &amp; Mulus,

               <p>Like as Natural Philosophy consisteth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, so doth it chiefly in the knowledge
of Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> in the understanding of their
wisdome, natures and properties: which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hath been approved by God himself from
the beginning; and not only approved, but
also ordained and given to <hi>Adam;</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi>
saith, God brought these Animals unto <hi>Adam,</hi>
to the end that he should advisedly view and
consider them; to the end that <hi>Adam</hi> should
give them names answerable to their shapes,
natures, proportion, and qualities; and that
the imposition of these names should not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
or at adventure (for God abhorreth all
disorder and confusion) but deliberately and
according to reason, so as every thing might
be aptly distinguished from other, by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
names, and according to their several
natures and dispositions; and that for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
that we hearing their names, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
their significations may be led to
the understanding of their natural properties,
for which Etymology, or true interpretation
and derivation of words is very behoofful and
of great use.</p>
               <p>The parts contained are Humours and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whereof only the first is used in Coat-Armours,
wherein are represented sometimes
drops of blood, and sometimes tears, which
both are naturally humours contained, though
in Armory they are supposed no longer to be
contained, but shed forth. The bearing of
this humour, blood, is understood to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
born Drop-meale (as I may so term it)
or by drops. Which manner of bearing is in
blazon termed Gutte, of the Latin word <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
which signifieth a drop of any thing that
is either by Nature liquid, or liquefied by Art.
These drops do receive a different manner of
blazon, according unto their different colour,
or diversity of the substance whereof they do
consist, as by Examples shall appear.</p>

He beareth, Argent,
Gutte de Sang, by the
Name of <hi>Lemming.</hi>
These drops are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
born of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alone, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon or with
some other kind of
Charge, either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or extraordinary,
or else dividedly, by means of the interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some of the lines of Partition hereafter to
be handled. These are termed <hi>Guttae de Sang.
Quia ex guttis sangninis constant;</hi> because they
signifie drops of blood, wherein the life consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
And if the blood of those, who boast
of their generous blood, should once drop forth
of their veins, no difference would appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
it and the meanest man's blood; unless
perhaps it be in this, that usually it is more
corrupt and vitiated; whereas in the poorer
sort it is more healthful and pure. Which should
teach such great ones not to prize their blood
at too high a rate, but rather to excel others
in vertues, since they cannot surpass in that
humour, which is alike in all: And if they
look in the first originals of both sorts, they
shall find, that <hi>Adam</hi> was the first Ancestor of
the Poor, as well as of the Mighty; and so
the one of them as anciently descended as the
other.</p>

This is the most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

and whose defect bringeth present death.
For the life of all flesh is his blood, it is joined

               <p>In blazoning of Coat-Armours charged with
drops, you must evermore consider the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof they are, and to give them a

need to name their colour at all; forasmuch as
by their substance their colours are easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
whereof I will give you some few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in these Escocheons next following;
which albeit they may seem to be unduly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed with these, yet in respect of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form manner of bearing, to wit, by drops (as

together with these, than to bestow them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
under several Heads.</p>

This is a wholesome

and may signifie a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

whose vertuous demeanour flourisheth most

which is as much
as to say, He beareth
drops of water. If he
should blazon it in English, the proper colour
thereof is Argent. This had been a worthy
Escocheon for a Souldier of that Christian Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
called <hi>Fulminatrix,</hi> at whose prayers
in a great drought God poured down rain in
the sight of the Heathen, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifieth,

This word Poix is a

the same that we call
Pitch in English. Yet
among our English
Blazoners these colours
and drops are termed Gutte de Sable. This
Coat serveth aptly to give warrantize of the
bearing of Chiefs, consisting of some of the
bunched lines beforementioned in the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
There are Ordinaries framed of sundry
other former sorts of lines, before expressed in
the first Section, which I leave to the strict
observation of the curious searchers of those
things.</p>

molten in fire, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
liquefied, whereby
it may be distilled Dropmeal.</p>
               <p>Note, that if such kind of drops be Or, then
shall they be taken as representations of fusible
or liquid Gold: if they be Vert, then shall they
be taken to be drops of Oyl-olive, as hereafter
shall appear, when I shall speak of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
whose fields have no tincture predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating.
But to return to the humour of blood
(from which we have upon occasion hitherto
digressed) it is infallible that there is no Animal
or living Creature but hath in it either blood,
or some other kind of hot humour in quality
like thereunto, as I have said before.</p>
               <p>These humours beforementioned, in respect
of their moist and fluent nature, do stand in
need of some other thing to contain them; and
such containing parts are either the outmost
includer, which is the skin (of which we have
already spoken in the first Section, where we
treated of Furrs) or the whole Body it self,
with the several members and parts thereof;
all which, because they need their supporters,
those we will first speak of, and so descend unto
the whole bearings and parts.</p>
               <p>But I will first shew you an Example of the
bearing of dead mens sculls, and then proceed
to the supporting parts.</p>

               <p>Parts of support, whereof we have use in

the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bones, whereby the Body

               <p>IN following the tract which our method
first chalked out unto us, we are at length
come to such blazons, as do present to the
eyes those sensitive things which we called the
Containing, because they are the mansion, in
which not only the blood and spirits, but also
the bones (which we named the parts sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
are inclosed. These are Animals or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures, with their parts and members.
An Animal is any substance consisting both of
a body fitted for divers functions, and of a soul
giving life, sense, and motion.</p>
               <p>Animals (saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) especially such
as do produce a living creature, have a more
near resemblance of man, both as touching the
parts of their bodies, as also concerning the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of their mind, and subtilty and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wit; for their bodies also do consist
(like as ours do) of flesh, sinews, arteries,
bones, gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tles and skin, &amp;c. In like sort they
have head, neck, breasts, back, a chine or
backbone, thighs, legs and feet: As also
hearts, lights, liver, spleen, guts, and other
inward parts as we have: Furthermore, they
do participate with us in our actions, as to eat,
drink, sleep, watch and move: albeit in many
other things they are much unlike us.</p>
               <p>In the handling of Animals, it might be a
scruple, whether the bearing of such creatures
whole should have precedence in their bearing
before their parts, and also in what rank and
order the several kinds of creatures are to be
marshalled by us, that thereby the dignity of
their bearing may be best conceived; because
the dignity of those things that are born in
Coat-Armour, being truly known, and duly
considered, doth not a little illustrate the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of the bearers in the displaying of their
Ensigns. For taking away these scruples, I
hold it requisite, before I proceed to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
first to set down certain notes by way
of introduction to that which followeth, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the dignity of these Animals, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be handled, is to be accounted of, either
in a relative respect of things of distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
compared one to another, or in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
reference of Animals of the same kind
each to other.</p>
               <p>This dignity cannot be better understood,
than by taking a considerate view of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which the Author of all Order, and the
most wise and powerful Disposer of all things,
did observe, not only in the creation of the
Celestial, but also of the Elementary parts of
the World, with their several Ornaments,
wherein be observed a continual progression
from things of less perfection, to things more
perfect. For, was there not a Chaos <hi>without
from and void,</hi> before it came to that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beauty, whereof it is said, <hi>Loe, it was very
good?</hi> In the Celestial, the Sun (the glory
thereof) was made after the Firmament, and
the Night was before the Day. In the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
bodies, the Vegetables, as Trees, were made
before sensitive and living Creatures: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these, the Fishes (which have neither
breath nor voice, and therefore imperfecter)
were before the Fowls, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
terrestrial creatures; and all of all sorts
before man, made after God's Image, for
whose service all other things were made, as he
was made for God's Service. Moreover, in the
creation of man, the body was before the soul,
which yet is a thing incomparably of more
perfection.</p>
               <p>By this rude draught of God and Natures
admirable method, you may conceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
dignity of those creatures, as often as they
shall occur in Armory. But as Art hath not
always the same end which nature hath (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one intendeth the being, the other
the knowing of things:) so is not the method
of both always alike in attaining their ends;
for Natures process is <hi>à simplicibus ad composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
from the single parts to the whole, whereas
Art descendeth from the compounds to the
simples: in imitation whereof, we shall in this
our progress follow this course, that first every
whole bearing of any Animal shall precede,
and then such parts and members thereof as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
are born; for so every one that first hath
seen the whole, will discern the parts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whereas he that seeth a part (having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen the whole) knoweth not whereof it
is a part. And in Coat-Armour the whole
bearing of Animals is most worthy, yet is not
the bearing of parts to be misliked; but if we
consider both the one and the other respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then doth the whole bearing farr surmount
the parts in honour and dignity.</p>
               <p>Neither must we here precisely esteem the
worth of every bearing by this order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because Art doth sometimes stamp a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
note of dignity, for some particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as for some especial use, quality, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the things. And this dignity or nobility
may have a twofold relation; the one, betwixt
Animals of divers kinds, as a Lion and a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
a Woolf and a Lamb; the other, betwixt
things of one kind, as whelps of one litter,
whereof yet one may be nobler than the other,
as the one will run to the Chase, the other to
the Pottage Pot. And forasmuch as the living
things beforementioned, as well vegetable as
sensitive, have their peculiar vertues worthy
imitation, as also their particular vices to be
eschewed, and that it is a chief glory to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Coat-Armonr, to have their vertues
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55096:65"/>
displaied under the types and forms of such
things as they bear, it is to be wished that each
one of them would considerately examin the
commendable properties of such significant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
as they do bear, and do his best to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festto
the world, that he hath the like in himself:
for it is rather a dishonour than a praise for a
man to bear a Lion on his shield, if he bear a
Sheep in his heart, or a Goofe in his brain;
being therein like those Ships, which bear the
names of Dreadnought, Victory, and the like,
though sometimes it speed with them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their Titles. A true generous mind will
endeavour that for his self-vertues, he may
be esteemed, and not insist only upon the fame
and merits of his Progenitours, the praise
whereof is due to them, and not to him.</p>

               <p>And now we will proceed to some particular
precepts, concerning things sensitive born in
Coat-Armour. Wherein first observe, that
all sorts of Animals born in Arms or Ensigns,
must in blazoning be interpreted in the best
sense, that is, according to their most generous
and noble qualities, and so to the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their bearers. For example; the Fox
is full of wit, and withal given wholly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his prey; if then this be the charge of
an Escocheon, we must conceive the quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
to be his wit and cunning, but not
his pilfering and stealing, and so of all other.
All Beasts of savage and fierce nature, must be
figured and set forth in their most noble and
fierce action; as a Lion erected bolt upright,
his mouth wide open, his claws extended (as
if he were prepared to rent and tear;) for with
his teeth and claws he doth exercise his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
in this form he is said to possess his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and courage; and being thus formed, he
is said to be rampant. Action doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David</hi> approve to be proper to a Lion,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 22. where describing the crueltie of the
wicked towards him, he saith, <hi>They raged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me with their mouths, as it were a ramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and roaring Lion.</hi> A Leopard or Wolf
must be pourtraied going (as it were) <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentim,</hi>
step by step; which form of action
(saith <hi>Chassanaeus</hi>) fitteth their natural disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is termed Passant: All sorts of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
or gentle nature, must be set forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the most noble and kindly action of
every of them, as a Horse running or vaulting,
a Greyhound coursing, a Deer tripping, a Lamb
going with a smooth and easie pace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And concerning the true placing of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
of whatsoever kinds in Armory according
to Order, Art, and the Property of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the use of the thing, whereupon they are
to be placed or depicted, must be first consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, and so must they be placed accordingly,
whether they be born bolt upright, passant, or
tripping, or howsoever.</p>
               <p>As if they be to be placed in Banners, they
must be so placed, as that it be agreeable to the
natural quality of the thing that is born, <hi>Ars
enim imitatur naturam in quantum potest:</hi>
therefore since it is proper for a Banner to be
carried upon a staff, according to the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the staff doth proceed, and the Banner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after; therefore ought the face to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the staff, that is, directly forwards. So
is it likewise in every other thing, whose parts
are distinguished <hi>per Ante &amp; Post;</hi> in such the
forepart of the thing born shall be placed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the staff, otherwise it would seem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde
or going backwards, which were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous

               <p>If a man do bear only the head of some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
(then most commonly) the forepart
thereof cannot aptly regard the staff, but is
born sideways chiefly being full faced, whether
it be the head of Ram, Bull, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As touching the orderly placing of the feet
of Animals, this is a general Rule, That the
right foot must be placed formost, <hi>Quia dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
pars est principium motus.</hi> And withal, it
is the most noble part in regard it is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more active, and therefore thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them, is to set them forth in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendablest
fashion; for <hi>Dispositio laudatissima
animalis est, ut in omnibus dispositionibus suis
sit secundum cursum naturae;</hi> that is the best
disposition of every creature, which is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to nature.</p>
               <p>But here you must observe, That in a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that which is made for the one side, will
seem to be the left foot on the contrary side,
but that chanceth by accident: and therefore
the side next to him that beareth the Banner
must be chiefly respected, that the same be
formed right in regard of him; like as it is in
writing, that side next to the writer is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to order; whereas if we turn the paper,
all falleth out after a preposterous fashion:
Therefore we must chiefly respect the side next
the bearer, let the rest fall out as it shall.</p>
               <p>Arms are sometimes depicted or embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the uppermost vesture of Military persons,
especially Emperors, Kings, and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and other Commanders in Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
used to cast over their Armours a kind of
short habit, as a Jacket, Mandylian, or such
like, whereupon their Arms were richly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and curiously wrought; to the end, that
in time of service, their Souldiers, who could
not be directed by the ear (by reason of the
far distance that was oftentimes upon occasion
between them and their Commander) they
might by their eye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Animals are most worthy. All Beasts
have a natural and greedy desire for the supply
of their wants, insomuch as for the attaining
thereof, they do roar, bellow, bray, and cry
out exceedingly.</p>
               <p>All beasts of savage and harmful kind, are
naturally armed with some thing wherewith
they may hurt a man, for which they are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
dangerous, and to be shunned: As the
Boar with tusks, the Lion with tallons, the
Stagg with horns, the Serpent with poison,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that the bearing of things

specially commended, yet must not such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

commendation be extended to derogate
from the dignity of other bearings, as if they
were of no esteem, in regard they be not born
properly; for there are as good and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intendments in these as in them, <hi>data pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
gestantium,</hi> if they be as ancient as the
former, and their bearers of equal estate and
dignity; which is not the least respect that
must be holden in the esteem of Coat-Armour,
<hi>Quia arma nobilitatem sumunt à persona ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantis,</hi>
Arms are honoured by the bearers.
And sometimes the variation from the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be of purpose to prevent some other
quality, which may be no lesser honourable
than the proper. Besides, it is one thing to
bear a living creature in colour or in action di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from nature; and another, to bear him
repugnant or contrary to nature; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
may be born commendably, but this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of bearing is holden disgraceful, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is condemned for false Arms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not worthy of bearing. In the blazoning
of things born in their natural colour, whether
the same be Celestial, except the Sun, Moon,
and Stars; or Sublunar, it sufficeth to say, He
beareth this Comet, Meteor, Beast, Bird, Fish,
Fowl, Plant, Tree, Herb, Flower, &amp;c. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
without naming of any colour; for by
Proper is evermore understood his natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
and for the Sun and Stars, when they be
of the colour of the metal Or, which is their
natural colour, it sufficeth to say, a Sun, or
Star, without adding the word Proper, or Or.
And so it is of the Moon, when she is Argent,
which in Heraldry is holden her proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>As touching the dignity of things born in
Coat-Armour, I have already shewed how the
same is to be reckoned in the order of Nature;
but if it be considered according to vulgar esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
then we must hold this for an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that seldom faileth, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith every
particular Empire, Kingdom, and Nation have
their distinct Ensigns of their Sovereign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
look what Beast, Bird, Fish, Fowl,
Serpent, &amp;c. he that swayeth the Sovereignty
doth bear for his Royal Ensign in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Nation, the same is accounted there to
be of greatest dignity. So is the bearing of
the Lion chiefly esteemed with us in <hi>England,</hi>
because he is born by his Majesty, for the Royal
Ensign of his Highness's Imperial Sovereignty
over us: so is the bearing of the Eagle esteemed
among the <hi>Germans:</hi> &amp; in like sort the Flowers
de lis amongst the Frenchmen. Four-footed
Beasts, whether they be born Proper, or Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
(that is to say, varying from their natural
colour) are to be esteemed more worthy of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Coat-Armour than either Fishes or
Fowls are, in regard they do contain in them
more worthy and commendable significations
of Nobility. Amongst things Sensitive, the
Males are of more worthy bearing than the
Females. Some men perhaps will tax me of
inconsideration, in not treading the usual steps
of Armorists in the handling of these sensible
Creatures, for that I do not prefer the Lion
(in respect of his Regal Sovereignty) before
all other Terrestrials. For clearing of my self
in this point, I must plead, that the project of
my prescript method hath tied me to another
form, and doth enforce me to prefer other
Beasts in place, before those which otherwise
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55096:66"/>
are preferred in dignity. And albeit I cannot
say there was any priority of time in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Beasts, because <hi>God spake the word and
it was done, he commanded and they were
created;</hi> nevertheless in regard of discipline,
there is a priority to be observed, wherein
those things that do promise us a more easie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to the distinct knowledge and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the succeeding documents, ought to
have the precedence.</p>
               <p>The Order that I prefix to my self in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these Beasts, shall concur with the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this present Section; as first, to set down
Animals of all sorts living upon the Earth: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
such as live above the Earth, as Fowls:
Thirdly, Watry Creatures: and lastly, Man.
And because of the first sort some are gressible,
having feet, and some creeping or gliding, as
Serpents, we will begin with the gressible;
and first with such Beasts as have their feet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
or undivided, or (as I may term them) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate,
that is to say, without toes; then
will I proceed to such as have their feet cleft in
two; and lastly to Beasts that have their feet divided into many.</p>

doubtful passages. Of these briefly, as in
the next Escocheon. The Invention of Arms,
wherein Beasts, or their parts, are born, are
borrowed (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>) from the
<hi>Huns, Hungarians, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi>
cruel and most fierce Nations, who therefore
delighted in the bearing of Beasts of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in their Arms; as Lions, Bears, Wolves,
Hyenes, and such like; which fashion likewise
came into these our Countries when those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
people over-ran with Conquest the West
part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Now to the end that the
Rules and Observations formerly set down
may receive both life and warrant by Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
I will now exemplifie them in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:

their Members.</p>

Concerning these
Arms that are formed
of Beasts, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
That generally
those are reputed more
Noble which do consist
of whole Beasts, than are those that are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their parts; yet sometimes the parts
may be given for some such special services, as
may be no less honourable than the whole
bearing. The Elephant is a Beast of great
strength, but greater wit, and greatest ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
insomuch that some have written of
them, that if you praise them, they will kill
themselves with labour; and if you commend
another above them, they will break their
hearts with emulation. The Beast is so proud
of his strength, that he never bows himself
to any (neither indeed can he;) and when he
is once down (as it usually is with proud great
ones) he cannot rise up again. It was the
manner of such as used the force of Elephants
(in set Battels) to provoke them to fight by
laying before them things of Scarlet or Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
colour, to make them more furious; as
we may see 1 <hi>Mac. 6. 34. And to provoke the
Elephants for to fight, they shewed them the
blood of Grapes and Mulberries.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
they were placed in the strength and
heart of the battel, as in the same Chapter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth;
where it is said, <hi>And they set the
Beasts according to their ranges, so that by
every Elephant there stood a thousand men
armed with Coats of Mail, and Helmets of
Brass upon their Heads; and unto every Beast
were ordained five hundred Horsmen of the
best, Verse 35. Which were ready at all times
wheresoever the Beast was; and whithersoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Beast went, they went also, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
not from him, Verse</hi> 36. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and incomparable strength of this Beast
may be conceived by this, That be bare thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
two fighting men in strong Towers of
Wood fastned upon his back; as we may
see expresly set down in the same Chapter
in these words; <hi>And upon them were strong
Towers of Wood that covered every Beast,
which were fastned thereon with Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and upon every one were thirty two
men that fought in them, and the Indian that
ruled him, Verse</hi> 37.</p>

this Erasing and Couping are the two common

other uses of agility, wherein Nature hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
the unaptness of his legs, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

which (as it passed by) a little boy pried in
his Proboscis; therewith being enraged, he
cast up the child a great height, but received
him again on his Snout, and laid him down
gently, without any hurt, as if the Beast had
considered, that for a childish fault; a childish
fright were revenge enough.</p>

A Horse erected bolt
upright, may be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
enraged, but his
noblest action is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in a Saliant
form. This of all
Beasts for mans uses, is most noble and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofful,
either in Peace or War. And sith his
service and courage in the field is so eminent,
it may be marvelled, why the Lion should be
esteemed a more honourable bearing: But the
reason is, because the Horses service and
strength is principally by help of his Rider;
whereas the Lions is his own: And if the Horse
be not mounted, he fights averse, turning his
heels to his Adversary; but the Lion encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
affront, which is more manly. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
of the Horse (as also of other whole-footed
Beasts) that their Legs are at the first
as long as ever they will be: and therefore
young Foals scratch their ears with their hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foot, which after they cannot do, because
their Legs do grow only in bigness, but not in
length, <hi>Plin. lib. 11. cap.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>The Horse is a Beast naturally stubborn,

The Ass is the lively

whom therefore our

Patience and Humility

his own riding; which hath made some to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

on the ridge of all Asses backs, thwarted
with the like over both the shoulders, is stampt
on them as the mark of his Cross, whereon he

as that an Asses head (which as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
was reckoned amongst things of least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem)
was valued at fourscore pieces of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
which perhaps gave occasion to the old
Proverb, <hi>Asini caput ne laves Nitro,</hi> Wash not
an Asses-head with Niter; which is a matter
white, like Salt, and full of holes as a Spunge;

<hi>Caho,</hi> which in the Spanish Language doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

understand, that it is the head of some such

If these Calves live to
wear horns, which differ
either in metal or in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
from the rest of the
body, then must there be
special mention of such
difference in blazoning,
as you shall see in the next Example. <hi>Pliny</hi>
saith, That Nature seemed to sport her self in
making such variety of horns of beasts, as so
many several kinds of weapons, wherewith they
come armed into the field: for in some she hath
made knagged and branched, as in the Red and
Fallow Deer; in other plain and uniform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tines, as in Spitters, a kind of Stags which
thereupon are called in Latin <hi>Subulones,</hi> and
that their horns are like to the blade of a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
Awl; but of all other, the horns of the
Bull may most properly be called his Arms,
they being of so piercing and violent a stroke,
as hardly can be resisted.</p>

               <p>The knowledge of the Ordure or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

of their haunt and feeding, and also their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
And therefore it is a thing highly to be

well in Coat-Armours as in Badges, that the
Attires of Deer, both Red and Fallow, may
be born bendy, barry, or otherwise counter-coloured;
I have thought it fit, for the more
apt blazon of them, to annex such propriety
of tearms, as the skilfullest Foresters or
Woodmen do attribute unto their several
kinds, so there may be a fit correspondence of
Artificial tearms, as well Woodman-like as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial;
adding withal their forms and shapes
of their several Attires, for the better and
readier conceiving of their particular parts,
and fit application of each particular tearm to
his proper part, by the help of the Alphabeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Letters that I have for that purpose annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>These Beasts of Chase do make their abode
all the day time in the Fields, and upon the
Hills and high Mountains, where they may see
round about them afar off, for preventing their
danger: For these are more timerous of their
own safety, than dangerous and harmful to
men. And in the night time, when men be at
rest, and all things quiet, then do they make
their repair to the Corn-fields and Medows for
food and relief; for which respect they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Campesties,</hi> because they do haunt the Field
and Champion grounds more than the Woods,
and thick Coverts or Thickets, as we do most
usually observe them.</p>

The Stag is a goodly
beast, full of state in
his gate and view, and
(amongst Beasts of
Chase) reputed the
chief for principal game
and exercise. It is observed of him, that
finding himself fat, he ever lodgeth and sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in secret places to avoid chasing, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself worth following and worth kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(as was said of the great Stag at <hi>Killing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>)
but most unfit for flying.</p>

exceeding speed of foot, to fly from the

That horns are so mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

upon the heads of the
beasts, that they may
be made capable of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
impressions, and are made divisible into
many parts: but Nature needeth not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
neither can Art form a fashion of more
stately decency, than she hath done on the
Stag. All horns in a manner be hollow, save
that towards the pointed tip they be solid
and massie. Only Deer, both Red and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
have them solid throughout.</p>

horns be assigned to
the Stag, Buck, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like beasts, for
weapons both offensive and defensive; yet do
they seldom use them to those ends, being
therein like many Gallants well attired and
armed, but it is more for shew than for use,
when it comes to proof. So <hi>David</hi> speaks of
of some, who <hi>carrying bows turned their
backs;</hi> as having arms, but wanting hearts.
And it may be, the Hart hath his name (as
<hi>Mons à movendo</hi>) for being heartless: But
sure it is, that all the Armour in the <hi>Tower</hi> is
not enough to arm a Dastard's heart.</p>

He beareth Vert, a
Fess between three
Bucks in full course,
Or, by the Name of
<hi>Robertson.</hi> This kind
of Deer is called <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
Palmatus,</hi> for the
resemblance that his
horns have with the
hand and fingers. This
beast reposeth his safety chiefly in flight,
wherein he is very swift in case of pursuit: his
colour most commonly sandy, with a black
strake along his back; their sides and belly
spotted with white, which spots they lose
through age: their Females are more variable
in colour, as being sometimes all white.</p>

He beareth Vert, on

from <hi>Nicholas Robinson</hi> of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi>
Gent. who lived in the time of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. Although this beast, as a
Coward, flieth with his weapons; yet two
times there are when he dares turn head on his
foe: the one is when it is for his life, as when
he is chased out of breath, and his strength so
spent that he cannot by flight escape, <hi>Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
facit audacem.</hi> He is more than a Coward
that will not fight when he sees his case despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
and therefore it is a general rule in good
policy, never to put them to the utmost exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and extremity, with whom we desire to
prevail, according to the old English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>Compel a Coward to fight, and he will
kill the Devil:</hi> which was the cause that the
Romans, landing in this Kingdom, burnt their
own Navy, thereby to enforce the Army to be
resolute, by despairing of any escape of return
by Sea again. The other time of the Stag's
courage is for his love, at which time he will
fight to the death with his Rival or Hinderer
of his hot desire,</p>

                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure, 3
Bucks tripping, Or, by
the Name of <hi>Green.</hi>
The Buck is a worthy
beast, and hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and measure of all
the properties of the
Stag, but cometh far
short of his stateliness
and boldness (for there
are degrees of courage even amongst Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.)
And Nature hath made his horn rather
broad, for a defensive buckler, than sharp, as the
Stags, for the thrust. Their best quality is, that
they are sociable, and love to keep together in
Herds, which is the property of all harmless
and peaceable Creatures, which are of comfort
and courage only in company; whereas all
beasts and birds of prey are given to wander
solitary, neglecting societies: And that made
the Philosopher say, That a solitary and unso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
man was either a Saint or a Devil.</p>

Gules, by the Name of

the Females, both of
Red and Fallow Deer,
to wit, Hinds and
Does, as well as Stags
and Bucks, are born in Coat-Armour; but such
bearing is holden less commendable than that
of Males, because <hi>Masculinum dignius est Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minino,</hi>
as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Topic.</hi> 1. The
Male is ever nobler than the Female. To prove
that Females are born also, I have (out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

next following.</p>

among all sorts of
beasts, the Males are
more stomachful, and
of greater courage than the Females, excepting
in Panthers and Bears: and that those parts
that Nature hath bestowed upon beasts, to
serve them (as it were) instead of weapons, as
teeth, horns, stings, and other such like, she
hath given them especially unto the Males, as
to those that are both better and stronger, and
hath left the Females altogether disarmed;

That the Attires of

of the sight of the
horns of this beast, because they are seemly to
behold, and do become the beast right-well;
and that Nature bestowed horns on them, more
for Ornament than Assault, appears by this,
that they repose their safety rather in their
speedy footmanship, than in the strength of
their heads. The Tines of the Stag's head do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
yearly, until he hath accomplished the

Ensigns of this Family, a Coat of Device,

saith) was very ancient, yet no Coat of Arms,
as indeed it is not, but a meer fantastick device;
which being so, he had done much better to
have expressed the true Paternal Coat of that
Family, as it is here expressed, rather than the
adulterate or counterfiet Coat, which neither
relisheth of true Armory, nor yet of any

any sort of Deer, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that they be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

If upon like occasion you shall speak

of the Latin word <hi>Vngula,</hi> which signifieth the
Hoof or Claws of a Beast.</p>

He beareth Sable, a
Cheveron between three
Attires of a Stag, fixed
to the Scalp, Argent, by

Coat, with the Arms of
<hi>Vlster,</hi> is born by Sir
<hi>Richard Cocks</hi> of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleton</hi> in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi>
Baronet: And without
the Arms of <hi>Vlster,</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Cocks</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they</hi>
in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> Kt. And by <hi>Thomas
Cocks</hi> of <hi>Castle-ditch</hi> in <hi>Herefordshire,</hi> Esquire.
The Stag doth mew his head every year, unless
he be castrated or gelt whilst his head is in his
prime: For in such case he never meweth his
head, neither doth his Beam burr, or Tynes
augment, or diminish any more, but continue
still in the same state wherein they were at the
time of his Castration.</p>
               <p>Foresters and Hunters do call this yearly
mewing of their heads the Beauty of their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55096:72"/>
Wildness, and not the Mewing of their
Horns as the Latinists do tearm it.</p>
               <p>These having mewed their heads, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to the thick Brakes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to hide them, as well knowing they are
disarmed of their natural weapons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do never willingly shew themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the day time, until the Spring that
they begin to bud and burgeon toward their
renovation of force.</p>
               <p>Horns do betoken Strength and Fortitude,
inasmuch as God hath bestowed them upon
Beasts to be unto them Instruments or Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
as well offensive as defensive; as we may
probably gather by that which is spoken by
the Prophet <hi>David, Psal. 75. 12. All the
horns of the ungodly will I break, but the horns
of the righteous shall be exalted.</hi>

The Unicorn hath
his name of his one horn
on his forehead. There
is another Beast of a huge
strength and greatness,
which hath but one
horn, but that is growing on his Snout,
whence he is called <hi>Rinoceros,</hi> and both are
named <hi>Monoceros,</hi> or <hi>One-horned.</hi> It hath
been much questioned amongst Naturalists,
which it is that is properly called the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn:
and some have made doubt whether
there be any such Beast as this, or no. But
the great esteem of his horn (in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be seen) may take away that needless
scruple.</p>

saith, <hi>Wilt thou trust
him because his strength

labour unto him? Wilt thou believe him, that
he will bring home thy seed, and gather it
into thy Barn?</hi> And his Vertue is no less fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moused
than his Strength, in that his horn is
supposed to be the most powerful Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Poison: Insomuch as the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
is, That the wild Beasts of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
use not to drink of the Pools, for fear of
venomous Serpents there breeding, before the

it be, this Charge may very well be a
representation both of strength or courage,
and also of vertuous dispositions and ability to
do good; for to have strength of body without
the gifts and good qualities of the mind, is but
the property of an Ox, but where both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
that may truly be called manliness. And
that these two should consort together, the
Ancients did signifie, when they made this one
word, <hi>Virtus,</hi> to imply both the strength of
body, and vertue of the mind.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Sable,
three Unicorns in Pale,

Or, by the Name of

by a question moved by

is never taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
and the reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demanded, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That the greatness of his mind is
such, that he chuseth rather to die than to be
taken alive: wherein (saith he) the Unicorn
and the valiant minded Souldier are alike,
which both contemn death, and rather than
they will be compelled to undergo any base
servitude or bondage, they will lose their
lives.</p>

he is beyond those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
exemplified, and
is counted the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Champion amongst Beasts, for that he
hath both weapons to wound his foe, which
are his strong and sharp Tusks, and also his
Target to defend himself; for which he useth
often to rub his shoulders and sides against
Trees, thereby to harden them against the
stroke of his Adversary: And the shield of a
Boar well managed, is a good buckler against
that cruel Enemy called Hunger.</p>

he foameth all the while
for rage; and against the
time of any encounter he
often whetteth his Tusks
to make them the more piercing. The Boar
hath been much honoured by being the Crest
of an Earl, which seemeth to be given to the
House of <hi>Vere,</hi> because <hi>Verres</hi> is the Name of

that he will rather die valorously in the field,

sharp and fierce in conflict with his foe. And
this is a special property in a Souldier, that he
be fierce in the encountring his Enemie, and

heads in both Escocheons were couped or era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
yet the very manner of the position of
them were sufficient difference to vary one
Coat-Armour from the other.</p>

               <p>HItherto of such beasts as we call <hi>Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
bisulca,</hi> which have their feet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only into two Claws: The next part
of our Distribution containeth those which are
called <hi>Multifida,</hi> which have many Claws;
of which sort are not only Lions, Bears, Wolves,
and others of fierce and ravenous kind, that
live by prey and spoil; but such also as are of
timorous nature, whose chiefest safety consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
rather in swiftness of foot, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means, as Foxes, Hares, Conies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of less harmful kind, whereof I will
give particular Examples: But first I will offer
unto your heedful Observation certain Notes,
as well of general as of particular use, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beasts of this kind; not forgetting (by the
way) such Rules and Observations as have
been already commended to your regard, that
especially touching mixt bearing of Ordinaries
and common Charges, which must serve for a
Regular Direction throughout our whole
Work. And in delivery of these Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Examples, I hold it fit to begin with
beasts of fierce nature, and first with the Lion,
reckoned the King of beasts; <hi>Dignioribus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
digniora loca sunt danda,</hi> Highest person
highest place.</p>
               <p>Some French Armorists are of opinion, That
the Lion should never be made Guardant, or full-faced,
affirming that to be proper to the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,
wherein they offer great indignity to that
royal beast, in that they will not admit him
(saith <hi>Vpton</hi>) to shew his full face, the sight
whereof doth terrifie and astonish all the beasts
of the field, and wherein consisteth his chiefest
Majesty, and therefore may not be denied that
Prerogative, <hi>Quia omnia Animalia debent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingi
&amp; designari in suo ferociori actu, ex illis
enim actibus magis vigorem suum ostend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55096:73"/>All beasts should be set forth in their most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
action, for therein they shew their
chiefest vigour. As concerning the true Note
whereby the Leopard is distinguished from the
Lion, <hi>Vpton lib. de Armis</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscitur
Leopardus à Leone, quia Leopardus
ubique depingitur habens naturaliter maculas
nigras, cum grosso capite, &amp; est Animal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
non hispidum: Leo verò habet unum colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
continuum, cum pectore hispido, cum certis
jubis in canda.</hi> The Leopard is portrayed
with black spots, and a great head, and no
where shaggy; whereas the Lion is one colour,
shaggy brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, with a certain tuft of hair in
his train. So that it is evident that the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
is notably distinguish'd both in shape and
colour, and not by his full-faced Countenance,
as they dream. Moreover <hi>Vpton</hi> saith, That
he hath often observed Leopards born by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Noblemen, as well half-faced as guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>
               <p>It is observed that the generous nature of the
Lion is discerned by his plentiful shaggy locks
that do cover his neck and shoulders, which are
infallible tokens of his noble Courage, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if those his locks be crisped and curled, and
short withal. Such Lions were those whereof
Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> maketh mention, <hi>In vita Pauli
Eeremitae,</hi> saying, <hi>Talia in anima volvente, ecce
duo Leones ex interioris Eremi parte curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
volantibus per colla jubis ferebantur:</hi>
Two Lions came running with their shaggy
locks wavering about their shoulders. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the thickness of the Lion's mane is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his generous birth, and by the same
he is distinguished from the degenerate and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
race of Leopards begotten between the
adulterous Lioness and the Parde, which are
naturally deprived of this noble mark; and not
only so, but they are also bereft of that bold
and invincible Courage that the generous sort
of Lions have. For these respects the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
brood of Lions are called in Latin, <hi>Imbelles
Leones,</hi> that is, Heartless and Cowardly Lions;
whereas the true Lion is termed in Latin, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosus
Leo, quia generosum est quod à natura
sua non degeneravit;</hi> That is generous which
degenerateth not from his kind: by which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a man of Noble Descent, and Ignoble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
is not truly generous, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth
from the Vertues of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p>Lions, Bears, Wolves, and other beasts of
ravening kind, when they are born in Arms
feeding, you must tearm them in blazon Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and tell whereon. To all beasts of prey
Nature hath assigned teeth and talons of crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shape, and therewithal of great sharpness,
to the end they may strongly seize upon and
detain their prey, and speedily rend and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the same. And therefore in blazoning of
beasts of this kind, you must not omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their teeth and tallons, which are their
only Armour; for by them they are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from those tame and harmless beasts, that
have their teeth knocked out, and their nails
pared so near to the quick, as that they can
neither bite nor scratch with much harm.
Those teeth and tallons are for the most part in
Coat-Armours made of a different colour from
the bodies of the beasts; and therefore in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoning
of beasts of this kind, when you speak
of their teeth or tallons, you shall say they are
thus or thus Armed. So likewise if you please
to speak of their tongues, you shall say they are
thus or thus Langued.</p>
               <p>To bear a Lion or whatsoever Animal in a
diverse colour from his kindly or natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as to bear a blue, green, red, purple Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Bear, &amp;c. or whatsoever other colour dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that which is natural unto him, is
not a bearing reproachful, though disagreeing
to his Nature, if we consider of the occasion
of their primary constitution; for that the
custome of such bearing seemeth to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from eminent persons, who habiting
themselves either for their sports of Hunting,
or for Military Services (as best fitted their
phantasies) would withal sute their Armours
and Habiliments with colours answerable to
their habits, with the shapes and portraitures
of forged and counterfeit Animals.</p>
               <p>Or else perhaps by occasion of some civil
tumults, as that between the <hi>Guelphi</hi> and the
<hi>Gibelini</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> they perhaps of each faction
bearing Lions, Bears, and Wolves, or other
Animals, to avoid confusion, and to the end
the one of them should not be entrapped by
the other of the contrary faction, when they
were intermixed one with another, and that
their valorous actions might be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
discerned from the other, they distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves by different and unlike coloured
Garments, that so each Governour and Leader
might know those that were of his own facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The like may we observe to have been of
late years used among ourselves, when private
factions have sprung amongst us; one sort was
known from others of the contrary faction by
a Carnation Ribond worn about, or in his Hat;
or by a Crimson Feather, or other thing: the
contrary faction wearing like thing, but in a
different colour or fashion.</p>
               <p>The Lion (<hi>saith</hi> Vpton) passing thorow stony
places, doth contract his Tallons within his
flesh, and so walketh on his feet as if he had
no Tallons at all, keeping them exceeding
choicely, lest he should dull and blunt their
sharpness, and so become less able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
and rend his prey. <hi>And this property
seemeth not to be peculiar to a Lion, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all beasts of rapine; as</hi> Pliny <hi>ascribeth
the same property to Leopards, Panthers, and
such other, as well as to the Lion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only Lions, but also all other beasts of
ravenous kind (according to <hi>Bekenhawb</hi>) do
bring forth their young in some part defective;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55096:74"/>
as Lions do produce their Whelps dead, Dogs
bring them forth blind, Bears deformed and
shapeless, &amp;c. For Nature would not that they
should attain perfection in the womb, in regard
of the safety of their Dam, lest in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
they should spoil and rent her womb by
their teeth and tallons.</p>
               <p>Other more particular Rules there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the divers kinds and peculiar actions of
beasts of Rapine, which shall follow in their
more convenient places. In the mean time,
let us proceed to Examples that may give life
and approbation to those premised Rules; <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta
enim quantumvis bona &amp; concinna, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua
sunt, nisi ipse auditor variis exemplis ea
percipiat;</hi> Good and fit Precepts are but dead,
unless Examples give them life: Of which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

He beareth Jupiter, a

Hebrew Rabbies (saith
<hi>Leigh</hi>) writing upon the
second of <hi>Numbers,</hi> do
assign to the Tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
a Lion after this
manner, alluding belike
unto that blessing that
<hi>Iacob</hi> (a little before his
death) did pronounce upon <hi>Iudah,</hi> saying, <hi>He
shall lie down and couch as a Lion; who dares
stir him up?</hi> Wherein one noteth, That <hi>Iacob</hi>
seemeth to allude to that diminution, which
happened at such time as the more part of the
people of that Tribe did fall away unto <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;
Tunc enim</hi> (saith he) <hi>Rex Iudae similis
esse coepit Leoni dormienti; neque enim erectis
jubis timorem suum latè effudit, sed quodam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
accubuit in spelunca. Latuit tamen quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
occulta virtus sub illo sopore, &amp;c.</hi> The
King of <hi>Iudah</hi> was then like a sleeping Lion,
which did not shew his rage with his erected
Shag; but did as it were lurk in his Den,
yet so as he lost not his strength in his sleep,
neither durst any the most adventurous to rouse
him. This may be true of the King of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
but surely the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah
doth neither slumber nor sleep,</hi> though he
seemeth to sleep; neither <hi>doth their vengeance
sleep</hi> who dare provoke him. It is reported that
the Lion sleepeth with his eyes open; so should
Governours do, whose Vigilancy should shew
it self when others are most at rest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</p>

                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
couchant, Sable. The
Lion couching after this
manner, must not be
deemed to have been
compelled thereunto, but
that he hath so settled
himself of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;
for it is contrary
to his magnanimous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to couch by any chastisement, or to be
corrected in himself; but if a Whelp, or some
other beast be beaten or chastised in his sight,
he thereupon humbleth himself after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
But as touching himself he must be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with gentleness, and so is he easiest won.
<hi>Generosus enim animus facilius ducitur quàm
trahitur;</hi> The generous mind you may easier
lead than draw. So when the Children of
Princes offend, their Pages are whipt before
them: And the Persians, if a Nobleman of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
brought forth his Garment and beat it
with wands.</p>

the manner of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing: And in these
kinds of varieties of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
you may observe, that by degrees and

Attorney General of
the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> In the blazoning
of Arms consisting of more Lions in a Field
than one, you must tearm them Lioncels (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Leigh</hi>) which is as much to say, as
so many young or petite Lions. The reason of
this Rule I take to be this, That inasmuch as
the Lion hath a Prerogative Royal over all
Beasts, and cannot endure that any other should
participate of the Field with him, <hi>Quia Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes
nolunt pares,</hi> Princes will admit no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
to the impeachment of their Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
therefore the bearing of divers Lions in one
Field must be understood of Lions whelps,
which as yet have not so great feeling of their
own strength, or inbred noble courage, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of their ingenerated Royal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
over all Beasts, as Lions have. But <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
adulti participationem non admmittere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
when they are of years they will know
their own worth. Note that this Rule must
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55096:75"/>
be understood with a certain limitation in some
particular cases, <hi>Quia non est regula adeò ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralis,
quin admittit exceptionem in suo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulari:</hi>
For this Rule holdeth not in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's
Ensigns, where these beasts are said
to be Lions, <hi>propter dignitatem Regiae Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis:</hi>
Next this <hi>Rule</hi> hath no place in Coat-Armours,
wherein any of the honourable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
are interposed between these beasts:
<hi>For by such interpositions of these Ordinaries</hi>
(saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) <hi>everyone of them is reckoned to
be of as great dignity, as if he were born di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videdly
in so many several Escocheons, and
that in respect of the Sovereignty of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
so interposed; for which cause they have
the Title of most worthy partitions.</hi> And so
shall you reckon of all other Coat-Armours
consisting of things so divided.</p>

Argent, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

have given another blazon to this Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
thus; He beareth Sable, two Lioncels,
the one passant, the other re-passant, Argent,
both collared, Gules. But in mine Opinion, no
man by this last blazon is able to trick or express
the true portraiture and manner of the bearing
of these Lioncels; for it appeareth not by this
blazon towards which part or side of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon
their heads are placed, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Rule given <hi>Chap. 4. Sect.</hi> 1. The
Lion and the Lioness do never go one and the
same way, either when they seek their prey,
or when they go to fight; the skilful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
men render this Reason for it, That these
beasts stand so much upon their strength of
body, as that neither of them needeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
help.</p>
               <p>Now that Lions and Lioncels are born in
Arms, the first with interposition of some of
the Ordinaries, the other charged upon Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
the following Examples will make it
manifest; and in blazoning of such Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
care must be taken to observe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what concerning this point of their
difference I have even now delivered.</p>

which kind of gate we usually do call passant,
expresseth his most generous and noble action
of Majesty, Clemency, and Circumspection.</p>

late Keeper of the Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

noble courage and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
of the Lion, as
that in his greatest rage and fury, he never
doth tyrannize over those that do prostrate
themselves to his mercy; whereof a certain
Author thus writeth,
<q>
                     <l>Parcere prostratis scit nobilis ira leonis:</l>
                     <l>Tu quoque fac simile, quisquis regnabis in orbe.</l>

Barrs Ermyn in Chief, a
Lion passant, parted <hi>per</hi>
Pale, Or and Argent, by
the Name of <hi>Hill</hi> of
<hi>Hales</hi> in the County of
<hi>Norfolk.</hi> This Lion is
different from the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
passants, in that he
goeth directly forward,
shewing in the Escocheon but half his face,
whereby he is distinguished from the guardant,
which sheweth the whole face. This Lion
passant seemeth to go with more confidence
and resolution, but the guardant, with more
vigilancy and circumspection, which both being
joyned, do make an absolute Commander.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a Lion
salient, Gules, by the
Name of <hi>Felbridge.</hi> The
proper form of a Lion
salient is when his right
forefoot answereth to
the dexter corner of the
Escocheon, and his hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
foot the sinister base
point thereof. And he
is termed salient, <hi>à saliendo;</hi> because when he
doth prosecute his prey, he pursueth the same
leaping, which action he never useth when he
is chased in fight (as <hi>Pliny</hi> noteth) but is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passant. And it is sometimes no dishonour
to go softly, or retire leisurely out of the Field,
but to flie is a reproach; and therefore of all
gestures, I never find any Lion current.</p>

Esquire; and by <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> of the <hi>Van</hi>
in the said County, Esquire. As touching the
bearing of the Lion after this manner, I hold
that then he may be truly said to be rampant,
when he standeth so directly upright, as that
the crown of his head doth answer to the plant
of his foot, whereupon he standeth in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
line, and not by placing of the left
foot in the dexter corner of the Escocheon, as
<hi>Leigh</hi> would have it. As the former Example
sheweth the gesture of the Lion pursuing his
prey; so this sheweth his gesture in seizing on
it when he hath attained it.</p>

<hi>Iohn Buxton</hi> of <hi>Tiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

this manner of
bearing, in respect of

Here Blazoners may please to observe, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite

<hi>Leigh</hi> saith, That
these were two Lions of sundry Regions, which
of manhood must combate only for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For the Lion is as desirous of mastery
as a couragious Prince is ambitious of Honour;
which if it be in a just Title and Claim, is a
vertue in a King, and no way to be disliked?
For it was a Royal Apothegm worthy that
great King, <hi>Nemo me major, nisi qui justior;</hi>
I acknowledge no King greater than my self,
but he that is juster.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Azure,
two Lioncels rampant,
endorsed, Or. This
Coat (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) was
born by <hi>Achilles</hi> the
<hi>Grecian</hi> at the Siege of
<hi>Troy.</hi> And <hi>Leigh</hi> takes
it to be a Combate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
between two
valiant men, and they
both keep appointment and meet in the Field;
but the Prince favouring both Parties, taketh
the matter into his hands, and then turn they
back to back, and so depart the Field: For
their stout Stomacks will not suffer them to go
both one way, because it is counted an injury
to hardiness to go first out of the Field.</p>
               <p>There are yet other forms of bearing the
Lion than are hitherto expressed, as in these

base points, erected in

The forefeet of the
Lion have five toes upon
each foot, and the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
feet but four, whereby nature hath enabled
him, for the more sure seizing and retaining
his acquired prey. The Lions claws are crooked
and exceeding hard, with these he carveth and
rendeth his prey; and for this purpose he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them very choicely and tenderly, and is no
less careful to save them from blunting, than a
good Souldier is to keep his Armour and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
from rust and bluntness. By the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sharpness of the Lions claw, we may
easily conjecture how dangerous a thing it is
for a man to encounter him; for wheresoever
he seizeth, if he break not the bones, yet he
renteth away the flesh. So also may we give
a near ghess, if not make a certain demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his proportion and bigness; for so we
read that <hi>Phydias,</hi> the famous Carver of great
Images in Gold and in Ivory, upon the sight of
a Lions claw only, did raise the whole propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his body, which gave occasion (as is
supposed) of the Proverb, <hi>Leonem ex ungue
aestimare,</hi> whereby is meant, That of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
conjecture, a man may give a near ghess
of the whole business.</p>

Coat doth minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

the one, that
this member is born up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Ordinaries; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is born after the manner or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

He beareth Sable, 3
Lions tails erected and
erased, Argent, by the
Name of <hi>Corke.</hi> The Lion
hath great strength in
his tail, the much motion
whereof is a manifest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of anger. When he
mindeth to assail his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
he stirreth up
himself by often beating of his back and sides
with his tail, and thereby stirreth up his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
to the end he do nothing faintly or cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly.
The Lion when he is hunted, carefully
provideth for his safety, labouring to frustrate
the pursuit of the Hunters by sweeping out his
foosteps with his tail as he goeth, that no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of his track may be discovered,
whereby they may know which way to make
after him.</p>
               <p>The Lion beareth his tail after a diverse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
insomuch as we may thereby (if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know, yet give a near ghess) what a
mood he is in for the present; <hi>viz.</hi> whether
he be furiously bent, or peaceable, or majesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
affected. And these qualities are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
discerned by the Inversion, Eversion, or
Extension, &amp;c. of his tail.</p>
               <p>Here may rise a Question, Whether the
bearing of the tail of the Lion in any of these
several manners be a sufficient difference to
prevent all causes of challenge?</p>
               <p>For my own part (albeit I have not read or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55096:80"/>
seen in <hi>Gerard Leigh, Boswell, Ferne,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Armorial Writers, the state of this
Question handled) I hold that they be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
sufficient to debarr all challenge: My
Reasons are these; first, <hi>Sufficit quod inter
arma mea &amp; tua talis sit differentia, qua detur
diversitas.</hi> And again, <hi>Nova forma dat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
esse rei:</hi> I hold them not only to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<hi>secundum quid,</hi> but <hi>simpliciter;</hi> that
is to say, absolute and essential differences.
Furthermore, <hi>Data una dissimilitudine etiam
paria judicabuntur diversa.</hi> Moreover, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
sheweth us, That the least addition or
subtraction in Armorial signs maketh them
cease to be the same that they were; <hi>Omnia
Arma Arithmeticis figuris sunt simillima, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
si quid addas vel subtrahas, non remanet
eadem species,</hi> as I have formerly shewed.
Finally, for approbation of these my Opinions,
I will add this infallible Assertion, <hi>Ea differunt
quorum definitiones differunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are my Reasons that induce me to be
of this Opinion, that the diverse manner of
bearing of the tail of the Lion, as aforesaid, are
or may be (without exception) essential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences:
which nevertheless I referr to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
censure of the Learned in this Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
who perhaps may convince me with more
forceable grounds.</p>
               <p>But because Demonstration is the best of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to convince the incredulous, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that <hi>Buxton</hi>'s Coat before mentioned,
differs not from that of <hi>Smeres,</hi> but only in
the manner of the bearing of the tail, both of
them being Argent, a Lion rampant, Sable;
only in <hi>Buxton</hi>'s Coat the tail is elevated and
turned over the head of the Lion, as it more
plainly appears before in this present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Now as touching particularizing of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
assertion, I say that the Eversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the tail of the Lion is an express token of
his placability or tractableness: as contrariwise
the Inversion of his tail is a note of wrath and
fury, especially if he do beat the back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and doth roar withal. Of this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lion <hi>Catullus</hi> maketh mention in these
words,
<q>
                     <l>Age, caede terga cauda tua, verbera pateant</l>
                     <l>Face, cuncta mugienti fremitu loca retonent.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The gate of a Lion, when he is passant, is an
apparent note of his jurisdiction and regal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and sovereignty wherewith the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his tail doth fitly quadrate and agree:
inasmuch as when he hunteth after his prey,
he roareth vehemently, whereat the Beasts
being astonished, do make a stand, whilst he
with his tail maketh a circle about them in the
sand, which circle they dare not transgress;
which done, out of them he makeh choice of
his prey at his pleasure.</p>

Near to this Escocheon is placed this Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Hadrianus de Bardis Prebendarius istius
Ecclesiae.</hi> Some report that those who rob
the Tigre of her young, use a policy to detain
their Dam from following them, by easting
sundry Looking-glasses in the way, whereat
she useth long to gaze, whether it be to behold
her own beauty, or because, when she seeth
her shape in the glass, she thinketh she seeth
one of her young ones, and so they escape the

The she Bear is most

do prosecute and obtain their prey; I
will now proceed to the handling of Beasts less

first intreat; because the Dog, whether it be
for pleasure and game in field, or for thrift and
guard at home, deserveth a very high estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

in use in Armory; whereof some prosecute
their prey speedily, others more leisurably.

               <p>Note, that it appeareth in an old Manuscript
treating of Blazon, that a Greyhound cannot

It is a general
observation, That there
is scarce any vertue inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to a man, but there
are singular sparks and
resemblances of the same
in the sundry kinds of
Dogs: For some are so couragious, as if they be
in the encounter, you may cut off a leg or any
limb before they will let go their holdfast: in
which kind the English Mastiff hath highest
praise; insomuch that Histories report, <hi>That
the Romans took Mastiffs hence to carry in
their Armies instead of Souldiers.</hi> Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have been so trusty and loving to their
Masters, as being by errour lost, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
meat, though it were to their death, till
they saw their Masters again. For their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
property in finding any thing that is lost,
in fetching any thing they are injoyned, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
any man by the scent of his foot after he
is fled: It requireth a Naturalist's large Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,

of this Bishop is not there set down. I
have inserted this Coat-Armour in regard of
the rarity of the bearing of this Beast whole in
an Escocheon, which is seldom so used: but the
skin of this Beast is of very frequent use in
Arms, it being that Furr in Blazon called Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn,
of which I have formerly treated in this
Book, <hi>Sect. 1. Chap.</hi> 4. I was as curious as I
could in procuring this Escocheon to be cut like
unto that which is depicted in that <hi>Manuscript,</hi>
because I was desirous to demonstrate unto you
the fashion of Escocheons of those times. I
must confess that I find the Blazon there to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

to Blazon the base part of the field first, which
manner of Blazon at this day is not approved
of by English Blazoners.</p>
               <p>To these must be added all fourfooted Beasts

the Hedghog and such other. It resteth that
I should now give Example of the last sort of
Beasts, among them of savage kind before
spoken of, which are those of timorous and
fearful Nature: Such are these that follow, and
their like.</p>

Conies are bred in most

are they so plentiful as
in <hi>England.</hi> Amongst
the <hi>Baleares</hi> they were
so abundant, as that the
people made sute to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
to grant them a military company of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneers

Though Nature hath

craft of strength as to
the former; yet are
they not destitute of their succours, in that they
have their strong Castles and Habitations in the

He beareth Argent,
on a Fess Nebule, Sable,
three Hares heads coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Or, by the Name

is a simple Creature, and
reposeth all her safety
in swiftness, wherein she
useth many shifts to help
herself withal, both to
defend herself from the peril of the Hounds,
and to frustrate the endeavours of the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
She naturally feareth the Eagle, Hawk,
Fox and Wolf, her natural Enemies. It is strange
which some have written of Hares, that their
Nature is, for the self same to be sometimes
Male, and sometimes Female. Such an one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
(as Poets write) was <hi>Tiresias</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi>
who being a man, became a woman, and so
continued seven years, and then returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

whether the man or the woman were
more insatiate of Venery, or took most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

they do bring forth living Creatures;

               <p>THIS other sort of four-footed Egg-bearing
Animals (as I may so term
them) notwithstanding that in many
things they have no small resemblance with
man, as well touching the faculties of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
soul, as also the parts of the body; yet
are they far more unlike us, than those that
bring forth a living Creature. And albeit that
these Egg-breeding four-footed Animals do
consist of the same bodily parts that the <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para,</hi>
or Animal-producing do, and of the four
humours that are answerable in quality to the
four Elements, and have all parts, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
as external senses, and many other things
wherein they do communicate with the <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para;</hi>
yet are there many other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ not only from these, but also even
amongst themselves one from another of them.
For neither do we find in these that quickness
of wit that we observe in others, neither like
parts of strength of body that the other
have.</p>
               <p>Like as man (especially in his soul) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
near unto God in likeness: so in like
manner do other Animals resemble man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they do participate with man in likeness af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some sort, but in divers degrees; forasmuch
as some of them have more, and some less like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with us than others have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is not (<hi>saith</hi> Beda) amongst the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Works of Nature, any one thing so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or of so base esteem, wherein a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find some Divine thing worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
No less (<hi>saith</hi> Farnesius) may we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the force of a silly Flea, than the hugeness
and strength of an Elephant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not without reason doth the Husbandman
prognosticate the approach of some great
shower of Rain by the croaking of Frogs more
frequent than usually; whereupon he saith,
<hi>that they do cry for rain.</hi> For this Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is grounded upon a Physical Reason, <hi>Omne
enim simile gaudet suo simili, &amp; suae naturae
utili ac convenienti;</hi> every like is delighted
with his like, and with that which is commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and agreeable to his Nature. Since then
that Frogs are exceedingly delighted with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as with that which best agreeth with their
Nature; therefore when they do apprehend a
foresense of Rain they do rejoice, and do testifie
their joy by singing after their manner.</p>
               <p>Animals of base esteem, and of no industry,
have (for the most part) not only four, but
manifold feet: whereby we are admonished,
that perverse and evil disposed persons have
multiplicities of affections, in respect that by
the motion of the feet our bodies are perduced
from place to place; so do our affections trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
us from one delight to another, according
to that saying, <hi>Pes meus, affectus meus; eo fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
quocunque feror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though some perhaps may esteem these
Egg-bearing Animals unworthy the dignity of
Coat-Armour; yet for my own part, I hold
their bearing to be no less honourable, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those that in common estimation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
far more worthy; insomuch that they
may well beseem the bearing of the greatest
Potentate. For if it pleased the Sovereign
King of Kings to use them as his special Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to chastise the stubborness of such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against his Ordinance, and to arm those
his minute and weak Creatures, with such an
incredible boldness, as that they feared not the
face or forces of men, but that the very Frogs
entred the houses and chambers of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
upon the people, into their ovens, and
into their kneading-throughs; yea, even into
King <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chamber, and upon his Bed.
Moreover, if God hath vouchsafed to give to
the Grashopper, the Canker-worm, the Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller,
and the Palmer-worm, the honourable
Title of his huge great Army: Why should we
prize them at so low a rate, as that we should
disdain to bear them in Coat-Armour? Since
God saith by the Prophet <hi>Ioel, I will render
you the years which the Grashopper hath eaten,
the Canker-worm, and the Catterpiller, and
the Palmer-worm, my great Host which I sent
among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore to be observed, that they also
have their actions not to be omitted in Blazon,
albeit not in that variable manner, nor yet so
copious as some others. And because they are
far different from those formerly handled, not
only in shape, but also in the manner of their
living, in their gate and actions; therefore must
they receive a divers manner of Blazon. They
are called in Latin <hi>Reptilia,</hi> or creeping things;
<hi>Quia reptant super terram.</hi> And here we must
distinguish between those things <hi>quae reptant,</hi>
which creep, as Frogs, Ants, &amp;c. and those
<hi>quae serpunt,</hi> which glide, as Snakes; which
latter kind we shall speak of afterward.</p>
               <p>But here we mention those <hi>Reptiles</hi> which
are gressible, such as by means of their feet are
able to go step by step from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so termed <hi>à gradiendo,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
by degrees: And hitherto also are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
such as by skipping, mounting, or leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
raise their bodies above ground, and so
alter their station, place, or seat. Of which
kinds some have four feet, some have more.
Such as have four feet only, are these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with their like.</p>
               <p>I have omitted in this Edition that Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which Family long since

may read in Learned
<hi>Camden.</hi> Toads and
Frogs do communicate
this natural property,
that when they sit, they hold their heads stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and without motion: which stately action
<hi>Spencer,</hi> in his <hi>Shepherds Calender,</hi> calleth the
<hi>Lording of Frogs.</hi> The bearing of Toads (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the opinion of some Armorists) do signifie
a hasty cholerick man, that is easily stirred up
to anger, whereunto he is naturally prone of
himself; having an imbred poison from his
birth.</p>

of the said County, Esquires. The shels of the

<hi>Mercury</hi> is said to be the Inventor; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Tortois left upon the Rocks after the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> the flesh being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
and the sinues that remained dried up,
he strake them with his hand, and they made
a kind of Musical sound, whereupon he framed
it into a Harp, which caused others to imitate
his practice, and to continue the same unto this
day.</p>

He beareth Azure,
a Tortois erected, Or,

This Escocheon I have
caused to be inserted in
this Edition, to manifest
the various bearing of
this gressible <hi>Reptile</hi> in
Armory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bara</hi> in his Book intituled, <hi>Les Blazones
dez Armories,</hi> giveth an Example of two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
erected one against another (as if they
were combatant) and termeth them rampant,
a term very unfitly applied to <hi>Reptiles,</hi> to
whom the terms of mounting, leaping, or skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
are much more proper. To this head must
be reduced Crocodiles, Salamanders, Chameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Ewets, Lizards, and whatsoever other
Egg-bearing Reptile, having only four feet, as
to their natural and proper place. There rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yet one other sort of this kind of <hi>Reptiles,</hi>
which are diversly shaped from all the former,
and are called in Latin <hi>Insecta animalia;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that being divided in their body between
their head and belly, their parts do seem so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
as if they hang'd only together by small
strings; having no flesh, blood, sinues, &amp;c. And
there are also <hi>Insecta</hi> which slie; but here we
speak only of Terrestrials, leaving the other
to their due place. And because such bearing
is rare, I am inforced (rather than to pass them
over with silence) to use Coats of Device, for
expressing their sundry forms, as in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Or, a
Cobweb, in the Center
thereof a Spider, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The Spider is born
free of the Weavers
Company; she studieth
not the Weavers Art,
neither hath she the
stuff whereof she makes
her thread from any
where else, than out of her own womb from
whence she draweth it; whereof, through the
agility and nimbleness of her feet, she weaveth
Gins, and dilateth, contracteth, and knitteth
them in form of a Net. And with the threads
that she draweth out of her body, she repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all rents and wracks of the same. Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly
is mans life resembled to a Spiders Web,
which is wrought with much care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and is suddenly marred with the least
occurrent that may befall it. For that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with much care and diligence, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
ended by swallowing of a crum, or hair,
or some other lesser accident (if less may be.)
In like manner Sophistical Arguments are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Spiders webs, for that they are framed
with much artificial cunning, and yet are fit for
no use but to intangle flies and weak capacities.
And to like purpose doth the Poet compare the
execution of Laws to Cobwebs, saying,
<q>
                     <l>Laws like Spiders webs are wrought,</l>
                     <l>Great flies escape and small are caught.</l>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Vpton</hi> saith, <hi>That he hath seen Spiders born in
Coat-Armour by a certain Lumbard.</hi> By the
Spider we may understand a painful and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
person, occupied in some honest and
necessary business; a man careful of his private
estate, and of good foresight in repairing of
small decays, and preventing of wracks. The
Spider herself is poisonful and deadly, yet is
her web reckoned an Antidote against poison,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55096:84"/>
notwithstanding the same is extracted out of
her womb. <hi>In like sort</hi> (saith <hi>Aelianus</hi>) <hi>out
of the poisonful contagion and infectious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
of sin and transgression, the Sovereign
powers do take occasion to extract and establish
wholsome and profitable Laws against such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
crimes.</hi> Of the Spider <hi>Solomon</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in this manner, <hi>The Spider taketh hold
with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A very remarkable Note doth</hi> Farnesius <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unto us, taken from this poor despised
Creature the Spider, touching the Procreation
of Children: It is a matter of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of what Parents a man is descended.</hi>
If we desire (<hi>saith he</hi>) to have a good race
of Horses, a litter of special good Hounds for
game, choice Plants and Stocks to plant our
Orchards and Gardens with delectable fruits,
do we not use our uttermost endeavour to effect
them? How much greater should our care and
providence be in the procreation of our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
The first instruction that the Children
receive, is in the veins and bowels of their
Parents, whereof we may take an Example
from Spiders, which are no sooner hatched
and excluded out of their Eggs, but forthwith
they practise to make webs, as if they had
brought with them (even out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb) together with their life, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
skill of webbing. Holy and reverent
is that piety that we owe to our Parents; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
enim est genitor, parens patria, parens
denique est ipse Deus.</hi> For he that begot us is
our parent, our Countrey is our parent, and
lastly God himself is our parent.</p>
               <p>It hath been often questioned, <hi>Why the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loveth the Son more dearly, tenderly, and
affectionately, than the Son doth the Father.</hi>
The Reason is this, <hi>Quia patris amor in filium
à natura est, filij in parentem ab officio.</hi> The
affectionate love of the Father proceedeth of
Nature, that of the Son of duty. Therefore
the sacred Law hath decreed, <hi>Amabis patrem
&amp; matrem tuam, Thou shalt love thy Father and
Mother,</hi> but not contrariwise: For where the
Law of Nature speaketh, there is no need it
should be assisted by Commandment. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
(even naturally) the love of the
Son to the Father is great.</p>
               <p>We may learn (<hi>saith</hi> Zanchius) by these
minute Animals, how many and how great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
we may receive from the universal
number of Creatures, that God hath given us
for Instructors and teachers of Moral Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
so that we will open our eyes to behold
them, and listen to God's disciplining us in
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admirable doubtless is the Omnipotency of
God in these Creatures; for as St.</hi> Hierome
<hi>saith,</hi> Epist. ad Heliod. Creatorem non in Caelo
tantum miramur, &amp;c. We do not admire God's
power in heaven only, and in the earth the
Sun, Elephants, Camels, Oxen, Boars, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c. but also in his smallest Creatures, the
Ant, Flea, Fly, and small Worm, and others
of like kind, whose bodies or shapes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known unto us than their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much were the</hi> Israelites <hi>assotted in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as that they esteemed beasts for gods, as
appeareth</hi> Wisd. 12. 24. For they went astray
far in the ways of errour, and esteemed the
beasts, which their enemies despised, for gods;
being abused after the manner of children that
have no understanding.</p>
               <p>So long is any Animal or living Creature
said to have life, as he hath breath and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
thereof. And this Rule holdeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in fourfooted Animals, but also in those that
we call <hi>Insecta,</hi> and in gliding Animals also,
as both <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> do teach; though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
denieth these latter to have breath, but
therein he speaketh comparatively, <hi>viz.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of other Animals, that do attract and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their breath more strongly and more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
they seem to have no breath at all.</p>
               <p>One Example more I will propose, which
shall be of the Emmet, as in this next Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent,

also doth <hi>Solomon</hi>
make mention, saying,
<hi>The Pismires a people
not strong, yet prepare
they their meat in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
To this simple
and feeble Creature is the slothful man sent to
learn wisdome; where it is said, <hi>Go to the
Pismire, O sluggard, behold her ways and be
wise. For she having no guide, governour, nor
ruler, prepareth her meat in the summer, and
gathereth her food in the harvest, &amp;c.</hi> Very
often do the Sacred Scriptures propose unto us
Examples of brute Creatures, as well to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
us with our vices, as to stir us up unto
vertue. For as there are in man sparks of the
understanding and practice of heavenly spirits,
even so the brute Animals have certain shadows
or footsteps of the vertuous qualities that are
or ought to be in men. Moreover <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 7.
<hi>Ask now the beasts and the fowls of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
aud they shall tell thee; or speak to the
earth, and it will shew thee; or the fish of
the Sea, and they shall declare unto thee.</hi> And
by the least of God's Creatures may we learn
many exemplary inducements to vertue, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
many forcible disswasions from vice, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the apparent signs of the wisdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and mercy of God that are found in them.

Cheeslip, Kitchinbobs, which being touched,
gather themselves round like a Ball, and such
like, which must be referred to the same head.
And besides all these, there are yet othersome
which be both gressible and volant; such are
those, that having their livelyhood only upon
the earth, by the help of a kind of wings they
oftentimes change their place for the acquiring
of their sustenance, as in Example.</p>

He beareth Gules, a
Grashopper in Fess pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
Or. <hi>Grashoppers</hi>
(saith <hi>Pliny</hi>) <hi>do fly
with wings made like
Pellicles or fine skins.</hi>
The Males of the Gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers
do sing in the
Summer season, but the
Females are silent.
Whereupon the Emmet, who did work (whiles
the other did sing) taketh occasion (as it is in
the Fable) to taunt their slothfulness and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
saying, <hi>Aestate quae cantaveris, in Hyeme
salta.</hi> You that sung all Summer, may go
shake your heels in the Winter. Among the
<hi>Athenians</hi> the Grashoppers were holden for a
special note of Nobility; and therefore they
used to wear golden Grashoppers in their hair
(as <hi>Pierius</hi> noteth) to signifie thereby that
they were descended of noble race and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.
For such is the natural property of the
Grashopper, that in what Soil he is bred, in the
same he will live and die; for they change not
their place, nor hunt after new habitations.
Hereupon <hi>Antisthenes</hi> took occasion to scoff at
the <hi>Athenians,</hi> saying, <hi>That in this property
they did communicate with Tortoises and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
born and living in the same shels. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
reckoneth the Grashopper for one of the
four small things in the earth that are full of
Wisdome, saying, <hi>The Grashopper hath no
King, yet go they forth all by bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are other of this kind, whose wings
are less manifest than the Grashoppers, because
they are closed in a kind of case that can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be discerned, but when they are preparing
to fly; for which respect they are called <hi>Vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennae</hi>
(saith <hi>Calepine) Quia alas vaginis

&amp;c. which, together with Locusts, and
such other as are both gressible and volant, and
many-legged, are to be reduced to this head,
as to their proper and natural place. I will
close up all these with one Example of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
which <hi>Aelianus</hi> and others report to be
winged in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> though he doubts
whether they are not rather bred by the heat
of the Sun, than by copulation; and if by this
latter, whether they come of Eggs, or come
forth living.</p>

He beareth Argent,

three Scorpions

in his <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi>
saith, <hi>That if a man
stricken with a Scorpion
sit upon an Ass with his
face towards the tail
of the Ass, his pain shall pass out of him into
the Ass, which shall be tormented for him.</hi>
In my opinion, he that will believe this, is the
Creature that must be ridden in this case; but
that the oyl of Scorpions is a Chief cure against
their own stinging, is an ancient observation. And
it is a Rule of Equity, That where the wrong
is offered, there the amends should be made.
And as these in this Escocheon are born with an
Ordinary betwixt them, so sometimes are they
born upon Ordinaries (according to a general
Rule premised) as may be seen in a Window
of S. <hi>Giles</hi>'s <hi>in the Fields</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi> where

termed Gliding: Those may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said to be such, which having
no feet at all, do yet move, and as it were

but othersome with a certain volubility and
flexible agitation of the body do make their

their skin only, some both skin and
shell also. Of the former sort are those now
following, with their like.</p>

                  <figure/>
The Field is Gules,
an Adder nowed, Or,
by the Name of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiley.</hi>
There is a natural
antipathy between Man
and Serpents of all kinds;
in which literal sense,
that was verified which
God promised, That
there should be <hi>Enmity
betwixt the Womans seed and the Serpents;</hi>
though a spiritual Enmity betwixt Christ and
the Devil (that old Serpent) was principally
foretold. The Serpent is very prudent and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
either to hurt other, or to save himself:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55096:85"/>
But his special care is to defend his head, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that part to be the principal, and withal
the weakest. This here enfolded may seem
to be one of the Locks of that monstrous Dame
<hi>Medusa,</hi> every hair of whose head was said to
be a Snake. And indeed <hi>Albertus</hi> saith, <hi>That
the hair of a woman, taken at some seasons
and laid in dung, will become very venomous
Serpents.</hi> Which some have supposed to befal
that Sex for the ancient familiarity it had at
first with that accursed Serpent.</p>
               <p>To the four-footed Egg-bearing Animals do
the Serpents come very nigh, as also other
<hi>Reptiles,</hi> For all Serpents have blood, flesh,
sinews, and other like parts as four-footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
have, although not in that perfection that
they have them. They are indowed also with
head, nostrils, eyes, tongue, teeth, and with
lights and spleen, and other inward parts and
bowels of the body, but much discrepant from
the members and bowels of all others</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that Serpents are far une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to four-footed Animals, both in shape and
strength; yet will they not give place to many
of them for sharpness of wit. It is a Creature
full of subtilty, as <hi>Moses</hi> testifieth, <hi>Gen. 3. And
the Serpent was more subtile than any Beast of
the field:</hi> For besides his exterior senses, he is
crafty and subtile in preserving his life, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of his lurking dens, in acquiring
his food, in hatching up his brood, in expelling
from him, and putting off his old slough. So
that for good cause did our Saviour exhort us
(in goodness) to imitate the wisdome of the
Serpent.</p>
               <p>These few Examples may serve instead of
many, which might be brought of Serpents of
sundry other names and natures, which all are
hither to be referred. Now let us see one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of such gliding or sliding Animals as are
more slow-paced, and have both skin and shell
to cover them; of which number is the Snail,
reckoned of all other that are born in Coat-Armour,
the slowest. And no marvel, since
it carrieth on her back no less a burden than her
whole house; for which cause she is called <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrada
Domiporta,</hi> the slow-going House-bearer.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Fess between 3 House-snails,
Argent, by the
Name of <hi>Shelley.</hi> These
are called House-snails,
either because they so
carry their Houses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their back, whereby
they be aptly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-snail,
that hath no house or shell; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
usually they breed about old houses. The
bearing of the Snail doth signifie, that much
deliberation must be used in matters of great
difficulty and importance: For albeit the Snail
goeth most slowly, yet in time, by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in her course, she ascendeth the top of
the highest Tower, as the worthy and learned
Gentleman Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> of <hi>Antony,</hi> hath wittily
moralized in his Poem intituled, <hi>The Herrings
Tail.</hi> It is also fabled, that when the Snail
and the Hare were to go a journey for a wager,
the Hare confident of his Footmanship, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to take a nap by the way; the Snail know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had nothing to trust to but his indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
perseverance, came to his ways end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Hare could awake. But a worse thing
in the Snails going is this, that wheresoever he
goeth, he leaveth such marks and lines, that
a man may as easily track him, as a young
Thief that is not yet perfect in his trade. And
thus by little and little have we also with the
Snail ended one part of our journey concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Animals Terrestrial, or which live upon
the earth: And because we have yet much
way to travel, we will now take wings, and
will mount up with such Creatures as live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the earth.</p>

               <p>A Second general Member of our Division
of living Creatures, concerning such as
live above the Earth in the Air, as are
the Fowls and Birds of all sorts: and as we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
the former by their feet, so the same
Method we will follow in these. Their feet
therefore are in some whole or conjoyned; in
others divided. The whole-footed do in a sort
resemble the palm of a mans hand, and are
therefore in Latin called <hi>Palmipedes;</hi> such as
the Swan, Goose, Duck, and for the most part
all River Fowls, as partly shall appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by Examples. But here I hold it necessary,
entring into this Discourse, to set down some
general Rules or Notes concerning the bearing
of Birds or Fowls, that the Reader may know
whither to resort for a resolution of such doubts
as may arise touching their bearing. Fowls or
Birds are of more worthy bearing in Coat-Armour
than Fishes, because they do more
participate of air and fire (the two noblest and
highest Elements) than of water or earth.
All fowls, of whatsoever kind, must be born
in Coat-Armour, as is best fitting the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their natural actions, of going, sitting,
standing, flying, &amp;c. Otherwise such Armory
shall be said to be false, because <hi>Ars imitatur
naturam in quantum potest;</hi> Art as much as
possible it can, doth imitate Nature. All Birds
are mustered under the name of Fowls, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their <hi>Genus</hi> or General, and so may seem
(after a sort) to be one. Nevertheless, in their
<hi>Species,</hi> or several kinds, they differ much
touching their particular qualities; for some of
them are simple, some others subtile, some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55096:86"/>
solitary, some sociable, some melodious, some
articulate, some docible, some doltish and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docible,
some of long continuance, and some
only of a few months lasting. <hi>Leigh</hi> saith,
<hi>That Birds in an Escocheon shall be numbred
unto Ten, and if they exceed that number, then
they shall be said to be</hi> sans number, <hi>and shall be
so blazoned.</hi> But <hi>Chassaneus</hi> saith, <hi>that they shall
be numbred unto sixteen;</hi> and of such bearing
and blazoning he giveth instances of Monsieur
<hi>Montmorancie,</hi> and of the Lord <hi>Lovale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the beaks or bills and feet of
Birds, most Armorists finding them to be of a
different colour from the rest of the body, do
term them all generally <hi>membred.</hi> But under
reformation of the skill, I hold, that as there
is a difference in the Nobility of Birds, so ought
they to have distinct terms of blazon: So that all
those that either are whole-footed, or have
their feet divided, and yet have no Tallons,
should be termed <hi>membred.</hi> But the Cock, and
also all Birds of prey, should be termed in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
<hi>armed;</hi> forasmuch as Nature hath assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cock (being a Bird much addicted to
battel) spurs; and to the Birds of prey, sharp
and hooked beaks and tallons, not only for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
and defence, but also to seize upon,
gripe, and rend their prey, and are to them as
teeth and claws unto Lions, Tigres, and other
fierce Beasts. <hi>Similium enim similis est ratio;</hi>
where the things are like, the reason is like.
It is generally observed, that amongst Fowls
of prey, the Female is the noblest and most
hardy: which Nature did so provide, because
(besides her own sustenance) the care of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her young doth especially lie on the Female;
and therefore if she should be timorous or cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly,
she would not be able to provide food
for herself and them. <hi>Such Fowls</hi> (saith <hi>Vpton)
as either in respect of their uniformity do never
change colour naturally, or by nature are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
coloured, shall be only named in blazon,
and no mention at all made of their colours, but
shall be termed proper; unless they either in part,
or in whole, be born of some other colour than
is natural to them.</hi> In the blazoning of Fowls
much exercised in flight, if their wings be not
displaied, they shall be said to be <hi>born close;</hi>
as he beareth an Eagle, Falcon, Swallow, &amp;c.
<hi>close.</hi> As in other forementioned Creatures,
so in Fowls also, besides the whole bearing, the
parts or members are also usually born in Coat-Armour,
as the heads, wings, feathers, and
Legs: and both couping and erasing are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
unto the parts of Fowls, as of those
Terrestrials, as by Examples following shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
wherein I will first begin with River
Fowls (which for the most part are whole-footed)
using neither curiousness in their form
of placing, or copiousness in their number; but
only that by the assistance of some few chief
Examples, that which hath been delivered by
Precepts and Rules, may be the more easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Swan, Argent, by the
Name of <hi>Leigham.</hi> All
River Fowls have their
tails shorter than other
Birds; wherein Nature
hath providently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
that the length
of their tail should not
be any impediment to
them in their swiming, diving, or runing. The Swan is a Bird of great beauty and strength al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:
and this is reported in honour of him, that
he useth not his strength to prey or tyrannize
over any other Fowl, but only to be revenged
on such as first offer him wrong; <hi>In which case</hi>
(saith <hi>Aristole) he often subdueth the Eagle.</hi>
This Bird is dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> whose white
colour denoteth sincerity; yet <hi>Leda</hi> was by
<hi>Iupiter</hi> deceived, when in that shape he fled
into her Lap, when he was pursued by the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</p>

expansed, Argent, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,

encounters with any
other of his own kind,
but in these two cases:
First, if any other be a
Rival in his love, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to court his mate; in which quarrel he will
be revenged to the death: also, if another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon his possession and place of haunt,
he is never at quiet till he hath expulsed him.
And these two points are causes of most quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
amongst the noblest Spirits.</p>

is more desirable) he is compelled by the
Laws of Nature to love his Father. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is the part and duty of a Father to bring
up and instruct his Son in vertue, and that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
hath no other reward than honour; unless
the Son do give honour to the Father, he doth
violate or rather lose the name of a Son. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
also he receiveth nourishment from his
Father, wherein consisteth the sustentation of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55096:87"/>
life; there is nothing comprised under this
name of sustentation, that the Son seemeth not
to owe to his Father: finally, forasmuch as
the Father is God's Vicegerent, the Son, next
unto God, is bound to obey his Parents. These
are the things that Nature, or rather God in
Nature teacheth us by the Stork; <hi>Natura e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
nihil agit, nisi aeternis consiliis,</hi> Nature
doth nothing but by God's special direction.</p>

<hi>Nature</hi> requireth
that her care, for their

that the Stork is the Emblem of a grateful man.

whole blood from the ancient Family of the

the Saphire stone, whose virtue, as Philosophers

This colour in Armory by it self sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth

               <p>Under these sorts will I briefly comprehend
all River-Fowls whatsoever, <hi>viz.</hi> all such as
are whole-footed under the former; and all
Cranes, Herns, Cormorants, &amp;c. under this
latter; for that albeit they be of the kind of
River-Fowls, yet have they their feet divided.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="20" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <p>AFTER those River-Fowls whole-footed
and divided, by order it now falleth
to hand that I should proceed to such
Fowls as do frequent, partly the Air, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Land; of which some are Fowls of
prey, othersome are Predable, or fit to be
made a Prey.</p>
               <p>Such as are Fowls of prey have their Beaks
and Tallons evermore hooked and sharp: hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for sure seizing and detaining; and sharp for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55096:87"/>
speedy rending and dividing thereof. Such are
Eagles of all sorts, Vultures, Falcons, Gerfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
Sakers, Lanerts, Tercels, Sparhawks,
Marlins, &amp;c, as also Kites, Buzzards, Owls, &amp;c.
<hi>Of Fowls</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny) those that have hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
claws and tallons, are not fruitful breeders,
for the most part; wherein Nature hath well
provided for all kinds of Fowls, that the
mightier should not be so copious as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and such as do fly from the tyrauny of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
Some of these Fowls of prey are (in
their kind) ennoblished by nature in as high
a degree of Nobility, as the chiefest of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Animals before handled. Such are those
that do much frequent the Air, as Eagles and
Hawks of all sorts, which are much exercised
in flying; and albeit they do build their nests,
and have their feeding upon the earth, yet is
their agitation above in the air. Therefore in
regard of the worthiness of the Element where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are chiefly occupied, I will begin with
Birds of prey, and after our former order, first
with their whole bearing, and so descend to
the parts (promiscuously) of sundry Birds,
according to the dignity of their place, or more
noble use, as in Example.</p>

is much commended; and it is a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>The Eagle is said to be <hi>Altivolans avis,</hi> an
high-soaring Bird, that sometime flieth so high
a pitch, as that she transcendeth the view of
man. She hath a tender care of her young: when
they be fligg or flush (as we say) and ready
for flight, then she stirreth up her nest and
fluttereth over them; yea, she taketh them on
her wings, and so soareth with them through
the Air, and carrieth them aloft, and so freeth
them from all danger. In that she carrieth her
young ones rather upon her wings than in her
tallons, she sheweth her tender care and love
that she beareth unto them. She is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
full of feathers, by means whereof she gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
through the Air very lightly, and maketh
way through the same with great expedition
and swiftness. <hi>Our persecutors</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremiah)
are swifter than the Eagles of heaven.</hi> And
again, 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 23. Saul and Ionathan were
swifter than Eagles.</hi> The Crown of her head
is enlarged with baldness as her years are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
As we may see <hi>Michah 1. 16. Make

Enlarge thy baldness as the Eagle, for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55096:88"/>
they are gone into captivity from thee.</hi> Wherein
the Prophet alludeth to the customes of the
Gentiles, who in the time of their mourning
used to shave their heads, and cut their flesh,
and to scorch the same with stigmatical marks,
which customs God did expresly forbid the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
to use, as appeareth <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>
14. 1.</p>

that such bearing be not agreeable to

Esq. Now I will shew
you an Example, where
three of these kind of
Birds are born together upon one Ordinary;
but when you find two or more of them so born
or in one Escocheon without interposition of
some Ordinary between them, you must not
then term them Eagles, but Eaglets, as <hi>Leigh</hi>
hath observed, <hi>pag.</hi> 104. And I take it, this
Rule of his is grounded upon the same Reason,
that I have formerly given concerning Lions
and Lioncels in the fifteenth Chapter of this
third Section, <hi>pag.</hi> 138. for the Eagle is the
Sovereign of Birds, as the Lion is of Beasts.</p>

He beareth Argent,

one of the Gentlemen Pensioners both
to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and also to our late Sovereign.
These Eaglets, because they be still in exercise,
do lively represent their Sires to be no Bastards
or degenerate Brood. It is storied, that the
old Eagles make a proof of their young by
exposing them against the Sun-beams, and such
as cannot steddily behold that brightness, are
cast forth as unworthy to be acknowledged
their Off-spring. In which respect <hi>William
Rufus,</hi> King of this Land, gave for his Device
an Eagle looking against the Sun, with this
word <hi>Perfero,</hi> I can indure it: to signifie, he
was no whit degenerate from his puissant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Conqueror.</p>

true magnanimity and

signified by the Eagle, which never seeketh to
combat with any small Birds, or those which
for their weakness be far unequal to herself.</p>

The Eagle, though he
mounteth high, yet is
his eye still roving on
the ground; so those
who are highest eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in honour, should yet
still entertain the humblest thoughts: But with
this difference from the Eagle, in that she look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downward to seek out some prey; which is
most unworthy of any noble Spirit, whom it
ill befitteth to pry and prole into poor mens
states to make a prey of them, as those great
ones of whom <hi>David</hi> saith, that <hi>They humbled
themselves, that the congregation of the poor
may fall into the hands of their captains.</hi> The
Beak of an Eagle in her old age waxeth so hook<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed,
that it hindereth her feeding, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
her strength, then (according to some
Authors) she flieth to the Rock, and whetteth
the same so long, untill she make it proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

The Field is Ruby,
two wings inverted and
conjoyned, Topaz, by
the Name of <hi>Seymour.</hi>
The wings are Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks
of celerity,
and sometime of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and coverture; as
the Psalmist often speaks
of <hi>hiding under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi>
of the wings of Gods favour: because
the Hens do shelter their young from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
of the mightier, with spreading their
wings over them. And therefore some have
thought, that the displaying of the Roman Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
wings did signifie the protection of the
obedient, and the extending of her griping
tallons to betoken the rending and ruine of all
that were resistant. Like as the Eagle in her
life makes prey of all other Fowl, so her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
being mingled with the feathers of other
Fowls, are said to consume them all to dust:
and therefore one compares them to riches got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by oppression or fraud, which will eat out
in time all the rest, though well gotten.</p>

<hi>Glocester,</hi> Kt. As wings
of fowls are born whole,
so are their feathers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
amongst which the
Ostriches may justly bear praise for beauty, for
distinction from all others, and for frequent use
and note in Armory, as I could shew by divers
Examples of their bearing, both by themselves

Scroles of the first,
by the Name of <hi>Roger
Clarendon,</hi> that was base
Son to the puissant <hi>black
Prince.</hi> The proper
conusance of the Princes
of <hi>Wales,</hi> being the same three feathers born
altogether with one Escrole, having this Motto,
ICH DIEN; whereby in Princely modesty
they dutifully profess that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows,
<hi>That the Son, as long as he is under tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is himself a Subject.</hi> But the Ostrich's
feathers in plume were sometimes also the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> who gave them with
this word, VI NULLA INVERTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUR
ORDO, <hi>No force alters their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion;</hi>
alluding to the fold and fall of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

He beareth Argent,
six Ostrich's feathers,
three, two, and one, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by the Name of
<hi>Iervis.</hi> This man was
a principal Founder of
<hi>Exbridge</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Devon.</hi> Of the
Ostrich, some have
doubted whether he
should be reckoned a Beast or a Fowl, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of some participation of both kinds; yet
doth <hi>P. Belon du Mans</hi> make no scruple at all
to sort him among Birds: therefore I have held
it fit to place his feathers here amongst the
parts of Birds.</p>

He beareth Sable, an
Eagle's leg in Pale, era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>à la quise,</hi> Argent,
the tallons, Gules, by
the Name of <hi>Canhanser.</hi>
This is termed <hi>à la
quise;</hi> and <hi>quise</hi> in
French signifieth a
thigh. It is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
that the devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer shall be devoured in his due time, even as
the rending and preying legg is here it self rent
off from the body. A worthy document for
all great men, whose bearing is of the ravening
and preying kind, to stand in fear how they
seize on any prey against justice; because if
they escape the like measure with man, yet it
is a just thing with God to shew no mercy to
them which are merciless.</p>

He beareth Or, two
Eagles leggs barr-ways,
erased <hi>à la quise,</hi> Sable,
armed, Gules. Though
the Eagles strength be much in her leggs and
beak, yet sometimes she
is for to use her wit to
rend her prey; as espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
she doth in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
open all Shell-fish, which she useth (as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
doth many great men) to carry them up
very high, that they might fall with greater
force, and so be broken up for her food. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is recorded one memorable, but piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
experiment on the Poet <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> who sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in deep meditation, an Eagle thinking his
bald-head had been a stone, let fall a Tortoise
upon it, and so made a Tragical end of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tragedian.</p>

The Field is Argent,
a Cheveron between 3
Eagles leggs erased, <hi>à

the Name of <hi>Bray.</hi>
To these leggs of Eagles
I hold it not unfit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn (for company) 3
Ravens leggs born after
another sort. The Raven was the Ensign of
the <hi>Danes</hi> when they invaded this Kingdom;
whose whole bearing you shall find hereafter.</p>

He beareth Argent,
three Ravens leggs era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Sable, meeting in

Guly tallons extended
into the three acute cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Escocheon,
by the Name of <hi>Owen</hi>
of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Madock.</hi> The Raven
hath his name for his Rapine, whence other
like Birds are termed Ravenous; but his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
is most shewed on dead Carkasses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
amongst generous Spirits, it is accounted
base to be valiant amongst them that cannot
resist, or to hurt the name and reputation of the
dead.</p>
               <p>As the Terrestrial Animals have their peculiar
actions and gestures, so doubtless have Birds
and Fowls their gesture according to their kind:
for sometime we find them born pearching,
which action is more usual with Birds or Fowls
of prey that are throughly mained &amp; brought
to the fist, as in this Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules,
a Bend wavy, Argent,
in the sinister chief

               </p>
               <p>Now since we are
come to treat of Fowls of prey; whereof
(next to the Eagle, which is reckoned the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Queen of all Fowls, like as the Lion is
reputed the King of all Beasts) the Goshawk,
the Falcon, the Gerfalcon, and all other long-winged
Hawks; as also all Sparhawks, Marli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Hobbeys, and other like small Fowl of
prey are the chief, it shall not be altogether
impertinent (though therein I do somewhat
digress from my principal purpose) if I give
some little touch of the propriety of terms
commonly used of Falconers in managing
their Hawks, and things to them appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
according to the slenderness of my skill,
always subscribing herein to the censure and
reformation of professed Falconers. The cause
of this my digression is, the desire I have to
give some superficial taste unto Gentlemen of
the terms of Falconry, like as I have done
Chap. 14. of the terms of skilful Woodmen
or Huntsmen: That so in their mutual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
together, they may be able to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
(though but superficially) and deliver
their minds in apt terms, when in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they happen to fall into discourse of the
noble recreations and delights, either of our
generous Armorial Profession, or of Hunting
and Hawking; that so the standers by may say
of them (when they shall observe their skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
discourses) as old Father <hi>Simon</hi> said to <hi>Sosia</hi>
his late Bondman, touching the delights of his
Son <hi>Pamphilus, Ter. And.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Quod plerique omnes faciunt adole scentuli,</l>
               <l>Vt animum ad aliquod studium adjungant, aut
equos</l>
               <l>Alere, aut canes ad venandum, aut ad Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophos:</l>
               <l>Horum ille nihil egregie praeter caetera</l>
               <l>Studebat, &amp; tamen omnia haec mediocriter.</l>
               <p>It is a usual thing with the most part of
young men to delight themselves, either in
pampering of Horses, or to cherish Dogs for
hunting, or to addict themselves to the study
of Philosophy; he fixed not his delight in any
one of these more than another, yet was he
meetly well seen in them all.</p>
               <p>The terms of Falconry, that I purpose to
touch in this place, are briefly these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>First, a Hawk is said to bate, when she striveth
to fly from the fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:55096:90"/>
She is said to rebate, when by the motion of
the bearers hand she recovereh the fist.</p>
               <p>You must say, feed your hawk, and not give
her meat.</p>
               <p>A hawk is said (after she hath fed) she smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or sweepeth her beak, and not wipeth her beak or bill.</p>
               <p>By the beak of an hawk is understood the
upper part which is nooked.</p>
               <p>The neather part of the beak is called the
hawks clap.</p>
               <p>The holes in the hawks beak are called her
Nares.</p>
               <p>The yellow between the beak and the eyes
is called the Sere.</p>
               <p>Hawks of long small black feathers like hairs
about the Sere, are properly called Crinites.</p>
               <p>You must say your hawk jouketh, and not
sleepeth.</p>
               <p>Also your hawk pruneth, and not picketh
herself.</p>
               <p>But your hawk cannot be said properly to
prune herself, but when she beginneth at her
legs, and fetcheth moisture at her tail, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she embalmeth her feet, and striketh the
feathers of her wings through her beak.</p>
               <p>Her fetching of the Oyl is called the Note.</p>
               <p>Your hawk is said to rowse, and not shake
herself.</p>
               <p>Sometime your hawk countenances, when
she picketh herself.</p>
               <p>Then shall you not say she pruneth herself,
but that she reformeth her feathers.</p>
               <p>Your hawk collieth, and not breaketh; your
hawk straineth, not clitcheth or snatcheth.</p>
               <p>She mantleth, and not stretcheth, when she
extendeth one of her wings along after her
leggs, and so the other.</p>
               <p>After she hath thus mantled herself, she cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
her wings together over her back, which
action you shall term the warbling of her wings
and say, she warbleth her wings.</p>
               <p>You shall say your hawk mutesheth or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and not skliseth.</p>
               <p>You shall say cast your hawk to the Pearch,
and not set your hawk upon the Pearch.</p>
               <p>Furthermore you shall say, she is a fair, long,
short, thick hawk, and not a great hawk.</p>
               <p>Also you shall say, this hawk hath a large, or
a short beak, but call it not a bill.</p>
               <p>Also that your hawk is full gorged, and not
cropped.</p>
               <p>And that she hath a fine head, or a small head
well seasoned.</p>
               <p>You shall say, your hawk putteth over, and
endueth, but both of them in a divers kind.</p>
               <p>She putteth over, when she removeth her
meat from her gorge into her bowels, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with her body, but chiefly with her
neck, as a Crane or some other bird doth.</p>
               <p>She never endueth so long as her bowels be
full at her feeding; but as soon as she hath fed,
and resteth, she endueth by little and little.</p>
               <p>If her gorge be void, and her bowels any
thing stiff, then shall you say she is embowelled,
and hath not fully endued.</p>
               <p>So long as you find any thing in her bowels,
it is dangerous to give her meat.</p>

volant, with jesses and

like a hook, and is
called in Latin <hi>Falco</hi>
(saith <hi>Calepine) non quod
falcatis unguibus, sed quod rostro &amp; talis tota

tallons, beak, and all made hooked for to prey.

Falco.</hi> This bird (according to the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
is very bold and hardy, and of great

Baronet; as also of Sir
<hi>Vincent Corbet</hi> of <hi>Moar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Corbet</hi>
in the said County, Baronet. This
is good and ancient Armory, as we shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Escocheon of the Ravens three
leggs. It hath been an ancient received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the same also grounded upon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the sacred Scriptures (if I mistake not)
that such is the property of the Raven, that
from the time his young ones are hatched or
disclosed, until he seeth what colour they will
be of, he never taketh care of them, nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth
any food unto them; therefore it is
thought that they are in the mean space nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with the heavenly dew. And so much
also doth the Kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> affirm,
<hi>Which giveth fodder unto the cattle, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the young Ravens that call upon him, Psal.</hi>
147. 9. The Raven is of colour black, and is
called in Latin <hi>Corvus,</hi> or <hi>Corax,</hi> and (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Alexander</hi>) hath but one kind of cry
or sound, which is <hi>Cras, Cras.</hi> When he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
his young ones to be pen-feathered and
black like himself, then doth he labour by all
means to foster and cherish them from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward.</p>
               <p>This bird (after his manner) is clamorous,
fraudulent, filching things away by stealth,
and hiding them secretly: Furthermore <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
saith, <hi>That Ravens do sometimes skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
amongst themselves with much eagerness,
and do assail each other with their armors,</hi> viz.
<hi>with jobbing with their bills, scratching with
their tallons, and beating with their wings:
in which conflict if the Hen do chance to have
the better of the Cock, she ever after holdeth
him in subjection.</hi> But howsoever they do cope
together in their encounter, certain it is that
the Victor ever after carrieth a hand over the
conquered.</p>

He beareth Gules, a
Pellican in her nest, with

Name of <hi>Carne;</hi> and is
born by <hi>Thomas Carne</hi>
of <hi>Nash,</hi> and <hi>Iohn
Carne</hi> of <hi>Wenny,</hi> both
in <hi>Glamorganshire,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>
The Egyptian Priests (as <hi>Farnesius</hi> noteth)
used the Pellican for a Hieroglyphick, to express
the four duties of a Father towards his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
whereof the first is generation; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is his office of education; the third of
training up, or instruction of learning; the
fourth and last, this duty of informing the eyes
of his Children with the example of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and honest life: for in the institution of
civil behaviour, the eyes are more easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
for the apprehension of instruction, than
the ear. This bird was also born Topaz, in a
Field Saphire, by that sapient and great Peer
of his time, <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi>
Lord Privy Seal, and Counsellor to two great
Kings, <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and <hi>Henry</hi> the

but because they have not such use of their feet
as other birds have. And if perchance they
fall upon the ground, they cannot raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

themselves to flight. For this cause they
are accustomed to make their Nests upon Rocks
and other high places, from whence they may
easily take their flight, by means of the support
of the Air. Hereupon it came, that this Bird
is painted in Arms without feet: and for this
cause it is also given for a difference of younger
Brethren, to put them in mind to trust to their
wings of vertue and merit, to raise themselves,
and not to their leggs, having little Land to
put their foot on.</p>

As some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Eagle the Queen, and the Swallow

courage, and also prepared evermore to the

sharp and hooked bill for a faulchion or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax
to slash and wound his enemy; and as a
compleat Souldier armed Cap-a-pe, he hath
his leggs armed with spurs, giving example to
the valiant Souldier to expell danger by fight,
and not by flight. The Cock croweth when
he is Victor, and giveth a testimony of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
If he be vanquished, he shunneth the
light and society of men. Of all birds, this
may best be said in blazon to be armed, that is
thus furnished and prepared to the encounter.
He is the Herald of the day, and the Sentinel

Indeed those which are most proud, are
generally of such sluttish and dirty qualities.
He displayeth his Plumes against the rays of the
Sun, that they may glister the more gloriously:
and he loseth this beautiful train yearly with
the fall of the Leaf; at which time he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

He beareth Azure,
three Bees volant, <hi>En
arriere,</hi> by the Name
of <hi>Bye.</hi> The Bee I may
well reckon a Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Insect, being so ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the behoof of
the Keeper. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
policy and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
both in Peace and War, with the
several duties both of the sovereign Bee, and
of the subjects, is beyond belief, and will ask
as large a Volume as the Commonwealth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Plato</hi>'s or <hi>Licurgus,</hi> to set it forth as it
deserveth.</p>
               <p>These small and slender bodies are indowed
with a perfect soul (if I may so say) as by the
effects appeareth: for they do not only live and
engender; but also have the use of the senses,
as sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no less than other Volatiles or flying Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
and in some of them we may observe a
singular sharpness of wit, and (to speak with
<hi>Solomon</hi>) fulness of wisdome; as in these Bees
and such others. Great is the Lord therefore
that made them, and right marvellous also is
he in all his works, who hath given this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wisdome to these contemptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The Bee is reputed to be of a doubtful kind,
in regard that it is uncertain, whether he may
be fitly numbred amongst the savage or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
kind of Animals; therefore they are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
his that hath obtained the possession of
them according to our vulgarspeech, <hi>Catch that
catch may.</hi> They are said to be <hi>ferae naturae:</hi>
therefore the Bees that do swarm on your trees,
until you have gathered them into an hive,
they are no more reckoned yours, than the
birds that do build their nests in your tree: but
being once hived, they cease to be publick, and
shall be adjudged the possessors, though he be
not interessed in the ground: and till then, it
is lawful for any man to take the Honycombs,
if they have any at all. Also a swarm escaped
out of your hives, is no longer reckoned yours
than you have them in sight, and it is lawful
for you so long to prosecute them; but if they
fly out of your sight, <hi>fiunt occupantis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Egyptians reckoned the Bee a figure of
Regal Power, because in him (besides the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of brute Animals) he is constituted a King,
that administreth his function (as it were) by
deep counsel, forasmuch as he is void of sting,
and governeth his hive, as his Commonwealth,
altogether by lenity.</p>
               <p>If a Bee sting a dead carkass, she loseth not
her sting; but if she sting a living man, she
loseth her sting. So death stinging us, who
were as dead flesh, did not lose his sting: But
stinging Christ, hath lost his sting. Therefore
we may say, <hi>O death where is thy sting, &amp;c.
1 Cor.</hi> 15. Death hath only the name of death,
but not the sting of death; as the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in the Wilderness had the form and shape
of a Serpent, but not the life nor sting of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 9.</p>

He beareth Argent, a
Bee-hive beset with
Bees diversly volant,
Sable, by the Name of
<hi>Rooe</hi> of <hi>Cheshire. The
Bee</hi> (saith the Wise
man) <hi>is the least of
Birds, but she is of much
vertue; and she provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both honey for
pleasure, and wax for thrift.</hi> And not only
do they carefully preserve their own petty
state, but by their labours do much sway in all
humane states and policies also; as is said in that
Verse,
<q>
                     <l>The Calf, the Goose, the Bee;</l>
                     <l>The World is ruled by these three.</l>
                  </q>
Meaning that Wax, Pens, and Parchment sway
all mens states. Bees have three properties of
the best kind of Subjects; they stick close to
their King; they are very industrious for their
livelyhood, expelling all idle Drones; they
will not sting any but such as first provoke
them, and then they are most fierce.</p>

<hi>giveth this general
note,</hi> That all such as
are armed with a sting
in their body or tail, have four wings a

carry their weapon in their mouth. To the
former (<hi>saith he</hi>) Nature hath given it for
their revenge; to the other, only to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
withal, and to content Nature. All
Insects (<hi>saith the same Author</hi>) having hard
eyes, have their forefeet longer than the rest,
to the end that with them they may other whiles
scour their eyes.</p>

               <p>HAVING finished our intended survey
of Animals, both Terrestrial and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and of their use in Armory; I will
now (according to order) proceed to the
handling of watery Animals, being such as have
their principal abode and relief in the waters;
as Fishes of all sorts. As fishes are of a less
compleat nature than earthly or aerial Animals,
so must they in reason be of less esteem in Coat-Armour,
<hi>Data paritate gestantium,</hi> unless
the quality of the Bearer add an honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
because those others do approach much
nearer to the nature of man, than the watery
sort doth; <hi>Et illud est melius, quod optimo est
propinquius;</hi> That is the better, which comes
nearest to the best. And the Picture which is
the adumbration of the thing pictured, cannot
invert or alter the order or worth of the things
whereof it beareth the similitude, <hi>Quia fictio
non plus operatur quam veritas;</hi> representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may not alter the truth of the principal.</p>
               <p>But here I speak of arms composed of fishes,
as they are considered in their self-nature;
which notwithstanding as they be born of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons descended of Noble and Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
are so much enoblished in their estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that they are to be preferred before
many that are formed of beasts or fowls. This
therefore must be here also recommended for a
general Rule, That the worthiness of the
Bearer is not the least respect we should use in
considering the dignity of things born in Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>Like as birds have their plumes, wings, and
trains, by means whereof they do cut their
way, and make smooth passage thorow the air;
in like sort fishes are furnished with fins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they guide themselves in their swiming,
and cut the current of the streams and waves,
for their more easie passage, wherein their
course is directed by their tail, as ships are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by their Helm or Ruther. And for their
kinds of motion, fishes are in Scripture term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Reptilia: In ipso magno mari &amp; spatioso,
illic reptilia sunt, &amp;c.</hi> In the great and wide
sea there are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great: which are therefore said to be
<hi>Reptilia,</hi> as <hi>Chassenus</hi> noteth, <hi>Quia omnia quae
natant reptandi habent vel speciem, velnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi>
because things when they swim seem to
creep along in the water.</p>
               <p>Fishes, albeit they have not breath (as we
may say in a comparative sort) so strong and
sensible as four-footed Animals have, because
they want Lungs or Lights, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath
taught, yet it behooveth they should have both
attraction and respiration of breath in some
fashion, which we call in Latin <hi>Inspiratio,</hi>
which is a drawing in of breath, and <hi>Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi>
which is a venting out of the breath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
as both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> do teach,
who do affirm that fishes do receive and deliver
their breath by their <hi>galls;</hi> For no longer is
any Animal said to have life, than he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and remission of breath.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention <hi>Gen. 2. 19,
20. That God caused all the beasts of the field,
and the fowls of heaven to come unto Adam,
that he might see how he would name them:</hi>
there is no mention of the coming of fishes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, neither that he gave names to them.
The reason is, for that such is the nature of
fishes, as that they cannot live long out of their
proper Element, which is the water. Besides
fishes do serve men for no other use, but for
food, and some sorts of them for medicine;
whereof it cometh, that we have not so many
names of fishes mentioned in the Scriptures, as
of other Animals. For these Reasons fishes
were not produced before <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might
give them Names answerable to their Natures:
Nevertheless God gave him dominion over
them, as well as over the rest, when he said
<hi>Dominamini piscibus maris, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereof it cometh, that man hath less familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and acquaintance with fishes than with
many other animals; as Horses, Doggs, small
Birds of many kinds, which we daily use, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to serve our necessities, or for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
               <p>Fishes are born after a divers manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
directly upright, imbowed, extended, endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
respecting each other, surmounting one
another, fretted, and trianguled, &amp;c. <hi>All fishes</hi>
(saith <hi>Leigh) that are born feeding, shall be
termed in blazon</hi> devouring, <hi>because they do
swallow all whole without mastication or
chewing: and you must tell whereon they feed.</hi>
All fishes raised directly upright, and having
fins, shall be termed in blazon <hi>Hauriant, ab
hauriendo,</hi> signifying to draw or suck; because
fishes do oftentimes put their heads in such sort
above the waters, to refresh themselves with
the cool and temperate air; but especially when
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55096:94"/>
the waters do so rage and boyl in the depth of
the seas against some tempestuous storm, that
they cannot endure the unwonted heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
All fishes being born transverse, the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
must in blazon be termed Naiant, of
the word <hi>Nato,</hi> to swim; for in such manner
do they bear themselves in the waters when
they swim.</p>
               <p>Concerning both the variety and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitude of fishes, <hi>Pliny</hi> is of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fantastical conceit, affirming that the seeds
and universal elements of the world are so
sundry ways commixed one with another, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the blowing of the winds, and partly by
the rowling and agitation of the sea, that it
may be truly said, according to the vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>That whatsoever is ingendred or bred in
any part of the world besides, the same is to be
found in the sea; besides many things more in
it, which no where else are to be seen.</hi> A fish
(if you will believe <hi>Farnesius</hi>) is called <hi>piscis
a pascendo, Quia ad rem nullam nisi ad pastum
natus est;</hi> he is bred only to eat, and to be eaten.
Of fishes, some have hard and crusty coverings;
others have a softer outside: and those latter
are also of two sorts, some having only skin,
and others scales. Scaled fishes by their fins
are both adorned &amp; greatly assisted also in their
swiming: but Congers, Eels, Lampreys, and
such like, may seem (in respect of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their fins) to have received them of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
rather for ornament than for use in swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
especially because they lye most in the
bottom of the waters, and therefore less need
their fins.</p>
               <p>Of these several kinds I will briefly give
some few Examples, wherein I rather purpose
to lay open their divers forms of bearing in
Coat-Armour, than meddle with their unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
particular kinds: as in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Argent,
three Eels Naiant in

by the Name of <hi>Ellis.</hi>

Congers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of like kind,
whereof some are born
Naiant aften this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and other Hauriant.
This sort, of all others, doth most nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
in their motions such Reptiles, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no feet, do with a kind of volubleness
make their way in the waters with many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
doublings. To these may be added Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Soles, Flounders, and whatsoever other
fish, whose covering consisteth meerly of
skin, and have not the defensible furniture
of scales, such as next ensue; as in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

to the Family of

These arms are

The Dolphin is a fish of

shelter, in the fierceness of his pursuit he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
dasheth himself dead against the rock,

many times is the success of over-heady and
outragious men, who seeking furiously the hurt
of others, feel the smart themselves in their

to marshal their great Troops in admiring or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for in the vantgard swim all their young

looking both to the orderly demeanour of their

in their eye, to defend them from danger.</p>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> The
Dolphin is said to be a
fish of such exceeding great swiftness, as that
oftentimes he out-strippeth a ship under Sail, in
her greatest ruff and merriest wind, in swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of course. In this fish is proposed unto us
an Example of charity and kind affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Children, as <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the nature of this fish sheweth, <hi>lib. 9. c.</hi> 8.
and <hi>Aelianus, lib. 5. cap.</hi> 18. as also of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
love towards man, whereof <hi>Aelianus</hi>
produceth strange Examples. To this Head
must be referred all other fishes of hard scale,
as the Sturgeon, &amp;c. Other scale-fishes there
are, but of a more soft and tender sort; such
as these which ensue.</p>

He beareth Sable,
three Salmons hauriant,

(whose tongue was a
touchstone to try the
excellency of all dishes)
were to give his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in the Senate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of Gluttons, it is
thought he would preferr the Salmon before all
other fishes, though the old Romans made
chief reckoning of Acipenser, a fish of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
making and quality; for his scales turn
all towards the head, and he ever swimeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the stream. These three Salmons here
were very fair bearing in a great Charger, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
Fishes are born hauriant, both respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
each other, and also endorsed, as in these
next Examples.</p>

He beareth Azure,
two Barbels hauriant,
respecting each other,
Argent. A like Coat
to this (but different in
colours) is born by the
Family of <hi>Colston</hi> of
<hi>Essex.</hi> This fish even
in his name bewrayeth
his shape, which gave
occasion thereof, by reason of the small and
tender films that grow about his mouth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
after a sort the form of a Beard,
whereupon he receiveth the Name of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules,

for his fourth Coat,
and are the Arms of the
Dominion of <hi>Phiert,</hi>
within the Territories
of the said Duke. Sometimes you shall find
fishes born fret-ways, that is to say, fretted or
interlaced one over another, as in this next
Example.</p>
               <p>

Argent, by the Name

the manner of their
fretting. The Heir of
this Family was in the
time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth married to <hi>Iohn
Talbot</hi> of <hi>Albrighton,</hi> from whom the <hi>Talbots</hi>
of <hi>Grafton</hi> now living, are lineally descended,

whom King <hi>Henry</hi> the

de Molina,</hi> in his Book

for the Coat-Armour of
<hi>Grilla.</hi> It is noted by
certain Naturalists, that
the Lobster is subtle in
acquiring his food, for he watcheth the Escal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
Oyster, and other like fishes that are fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by Nature with a stronger and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible
Coat than himself, to become a prey
unto him, by observing when they do open
their shell, either to receive food or air, and in
the mean time with his claws he taketh a stone,
and casteth it between the shels of the Oyster,
so as she can neither save her self, nor annoy
her foe; using his wit for a supply of his
strengths defect, according to the old Proverb,
<hi>Where the Lions skin is too scant, it must be
pieced out with a Fox case.</hi>
               </p>

He beareth Argent, a
Lobster's Claw in Bend
sinister, Saltire-like,

Those other
fishes, which are said to
be shelled, and are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
inclosed in strong
and thick walls, do dilate and open their shells
at certain seasons, either to receive the benefit
of the air, or of food; and again contract
them (at their pleasure) and so defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from all harm and violence. Of these,
the shells are of most frequent use in Arms, and

are diversly born, as well with Ordinaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

He beareth Argent,
a Cheveron engrailed,
Sable, between three
Sea-crabs, Gules, by the
Name of <hi>Bridger.</hi> It
is an observation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Fishermen, that
when the Moon is in her
decrement or wane (as
we commonly call it)
these sort of fishes have little or no substance at
all in them, which moveth them to forbear to
fish for them in that season, in regard that the
Moon is the natural and secondary cause, that
the Crabs of the Sea are either full and plum,
or else shear and (after a sort) empty.</p>
               <p>The claws of the forefeet of this sort of fish
are called <hi>forcipata brachia Cancrorum,</hi> of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps,</hi>
which signifieth a pair of Tongs or Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,

This Coat stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Abbey

to have been of long

Escallop (according to <hi>Dioscorides</hi>) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
of the Dew and Air, and hath no
blood at all in it self; notwithstanding in mans
body (of any other food) it turneth soonest

Here I think it
fit to note out of the
Number and position of
the Charge of this Coat-Armour
two things:
the one concerning the
number, which you see is six, which some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morists
hold to be the best of even and articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
numbers that can be born in one Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
their reason is, because none other even
number under ten can decrease in every rank
one to the base point of the Escocheon, and
produce an odd one in the same point. Next
touching this manner of the position of this
number; which suiteth most aptly with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a triangular Escocheon, as in the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Armories, pag.</hi> 181. is observed.</p>

Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Baron <hi>Russel</hi> of <hi>Tavestock</hi>
and <hi>Thornhaugh,</hi> Knight of the most Noble
Order of the Garter, &amp;c. Such is the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
shape that Nature hath bestowed upon this
shell, as that the Collar, of the Order of St.
<hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in the first Institution
thereof, was richly garnished with certain pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Gold artificially wrought, as near as the
Artificer could by imitation express the stamp
of Nature.</p>
               <p>Which Institution doubtless was grounded
upon great reason, to shew the stedfast amity
and constant fidelity, that ought to be between
brethren and companions of one society and
brotherhood: For take one of these fishes, and
divide the shells, and endeavour to sort them
with (I will not say hundreds) but millions
of other shells of fishes of the same kind, and
you shall never match them throughout:
therefore do they resemble the indissoluble
friendship that ought to be in Fraternities and
Societies, because there can be according to
<hi>Cicero, Offic. 1. Nulla firma Amicitia nisi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aequales.</hi> The consideration whereof (it
I be not deceived) moved the first Founders of
this Order to sort them in the collar of this
order by couples, for that all others do disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with them, <hi>Secundum magis vel minus,</hi>
and none do concurt together with them in all
points, but only those that nature hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and made agreeable to each other in
all points.</p>

doubtless find just cause
to glorifie God, and admire his Omnipotency

               <p>WE have long insisted in the bearings
of Animals or living Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
distinguishing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their kinds, sorting them into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ranks, placed them under sundry heads, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying
their manifold use and forms of
bearing in Coat-Armour, to the end that they
might give better life and warrant to such
Rules and Observations, as concerning them
are formerly given. The last place I have here
reserved to the most noble Creature and first
in estimation, I mean Man, whom God hath
indued with a reasonable Soul, and for whose
sake he crcated all other things, subjecting
them to his sovereignty, that they should serve
man, and man should serve God. <hi>Thou hast
given him</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>sovereignty over all
the works of thy hands, and hast put all things
in subjection under his feet;</hi> all sheep and oxen,
and all beasts of the field, the fowls of the air

in his own image, not only in giving him an
understanding soul, and an holy will, but also a
sovereign jurisdiction over these inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
even as Kings are the Image of God, in
a more peculiar manner, because God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them sovereignty over men. Neither is
the beauty of the body it self lightly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
whose admirable proportions and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made <hi>Galen</hi> (a heathen) to acknowledge
the infinite wisdome of an eternal Creator: And
that godly King to break out into terms of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
saying, <hi>Thine eyes did see my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

forcible motives to stir us up to the glorifying

the fruitfulness and riches of the earth,
the infinite variety of shapes, colours, qualities,
and operations of Animals and Vegetables; of
all which there is not the least, or whatsoever
we hold most contemptible, but will minister
unto us just cause to glorifie God's Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

God hath created man, and placed him in this
world, to the end he should be a diligent search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
viewer, and beholder of all his works; and
withal, that he should not be only a Spectator,
but also a serious and zealous Enarrator of his
infinite wisdome, power, and mercy, in that
he hath most powerfully created them, most
wisely disposed them, and most providently
conserveth them in their several ranks and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
places and offices.</p>
               <p>But when we speak of man, we must not
understand him to be that outward form or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of body, that is subjected to our visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sense; but the mind of each man is the man
indeed, not that part of him that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by pointing of the finger.</p>
               <p>The mind of man penetrateth and passeth
through all things in a moment, more swiftly
than the stars, more speedily than imagination,
yea with more celerity than time it self.</p>
               <p>So great is the estate and dignity of mans
condition and nature, as that there is no good
can suffice him, but the chiefest and only good
of all.</p>
               <p>The soul of man is of a Divine Nature, and
therefore immortal and eternal; he ascendeth
up by degrees evermore, and never ceaseth
until he attain divine and celestial things:
Which nature and property is not found in any
creature but in man only.</p>
               <p>God indeed hath created man of an upright
stature, with his countenance raised up towards
heaven; whereas he hath given all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
a groveling countenance, fixed upon the
earth: whereby he would notifie, that mans
soul is a celestial thing, and that his <hi>ultimum
bonum</hi> is in heaven; that heaven is his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
that there is his everlasting habitation,
if he love his God, and become pliant and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
unto his Divine will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> calleth man <hi>the miracle of God; for,</hi>
saith he, <hi>man is endued with the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the World.</hi> For what is the world, but
an universality of things compacted together
in the form of a Sphere? And what is man, but
a Compendium or Epitome of the universality
of things? Therefore was he not mis-named
by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when he called him <hi>a little world:</hi>
For he understandeth with the Angels, he hath
sense with living Creatures, he communicateth
of food, growth and generation with Plants;
and finally he hath being with all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and retaineth with the world the form
of a Sphere. For as <hi>Iulius Solinus</hi> saith, <hi>look
how much breadth a man hath when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
his hands to the full, so much is his
length from the crown to the heel:</hi> So as if you
draw a circle about him, you shall comprehend
him within the form of a compas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed Sphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> speaking of the particular works of
God in his Creation before he had created man,
saith, <hi>Ea visa fuisse Deo bona;</hi> but after he
had created man, and all things pertaining to
his sustentation and preservation, as also all
things behoveful for the propagation of all
mankind prepared, then did he take a general
view and survey of the whole fabrick of the
World, <hi>Et Deo visum fuisse valde bonum,</hi> they
were exceeding, that is, so perfect good in the
highest degree, as nothing could be wished to
be added thereto for the bettering thereof.</p>
               <p>As touching the food allotted to man, at the
first it is most certain, that the same was herbs
and fruits, as appeareth <hi>Gen. 1. 29. Ecce dedi
vobis omnem herbam, &amp;c. And God said, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I have given unto you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon all the earth; and every
tree, wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing
seed, that shall be to you for meat.</hi> That is to
say (saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) <hi>multam, amplissimam,
suavissimam &amp; utilissimam,</hi> in great plenty,
abundant, most delicate and most wholsome;
herewith shall ye be satisfied and contented
without seeking after other food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These three things (<hi>saith</hi> Zanchius) are
most certain; first, that before the flood both
herbs and fruits of trees were so wholsome and
good, as that man needed no other food; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof there was no need, that the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of flesh should be permitted unto him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is also undoubtedly true, that after
the flood the earth was so corrupted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
thereof, and consequently mans body
became so weakened, that he stood in need of
more solid and strong nourishing meats, as the
flesh of Oxen, Kine, Sheep, &amp;c. In regard
whereof God gave him permission to use them
for food. Thirdly, this also is without all
controversie, that God did not prohibit unto man
any sorts of meats, because <hi>all things are clean
to the clean:</hi> as also <hi>for that every Creature
of God is good, because they are sanctified by
his Word.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the mixture and composition of the four
Elements before mentioned, and of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of them, and of them engendred, two
principal parts of matters of our bodies have
their being, <hi>viz.</hi> our bones with their nerves
or sinews, wherewith they be conjoyned and
knit; and our flesh with the veins, whereby
the blood is conveyed throughout all parts of
the body, together with her arteries, whereby
the vital and animal spirits are carried into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part and member thereof.</p>
               <p>These two parts did <hi>Adam</hi> well express,
when speaking of <hi>Eve</hi> he said, <hi>Haec est os ex
ossibus meis, &amp; caro de carne mea.</hi> First he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of bone, as the more solid and
substantial part, and as it were the fundamental
part of the whole body; and after of the flesh,
as of the matter wherewith the bones are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55096:98"/>
To these two parts there is annexed a skin,
wherewith the whole frame of the body (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united and knit together) is covered, and
wherein it is comprehended and contained.
And this skin is not scaly, such as is proper to
fishes; neither feathered after the manner of
fowls; neither hairy and rugged, as many sorts
of beasts are; neither thick skinned, as many
bruit Animals have; but a soft tender skin, and
of a delicate touch, and such as may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem
such a mind, as the mind of man is: for
where there is store of wit, there needeth not
a hard skin, but a soft tender skin fitteth best
a generous and ingenious mind. For so was
it the pleasure of the most wise God, to adde
unto the noblest mind the noblest flesh, and the
tenderest and most dainty skin, that so the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
shape might be an evident testimony of
the inward mind. That this Creature, Man,
is also born in Coat-Armour both limb-meal (as
I may term it) and also entire, with all his
parts conjunct, I will shew by Examples: and
we will first here set down the whole bearings,
and afterward proceed to the parts.</p>

Since it hath pleased
some (doubless out of a

far from their opinion who damn it for Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition

Babe; but yet I hold it undoubted Idolatry to
offer to these, or any other Pictures, those
Services of Worship and Prayer which God
hath made his own peculiar Prerogative, not
to be communicated to that holy Virgin her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
much less to her Image; which yet are so
far oftentimes from being her Image, that it
hath been acknowledged, that some lewd Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have pourtraited that unspotted Lady to
the likeness of their own Courtizans, and so
have proposed her in Churches to be adored.
This worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hath almost
worn out the worship of her Son, especially
where their ridiculous feigned Miracles daily
broached do find any credit.</p>

it fit, that man (the most excellent of God's

degrees and callings, so is it decent (saith
<hi>Bartolus</hi>) that each particular person should
be habited as is fitting for his estate, calling, and
imployment; viz. <hi>Principes in solio Majestatis,

Examples of the whole

the head should first be handled before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:55096:98"/>
parts; for that amongst all the parts of
living Creatures, the head obtaineth the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
preheminence, saith <hi>Pierius:</hi> and (as <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
noteth) it is called <hi>Caput,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is capable of the knowledge attained
by the Senses; but for that also it comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and containeth them all. As this Member
is chiefest in dignity, so hath Nature appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
thereto the highest and principal place, it
being lifted up on high, as in a Watch Towre,
that it might oversee all approaching danger
before it come near; for which cause also Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath given man more flexibility to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his neck and look on all sides, than other
Creatures have.</p>
               <p>In the workmanship of this principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of mans body may we behold with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the unspeakable power, providence, and
mercy of God, if we shall attentively consider
the order and composition of the head, with
the external and internal parts thereof.</p>
               <p>First of all the skull, called in Latin <hi>Cranium,</hi>
is the uppermost bone of the head, fashioned
in the form of a Globe, and distinguished with
their orders of small holes and seams. An
Example of hearing in Coat-Armour of three
of these skuls on a Cheveron I have formerly
given you, <hi>pag.</hi> 114. where I treated of bones.
The skull is outwardly covered with skin and
thin flesh, lest the same should be overburthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with too much weight. This flesh with that
skin is therefore made full of pores, or small
invisible holes, for the more commdious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of the gross humours of the brain,
and certain excrements thereof; whereof
hairs are engendred and may have their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
The skull is inwardly hollow, to the end
that the brain, which is the seat of all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
might be the more commodiously confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therein.</p>
               <p>The skull hath God distributed into three
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>Sinciput,</hi> which is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thereof, and conjoyneth to the forehead;
into <hi>Occiput,</hi> which is the hindmost part
thereof; and into <hi>Verticem,</hi> which is the
Crown or middle part of the same, seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the fore and hinder part aforenamed.</p>
               <p>Under these three partitions are placed three
several faculties: In the forepart is the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,
or <hi>Sensus Communis, scil.</hi> the Judgment
of the Senses, or universal notion of things;
in the middle the Imagination; and Memory
in the hinder part of the head.</p>
               <p>Within the concavity of the skull the brain
hath his being, distinguished with 3 little Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
or Cells, one in the forepart, another in
the midst, and the last in the hinder part: In
which three Ventricles, the forms and ideas of
things, apprehended by the exterior senses, are
severally and distinctly imprinted. Therefore to
the end the same might be more effectually
performed, God made not the brain fluent, like
water, for then would it not apprehend or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
those conceited forms; nor yet of solid
substance, like bones, for then could it not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
admit the impressions of such imaginary
forms: but he made the brain of an indifferent
temper, <hi>viz.</hi> moderately soft, and moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hard, to wit, of a soft and temperate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, God hath made in the brains
of man certain concavities or hollownesses, and
those hath he replenished with vital spirits,
without which the interiour senses could not
consist: and these spirits doth the soul use to
understand by, and to the performance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
actions which she produceth in the head.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the brain hath he placed the
fountain of the sinews, which from thence are
dispersedly conveyed throughout the body; as
well those nerves and sinews as are sensitive, as
also those that are motive, <hi>viz.</hi> those that give
motion to the body. But who can express or
conceive in mind the manifold instruments of
the soul, that God hath placed in the head of
man?</p>
               <p>In the head we may observe (well-nigh)
all the uses of the soul. Behold the admirable
composition of mans head, which of all other
parts of the body is the noblest; and how all
and singular the parts thereof are accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and applied by our most gracious Maker,
Conserver, and Redeemer, to serve for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all the faculties of the soul!</p>
               <p>If the framing of this one member (I mean
the head of a man) be so admirable in it self;
how much more is the composition of the
whole frame of the body, being conjoyned and
united together with sinews and arteries, in a
proportionable manner, and furnished through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
with all the external and internal parts,
and their particular appurtenances to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
               <p>The members of Animals are (of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)
usually distinguished into external and
internal, and so be handled severally each one
apart by it self: but I labouring to be brief
herein, will handle those outward and inward
parts only, whose shapes and forms I find to be
born in Coat-Armour, leaving the more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and exact handling of them to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Physicians, Chirurgions, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists
professed, to whose consideration they
do more properly appertain.</p>
               <p>The head in Latin is called <hi>Caput,</hi> because
it is the chief and principal beginning of the
whole fabrick of the body, and withal the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
of all other the members thereof.</p>
               <p>In the head do the two principal faculties of
the sould rest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intelligent and Sentient,
and do there execute their functions, albeit that
the vegetable faculty also hath his operation
there, but the other two do reign and chiefly
predominate therein: therefore it is the seat
and residence of all the senses, as well internal
as external, placed in the head, and that for
good cause; for since that the faculty Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
understandeth not in any other sort than
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55096:99"/>
by inspection of imagination and imaginary
shapes, which are engendred of external forms,
and are by the outward senses conveyed to the
phantasie or image conceived in the mind. Most
wisely therefore hath God there placed the seat
and wisdome of all the senses, where the mind
hath her being, that so she need not go farr to
seek those imaginary forms whereof she is to
consider, to understand and dispose of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to order.</p>
               <p>Therefore inasmuch as the senses are become
serviceable to the mind, there the seat or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the senses is most fitly placed, where
the mind doth exercise her offices and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>From the same head do proceed all the
nerves and sinews wherewith each bone and
member, as also the universal body is conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fastened together, and consolidated,
and also receiveth increase, and being. In the
head is placed the principal part of manly form,
the Visage, whereby the differeth from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals, and doth far surpass them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and comliness; whereof the Poet rightly
wrote in these words,

                        <l>He with a lofty look did man endue,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
Forasmuch as God would that the faculties,
both intelligent and sentient, should predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the head; therefore did he form and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
therein instruments well fitting for
either use: Of these instruments there are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two sorts, whereof the first containeth the
instruments of the inferiour senses, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the outward.</p>
               <p>The instruments serving for the use of the
external senses (whereof there is use in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
are not many; therefore will I handle
them as I shall find use of them in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
the rest I will only name, and so pass
them over as impertinent to my purpose. These
instruments of the external senses are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
five, that is to say, the eyes, nostrils, ears,
mouth, with the roof and palate thereof, and
the tongue. Of these I find only the eyes born
in Coat-Armour, therefore of them only will

was a sign of servile bondage: <hi>For the Romans

change according to time, so it is the part of a

He beareth barry Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bule
of six pieces, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure
and Argent, on a
Chief of the second 3
eyes, Gules, by the
Name of <hi>de la Hay</hi> of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> The eyes hath
God formed with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
skill in such sort,
as that by them the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
spirits are transferred to the soul. For by
them, as it were by Windows, the soul doth
apprehend the forms and kinds of things co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
by way of attraction; therefore to the
end the same might be the more commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed, first of all, he made them slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and round, that they might more easily
move and stir every way, and so apprehend the
colours of all sorts of things which are either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
below, on the right hand, or upon the
left, as it were in a moment. He would that the
eyes should consist of three distinct humors, to
wit, of a watery or whitish humour, of a
glassie and a christaline humor; and those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
each from other with most thin films or
skins, to the end that they should be capable
of the <hi>species</hi> or kinds of colours. In the midst
of these there is a little ball (as it were) which
we call the ball, or apple of the eye, as it were
a certain hole, through which the sight hath
its passage; by which, as through a little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
or casement, the visible spirits of the soul
are sent forth to their objects, and also the
<hi>species</hi> or kinds of colours are received inward,
and conveyed to that we call <hi>sensus communis</hi>
or the phantasie (which is seated in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
of the brain) by means of sinews that do
bring sight to the eyes.</p>
               <p>God hath annexed those two nerves or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
as the Wagons of the shapes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
received into the eyes, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the phantasie: which sinews, albeit
there are two of them annexed to each eye,
nevertheless, when they are protracted to the
brain, they do joyn together and end in one
point, for this end and purpose, that the shapes
that were twofold in the two eyes, they should
yet end in one, forasmuch as the conceived
shapes are simply of one colour, and that so
the Judge of the <hi>Sensus communis;</hi> or the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
should not be deceived.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he hath covered the eyes with
lids, as it were with folding doors, both for
a defence against harmful objects, and more
specially for sleep, that these being shut, man
might take his rest and sleep.</p>
               <p>These are the means and instruments of
sight, that is to say, of the eyes, whereof
who can attain the knowledge of the exact
workmanship of them?</p>
               <p>The rest of the beforementioned external
instruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nose, Ears, Mouth, with
the Roof and Palate thereof, and the Tongue,
I do pass them over, as not being of any, or
(at the least) frequent use in Armory, but as
they are parts of the head, and therewith uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and conjoyned. After the head and parts
thereof, the heart doth challenge the chiefest
place, as in Example.</p>

not round; to signifie
that our thoughts and
consultations ought to be
long, deliberate, and not
hasty and inconsiderate.</hi>
This is the Fountain, Seat, and Treasury of
Life, wherethrough the whole body receiveth
the vital spirits; which are (as it were) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
quickning flames, which by the ministery
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:55096:100"/>
of the arteries and veins, are dispersed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all parts of the body, giving thereto life

of every action.</p>

by the Name of
<hi>Tote.</hi> These are termed
vulned of the Latin word
<hi>vulnus,</hi> which signifieth
a wound. This noble
Member hath Nature
placed in a seat well fitting the dignity thereof,
insomuch as it may well be said (according to
<hi>Aristotle) Natura constituit rem nobiliorem
in nobiliori loco, ut cor in medio;</hi> To the best
part the best place. This is that which of all
other parts God requireth us to reserve for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to his service, where he saith, <hi>My son,
give me thy heart;</hi> and good reason, since he
was pleased to give us his Sons heart, to be
pierced to the death for our demerits. And this
place may decide their doubt, who make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
whether be the more principal part of a
man, the brain or the heart, since God prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the heart, as more esteeming the hearty
affection of true Charity, than a speculative
contemplation void of Christian practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules,
a heart between two

used to hang the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure

and is far unlike those that the Psalmist
mentioneth, saying, <hi>They give good words
with their lips, but dissemble with their

whose tongue and heart go two diverse ways.
Therefore well is that saying verified of these

The arm is a member
of the body ordained by
Nature for labour: and
for that purpose she hath
fortified the same strongly with arteries, mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and sinews. By the arm therefore is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
a laborious and industrious man; but that

the Family of <hi>Tremaine</hi>
of <hi>Colacombe</hi> in <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
These arms and
hands conjoyned and
clenched after this manner may signifie a treble
offer of revenge for some notable injury done

He beareth Or, on
a Chief, Gules, a hand
extended and born trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
the Chief, Argent,
by the Name of <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
The hand is the
pledge of friendship and
fidelity, which was in
ancient times confirmed
by shaking of hands;
but later times have taken up another fashion,
by embracing with the Arms. But the truth
is, a handful of that ancient amity is more
worth than a whole armful of the new, which
now every where consists in words, not in
deeds. The hand is the chief working instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body, and of no less comliness
than use; <hi>Quam multarum artium ministrae
sunt,</hi> saith <hi>Zanchius;</hi> of how many Arts is
the hand the worker? and it is called <hi>manus</hi>
(according to some) <hi>à manando, vel quia ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
è brachio manat, vel quia ex ea manant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giti,</hi>
either for that it proceedeth out of the
arm, or for that the fingers proceed out of it.
This member is divided into five parts, whereof
each one hath a name appropriate to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
use thereof; as the Thumb is called
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:55096:100"/>
                  <hi>Pollex, quod virtute prae caeteris polleat,</hi> for
the strength of it. The forefinger is named
<hi>Index, Quia homo illo digito omnia indicat,</hi>
for pointing with it. The next is called of the
place, <hi>Medius,</hi> the middle finger. The fourth
<hi>Anularis,</hi> or Ring-finger. The fifth <hi>Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularis,</hi>
because men use to pick their Ear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>

The Field is Pearl, a

Honourable <hi>William</hi>
Lord <hi>Maynard</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> and of
<hi>Wicklogh</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the actions and gestures of the body, of
all the members thereof the hand is (as I may
say) the most talkative: For it is a usual thing
with the most sort of men, by the motion of
the right hand to crave silence; when we make
any speech or protestation of our selves, we
do clap our hands upon our breasts; when we
are moved with admiration, we strike our hand
upon our thigh; with the hand we do becken
and allure unto us, and therewith we do repell
and put from us; when we speak to other men,
we do extend our hands toward them. The
apposition of the finger to the mouth, is a note
of silence craved; the striking of the breast
with the fist, is a token of sorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the exalting and shaking of the right
hand aloft, is usual with military persons
when they will notifie any prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
               <p>The hand, as it is comly in sight, so is it also
of singular use, and an Instrument of many
Arts: for by their help there is no invention of
mans wit left unattempted and brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and therefore it is of all other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of mans body, the nimblest and most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal:
yet is the same no longer reckoned a
part of man, than it can perform her function,
as witnesseth <hi>Aristole Metaph. Manus non sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
est pars hominis, nisi quando potest perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
opus suum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The clapping of hands is a token of joy and
applause, and hath been in use not only with
men of modern times, when they would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their consent and approbation; but also with
those of ancient time, as we may see when
<hi>Iehojada</hi> the Priest caused <hi>Ioash</hi> the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah</hi>
to be crowned King; <hi>Then he brought
out the King's Son, and put the Crown upon
him, and gave him the Testimony, and they
made him King, and anointed him, and they
clapt their hands, and said, God save the
King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anciently the cutting off hands and feet
was used for a military punishment, for such
as had committed some capital crime meriting
death. So we read that <hi>Aufidius Cassius,</hi> by
a new and unexperimented Example, did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
divers fugitive Souldiers that had abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Captain, by cutting off their hands
and feet, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>irming that such punishment was
more exemplary and disciplinable than the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them to death, by how much a long
and lingering reproachful life is worse than
death it self, that giveth a speedy end to all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
and wretched calamities.</p>
               <p>It hath been an ancient custome, that when
a Master requireth his servant to perform for
him any matter of importance (and would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him by taking of a solemn Oath to use his
best care and diligence for the effectual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
thereof) to cause his servant to put his
hand under his thigh, and to take his Oath, as
we may see <hi>Gen. 24. 2, 3. Put now thy hand
under my thigh, and I will make thee swear
by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God
of Earth, that thou shalt not take a wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Son of the Daughters of the Canaanites
amongst whom I dwell.</hi> This Ceremony shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Servants Obedience to his Master, and
the Masters power over the Servant.</p>

This was the

The kissing of the hand
so much in use with us
at this day, may be thought to be an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the latter hatchers; but if we look back
into the customs of ancient times, we shall find
that it was in use many Ages past, and is by the
revolution of time become new again: <hi>For
what is new</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) that hath been
informer times.</hi> Of this custome of kissing
the hand we read as followeth, <hi>Many when
a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found,
and put them to trouble that helped them. Till
he hath received he will kiss a mans hand.</hi>
And concerning the Antiquity of this action of
kissing the hand, you may further read learned

He beareth barry of
six pieces, Or and Sable,
over all a Pale, Gules,

Name of <hi>Dodge.</hi> And
here, because I find in
the Office of Arms a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of the first Grant of
this Coat-Armour, and that very ancient, I
think it convenient to acquaint the Reader
with some particulars of the said Patent, as I
there find it; whereby appeareth that <hi>Iames
Hedingley,</hi> then Guyen King of Arms, after
recital made of the loyal and valiant service
which <hi>Peter Dodge,</hi> born in the Town of <hi>Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
in the County of <hi>Chester,</hi> Gentleman,
had done to King <hi>Edward</hi> the first (for as it
there appeareth by the Copy, this Instrument
beareth date the eighth of <hi>April</hi> in the <hi>34th.</hi>
year of that Kings Reign) in divers battels and
sieges, for which the said King had remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him the said <hi>Peter</hi> with the Gift of a Seignory or Lordship there mentioned: He (I
say) the said King of Arms, after such recital
made, doth give and grant unto the said <hi>Peter Dodge,</hi>
that from thenceforth, Il (understand
the said <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>portera son escu d'Or &amp; Sables,
barre de six pieces &amp; ung Pale de Gules, avec
une mamelle de femme degoullant;</hi> for so are
the very words and their Orthography, in the
Copy of the Patent, which is in French. Thus
much whereof I thought fit to present to the
publick view, not doubting but the Judicious
Reader, by careful observation thereof, may
make some good use. The Function of this
Member is thus taught us, 2 <hi>Esdr. 8. For thou
hast commanded the members, even the Breasts
to give milk unto the fruit appointed for the
breasts, that the thing which is created might
be nourished for a time, till thou disposest it to
thy mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earths Fountains are made to give wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Breasts of women are made to give
suck: But Gentlewomen and Citizens wives
are said to be troubled with a perpetual
drought in their Breasts, like the Gout that
haunteth the rich and wealthy only. By the
Teats sometimes are meant the plentiful Fields
wherewith men are nourished; as we may read
<hi>Isai. 32. 12. Men shall lament for the teats,
even the pleasant fields, and for the fruitful
vines.</hi> Like as wholsome and plentiful feeding
nourisheth and encreaseth milk: so contrariwise
thin diet, sorrow, and grief of mind or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
drieth up, and much wasteth the same.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> shewing the untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those that should learn the Word of
God, saith, <hi>Whom shall he teach knowledge?
and whom shall he make to understand the
things that he feareth? Them that are wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the milk, and drawn from the breasts,
Isa.</hi> 28. 9. Whereby he sharply reprehendeth
their backwardness in Religion, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them to Babes newly weaned from the
Breasts.</p>

It was a custome of the
ancient World, that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
or Children should put their hand under
the thigh of him to whom they should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged

take it) they used, as well to shew the ready o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience

that whereby we humble our selves before
God in kneeling and praying, as if Nature had
especially framed our Bodies, as well as our
Souls, for that service to him that made us. And

as are ingendred of two distinct kinds of Beasts
against the prescript of Nature's Order. Of
which prodigious kinds of Beasts, as some have
been procreated by means of mans idle inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and others by casual accident: so are
there sundry sorts of Beasts no less unnaturally
ingendred, through careless neglect of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
each sort of Cattel by themselves, and
by permitting the Beasts of distinct kinds to
sort and feed together confusedly in the time of
their heat. Such are those that <hi>Vpton</hi> calleth

               <p>These bigenerous Beasts (saith <hi>Vpton</hi>) may

have not the actual exercise thereof; as the

The shape of the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard

birth, forasmuch
as he in all proportion of
body is more like the
<hi>Pardus,</hi> aswel in respect
of the slenderness of his
body, as of his spots, and wanteth the courage
notified by the plentiful Mane, wherewith Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath invested the Lion, being the express
token of his generous and noble spirit. This
mis-begotten Beast is naturally an Enemy to
the Lion, and finding his own defect of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to encounter the Lion in fair fight, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
when the Lion makes his walk near to
his Den, which (in policy) he hath purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought spacious and wide in the double en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
thereof, and narrow in the midst, so as
himself being much more slender than the Lion,
may easily pass: when he seeth the Lion, he
maketh towards him hastily, as if he would bid
him battel in the open fields; and when he seeth
the Lion prepared to encounter him, he beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him to his heels, and maketh towards his
Den with all celerity, whom the Lion eagerly
pursueth with full course, dreaming of no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by reason of the large entrance into the
Den. At length, through the vehemency of
his swift course, he becometh so straitned in
the narrow passage in the midst of the Den (by
reason he is much bigger bodied than the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard)
that he can go neither forwards nor
backwards. The Lion being thus distressed,
his Enemy passeth thorow his Den, and cometh
behind him, and gnaweth him to death. Of
this Beast, the head is more usually born in
Coat-Armour than the whole, and that in a
diverse manner, as by these Examples next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

The Field is Gules, a
Boar, Argent, armed,
grisled, collared, and
chained, Or, tied to an
Holly-bush on a Mount
in base, both proper. This
was the Paternal Coat-Armour
of <hi>George Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
Esq. deceased, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
lover and an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Collector of Antiquities, as Learned
Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> writeth in the description of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brokeshire.</hi>
He was owner of the Barony of
<hi>Keimes</hi> in the said County, which, as the same
Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> there noteth, consisteth of twenty
Knights fees, and twenty six Parishes over and
above the three Boroughs of <hi>Newport, Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,</hi>
and St. <hi>Dogmaels.</hi> By this Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s
industry the printed Mapp of the said County
was, as you may see in the said Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>'s
description, composed.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Sable, a
Horse passant, Argent,
spanceled on both Leggs
of the nearer side, Gules,
by the Name of <hi>Perci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall.</hi>
Albeit this Horse
be now spanceled as you
see, yet must you not
account him to be of so
base and dejected na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that he hath been forced to this subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but rather won thereunto by tractable
usage: for such is the quality of noble Spirits,
as that they are rather brought to conformity
by gentleness than by severity, according to the
memorable saying of <hi>Seneca, Generosus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
facilius ducitur quam trahitur.</hi> For it is
with irrational Animals as with the rational,
who are rather drawn by the Ears than by the
Cloak, that is, they are sooner won by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
than forced by compulsatory means:
which being taken in this sense, the imposition
of this artificial note of restraint, doth no way
derogate from the worth of the Bearer.</p>
               <p>In the closing up of this third Section of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Animals, I will note unto you some
few Examples (not unworthy your observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
of some other sorts of bearing than have
been hitherto spoken of; for that I would not
willingly omit any thing worthy of note, that
may serve for your better information: For I
had rather you were ill furnished at my hands,
than that I should leave you altogether disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
The things that I purpose to note un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you in this place, are briefly these, to wit,
That there are some Coat-Armours, whose
Fields (besides their grand Charge) do admit
some petite Charge to be annexed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Charge. Others there are, wherein the
Field being freed of such petty Charges, the
same are imposed upon the Charge it self. Hence
it is, that we have so many Lions and other
living things born Gutte, Billette, Escalloppe,
Pellette, &amp;c. as by this that ensueth in part
may be seen.</p>

               <p>AS all Natural things (of which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have intreated) were
made by the powerful hand of the
Almighty and All-wise God for
the use of Mankind: so did God
also endue Man with an admirable power infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into him, with a reasonable Soul, whereby
every man might invent ways and means to
help himself, and one man to help another by
the benefit of Arts, for the better use of those
things which God and Nature hath provided.
In which respects Art is reputed <hi>Naturae Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
Natures Ape, for imitating those things
which Nature herself hath framed, as we see
in Painting, Poetry, and the like. But we may
go further (since Art goeth further) and add,
That Art is also <hi>Natura Obstetrix, Medica,
Leno:</hi> Natures Midwife, in helping her for the
safer and better producing of her fruits, as is
Husbandry, &amp;c. Natures Physician, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Natures works, as Architecture, Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Physick it self: Lastly, Art is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Pandor, in setting her out to the most
tempting and pleasing fashion, by inventing
those things that tend either to the adorning
or delight, so to please the senses and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
with those things, which in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without Art, would not be so contentful.
And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> yieldeth this reason of
the invention of Arts, <hi>Quia Natura multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
est ancilla &amp; multis angustiis oppressa, idea
inventa est Ars, ut suppleat defectum Naturae,</hi>
Nature is much kept under and oppressed like
an Handmaid, and therefore Arts were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to supply those defects of Nature.</p>
               <p>In this place therefore we intend from the
works of Nature to come to the works of Art,
so far forth as they are used in Coat-Armour.
And here we must be born with, if we use the
word of Art in his largest signification, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all Sciences and Knowledge, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
or Operative and Pratick whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for so one hath defined it, <hi>Art is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of doing or teaching any thing by certain
Rules</hi> [or prescript forms:] And therefore
some have thought Arts to be <hi>ab Arctando,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55096:108"/>
Quia arctis brevibusque praeceptis concluditur,</hi>
because it is comprised in brief and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Precepts: whereas those who so call it,
<hi>quia per Artus operatur,</hi> for the works of the
limbs or joynts, they comprehend only Arts
Mechanical by that name. Some more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
derive it from the Greek word <hi>Arete,</hi> which
signifieth Vertue; because the perfect Skill or
Art of doing any thing is properly the vertue
of that Action. In handling these Artificials,
I will follow our prescribed Order, and begin
with the Ensigns of the Actions of Estate Civil,
and first with the Highest and Sovereign, as in
Example.</p>

The Field is Jupiter,
a Crown Mitral Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
Sol, garnished and
enriched with sundry
precious Gems, proper.
These Arms do pertain
to the City of <hi>Toledo</hi> in
<hi>Spain.</hi> This sort of
Crown was devised to
represent a twofold dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
united into one,
<hi>viz.</hi> Sacrifical and Imperial (in which respect
I have given it this new coyned form of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon:)
For in ancient times Emperours and
Kings were also Priests, <hi>Tanta est Sacerdotalis
dignitas, &amp;c.</hi> (saith <hi>Chassa.</hi>) So great is the
Priestly Dignity, that in the glorious times of
the Romans no man might be Emperour or
King, but he was to be also a Priest; and
thence are they instiled in their Coyns <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores,
&amp; Pontifices Maximi;</hi> whence we may
see, that the original was meerly heathenish of
the Popes Usurpation of that Title <hi>Pontifex
Maximus;</hi> surely he could find in his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to style himself <hi>Imperator Maximus,</hi> for
that high command he challengeth over all
Emperours and Kings. And though this be
now the Ensign of the Empire, yet it is rather
in possession of the usurping Papacy.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Mars, a
Crown Imperial, Sol.
This is called an Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Crown, in regard of
the Imperial Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Prerogatives,
that an absolute King
(to whom such a Crown
is due) hath within his
Kingdom. The high
rising of the Diadem
doth signifie the greatness and perfection of
of such a King, from whom there is no appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
forasmuch as he acknowledgeth no
earthly Superiour in any thing pertaining to
his Royal Jurisdiction; neither oweth he duty,
but only to the King of all Kings, of whom he
holdeth by an immediate right.</p>
               <p>The Kings Crown is arched, to shew its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
to the Imperial Heaven; its adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with precious stones, as it were with stars,
to represent its splendor; and its being lined
with furrs doth declare its honour.</p>
               <p>The cause that moved the Egyptians to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
a Crown amongst their Sacred or Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical
Letters, may not impertinently be
expressed in this place, where we are to handle
their divers forms according to the several Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Estates, to whom they do appertain:
For as Gamesters make but cold sport, when
there is no money at stake; so knowledge doth
oftentimes faint, if it be not seasoned with the
Salt of Reason. In this Hieroglyphick we may
observe the four causes of the Law: The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause is understood by the Head of the
King that is adorned with this Crown. The
final cause is conceived by the Flowers, or by
the profitable use of fruit; which how great
the same (in likelyhood) will be, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
by the Flowers. The material cause
may be gathered by the context or interlaced
form and workmanship of the Crown, which
carrieth a resemblance of the People or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Finally, by the Orbicular form of the
Crown is understood Justice; and amongst Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
the Spherical form is reckoned
the perfectest and most noble, <hi>Farnes.</hi> 3. 65.</p>
               <p>The Prince is to the People the Author of all
goodness; inasmuch as from him, as from a
plentiful Fountain, doth flow a sweet current
of plentiful streams of honour, profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
In regard whereof he is reputed to be
the Common Parent of all his Subjects, in that
he affordeth unto them whatsoever a Natural
Parent oweth to his Children. The platting
of these Flowers in the Crown doth represent
the end of the Law, which end hath its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
period in utility, <hi>Farnes.</hi> 4. 66. For
that Tree which beareth no blossoms, for the
most part produceth no fruit at all, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crowns in times past have been of great
value, and sumptuously enriched with precious
stones, as we may read</hi> 1. Chro. 20. 2. And
<hi>David</hi> took the Crown of their King from off
his head, and found it to weigh a Talent of
Gold, and there were precious stones in it. And
it was set on <hi>David's</hi> head.</p>
               <p>In these latter Ages the Emperour elected
(before his Coronation) doth write himself
<hi>King of the Romans,</hi> as a title of less esteem
and dignity than is the Title of Emperour.
But in ancient times the Romans had three
degrees of Supream Dignity; that is to say,
a King, a Dictator, an Emperour; and of these
the Dignity of a King was the chiefest; and
next thereto the Dignity of a Dictator was
holden the worthiest; and after the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Estate of an Emperour held the third
place, as inferiour to both the other. Hereof
we have a manifest proof, in that the Senate
and People of <hi>Rome</hi> minding to give unto <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
the Emperour (being a man well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55096:108"/>
of them) some advancement or increase
of honour and dignity, they purposed to make
him Dictator, which he (reverently bowing
his knee) refused, for that he reputed the same
a Dignity more ambitious, and of greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
and withal more subjected to spite and
envy, esteeming the Title of Emperour to
be popular, and of small account, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the eminency of a Dictatorship. We
may easily perceive by this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
(that time he was Dictator) did affect to aspire
to the Dignity of a King, for which cause he
was slain: forasmuch as the Citizens could not
endure that he should exercise Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over them; but well could they suffer him to
use the power of a Dictator as a Jurisdiction of
less esteem <hi>Leonard. Aretini Epistolar. Lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>There can be but one King at one time in a
Realm, whose Power must be absolute, for the
better managing of the Estate and Affairs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for if there be more, they will cross and
hinder each other in his Government, and
so destroy the nature of a King, in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them can sway the whole weale
publick, but each of them should admit a
participation in government. This do both
ancient and modern times manifest unto
us by Examples: For neither <hi>Numa,</hi> nor
<hi>Hostilius,</hi> nor <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> nor any other
of succeeding Kings of the Romans, could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any Fellow or Copartner in Government.
The like also may we observe in Kings of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
times: for neither doth <hi>England</hi> nor
<hi>France</hi> admit more than one King at once to
sway the Sovereign State, but one alone hath
the sole Government: So that it is a thing
meerly repugnant to the Nature of Royal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
that two Persons at one time should
exercise Kingly Authority.</p>

Sol. This is the second
Ensign that is born by

is of divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

<hi>Cham,</hi> the cursed Son of <hi>Noah.</hi> The Eye betok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth

               <p>A Scepter (with many Nations) is holden
for an especial Ensign of Royal Jurisdiction and
Authority, and the extending thereof a special
note of the placability and royal favour of the
King; as we may see <hi>Hester 15. 14. And he
held up his golden Scepter, and laid it upon
her Neck.</hi> That the Scepter betokeneth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
and Authority, it is manifest by that
which is written, <hi>Baruch 6. 13. One holdeth
a Scepter, as if he were a Iudge of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
yet can he not slay such as offend him:</hi>
which is here spoken of the vanity of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols

is one of the Ensigns that representeth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Majesty and Jurisdiction of a King.
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:55096:109"/>
By the roundness of the Mound and insigning
thereof with the Cross, is signified, that the
Religion and Faith of Christ ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and religiously embraced throughout
his Dominions, which high duty is residing
in his own Sovereign Power, and not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

like Cap did Pope <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the second send with
a Sword to King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth. And after
him Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth
gave him the Title, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Faith,</hi> for
that he had then lately
before written a Book against <hi>Martin Luther.</hi>
The Bull by which this Title was given, is now
printed by that worthy and famous Antiquary
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Titles of Honour, p.</hi> 54, 55.
of his last Edition. But howsoever the Cap
may seem then and thereof to be first called a
Cap of Maintenance, yet certain it is, that the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> did long before that time
declare and profess themselves Defender of
the Faith, as by divers of their Charters yet
extant may easily appear; and for an instance
thereof, you may read in the Book of the <hi>Acts
and Monuments,</hi> that King <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in his Commission (which went forth in
the sixth year of his reign) used these words,
<hi>Noszelo fidei Catholicae cujus sumus &amp; esse vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus

Sol, garnished with
Strings fastened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
fretways depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,

the same. These Arms
do pertain to the Town
of <hi>Brecknock.</hi> The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
is a Robe of Estate
peculiar to Emperours, Monarchs, Kings and
Free Estates, and thereof perhaps received
his Name, as I here understand the same in the
strict construction thereof; but taken in the
largest signification it may represent as well
those kinds of Mantles, that (together with
some Dignity or Jurisdiction) Emperours and
Kings do communicate unto such as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to some Principality, Dukedom, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Honorary Ensigns, that serve
for a declaration of the Royal Majesty or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an Emperour and King, and are worn
by the persons themselves that do exercise So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Jurisdiction over their Subjects within
their Dominions. To which Ensigns I hold it
not impertinent to add these few Attires or
Ornaments following, <hi>viz.</hi> Garters and Tassels,

King of Arms of <hi>Ireland,</hi> bore this Coat-Armour

Richmond,</hi> Herald, who lived in the time
of King Henry the Eighth, bore the same Coat-Armour
also, with a difference of a Mullet for
a third Brother. Though this Garter be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiated,
or severed into two halves, yet doth
the most permanent part thereof remain, which
is that buckled and nowed part of the same,
which detaineth and restraineth the Garter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entire, or howsoever dimidiated from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
inasmuch as the buckle and interlacing
thereof, and of the pendant, are the chief
stay and fastening thereof, whether the same
be whole dimidiated or howsoever.</p>

Tassels, Or, by the name
of <hi>Wooler,</hi> The Mantle
of Estate, which even
now I shewed you was
garnished (as you, may
remember) with strings
tasseled, which kind
of tasseling is an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to divers other
strings or cordons, as
those used about the habit of the Prince of

Estate or Dignity Temporal; let

                  <figure/>
The Field is Gules, a
Papal Infula, insigned
with a treble Crown and
a Cross Patee, Or, two
Labels pendant, Argent.
This kind of Infula or
Miter is worn by the
Antichristian Prelate of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to signifie the
three-fold Jurisdiction
that he doth arrogate to
himself as Christ's Vicar-General in Heaven, in
Earth, and in his supposed Purgatory. <hi>Guido</hi>
Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who was elected
Knight of the most Honourable Order of the
Garter, <hi>Anno 23. Hen.</hi> 7. did bear this Coat
quartered next to his own. As touching the
installation of this Duke, Sir <hi>Gilbert Talbot</hi>
Kt. Sir <hi>Richard Bere</hi> Abbat of <hi>Glastenbury,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Robert Sherbourne</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi>
being sent Ambassadours to <hi>Rome</hi> unto Pope
<hi>Iulius,</hi>
did bear the Collar and Habit of this
Order unto the Duke; who receiving the same,
sent <hi>Balthasar Castalio</hi> Kt. (a <hi>Mantuan</hi> born)
to the King, which <hi>Balthazar</hi> was installed in
his room according to the usual Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Argent, a
Cardinals Hat, with
strings pendant &amp; plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in True-love, the
ends meeting in Base,
Gules. These are the
Arms of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> a
Region in the Sea <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaticum,</hi>
and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Windesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi>
Pope <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
the fourth ordained that Cardinals should
wear red Hats, whereby he would signifie,
that those that entred into that Order ought to
be prepared to expose themselves even to the
shedding of their blood, and hazard of their
lives (if need so required) in the defence of
the Ecclesiastical Liberty. And this Institution
was made (according to <hi>Chassan.</hi>) at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
holden at <hi>Lyons,</hi> 1273. But they have ever
since so far digressed from it, as that they have
more justly deserved that Censure of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <l>Wherein their thirsty vestures they have dy'd;</l>
                     <l>Or else 'tis blushing which their weeds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paints,</l>

The Field is Jupiter,
a Staff in Pale, Sol, and
thereupon a Cross Patee,
Luna, surmounted of a
Pall of the last, charged
by four other like Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
fitched, Saturn, edged
and fringed as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
This Coat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
See of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
which hath annexed with it the Title of
Primate and Metropolitan of all
<hi>England;</hi> to
whose high place it of right appertaineth to
Crown and Inaugurate the Sovereign Monarchs
of this Kingdom. This Ornament is called in
Latin <hi>Pallium, Quia ex eo plenitudo dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
Archiepiscopatus in gestante, palam fit om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</hi>
What a Pall is <hi>Chassanaeus</hi> sheweth in
these words, <hi>Pallium est quoddam ornamentum
ad modnm Stolae Socerdotalis cum quibusdam
crucibus nigris contextis, quod defertur super
alia ornamenta, circundans pectus &amp; humeros,
ad modum coronae dependens.</hi> In ancient time
it was (through the intolerable pride and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the Roman Bishop) not lawful for any
to take upon him the Title of an Archbishop,
before he had received from the Pope this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
which we call a Pall, and that was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
to be a manifest demonstration of the
lawfulness and fulness of his Archiepiscopal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
Besides, he was to take a Corporal
Oath to hold faith and obedience to the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> at the receiving of this Pall. No
man ought to lend his Pall to any other, but
contrariwise the same to be buried with the
Possessor and Owner.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, a
Mitre with two Labels

Or. This Coat
standeth in St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Church in <hi>Nantwich,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
called <hi>Wich Mulbanke.</hi> Amongst
the sundry Ornaments
ordained for the illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bishops Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> reckoneth the Mitre for
one, and affirmeth the same to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the Hebrews. And as touching
the forked shape thereof, he writeth in this
manner, <hi>Adduntur bina cornua, quoniam Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
acceptis tabulis, quibus Mandata Dei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripta
erant, visus est suis cornutus.</hi>

The Field is Gules, on
a Lion rampant, Argent,
a Bishop's Croysier in
Bend sinister, Or, born
by <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayon,</hi>
half brother to <hi>William</hi>
the Conquerour, by
whom he was created
Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> This staff
(according to <hi>Polydore
Virgil)</hi> was given to
Bishops to chastise the Vices of the People; and
it is called <hi>Baculus Pastoralis,</hi> as given to
them in respect of their Pastoral Charge, and
superintendency over their flock, as well for
feeding them with wholsome Doctrine, and
for defending them from the violent incursions
of the Wolf, wherein they do imitate the
good and watchful Sphepherd, of whose Crook
this Croysier hath a resemblance. Besides these
Ornaments, the same Author speaketh of a
Ring given to a Bishop, in signification of the
conjunction or marriage of Christ with his
Church, whereof the Ring is a Pledge: and
of his Gloves, that betokened cleanness of
hands, free from all contagious corruption:
and lastly, his Sandals, that betokened his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
vigilancy over his Flock: all which
are said to have been instituted by the Decrees
of Pope <hi>Clement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In blazon here you shall not say debruised
or oppressed, both in respect the Croysier ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
not to the extremities of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as also in respect of the slender substance
thereof, whereby it may be intended, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may easily free himself thereof, if it were
extended throughout to the Corners of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon.
Howsoever, most true it is, that
those who are advanced to the Calling repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the Croysier, ought to be like Lions,
both for courage and vigilancy, in execution
of that great Authority and Jurisdiction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ and his Church have honoured
them, for the repressing of obstinate Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and preservation of the Churches Peace
and Discipline.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent,

Gules, three Croysiers,
Or, by the Name of
<hi>Weare</hi> of <hi>Devon.</hi> And

               <p>To this Head must be referred all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments

sufficient in this place to shew their use in Coat-Armour.</p>

               <p>OF things artificial born or worn by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Dignity, and represented in
Coat-Armours, we have spoken in the 2
Chapters preceding: In this shall be delivered
Examples of such Ornaments, or representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Dignity, as are born before Persons of
such Majesty or Dignity, for the more honour
of their Place and Calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Pearl, a
Sword of Estate in Pale,
the point crected, Ruby,
hilted and pomelled,
Topaz, the Scabbard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with stones of
divers kinds, set in Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smiths
work, proper.
The manner of bearing
this Sword varieth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several
Estates and Dignities of the Persons for whom
they are born. But the same is not born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Head-Officers of Boroughs and other
Towns Corporate (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) comparable
to the orderly bearing thereof within his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> by reason of the
want of judgment therein. It is therefore to
be observed, that when the Sword is born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Sovereign Lord the Kings most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Majesty, the Bearer thereof must carry
the point thereof direct upright, the blade op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
and near to the middle part of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
And as to the form of bearing the
Sword before inferiour Estates, as a Duke, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess,
Earl, &amp;c. I refer the Reader to the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence
of Armory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
The Field is Jupiter, a
Mace of Majesty in bend,
Sol. I call this a Mace
of Majesty, to distinguish
the same from the Mace
born by a common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant,
not only in form,
but also in use; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as this is born in
all solemn Assemblies
before his Majesty, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
before his Highnesses Vice-Roys. In like
manner the same is born before the Lords Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
Keeper, and Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Lords President of <hi>Wales,</hi> and of the
North parts, and the Speaker of the Parliament-House
in time of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The Bearer hereof is called a Serjeant at
Arms; whose Office is to attend the Estates
and Persons aforesaid, for the execution of their
Commands, for the Arrests of Traitors, the
Remove of forcible Entries, and the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Malefactors. A man that is under
Arrest of a Serjeant at Arms, is protected all
that time from all other Arrests.</p>

The Field is Pearl, a
Purse open, the long
strings thereof pendant,
fretted, nowed, button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and tasseled, Mars,
all hatched, Topaz, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
all over with
the Sovereign Ensigns
of his Majesty, insigned
with a Crown trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and supported
of a Lion gardant and an Unicorn, underneath
the same an Escroll. This Purse is born before
the Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper, as the
peculiar Ensign of his high Magistracy, whose
Office is to mitigate the rigour of the Common
Laws of the Realm, according to the Rule of
Equity, and by apposition of his Majesties
Great Seal, to ratifie and confirm the Gifts and
Grants of Dignities, Offices, Franchises, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Immunities, Estates in Fee for
term of life, or for years, granted by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty:
As also to correct and reform whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seemeth to him (in any of those Grants)
either prejudicial to his Majesty, his Royal
Dignity, Honour, or Profit, before he do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the same under the Great Seal. He is
(according to <hi>Chassanaeus</hi>) the King's Vicar;
for that (in his Majesties stead) he ordaineth
Provincial Governours, nominateth Judges
without Election by Voices, and appointeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers of inferiour place and service. He
hath his Name <hi>à cancellando,</hi> of cancelling
things amiss, and rectifying of them by the
Rules of Equity and a good Conscience. Of
whose Dignity <hi>Polycratus</hi> hath this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trastich.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Hic est qui Leges Regni cancellat iniquas,</l>

               <p>Of Ornaments representing Dignity born
before Ecclesiastical Persons, the chiefest are
the Cross before exemplified, and the Vierge,
which is born before them in Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
within their several Jurisdictions, which

               <p>TO these honorary Ensigns, as well Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
as Ecclesiastical, worn by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
dignified, and born before them in
token of honour, it shall not infringe our order,
if I add such honourable Donations and Badges

by Emperours, Kings, Princes, and
States upon their Favourites, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd upon such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as they esteemed worthy, in respect of
their merits, to possess some pledges of their
favour, as testimonies of their own worth; in
which number are Rings, Chains, Collars,
Chaplets, and such like. That these in former
Ages were bestowed upon persons advanced to
honour, appeareth by many evident testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
both of sacred and prophane History. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
minding to advance <hi>Ioseph</hi> (for that he
found by experience that God had bestowed
upon him gifts worthy to be highly honoured)
put upon his finger a Ring, and about his neck
a Chain of Gold; <hi>Detrahens Pharaoh</hi> (saith
<hi>Moses) annulum suum è manu sua, induit il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
in manum Iosephi, jussitque illum induere
vestes xylinas, &amp; apposuit torquem aureum col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo
ejus, &amp;c.</hi> And as touching Collars of Gold,
they were bestowed for Rewards upon such as
were of the Blood Royal of Kings, or such as
were near of Alliance unto them, as appeareth
in the first Book of <hi>Maccabees; Fuitque, ut au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divit
Alexander Rex sermones istos, ut am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliore
honore Ionathanem afficeret, mittens ei
auream fibulam, ut mos est dari cognatis Regum,
&amp;c.</hi> Of these last mentioned Ornaments, Rings
are most usually born in Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Sable, 3
Gem-Rings, Or, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with Turkesses,
proper. The <hi>Romans</hi>
having lost three great
Battels to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> one
at <hi>Ticinum,</hi> another at
<hi>Trebeia,</hi> and the third
at <hi>Thrasimene, Mago</hi>
his brother went to
<hi>Carthage</hi> to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his happy Victories to his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
there: and for approbation thereof, he
poured forth before the Senate (as some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
above a bushel full, and as others write,
above three bushels and an half full of Rings,
which had been taken from the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights.
And though custome and time hath made the
Ring a common Ornament for every Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
hand; yet of right none should use them,
but such as either Blood, Wars, Learning, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Dignity had made capable thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> waging battel against
the <hi>Messeni,</hi> a people of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi>
to the end their people that deceased in the
Wars should have Funeral Rites, and not be
exposed (unburied) to all casualties, they had
certain Rings about their Arms, wherein their
Names were engraven.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gideon</hi> purposed to make an Ephod
to signifie his thankfulness unto God for his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
against the <hi>Midianites,</hi> he required of
the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that every man would give him
the Ear-ring of his prey, whereto they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
consented; the value whereof amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the weight of one thousand and seven
hundred shekels of Gold, besides Collars and
Jewels, and purple raiment that was on the
Kings of <hi>Midian;</hi> and besides the Chains that
were about the Camels necks, <hi>Iudges 8. 24.
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ring is a type or representation of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
as appeareth in the sacred Writs of the
<hi>Egyptians;</hi> for the Ancients did not wear
Rings on their fingers so much for ornament
or ostentation, as for use of Sealing, in regard
that the Seal gave a better approbation than
the writing did, concerning the validity and
verity of the Charter: therefore in after ages
men used to fortifie their last Wills and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with seven Manual Seals, or Rings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,
of witnesses called thereto, to signifie
the verity and validity thereof. Hereof came
that saying of <hi>Cicero ad Quintum fratrem, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulus

               <p>WE now come to Coat-Armours beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
or borrowed from the Arts
Liberal; which (according to <hi>Ioh.
de Tur. Cremat.</hi>) are so denominated for three
respects: First, <hi>Quia liberam mentem requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
to put a difference between them, and
those Mechanical Sciences wherein Artificers do
more exercise their limbs than their minds. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they are called Liberal, in regard they
are attained without any impeachment of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
or cauterize of Conscience. Thirdly, for
that in times past, only the Children of noble
and free-born persons were admitted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and trained up in them. <hi>Patricius</hi>
saith that Arts Liberal are so termed, <hi>Quia
liberos homines efficiunt ab omni turpi &amp; sordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
questu, &amp;c.</hi> Because they make men to be of
liberal and ingenuous minds, free from base
and sordid covetousness and sensual delights,
ennobling them with true wisdome (the most
noble endowment of mankind) wherby men are
as it were link'd unto God, and made most like
unto him.</p>
               <p>And this especially is effected by that high
and heavenly Art, Theology, a Science not
invented by man, but proceeding from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Wisdom of the Almighty, whereunto all
other Arts are but Handmaids; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Professors thereof are by right, and
also by common consent of best approved He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
to have the precedency of all worldly
Professions whatsoever. And this Celestial
Science tending to the eternal happiness of the
Soul, is accompanied with two other Faculties
of great esteem (though inferiour to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
which are <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Law;</hi> the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the good of our Body (and therefore
worthily to have the next place after our Souls)
the other tending to our outward Estates of
Fortune, which are not to be neglected of the
wisest. And these three we call the Cardinal
Sciences, because of their great necessity and
noble use above the other seven Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>Man naturally desireth knowledge, but is
not able to attain the perfection thereof, no
though he be well read in Natural Histories, in
Chronography and Moral Discipline, as may
be seen <hi>Ecclesiast. 1. 13. And I gave my heart
to seek, and search out by wisdome, concerning
all things that are done under the heavens:
this sore travel hath God given to the son of
man, to be exercised therewith, and all is
but vexation of the spirit. For in much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is much grief, and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow, verse 18. And
further, by these, my son, be admonished, of
making many Books there is no end, and much
study is a weariness of the flesh.</hi> Whereby we
are given to understand, that wisdome and
knowledge are not gotten without great travel
of body and mind; and when a man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the highest pitch, yet is his mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fully satisfied; wherefore we must depend
only upon God, and acknowledge that there is
no true felicity in this life. One Example I
will give you, which shall comprehend all the
Liberal Sciences joyntly, which is this next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:55096:112"/>
in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> where that University in the
old Britains time (as is thought) was first
planted. The Book it self some have thought
to signifie that Book mentioned in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps,</hi>
having seven Seals: but these here are
taken rather to be the seven Liberal Sciences,
and the Crowns to be the reward and honour
of Learning and Wisdome; and the triplicity
of the Crowns are taken to represent the three
Cardinal Professions of Faculties before specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Inscription I find to vary according
to variety of times: some having <hi>Sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
&amp; Felicitate,</hi> Wisdome and Happiness;
others (and that very ancient) <hi>Deus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio
mea,</hi> The Lord is my light; others this,
<hi>Veritas liberat, bonitas regnabit,</hi> Truth frees
us, Godliness crowneth us; and others thus,
<hi>In principio, &amp;c.</hi> In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God. This
one Escocheon may serve for a pattern of all
the other Sciences, yet of some of the rest I
will give instance.</p>

He beareth such or such a Metal or Colour, and
so many Billets, as in this present Coat-Armour

the Billets exceed ten, then you may tell the

I let them pass. The Musical Instruments
are of three sorts, whereof some are Wind-Instruments,
as are the Organs, Shagbuts, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys,
Cornets, Flutes, &amp;c. The second sort
consisteth in strings, and in the skilfull fingring
of them; as are Harps, Viols, Rebecks, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
Claricords, Bandore, Alpharion, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
&amp;c. The third sort consisteth in striking;
as the Taber, Timbrel, Ordinary Drums and
Kettle-Drums, and such others, whereof in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

               <p>THOUGH great be the difference of
dignity and esteem betwixt the Noble
and Liberal Professions (before intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and Illiberal; because those are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of divine spirits and understanding minds,
whereas these are for the most part but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of an industrious hand: yet in these
also, as there is great use for the necessity of
mans life, so is there much reputation for the
exquisite varieties of invention. And albeit
they are called Illiberal, <hi>Quia liberè exerceri
non possunt, sine corporis viribus,</hi> because they
cannot be freely practised without bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
yet in another respect they may be more
truly called Liberal than the Liberal Sciences
themselves, for that commonly they bestow
more wealth on their Professors, whiles, as
<hi>Virtus,</hi> so <hi>Scientia laudatur &amp; alget.</hi> In the
first rank of these Illiberals reason exacts that
Agriculture should have precedence, it being
the chief Nurse of mans life, and hath in the
times of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> been esteemed an
estate not unbefitting their greatest Dictators
and Princes: and it was devised and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
soon after the Creation, as appeareth in
the Text, where it is said, <hi>Habel Pastor Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,
Kaiin verò Agricola;</hi> for here we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not only Tillage, but also Pastorage, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

               <p>After the Deluge God made a Covenant
with <hi>Noah,</hi> that from thenceforth he would
never destroy mankind by water, as hath been
before touched: but that his first Ordinance
concerning the fourfold seasons of the year
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55096:114"/>
should remain inviolable unto the Worlds end;
In assurance of this same infallible promise of
God, we do fit ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>dunging</hi> of our Land, in <hi>planting,
pruning,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>That Tillage and Husbandry was the first of
all the Mechanical Trades (as we now call
them) it is manifest, <hi>Gen. 2. 15. Then the Lord
God took the man, and put him into the Garden
of</hi> Eden, <hi>that he might dress it, and keep it.
Wherein</hi> (saith <hi>Zanch.) God would moderate
the pleasure and delight that he had given to</hi>
Adam, <hi>in some kind of Trade or course of life,
and honest Exercise. Whereof Tillage is of
all other the most ancient and commendable,
inasmuch as it was instituted in Paradise, and
that in the time of mans innocency before he
had transgressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great difference between the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
that man was initiated unto before his
fall, and after: For after his transgression it
was performed with much labour, pain, and
sweat, and to supply necessity, such as is the
Husbandry now used; For Husbandmen be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to till the ground, if they will have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to sustain life. Therefore God said <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicta
terra propter te, &amp;c. Cursed be the earth
for thy sake: In sudore vultus comedes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In the sweat of thy brows shalt thou eat of it
all the days of thy life, Gen. 3. 17. Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and
thou shalt eat the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rb of the field, verse</hi> 18.
Before <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall he was injoyned to till the
ground only to prevent idleness; such as is the
Husbandry that Noblemen are delighted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and do perform the same with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of Tillage much differing
from this, whereof <hi>Petrarch</hi> saith, <hi>Ager est
animus, cultus intentio; semen cura, messis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

good Arts or Studies, as often as we find our
selves ill affected with sloth and idleness which
cannot abide it self. Many are the Instruments

Temple of <hi>Sangus,</hi> there continued even till
the time that he wrote his Book, the Wooll
that the Lady <hi>Caia Cecilia</hi> did spin, together
with her Distaff and Spindle. As for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
and necessary use of spinning, we have
an undoubted president in the 35. of <hi>Exodus</hi>
25, 26. where it is said, <hi>And all the women
that were wise-hearted did spin with their
hands, and brought that which they had spun,
both of blue and of purple, and of skarlet and
fine linnen: And all the women, whose hearts
stirred them up in wisdome, spun Goats-hair.</hi>

<hi>the Son of</hi> Arachne, <hi>taught first the making
of the Spindle for Woollen-yarn.</hi> It was
(<hi>saith</hi> Pliny) a fashion and custome at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that when Maids were to be wedded, there
attended upon them one with a Distaff dressed
and trimmed with kembed Wooll, as also a
Spindle and Yarn upon it, to put them in mind
that Huswivery and Wivery were to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Fusils (<hi>saith</hi> Leigh) are never pierced
or voided, but are diversly born, in respect of
their local position or mutation. And the
Frenchmen (<hi>saith he</hi>) take them for Spindles,
we take them for Weavers Shuttles, and the
Dutch for Mill-pecks.</p>

those precedent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the crook a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,

imposed upon the

sort of Spindle women do use most commonly
to spin withal, not at the Torn as the former,
but at a Distaff put under their girdle, so as they
oftentimes spin therewith going. The round
Ball at the lower end serveth to the fast twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Derby</hi> by the Lord <hi>Strange,</hi> and Sir <hi>Peter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew</hi>

derived from the Latin word <hi>Manica,</hi> which
signifieth the sleeve of a Garment. And the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55096:116"/>
same of some Armorists is termed <hi>Manche
mal tailee, Quasi manica malè taliata,</hi> as an
ill shapen sleeve. To wear sleeves unto any
sort of Garment was with some people holden
reproachful, as appeareth in the Exposition of
the Epistle of St. <hi>Hierome ad Eustochium,</hi> in
these words; <hi>Objiciebatur quasi delicatum
apud Maronem, quòd tunicae haberent Manicas.</hi>
The coming of the hand out in this manner
doth shew the same to be a sleeve. For (if you
observe) you may herein discern the bought of
the Arm in the midst, as also the elbow oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
thereunto, and the widing thereof at the
shoulder, as if the same were enlarged with a
Gusset under the arm-pit. Also the hanging
down of the bagg from the handwrist doth
concurr with that form of sleeve, which the
women of <hi>Galoway</hi> in the North parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at this day do use. The same doth the
former also express, although in a more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
manner, as if you compare one of them
with the other, you may easily perceive.</p>
               <p>As touching Apparel, we find, that though the
same be made chiefly to clothe our nakedness;
yet shall we find that they were not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by the invention of man, but also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
(and for some special end) expresly
commanded by God himself to be made and
provided, as well for glory as also for ornament
and comliness, as appeareth <hi>Exod. 28. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
thou shalt embroider the fine linnen Coat,
and thou shalt make the Mitre of fine linnen,
and thou shalt make the Girdle of needle work.
And for</hi> Aaron<hi>'s sons thou shalt make Coats,
and thou shalt make for them Girdles, and
Bonnets shalt thou make for them for glory and
for beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rich Garments and costly Jewels are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
Ornaments, as appeareth <hi>2 Sam. 1. 24.
Ye daughters of</hi> Israel <hi>weep over</hi> Saul, <hi>who

who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</hi>
And they be called Ornaments, because they
do illustrate and adorn or beautifie the person
that is garnished with them.</p>

Combs, Argent, by the

Comb is a necessary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
for triming of

(as touching the form
thereof) to have been
devised by imitation of
the back-bone of a fish;
and serveth not only for cleansing the head
from dandruff and other superfluities, but is of
most use with women for shedding and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hair and head-tires, wherein some of
them bestow more labour for the adorning of
them, than their whole body is worth.</p>

The Field is Argent,

to the ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

That that Coat-Armour whose field consisteth
of Argent, and the charge of Sable (as you
see the Coat of <hi>Cutts</hi> doth) is the most fair kind
of bearing; and with him agree other Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists.
<hi>Leigh</hi> there sheweth this reason, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Argent or White will be seen in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55096:117"/>
place, and Sable or Black in the clearest light;
and since these two of all other Colours may
be discerned farthest of, therefore is the shield
thus born and charged called the fairest.</p>
               <p>In respect we are now come to speak of
Stamps and Coins, I hold it not impertinent (by
the way) to give some little touch of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of Coining. It is therefore to be observed,
that the power to coin money hath been ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
reckoned to be one of the Prerogatives
that in our common Law we do call <hi>Iura Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi>
and pertaineth to the Sovereign Power
amongst many Regal Immunities to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Jurisdiction peculiarly belonging, and to
none others.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless we read that Monarchical Kings
and Sovereign States have imparted this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
or Preheminence unto others their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
upon special acceptable service done, or
for whatsoever private respect, as we may see
<hi>Maccab.</hi> 15. 6. where amongst many other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences
granted by <hi>Antiochus</hi> the son of
<hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Simon</hi> the high Priest, which
had been formerly granted to him by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he enableth him to
coin money, saying, <hi>I give thee leave to
coin money of thine own stamp within thy
Countrey.</hi>

He beareth Azure,
three Peny-yard pence,

<hi>Spence.</hi> These are so

of <hi>Peny-yard</hi> near
the Market Town of

He beareth Argent,
a Purse Overt, Gules.
This Coat pertaineth to
the Family of <hi>Conradus
Wittenbergensis Comes,</hi>
that was first invested
by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth,
Emperour, to whom he
gave faithful aid in his
wars, and did much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
the strife betwixt
him and <hi>Rodolph</hi> of <hi>Swevia,</hi> his competitor to

Emperour: he much laboured a pacification of
the tumults then stirred up in <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius</hi>
in his Genealogies noteth.</p>
               <p>By this open Purse we may understand a man
of a charitable disposition, and a frank and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral

He beareth Gules, a
Cheveron between 3
Irish Brogues, Or. This
Coat pertaineth to the
Family of <hi>Arthure</hi> of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> The pulling
off a mans shoe (which
in Irish is call'd a Brogue)
seemeth to have been a
note of reproach or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
as we may gather
by that which <hi>Moses</hi> hath observed unto us,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 25. where it is shewed, that if a man
happen to die issuless, then his next kinsman
should marry his wife, and raise up to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a name amongst the <hi>Israelites:</hi> which if
he refused to do, then upon complaint by her
made to the Elders, he was warned before them;
if then he refused to marry her, then came the
woman to him in the presence of the Elders,
and pulled off his shoe, and did spit in his face,
and say, <hi>So shall it be done unto the man that
will not build up his brothers house: And his
name was called in</hi> Israel; <hi>The house of him
whose shoe is pulled off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the shoe be an habit serving for the
foot, which is the most inferiour part of mans
body; yet it is not therefore to be contemned,
forasmuch as it is a note of progression, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
behoveful for travellers: In the Scriptures
it is often taken for expedition, as <hi>Psal. 60. In
Idumaeam extendam calceamentum meum; And
proceeding to</hi> Idumea, <hi>I will cast my shoe over
it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient custome amongst the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
(in transferring of possessions) for him
that departed therewith to pluck off his shoe,
and to deliver the same to his neighbour, as
now it is with us, to pass livery and seis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
Inheritance by the delivery of a turf and sprigs
taken off the ground, and delivering the same
to the Purchaser, as appeareth in the Book of
<hi>Ruth;</hi> where it is said, <hi>Now this was the
manner before time in</hi> Israel <hi>concerning r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and changing, for to stablish all things: A
man did pluck off his shoe, and gave it to his
neighbour, and this was a sure witness.</hi> By
which Ceremony he publickly acknowledged
that he had transferred, and put over his
whole right unto the Purchaser, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. 7,
8, 9.</p>
               <p>But in after Ages it seemeth the Jews passed
Inheritances by Charters, sealed and testified
by witnesses (a custome of use with us at this
day at the Common Law) as appeareth in the
Prophesie of <hi>Ieremiah; Men shall buy fields
for money, and make writings and seal them,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55096:118"/>
and take witnesses in the Land of</hi> Benjamin,
<hi>and round about</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 32. 44. And
again, <hi>Ier. 32. 25, And thon hast said unto me,
O Lord God, buy unto thee a field for silver,
and take witnesses. And I bought the field of</hi>
Hananeel <hi>my Uncles son, that was in</hi> Anathoth,
<hi>and weighed him the money, even seventeen
shekels of silver: And I subscribed the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
weighed him the money in the balances, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now since I am casually fallen upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of sealing of Deeds, I hold it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
to give some little touch (by the way)
of the first coming in of this custome of seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(in this our Nation) which is now of so
frequent use amongst us.</p>
               <p>First, it is to be observed, that our Ancestors
the Saxons had not the same in use; for they
used only to subscribe their Names, commonly
adding the sign of the Cross. And I need not to
prove the same by the testimony of divers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
for this custome continued here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
until the time that this Realm was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who
together with the state of Government (a thing
of common custome with absolute Conquerors)
did alter the before mentioned custome of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of Deeds, into sealing with wax;
whereupon the <hi>Norman</hi> custome of sealing of
Deeds at length prevailed amongst us. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the before mentioned use of the
<hi>Saxons</hi> therein was utterly abolished; as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
<hi>Ingulphus</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Crowland,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The</hi> Normans <hi>do change the making of
writings, which were wont to be firmed in</hi>
England <hi>with crosses of gold and other holy
signs, into printing wax.</hi> And they rejected
also the manner of English writing. This change
was not effected all at once, but took place by
degrees: so that first the King only, and some
few of his Nobility besides, used to seal; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Noblemen for the most part, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>At this time also, as <hi>Ioh. Ross.</hi> noteth, they
used to grave in their seals their own Pictures
and Counterfeits covered with a long Coat over
their Armours.</p>
               <p>After this Gentlemen of the better sort took
up this fashion: and because they were not all
warriors, they made seals ingraven with their
several Coats or Shields of Arms for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, as the same Author reporteth.</p>
               <p>At length, about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, seals became very common; so as not
only those that bear Arms used to seal, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men also fashioned to themselves signets of
their own devising: some taking the letters of
their own names, some flowers, some knots and
flourishes, and other beasts and birds, or some
other things, as now we behold daily in use.</p>

The Field is Argent,
a Cheveron engrailed,

Arms do pertain to the
Company of Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Under this Head must be comprehended all
sorts of Instruments (whereof there is use in
Coat-Armours) pertaining to the several
Trades of Joyners, Milwrights, Cartwrights,
Turners, Coopers, &amp;c, and whatsoever other
Trades, whose use consisteth and is exercised
in working or framing of Timber, Wainscot, or
any sort of Wood. And so from Tools of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonry
and Carpentry born in Coat-Armour, we
come to Instruments of Metal-work (the other
Species of Armature) whether the same be
malleable and wrought by Hammer, or Fusil, and
formed by fire.</p>

The Field is Sable, a
Cheveron between 3
Hammers, Argent,
crowned, Or. This Coat-Armour
belongeth to
the Company of Smiths,
whose trade of life, as it
is most laborious, so is
it of most behoof for the
strength both of private
mens persons, and of
Kingdoms: And therefore the Iron Hammer
doth well deserve the Crown of Gold on it, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
it self in respect of the use being much
more precious and necessary for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
than Gold is: which the Enemies of
God's people knew very well, when they would
not permit a Smith to live amongst the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
as may be seen 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 19. where it
is said, <hi>Then there was no Smith found through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Land of</hi> Israel; <hi>for the</hi> Philistines
<hi>said, lest the Hebrews make them Swords or
Spears.</hi> The Hammer and Anvil are two of
the chiefest Instruments of this Trade for
forging and forming of things malleable for
necessary use. Of these doth <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi>
make mention, chap. 38. v. 28. where speaking
of the laborious travel of the Smith, he saith,
<hi>The Smith abideth by his Anvil, and doth his
diligence to labour the Iron: the vapour of the
fire drieth his flesh, and he must fight with the
heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer
is ever in his ears, and his eyes look still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the thing that he maketh: he setteth his
mind to make up his work, therefore he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to polish it perfectly.</hi>

               <p>Castles and Towers are strengths and fences

well for descrying of the Enemy afar off, as for
repulsing him upon his approach: whereupon
they are called in Latin <hi>Arces, ab arcendo,</hi> of
keeping the Enemy aloof, or repulsing and

retreat for the timorous to lurk in, than for

               <p>Pillars, the Hieroglyphicks of Fortitude and
Constancy, were erected for divers ends and
purposes: Sometimes to limit out the bounds of

another: Sometimes for memories of vows
made; as that which was erected by <hi>Iacob</hi> at

as those of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 15. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for Testimonies of Covenants, as that
which was erected by <hi>Iacob</hi> for a memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>Laban, Gen.</hi> 31. 44, 45. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for Monuments to extoll the valour,

those that were decreed by the Senate and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Such kind of habitations

Towns, or Villages to inhabit, but the open

of the ancient <hi>Scythians,</hi> because they are (in

to attention, when the High Priest

               <p>Because we have here spoken of Buildings

hereunto such Escocheons as are derived from

three Cushions, Ermyn,
buttoned and tasseled,
Or, by the Name of
<hi>Redman.</hi> Howsoever
these are now taken for
Cushions, others are of
opinion that they are
more truly Pillows, and
given to some Ancestors
of this Bearer (if Fame
be true) for that by occasion of a combat chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
upon him by a stranger, for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
whereof the day and place being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this man being more forward than the
Challenger, came very early to the place at the
day appointed, and by chance fell on sleep in his
Tent: the people being assembled, and the hour
come, the trumpets sounded to the battel,
whereupon he wakened suddenly, ran furiously
upon his Adversary and slew him.</p>
               <p>These and such other Utensils do serve as

He beareth Gules, a
Fess Humet, between
three Trestles, Argent,
by the Name of <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
More aptly (in
my conceit) may this
transverse Charge be
termed a Table than a
Fess Humet, for so have I
seen the same anciently
blazoned, and so taken
it is a note of special Hospitality and House-keeping,
a thing in this Age much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but little practised.</p>
               <p>Now in respect we are in hand to speak of
Hospitality, it shall not be amiss to give some
little touch by the way of the bountiful hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of Kings in former Ages, whereof I find
King <hi>Solomon</hi> to be the most famous president:
for his daily expences that I read of, wherein
he exceeded all others that preceded or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him, as we may see 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 22. where
it is said, <hi>And</hi> Solomon<hi>'s victuals for one day
were thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty
measures of meal; ten fat Oxen, and twenty
Oxen of the Pastures, and one hundred Sheep
beside Harts, Robucks, and fallow Deer, and
fatted Fowl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s House-keeping descend
we now to the Hospitality of the ancient Kings
of this Land. I find in an ancient Manuscript
that King <hi>Lud</hi> commanded his houshold Officers
to have in daily custome, to cover the Tables
in the Hall from seven of the clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till seven in the evening. His daily Diet
was not much in rare and delicate Viands; but
that he kept it constantly with all good Cates
as could be gotten; and at the four great Feasts
he caused Proclamations to be made in all
Countries for all manner of people to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the same Author maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a very memorable and most royal Feast,
that <hi>Cassibelane</hi> made upon his second Triumph
over the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour. And forasmuch as
it is a chief point to be observed of him that
shall cite Authority for any thing that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or speaketh of, to use the express words
of his Author which he voucheth, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deliver it as he himself relateth the same.</p>
               <p>Domus Regis Cassibelani standeth for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
note, which after his second triumph up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Emperour, gave out his Royal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to all the Gentiles in <hi>Britany,</hi> to come
with their Wives to magnifie his Feast: For

one hundred thousand Sheep, thirthy thousand

of so many feet. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

Church dedicated to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
wherein was a
Lamp that burnt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
and never went
out, but still gave light,
yet was not maintained with any kind of Oyl,
or other fatty matter or substance, and this was
holden for a special miraculous thing; yet might
the same be performed by some other natural
means; as with a certain kind of stone that is
found in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and is called <hi>Asbestus,</hi>
which is said to be of that nature, that being
once kindled and set on fire, doth never extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
or go out, neither is it thereby consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or wasted, <hi>Zan. lib. 4. de potent, daemon.

               <p>There are doubtless both in herbs and stones
admirable vertues (not manifest) whereby
strange and unwonted effects may be wrought.
Therefore men being ignorant of the efficacy
and forcible vertues of things natural, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
only their effects by sight, do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
conceive that there is wrought some
strange or great miracle; whereas indeed it is
nothing less but a matter proceeding meerly
from some natural cause.</p>
               <p>Besides these aforesaid, there are sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instruments of houshold use, as Mortars,
Gridirons, &amp;c. which we leave to observation.
And to this may be referred Candles, Torches,
&amp;c. The great Turk <hi>Solimannus</hi> gave four
Candles for his Device, one burning, the other
three extinct; to signifie that other Religions
were nothing light in respect of his; or that
the other parts of the world should lose their
beauty by the brightness of his glory.</p>

He beareth parted <hi>per</hi>

Or and Gules, three Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

Hour-glasses of the first.
This Coat pertained to
Dr. <hi>White,</hi> sometimes
Bishop of <hi>Winchester;</hi> a
Descendant of which
Family is <hi>Nehemiah White</hi> of <hi>Islington</hi> in <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex,
Clericus.</hi> Albeit the Sun is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and Moderator of time, yet because
we cannot aplty express the same to the view,
I have made choice of this Coat to manifest the
same thereby, in respect of the Hour-glasses
placed on the Chief thereof: For as the Sun is
the measure of time; so is the time also the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
not only of publick, but also of private
affairs. For who is he that hath any business
to perform, that desireth not to know how he
proceedeth therein, and whether he be before
hand with time, or that he be belated? And
for this end were Dials, Clocks, Watches and
Hour-glasses devised.</p>
               <p>Endless is the swift passage of time, which
we shall better discern, if we look backwards
to the times that have already over-slipped
us.</p>
               <p>The best means we can devise to bridle time
is to be evermore well exercised in some honest,
vertuous, and laudable work; so shall it not
escape us fruitlesly, according to that saying of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55096:122"/>
                  <hi>Petrarch, Virtute &amp; industria, bonarumque
artium studiis fraenari possunt tempora, non
quia fugiant, sed ne pereant.</hi> So shall we be
sure to carry a hand over time, and not time
over us: so shall we, if not clip his wings that
he glide not from us, yet so attach him,
that he shall not so pass us, but that we shall
make some good use of him, that he pass us
not unprofitably,</p>
               <p>Time slippeth from us suddenly, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strippeth
us, which only we ought greedily to
seize upon, and in no case barter or exchange
the same for any costly price or reward. Let us
(though late, yet not too late) begin to love
and hold time in estimation, which only a man
may lawfully and honestly covet. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
our selves of the shortness of our time,
and our own frailty, and endeavour our selves
to make good use thereof; and let us not then
(as <hi>Seneca</hi> admonisheth us) begin to live, when
life begins to leave us.</p>
               <p>To this place are Clocks, Watches, and such
like Instruments (representing the swift inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
motion of time) to be referred, wherein
we may observe that every wheel therein is
moved by some other of more swift motion
that it self hath; whereby is verified this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

He beareth Azure, a
Ruther or Helm of a
Ship, Argent. By the
help of this Helm doth
the Pilot wield the Ship
at will through the most
violent Seas. Some men
are of opinion, that the
first invention of the
Helm of a Ship was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Kite flying, or rather gliding in the
Air, that by turning of his tail one while one
way, another while another way, doth guide
his course in the Air: whereby it seemeth that
Nature would manifest in the clear Air, what
was behoveful to be practised in the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
So necessary is the use of this Instrument,
as that without it no shipping can be directed
in a certain course, but would be evermore in
peril of splitting upon Shoals and Rocks,
through the forcible current and surging waves
of the Sea, and the violence of the boysterous
winds, notwithstanding the might of the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Pilots or Mariners, to their great hazard
and astonishment, as we may see <hi>Psalm 107.
25, 26, &amp;c. For at his word the stormy wind
ariseth, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to heaven, and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the deep; their soul melteth away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the trouble. They reel to and fro, and
stagger like a drunken man, and are at their

               <p>THE last of the foresaid Arts we reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Venation, which <hi>Plato</hi> divideth
into three Species, Hunting, Hawking,
and Fishing; all which, because they tend to
the providing of sustenance for man, <hi>Farnesius</hi>
doth therefore account a Species of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The dangerous chases of the Bear, the
wild Boar, Bull, &amp;c. whether the same be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on horseback or on foot, hath a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Military practice; for it maketh a
man provident in assaulting, as also valorous in
sustaining the brunt of the enemy: it maketh
them politick for choice of places of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and enableth them to tolerate hunger,
thirst, labour, storms, tempests, &amp;c. all which
are most requisite for such as do profess a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
course of life. What valorous Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
those men have proved, that have been
trained up in the Art of Hunting, when they
have come to the administration and managing
of Martial Affairs, the <hi>Persians</hi> can sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witness unto us, who had no better means
to become expert Souldiers, than their daily
exercise of Hunting: As also the History of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who was so much
transported with the love of Hunting, as that
(according to <hi>Farnesius</hi>) by the space of seven
years he took not the benefit of any house ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in City or Countrey to lie in; by means
whereof he so enabled and enured his body to
sustain all hardness, that afterwards he became
a scourge and terrour to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And
therefore this noble kind of Venation is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
from the title of an Illiberal Art, being
a Princely and Generous Exercise: but those
only, who use it for a trade of life, to make gain
thereof, are to be marshalled in the rank of
Mechanicks and Illiberal Artizans.</p>
               <p>As touching the number of Examples of
things pertaining to this noble exercise of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
proposed for the first Species of Venation,
I purpose to be very brief; not in respect of
their scarcity, but because of the manifold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the Workman for the present,
that he is not able to furnish me with more.
And having ended with them, I will proceed,
according to order, with the other two Species
of Venation, <hi>viz.</hi> Hawking and Fishing.</p>

to Sir <hi>George
Huntley</hi> of <hi>Frowcester</hi>
in the Country of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
Kt. Other Coats
derived from this Noble

born by the Name of <hi>Mertingham,</hi> three Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
or Slips, by the name of <hi>Hayward;</hi> but
these Examples may stand in stead of the rest.
And hitherto are to be referred Toyles, Hayes,
Collars for Greyhounds: of which last sort I
find an Escocheon erected in the Church of

He beareth Or, on a

Bells of the first, by the
Name of <hi>Planke.</hi> This
sort of Bells is of no late
invention, but of great
antiquity, and in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
whose High Priest had
little Bells at the skirts
of his uppermost Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as appeareth <hi>Exod. 28. 33. And beneath
upon the skirts thereof, thou shalt make Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats
of blue silk, and purple and scarlet
round about the skirts thereof, and bells of gold
round about:</hi> to shew that the attention and
devotion of Gods people must be stirred up by
the Ministery of this most sacred Function.</p>
               <p>

Sir <hi>George Ent</hi> of

This Coat was quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Sir <hi>Nicholas Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> Kt. sometimes of
<hi>Hyneham</hi> in the County
of <hi>Glocester.</hi> A like
Coat to this is born by
the Name of <hi>Lie,</hi> and
well accordeth with the Name; for Faulkners
use to deceive their Hawks with casting up of
this, as if it were some Fowl, and so they
give them a lie for a truth. And these two
Examples may suffice for the Noble Art of
Hawking. The next and last is Fishing.</p>
               <p>The skill of fishing is diversly exercised, <hi>viz.</hi>
sometimes with Nets, sometimes with Hooks,
otherwhiles with Salmon-spears, or Eel-spears,

Now first of Nets. These are most u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
born in Arms piece-meal, or in frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are the same (if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
which we call in blazon Frets, because
the Frenchmen call a Net <hi>Retz,</hi> and we by
intermixture of Language have added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Letter <hi>F.</hi> These Fragments are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
born single, and otherwhiles manifold,
as appeareth by these next Examples.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, 8
Mascles, Or, five and
three, by the Name of
<hi>Preston.</hi> The Mascle is
taken for the mash of a
Net, as I shall presently
shew you by good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And Nets are
in sacred Writ Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks
of perswasion,
whereby men are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to vertue and verity, and so may seem af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some sort to be caught. Far diverse from
this is that sort of Net, which is in use with
many men in this Age, to catch and ensnare
men of honest and plain dispositions, entangling
them therein, not only to the decay of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but also to the utter subversion of their
Estates, for the enriching of themselves and
their posterity: of such the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi>
speaketh Chap. 1. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>There is also born Gules, eight Lozenges,
Argent, four, three, and one, by the Name of
<hi>Preston.</hi>

He beareth Gules, a
Cheveron, Ermyn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
three Mascles,
Argent, by the Name of
<hi>Belgrave;</hi> and is born
by <hi>William Belgrave</hi> of
<hi>North Kilworth</hi> in <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi> Esq. These
are by some taken to be
the same with Lozenges.
I <hi>Mascle in Armory</hi>
(saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne) is a representation of
the mash of a Net, signifying the Bearer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in a Field, Gules,</hi> to have been most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and politick in the stratagems of Wars,
for that the Field is dedicated to <hi>Mars.</hi> The
bearing of Mascles therefore is of greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
than many other Charges are, that in
vulgar estimation are more accounted of.
Sometimes these are born to the number of six,
<hi>viz.</hi> three, two, and one, jointly, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of any Ordinary. Otherwhiles
they are born of the number of seven conjunct,
as in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Gules, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Mascles conjunct,
<hi>viz.</hi> three, three, and
one, Or, a Canton, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn.
This Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
pertained to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Badsley</hi> in
the County of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> a man very
judicious in matters of
honour. Whereas <hi>Leigh</hi>
saith that the Mascle ought always to be square,
whether the same be void or whole; I hold,
that if they be mashes of a Net, as Sir <hi>Iohn
Ferne</hi> taketh them to be, then can they not in
any case be whole, but must be evermore trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
and void: for if they be solid, they may
better be resembled to quarels of Glass, or
some other thing of massie and sound substance,
wrought every way square like a Die; from
which a Lozenge is said to differ, in that the
same is longer one way than another.</p>

in any Coat of this bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there be found more
than eight pieces, then (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) you
shall not need to number the pieces; but in the

without saying any more: but in this we differ
from the French Heralds, who blaze such a
kind of bearing, a Fret of six pieces; and there
he noteth further, that a Fret cannot be of less
than six pieces, you shall also sometimes find a
Fret ingrailed, as in this next Example.</p>
               <p>Sable, a Fret, Argent, is born by the Name

Not unproperly
(<hi>saith</hi> Pierius) do men
signifie by this kind of
Hook fraud and guile,
Quia decipere est unum
ostentare, &amp; aliud prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
opinionem inferre: for the fisherman, under
a shew of rendring food to the fish (having sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly
covered the hook all over with the bait)
doth give him his deadly bane. <hi>And of this
trade are more in the world, than will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

These do Fishermen use
for the taking of Eels,
which being (for the
most part) in the mud,
cannot be taken with
Net or other Gin; which
gave occasion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of this Instrument, a long staff being
set in the socket thereof, and so to strike into
the depth of the mud, and by means of the
Barbs of this Instrument, they detain as many
as come within the danger thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Engine hath a signification of such an
action of desert, wherein both strength and

this is like the insnarings
and deceits of wily men:
for as this mouth is made
broad and easie for the
fish to enter, but is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
within, that they
cannot get forth; so crafty Varlets will make
fair pretence to draw men into their dangers,
out of which they cannot get forth, being once
intangled. And this kind of trade is much more
base and illiberal than any of the afore-specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And with these are to be ranged all those,
<hi>quorum lingua venalis est</hi> (saith <hi>Tully</hi>) who

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>ARTS Mechanical of more necessary use
for the nourishing and preserving of
mans body, we have proposed in the
preceding Examples: there yet rest other Arts
of a second rank, which tend rather to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing
and beautifying of Natures works
than to the necessary supply of humane uses;
yea some of them such, as are rather baits to
please the senses, than means to further man's
good. Yet because the custome of times, and
opinion of men, and a certain curious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
skill hath given esteem and name of Art
unto such superfluous curiosities, we will not
utterly pass them by; the rather, because all
of them being used with moderation, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
men, and for good ends, they may
deservedly have both approbation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
The first of these is the skill of
Cookery, for the exquisite pleasing of the
Palate; unto which kind of men, some have
been so addicted, that it is storied of a certain
Prince, that he proposed a great reward to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man that should invent a new conceited
dish. And the <hi>Sybarites</hi> were famous in this
kind, who bid their guests a year before the
Feast, and so long were catering for dainties.
It is a Proverb amongst the Jews, <hi>Qui multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat
carnes, multiplicat vermes:</hi> and most
true it is, that he that daily feedeth his body,
is but a Cook to dress meat for worms. Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Carving, and Imbroidering, serve to
please another sense, the sight; and therefore
is a more ingenious delight: and in this kind
some have been so excellent and renowned, as
that they have been numbred amongst men of
admirable wisdome; as <hi>Apelles, Phidias, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycletus,</hi>
and others, whose works have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
immortal reputation, and some of their
Master-pieces have been prised beyond belief.
All these have sundry Instruments, which may
be (and doubtless have been) born in Coat-Armour;
but because they are not usual, I will
referr them to each man's own observation, and
will give instance in the last of this kind of Arts
of Delight, which we call Playing; which
comprehendeth either Theatrical recreation, or
other Games whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as their first institution was
good, and that they are in themselves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

because they are abused by those that do
practise and exercise them) I have thought
good to annex them unto the same: such are
Table-playing, Chess, Dice, Racket, Balloon,
&amp;c. The things wherewith these Games are
practised, are born in Coat-Armour, as by these
Examples following may appear.</p>

He beareth Azure,
three pair of playing
Tables, Argent, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Or, pointed and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
within of the first,
by the Name of <hi>Pegress.</hi>
Recreations which are
honest are as necessary
for the mind, which is
imployed in great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
and cares of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
as meat is for the body which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
with daily labour; and therefore of all
men living, Statesmen and Students are to be
born with, if they are more addicted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
of their minds surcharged with medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
than other sorts of men. But the play
at Tables is not held so fitting for the Female
Sex, thereby they learn to bear a man more
than they should.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Azure, a
Fess between 3 Chess-Rooks,
Or, by the Name
of <hi>Bodenham;</hi> and was
born by that great lover
and promoter of Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Sir <hi>Wingfield Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham</hi>
Kt. It seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
these were at first
called Rooks, for being
the defence of all the
rest; and therefore they stand in the uttermost
corners of the Chess-board, as Frontier Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
This is a game of noble exercise for the
mind, as requiring much forecast and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
King <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour was
much addicted to this delight, and lost great
Lordships at this play. And indeed, were it
not too serious a recreation, and going beyond
the nature of Games, it might well beseem a
King; because therein are comprised all the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
of warr, or plots of Civil states.</p>

There is no successful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of Dicing, none
prosperous or fortunate,
but all ominous and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable:
for he that loseth is tormented; and
he that winneth is enticed and tolled on, until
he be entrapped or insnared in some wily or
dangerous plot.</p>
               <p>If a man play at dice, and depart a winner,
let him try his Fortunes again, he shall be sure
to lose. If a man win, his gains is wasted by
giving away here and there to standers by, and
to the Butlers box; but let him lose never so
much, there is none that will afford him one
jot of restitution.</p>
               <p>In this kind of play many men do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot
themselves, and commit such errours for
the loss of a little money, as otherwise they
would not for great sums be hired to do.</p>
               <p>In this Game all manner of vices, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those of covetousness and swearing do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate

many men observing the casual chance of the
Dice, out of a covetous desire of gain, and
not being rightly informed of the use of this
our mortal life, do with vehemency prosecute
their insatiable thirst and desire of gain, as if
that were the only scope whereto they ought
to direct all their actions of this life: whose
folly, or rather extream madness, is lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Book of <hi>Wisdome 15. 12. But they
counted our life a pastime, and our time here
a market for gain: For (say they) we must
be getting every way, though it be by evil
means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, the hazard of Dice-playing
(according to <hi>Petrarch</hi>) is an huge and insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
Gulf, a dreadful and sudden Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Patrimonies and Inheritances, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
of wind, a cloud of same, a spurr to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and the roadway to desperation: And
howsoever other recreations are sports, yet
this is nothing but meer grief and vexation of
mind.</p>

This is the Game
of Fortune, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's
Children. The
square, which always
falleth right howsoever it be cast, is the emblem
of Constancy; but the uncertainty of the Picks
is the very type of Inconstancy and Mutability.
He that lays his estate on the eyes of these
Dice, will leave a small estate for his own eyes
to look on.</p>
               <p>To this Chapter may be referred all other
Games; as the Racket, and that of <hi>Iacobus
Medices,</hi> General to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, whose
Device was a Ball with two Balloons, with this
word, <hi>Percussus Elevor, The harder I am

               <p>WHAT manifold variety of Coat-Armours
(consisting of things Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial)
is borrowed from the several
Dignities, Arts, and Exercises of men of civil
life and condition, the foregoing Tracts and
Examples have sufficiently declared. There
now remain such Artificials as are in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men of military profession, with which
we will shut up this whole Section of things Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial.
By things Military I understand all
such as do pertain to the use and exercise of
Martial Discipline and Service; whereof some
do serve for Order, some for Execution of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Of the first kind are those things which
are for direction in Marchings, Encampings,
Arisings, Assaults, Retreats, &amp;c. and such are
the Banner-Royal, the Standard, Guidon, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
Cornet, &amp;c. For albeit it be true, that
<hi>Leges silent inter Arma,</hi> Laws cannot be heard
amongst clashing of Weapons; yet without
certain Laws of Discipline and Order it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any Martial attempt to be success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And therefore this is reckoned as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s
highest glory, that being Captain of an
Army consisting of men of so sundry Nations
and Conditions, he notwithstanding kept them
all under quiet Discipline; the want whereof
hath commonly been the cause, when any great
design hath proved unprosperous.</p>
               <p>The valiant <hi>Zisca</hi> being stark blind, yet sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the midst of his Army, whiles they
were in any pitched Field with the Enemies,
gave such directions upon all occasions, as
that his Army was ever Victorious. And <hi>Caesar</hi>
was in this kind so fortunate, that he fought
fifty pitched Fields with honour, wherein he
alone surpassed the valorous <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi>
who is said to have been forty times save one
in the Field. And requisite is it in matters of
so high nature, as are decided by wars, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
care both in directing and obeying,
should be observed; because it hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that the neglect or mistaking of some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>one
small Circumstance hath been the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of whole Armies, and all the States
thereon depending.</p>
               <p>And since we are about to treat of such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials
as are in use amongst men of Military
profession, I hold it not impertinent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
a little of Military Laws, and some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
concerning Battels and Armies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with such Military Laws and Discipline
as were divulged to the Israelites, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the second month of the second year,
after their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The all-powerful and most provident God
and wise disposer of all things, having made
special choice of a people selected out of all
the Nations of the world for his own peculiar
service, and minding to exercise them under
many afflictions, to prove what was in their
hearts (to the end they might have a feeling
sense of his Almighty presence, and ready de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
at all seasons out of all their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that so he might humble them, and
make them meet for himself) he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
lead them into the Land of Promise, so
soon as he had brought them out of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
servitude; but led them to and fro in the
Wilderness by the space of forty years, keeping
them in continual exercise, to prove their faith,
and to bring them out of liking with this world,
and to learn them to depend wholly upon his
Divine Providence, and in all their necessities
to rest solely upon him, and to seek their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and relief from him only.</p>
               <p>This most gracious God, having a tender
care of these his people, and foreseeing in his
Divine Providence how needful discipline was
for the ordering and conducting of so huge and
populous a multitude, in a passage so long, and
withal so full of perils; and knowing that all
Civil Discipline consisted in commanding and
obeying, prescribeth to his servant <hi>Moses</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
form of government, whereby he might
contain them in their several Offices and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, he commanded</hi> Moses <hi>to number the
Israelites, saying,</hi> Take ye the sum of all the
Congregation of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Num.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then having given</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
directions for the marshalling and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Numb. 2. 2. Every man of the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

               <p>Here have we in this second Chapter of
<hi>Numbers</hi> an uncontrollable warrant pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the mouth of Almighty God for the
use of two sorts of Ensigns, the one general,
being in number four, only ordained for the
leading and direction of the four Regiments
(as I may so call them.) And the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
serving for the demonstration of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
families, and for the distinguishing of the
particular persons of each family, for the more
commodious distributing of them into bands;
a thing most behoveful for the bestowing and
conducting of so huge a multitude, considering
how many thousand of persons were comprised
in and under every of the above-named Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
So as it is most clear, that these are no
less requisite (in their kind) than the former
in theirs, for the more orderly and effectual
managing of this military expedition of so
long a continuance, and withal subjected to
infinite dangers.</p>
               <p>As touching the tokens or sings used in the
general Standards, we have shewed what they
were after the opinion of <hi>Martinus Borhaus</hi>
(who differeth from <hi>Speed:</hi>) his very words you
may read in the first Chapter and first Section
of this Book.</p>
               <p>But since here is mention made of signs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to particular families and persons, it
may perhaps be questioned what these signs
were. Whereto I answer, That they must of
necessity be <hi>signa existentium in rerum natura,</hi>
because there cannot be a representation of
things that are not. If then they consisted of
the similitude of the things in Essence, or being;
no doubt they were such, as not only the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller
sort, but the vulgar also (through frequent
use and custome) did well know by their daily
fight and use of them: as being the express
pourtraitures either of Celestial Bodies, as of
the Sun, Moon, Stars, &amp;c. or of things Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunar,
as Meteors fiery, Meteors watery, whereof
we have before spoken in their due places: Or
else of Vegetables, as Trees, Shrubs, Plants,
Fruits, Herbs, Flowers, &amp;c. Or else they were
resemblances of sensitive Creatures; as of Man,
Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Reptiles: Or else of
Instruments, or Tools of familiar use in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Mechanical Trades, pertaining to life
Civil or Rustick. Which in respect of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ordinary use were best known to men,
and therefore served most fitly for notes or
marks or precise differencing of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
family and person from other.</p>
               <p>When a King or Prince do enter the field to
give battel to their enemies, it behoveth that
he be strongly fenced of the Army, both before
and behind; and that he have his being near
the great Standard, in the heart of the battel,
for the more safety of his person, and that he
may the better give directions upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the whole Army, as the necessity of the
service shall require.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very dangerous for a King,
Prince, or other General, or whatsoever other
their great Commander, to be over-forward or
venturous to encounter his enemy in battel in his
own person: It sufficeth such to command, and
to give direction, and never to hazard their
persons in battel. But if he must needs put
his person upon the jeopardy of the uncertain
and dangerous events of a battel, it behoveth
that he deferr the same to the last conflict; for
that upon the safety of his person dependeth
the hopeful good success of the battel, and the
safety of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>Besides, so long as the chief Commander is
in life and safety, albeit he be foiled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited;
yet may he repair his Forces, and
subdue him by whom he was foiled: but his
person being either slain or surprized, there is
no hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>Upon the first display of the Banner of a
King or Prince, or of their General or chief
Commander, it behoveth that some discreet
and ancient Counsellor should make known
publickly the cause, why those wars were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
to the intent the same may be known
to be grounded upon lawful cause; and that the
King or Prince doth not rashly attempt the
same, but that he doth it in a lawful quarrel, and
upon just cause.</p>
               <p>Which done, then should he command the
chief Herald to unroll and display the said Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and deliver it to him that is appointed to
bear the same (who before he take the same
must receive the order of Knighthood, if he be
not before Knighted) with a strict charge and
command to hold the same fast, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the honour thereof, even with the extream
hazard of his life, and thereupon to advance
the same in the Name of God, the sole Author
and Giver of all Victory.</p>
               <p>Like as the Laws of Civil Magistracy and
Government were ordained by God: so also
were Military Laws and Ordinances grounded
upon his express Commandment, uttered by
the mouth of the Prophets and Priests; as you
may see particularly, for the exhortation of
Priests, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 1, 2. and of other Officers,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 5. and <hi>Iud.</hi> 7. 3. besides Military
Laws for fight, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 21. that the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Peace</hi> must be offered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 11, 12.
&amp;c. for <hi>Spoil,</hi> 20. 19. and the division thereof,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55096:127"/>
1 <hi>Sam. 30. 26, &amp;c. 1 Chron. 26. 27. Iosh. 22.
8. 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 15. for <hi>Victory;</hi> that it is the
duty of Captains and their Armies (after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
obtained) to ascribe the whole glory
thereof to God, and with one heart and one
voice to magnifie his most glorious Majesty by
the example of <hi>Iudas Maccabeus, Thus they
went home and sung Psalms, and praised the
Lord in heaven, for he is gracious, and his
mercy endureth for ever, 1 Maccab.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>The skilful managing of Military Affairs is a
kind of Art; neither doth the publick profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the name of a Souldier, nor yet his lofty
countenance or change of habit forthwith make
a man a Souldier, it is a matter of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
and of no less secrecy; for a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to be confident in that he undertaketh, and
to wage battel with an assured hope of Victory,
and to retire himself and his Forces (if the
necessity of the cause so require) without fear
of reproach or danger. For as the common
Proverb saith, <hi>A more valorous man is he that
wisely flieth, than he that foolishly exposeth
himself to adventure and hazard; Periti e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
bellatoris est non minus scire fugiendi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
quam pugnandi:</hi> for it is a matter of no
great difficulty to draw men on to fight; but if
the Captain in his providence, whilst they be
in action, shall discover some unexpected dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
or damage that may befall him and
his Band, and can wisely retire himself with
honour and with safety of his Souldiers, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself both valorous in his encounter, and
wise in his retreat.</p>
               <p>The greatest Victories have not been gotten
by handy-strokes always; but many times for
safeguard of the effusion of blood, either the
one part, or the other, devised some witty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
sudden policy or stratagem, to astonish
the adverse part, that so they might suddenly
slaughter them, or put them to shameful
flight. Large is the field of stratagems which
every Commander hath by particular inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither hath there been more Victories or
Trophies gained by any one means than by
these Stratagems. Whatsoever cometh beyond
expectation maketh a disturbance or amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Enemy: but it must be wrought
with this caution, that it be no disturbance to
our selves.</p>
               <p>Neither is every slight invention fit to be put
in practice, but such only as have foresight and
circumspection annexed to them. He must be
<hi>Argus</hi> that is a General or chief Commander;
he must be eyed behind, before, in his head,
in his feet; and then shall all things be easily
disposed according to order, and take good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
when orderly distribution, and providence,
and premeditation, have made way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>It is not the length of a man's age, or the
number of years, that yieldeth the art or skill
of managing Military Affairs; but a continual
meditation how he may encounter all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and put them in exercise and practice:
For if a man receive never so many stipends,
yet is the unexercised man still but a freshwater
Souldier notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>There were in former Ages two sorts of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or discharge from Military Service; the
one named <hi>ignominiosa,</hi> that is to say, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
or infamous: as when a Souldier for
some notorious crime was discharged from his
service, and disgracefully put out of pay and
place, as for slothfulness, cowardize, forsaking
of his Captain, or such like; then he was by
the Tribune dismissed of his place, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the mark of infamy and reproach, if
he were so by the Tribune discharged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his Military Ornaments.</p>
               <p>The other was called <hi>Causaria missio,</hi> as much
to say as an occasional dismission or discharge,
grounded upon good and lawful considerations:
as when in regard of debility, by reason of
age or sickness, wounds or other infirmities pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
a man, he was licenced to depart to his
home; and those that were thus dismissed, did
most commonly dedicate their Shields, Swords,
and Armour, <hi>Laribus suis,</hi> to their Houshold
Gods, as the Heathen termed them, by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up upon the walls in some chief or
special place or room of their House, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of their service performed in defence of
their Friends and Countrey.</p>
               <p>Martial men are evermore in peril and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of life, in regard of their light esteem of
the manifold varieties, casualties, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
events of wars, whereunto they do ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
expose themselves: for Fortune thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
not her perils more abundantly upon any
sort of men, than upon those that set her at
naught; such are high spirited and valorous
men. And not without cause; for as others
do labour to shelter themselves from danger,
and do shun the violence thereof; these contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
do lay open themselves to the utmost
hazard that may befall them.</p>
               <p>Call to mind the fore-passed Ages, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them to the point, and you shall find that
the valiantest men (for the most part) have
been swallowed up with a violent death. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
doth oftentimes make men to swell with
pride, and to insult over others, and provoke
them to their own destruction, as we may see
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 8. where <hi>Amaziah</hi> summoned the
son of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> to single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
saying, <hi>Come let us look one another in
the face.</hi> Who answered him, <hi>Because thou
hast smitten</hi> Edom, <hi>and thine heart hath lifted
thee up; glory of this and tarry at home: for
why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou
shouldest fall, even thou and</hi> Judah <hi>with
thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men are of opinion, that such as are
vanquished in battel ought not to be captivated
to such as had subdued them, unless the wars
were just and lawful, as Dr. <hi>Casius</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
But <hi>Borreus</hi> holdeh, that albeit the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55096:128"/>
ground or cause of the wars that are underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
be unjust; yet it is not simply unjust that
such as are vanquished in battel, should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
under the power of the Vanquisher; <hi>Quia
Legislatoris intentio est, ut virtus vincentis sic
honoretur;</hi> the purpose of the Law-maker was
that the valour of the Vanquisher should be so
rewarded. Besides, it is no ignominious thing
for a man to be subdued by a man accounted of
valour, according to that saying, <hi>Non tam
turpe est vinci, quam contendisse gloriosum;</hi>
It is not reckoned a matter so reproachful to
be subdued, as it is honourable to have coped
with a magnanimous and valiant man.</p>
               <p>Many men are remunerated for the vertues
that are found in them, or for the external to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of vertue that are observed in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
carriage. Hereupon is that Law ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Quod capti bello victoribus subserviant;</hi> not
for that the Conquerours are always the better
men, but in regard that in them the signs and
tokens of vertue and valour are more apparent
than in those that are subdued.</p>
               <p>It is a just dominion or superiority, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the order of Nature, that the more
powerful should predominate over the weaker
fort. And the Laws do seem to approve the
same, <hi>Cum velint victum captum in bello vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoris
servum fieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Law of perpetuity (<hi>saith</hi> Zenophon)
observed amongst men, that when a Town or
City that held out the Assailants is surprised,
whatsoever is found therein is due to them that
took the same, as well the persons as their
whole substance; <hi>whose opinion herein</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
<hi>followeth,</hi> Polit. 40. <hi>And St.</hi> Ambrose
lib. 1. de Patriarch. <hi>writeth,</hi> That the prey of
the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> was in like sort in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Abraham</hi> that conquered him.</p>
               <p>This custome hath been also observed, That
to ask leave to bury the slain in the time of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
hostility, and whilst men are in Arms in
the Field, or depart the Field after Battel, is
a kind of yielding of victory: for it beseemeth
not them that won the Battel to seek any thing
of the enemy by way of intreaty. Like as
also the unwillingness to joyn Battel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or delay of Battel was taken for a
yielding of Victory.</p>
               <p>And now we will begin with Examples of
bearing such things in Coat-Armour, whereby
Martial Discipline and Order, which we have
now discoursed of, are preserved; whereof
some are for shew, other for sound.</p>

               <p>Very behoveful are these Ensigns for every
particular Band of Foot and Troop of Horse,
to the end they may know whither to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in expectance of the command of their
Captain for the performance of all occasions;
and that they may by them be directed after
any conflict or skirmish, whither to retire
themselves without danger: they also serve for
the manifest distinguishing of Bands and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.
And by these they are all directed in
their Services, as a Ship is guided through the
forcible and violent surges of the Seas, by the
benefit of her Helm and a skilful Pilot guiding
the same.</p>

were of divers shapes: the Eagle fixed on the
top of a Pike or Pole was the chief; but that
they had Penons or Flags also, appeareth by
<hi>Lazius,</hi> who saith they were called <hi>vexilla,

wherewith Martial men do oftentimes adorn
their Spears and Launces, which albeit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they be things of no moment; yet do
they very often (like as also Banners do) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish
the Enemy through their continual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
forasmuch as they are evermore wafting
and wavering in the wind, whereby they do so
occupy the enemies eye, as that it breedeth a
terrour in the mind of their foes, through a
conceived opinion, that those that come against
them (being all Troops of Horsemen that use
this kind of Spear) are of a farr greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
than indeed they are, as <hi>Wyrley</hi> in his said
Book noteth, saying,

               <p>These foresaid Instruments serve for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on and order to the eye, and by shew. To these
Ensigns thus born in the Field in time of Battel
either expected or acted, we may add this
known Ensign of premonstration of eminent
hostile invasion, which is the fired Becacon,
which giveth a sudden warning of instant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
attempt or invasion of Enemies, the
notice whereof giveth occasion of the firing of
the Beacon: whereupon a Gentleman of good
reputation chose to bear for his Impress, upon
a Mount a Beacon fired, with this Motto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Sic periisse juvat;</hi> meaning to die for his
Countries safety was his desire. The bearing
in Arms of three of these fired Beacons appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

He beareth Sable, 3
Beacons fired, Or, the
flames proper, by the
Name of <hi>Dauntre.</hi> As
touching the name of
Beacons, it seemeth to be
a <hi>Saxon</hi> word, derived
fron the <hi>Saxon</hi> word
<hi>Becuian,</hi> which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to call by sign or to
beckon, as we use the word at this day, and
thereof are they called Beacons. Before the
time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, they were
made of great stacks of wood; but about the
eleventh year of his reign, he ordained that
there should be in <hi>Kent</hi> high Standards with
their Pitch-pans on the top of them. <hi>Lambert</hi>'s
<hi>Perambulation of Kent, pag.</hi> 69. Now I will
present to your view some Examples of the
bearing in Coat-Armour such Military Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which direct more distinctly by sound.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Gules, a
Drum in Fess between
three Drum-sticks e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
Argent. The
Drum is of frequent use
(with divers Nations)
in the Field. The <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
for this purpose
have great Kettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drums,
hollow within,
and about them they do
hang little Bells and Copper-rings, all which
sounding together, do make a noise much like
a dead sound mingled with the braying and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of a wild Beast. This Instrument as it
serves for direction, so likewise is it of use in
drowning the fearful cries of wounded and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, lest that ghastly noise should daunt
the hearts of the Souldiers. <hi>Zisca</hi>
that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Captain of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> being sick
to death, willed his Souldiers to pluck off his
skin, and to make a Drum of it, assuring them
that when their Enemies should hear the sound
of it, they would flie before their face.</p>
               <p>There is manifold uses of the Drum, Fife,
Trumpet, and other Musical Instruments used
in Martial Affairs, inasmuch as they serve not
only for the direction of Companies &amp; Troops,
but also of the whole Army in their Marchings,
Encampings, Risings, Assaults, Retreats, &amp;c.
but also to dead and drown the cries of the
maimed and wounded, and to stir up valour and
courage in the Souldiers to the fierce encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and assaulting of the Enemy: and for
these ends was the use of them ordained in
wars, to which purpose do these Instruments
much avil, <hi>Sonus enim cornuum &amp; tubarum
(in praeliis) magnum vim habet ad spiritus,
&amp; sanguinem evocandum.</hi> For it is not with
men as it is with beasts, which can stir up cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in themselves, as I have before shewed:
For men in respect of fear and faint courage,
are hardly provoked to fight, therefore had
they need to be drawn on and provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>

He beareth Argent,
a Cheveron engrailed
between three Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
Sable, by the
Name of <hi>Thunder.</hi> This
Coat-Armour standeth
in a Glass-window in St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheda</hi>
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> God
himself vouchsafed to
give direction to <hi>Moses</hi>
for the making of this kind of Instrument, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Make thee two Trumpets of silver, of an
whole piece shalt thou make them, that thou
mayest use them for the Assembly of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and for the departure of the Camp,
Numb.</hi> 10. 12. and <hi>ibid. 14. But if ye blow
an Alarm, then the Camp of them that pitch
on the East part shall go forward,</hi> Ibid. 15.
<hi>If ye blow an Alarm the second time, then
the hoste of them that lie on the South side
shall march; for they shall blow an Alarm
when they remove.</hi> So that the sound of the
Trumpet is but as the loud and far-reaching
voice of the General: and though the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
fight not, yet it doth more than many
others, because it encourageth them to the
fight.</p>

Governour of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Groom of the Stool,
first Gentleman of his Majesties Bedchamber,
and one of his Majesties most Honourable Privy
Council, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These Clarions are sometimes described
Rests: but whether they be understood to be
the Rudder, or from the Name to be a thing
whereon to rest their Launces, I know not; but
am rather induced to believe them to be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
used in Battel and Tournaments, as we
do Trumpets: For I find <hi>Robert Consul</hi>'s Coat,
base Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the first, blazoned Clarions
of these very colours: And in many old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of Tilting, we find the Knights to
come in with Clarions sounding before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Azure,
three Fluits in Bend,
Argent. This Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seemeth to have
been invented, for the
quiet settling and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the Souldiers
minds before the fight.
And some such did the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> use, who
(saith <hi>Plutarch)</hi> being
ready to joyn Battel, did first Sacrifice, and
then all adorned with Garlands sung a Martial
Song, their King marching with the whole
Army in admirable quiet and composed order.
But the <hi>Sybarites</hi> were not so happy in the use
of such musick; for themselves being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
given to wantonness and pleasure, all their
Gentry taught their Horses to dance at the
sound of Musical Instruments; which their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
having notice of, being then in the
Field and ready to joyn, they commanded a
noise of Musick in the Front of the Army to
sound, whereupon the <hi>Sybarites</hi> Horses fell
all a dancing, and overthrew their Riders,
whereby their Enemies departed Conquerours.
And thus much for Instruments of Military Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

               <p>THE next are such things as serve for
execution of order, which is the final
end for which Military Profession is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
<hi>viz.</hi> propulsation, or revenge of
wrong, or for foiling the wrong-doer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to give satisfaction to the party grieved.
And as in the Law Politick, so in this Law Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
Execution is reckoned the soul thereof.
To the accomplishment of execution of order,
sundry sorts of weapons are requisite: some
invasive or offensive, others defensive; the one
to protect our selves, the other to impeach our
foes. And of these invasives will we speak in
the first place; beginning with those which we
call <hi>Missilia,</hi> such as are cast or forced by
strength of hand, or slight of Engine: and after
we will come to such as are manual, or managed
with the hand.</p>

He beareth Argent,
a Culvering dismounted
in Fess, Sable, by the
Name of <hi>Leigh.</hi> Before
the invention of Guns,
many sorts of weapons,
as well invasive as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
were devised,
which (saith <hi>Munster</hi>)
by the space of every
hundred years have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
alteration twice or thrice, like as also
the Armour wherewith our bodies are covered
and fenced. But one saith that it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
himself, who invented this hellish Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for confusion of mankind. Indeed it
was a Monk who first invented Gun-powder.
And I have read, that the first founder of these
huge great Peeces was himself slain with the
breaking of one of them. A certain Captain
was wont to call the mouth of the great Gun
Hell-mouth; and said, that he who trembled
not when one of them thundred, did fear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God nor the Devil.</p>
               <p>There are divers sorts of these kind of Guns,
but I shall only shew you an Example of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of one other sort of them called Chambers;
of which you may here see three born with
an interposition of one Ordinary surmounted of
another between them.</p>

               <p>Whether the invention hereof were behove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

three murthering Chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shots,

it is thought to be an
augmentation. Some
have taken these to be

to be some murdering Chain-shot. <hi>Amadaeus</hi>

use to draw water
withal, and therefore
we call it a <hi>Swepe</hi> as
they do. With this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they used in ancient time to throw great
stones into the Towns and Fortifications of the
Enemy. Some such Instrument did <hi>Vzziah</hi>
King of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> use among many others for
the defence of the City against the assaults of
the <hi>Philistims,</hi> as appeareth where it is said,
<hi>And he made very Artificial Engins in</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,

               <p>This Coat is also born by his Lordships Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

any City or Hold with purpose to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
them. Such an Engine (amongst divers
others) did <hi>Titus Vespatianus</hi> erect against the
City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which were by <hi>Iosephus</hi>
and his Associates consumed with fire. Such
is the force of this Engine, as that there is no
Tower so strong, or Circuit of a Citie so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
but if that they resist the first brunt
thereof, through often use they will be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>

This Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Military (saith <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi>)
was first devised
by the <hi>Cretians.</hi> And in
former Ages was called
in Latin <hi>Scorpio;</hi> and

He beareth Ermyn,
three long Bows bent in

<hi>Arcus, ab arcendo,</hi>
of keeping the Enemy
aloof, and not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to approach
near to us, by darting (as
it were) out of the Arrows, whereby we do
gall, wound or kill them afar off. This is a
Military Instrument of the Missile sort, and that
not of the meanest rank, if we considerately
peruse the Histories of former Ages; for we
shall find more Set-battels fought, and famous
Victories atchieved by English men with Bows
and Arrows, than any Nation of Christendom
hath obtained by any one Instrument whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
without exception. But this weapon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
sufficeth not of it self to perform any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Baronet, and <hi>Edward Hales</hi> of <hi>Chilstone</hi> in
<hi>Bocton-Malherb,</hi> Esq.</p>
               <p>The Arrow is called in Latin <hi>Sagitta</hi> (as
some do conceit it) <hi>quasi satis ictus,</hi> for that
it annoyeth and galleth the Enemy farr enough
off, so as he cannot approach the Archer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage
him, because by the smart delivery
of the Bow the Enemy is put to hazard a
great way off: others would have it called (and
not unaptly) <hi>quod sagax sit ictus ejus,</hi> for that
the same being directed by the hand of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and skilful Archer doth cleave the pinn or
mark oftentimes in two, though the same be
but of a small scantling.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Arrow is reckoned one of the number

Deut. 32. 42. I will make mine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
drunk with blood (and my sword shall
eat flesh) with the blood of the slain and of the
Captains, when I begin to take vengeance of the
Enemy.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find both these Martial
weapons born together in one Escocheon, as in

This Coat standeth in
<hi>Kirton</hi> Church in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire.</hi>
This sort of
bearing may signifie a
man resolved to abide the uttermost hazard of
Battel, and to that end hath furnished himself
to the full, as well with Instruments of Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as also of retention. The Bow and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in former Ages have won more glory to
this Kingdom than any other sort of Souldiery
whatsoever, as the renowned Victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in <hi>France</hi> do well testifie. There is yet
another form of bearing of Arrows diverse
from these, as in Example.</p>

This Coat was quartered
by <hi>Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Hollyrood
Ampuey</hi> in the County
of <hi>Glocester.</hi> It was a
custome amongst the
<hi>Persians,</hi> when they went to warfare, every
man to cast an Arrow into a Chest ordained
for that purpose, and placed before the Throne
of their King: and at their return every one
to take his own shaft, that so by the number
of the Arrows remaining, the number of the
deceased might be certainly known.</p>

               <p>The Pheon is the head of an Instrument of
the Missile sort, which we call a Dart, the
same being a long and light staff headed after
this manner, and having a thong fastened to
the middest thereof, for the more sleighty and
strong forcing the same against the Enemy to
keep or annoy him afar off. This is called in
Latin <hi>Iaculum, quia è longinquo jaciatur;</hi> it
pierceth speedily, and maketh a large wound,
by reason of the wide-spreading barbs thereof.
The bearing of Pheons is both ancient and
commendable.</p>

thereby, that because his Sword was short,

               <p>As touching the invention of Swords, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore
Virg.</hi> saith their use was found out by the
<hi>Lacedemonian.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> in their Saturna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Feasts, amongst other Exercises used the
game of Sword-playing, to the end that in time
of Peace they being accustomed to behold
Fighting, Wounds, and Swords, might be the
less discouraged, when they see the feats of
Arms in the Field against the Enemy; and
therefore the Chiestain or General of the Hoste
was to exhibit to the people a game of Fence or
Sword-playing.</p>

The Field is Gules, a
Cross between four
Swords, Argent, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
and Hilts, Or. This
Coat was given to Sir
<hi>Iohn Philipot</hi> Kt. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Lord Maior of
<hi>London</hi> (and used with
his ancient Arms, which
are Sable, a Bend, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn)
for a Coat of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.
For this Sir <hi>Iohn Philipott</hi> at his
own charges set forth a Fleet of Ships in the
Year 1378. (which was in the second year of
King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second) and scoured the
Seas, at that time so forely infested with Pirats,
that the Merchants Ships could not traffick in
safety. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia</hi> sets
forth, <hi>That he like a good Patriot of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
surprized</hi> John Mercer <hi>a Scottish Rover,
and all the Robble of his Adherents, besides
fifteen Sail of Spanish Ships richly freighted
with Merchandize, which they had taken as
prize, whereof he made no other use bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to
give supply to his Sovereign; for he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one thousand men in the Kings wars in</hi>
France, <hi>and performed many pious and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
works in his life time, and ordained many
more by his last Will extant in the Registers of</hi>
Hoysting, London. King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second
rewarded his good Service with a grant of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds of yearly Revenue of Land escheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Crown, yet in the possession of Sir
<hi>Iohn Philipott</hi> his next Heir in <hi>Philpott-Lane</hi>
in <hi>London;</hi> and made him Knight in <hi>Smithfield,</hi>
when he rewarded Sir <hi>William Walworth</hi>
Maior of <hi>London</hi> with that Order at the same
time, when he vanquished that arch Rebel of
<hi>Kent, Wat Tyler.</hi> He builded a fair Chappel at
his Mannor of <hi>Granch</hi> in <hi>Gillingham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi>
which Mannor is a Member of the Cinque
Ports, which he bequeathed to his second Son,
from whom descended Captain <hi>Thomas Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pott,</hi>
that valiantly maintained a Challenge in
the <hi>Low Countries</hi> against Captain <hi>Debee</hi> that
had wickedly depraved our late Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and slew the said <hi>Debee</hi> in the single
Combat. And from another Son of Sir <hi>Iohn
Philipott</hi> is descended Captain <hi>Thomas Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pott</hi>
of <hi>Apston-Hall</hi> in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> not farr
from <hi>Woodhall Philipotts,</hi> the ancient Seat of
this Family, who by following the wars in
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days at an expensive rate,
was constrained to alienate those Lands. Sir
<hi>Iohn Philipott,</hi> now one of the Justices of the
<hi>Common Pleas</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but born in <hi>Kent,</hi>
is branched from those of <hi>Gillingham</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
I have seen some Evidences which do
perswade me to believe that the Lands now
belonging to Sir <hi>Iohn Philipott,</hi> the chief of
this House at <hi>Stepney</hi> nigh <hi>London,</hi> came to
his Ancestors by marriage with the sister of
<hi>Thomas Becket</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
The Swords are the truest Emblems of Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Honour, and should incite the Bearers to a
just and generous pursuit of Honour and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in War-like ways, especially when they
intend the defence of the Christian Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
sufficiently in the Cross, as here in this
Coat. Much might be spoken here of the
bearing of the Sword, it being an Emblem of
Government and Justice, and born before the
King, God's Lieutenant; and in other places
to honour Lieutenants to the King's Majesty:
But of a bearing so apt to be displaied I need say
no more.</p>

and is now born by
<hi>William Tatton</hi> of <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenshaw,</hi>
Esq. The
old Britains our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
were wont to wear
a short and broad Sword; so did the <hi>Spartans</hi>
also, whom, when one of their Enemies moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for so curted a Weapon, it was replied,
<hi>That it was not so short, but it could reach

It was a custom amongst
the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they
did undertake any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
wars, after denial of
restitution demanded of
things unlawfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or satisfaction for
wrongs offered, that the King of Arms (to
whom the denouncing of Battel and Defiance
did properly appertain) should amongst other
Ceremonies, throw a Spear headed with Iron,
imbrued with blood, and scorched with fire,
into the Soil of that people against whom such
warr was denounced; to notifie unto them, that
they would severely prosecute them with
fire and force for the wrong by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

He beareth barrey of

two Launces in Saltire,

Keeper of the Store of

of those in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as of these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

He beareth Argent,

It was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Romans</hi> to
bestow Spears upon the
valiant and well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Souldiers in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their acceptable
service performed. To
this end and purpose (as <hi>Festus Pompeius</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth)
because the Spear is the perfection of
Martial Affairs and Imperial Jurisdiction: and
for that it was a custome to make sale of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
under the same; as also to make them,
and such Souldiers as had transgressed the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Discipline (whereupon they were disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Military Belt, and received the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious
name of <hi>Discincti</hi>) to pass the
yoke; the first, for that they were brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
subjection by force; the other, for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of the Laws Military.</p>
               <p>This yoke consisteth of three Spears, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
two were pitched upright, and the third
was bound cross-ways to them both; under this
yoke were both enforced to pass, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
might be the greater.</p>
               <p>Before a man shall go about to buckle with
his enemies, it behoveth that the Army be
fully furnished, and provided with all sorts of
Military Provisions both defensive and offensive,
by the example of <hi>Vzziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah;</hi> of
whom it is said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uzziah</hi> had also an hoste of fighting men that
went out to warr by bands according to the
count of their number under the hand of <hi>Jeiel,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Uzziah</hi> prepared them throughout all

This Coat-Armour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

great charge and care in

to the opinion of some Authors beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth
a dexterity and nimbleness of wit to
penetrate and understand matters of highest
consequence.</p>
               <p>As concerning the quantity or weight of
Spears heads, we find them in all Ages answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the strength of the persons that were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55096:132"/>
to manage them: So we read that the Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of <hi>Golias,</hi> that encountred with <hi>David,</hi>
weighed six hundred shekels of Iron, which was
correspondent to his Spear, that was resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for bigness to a Weaver's beam; as also
to the hugeness of his stature, which was six
<hi>Cubits and a hands breadth, 1 Sam,</hi> 17. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we read of <hi>Ishhibenob</hi> the son of <hi>Haraphah</hi>
(of the race of the Giants) <hi>whose head of his
spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass,
even he being girded with a new sword
thought to have slain</hi> David.</p>

He beareth Sable, a

Spears heads, Argent,
their points embrued,
proper, by the Name of
<hi>Morgan. Alexander</hi> the

to a Spear without
a strong head: for that
as the shaft of the Spear
could have little force without the head,
though it be much larger than it; so the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Army can little avail without the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidance
of a valiant Leader.</p>
               <p>Now I shall, I hope, without any great
breach of Method, demonstrate the bearing
in Armory of some part of a Tilt-spear or
Tilt-stave, call it which you please: which
kind of weapon or instrument, although it be
not of any use in the wars; yet the well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging
thereof maketh a man the more expert
for Military Service on Horsback, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may challenge to be ranked among Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
weapons managed with the hand.</p>

He beareth Sable, a

three Cronels of
a Tilt-spear, Argent, by
the Name of <hi>Wiseman.</hi>
These Cronels or Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
(for I find them
called by both these
names) are the Iron
heads of Tilt-spears, or
Tilt-staves, which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
have six or eight Mourns (for so are those
little piked things called which are on the top
or head of this Cronel or Coronet) three of
which appear in each of these, the other
three which are not here seen, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by the Art of Cutting or painting.
Some have termed, or rather mistermed these
Cronels, Burrs; for the confutation of which
Errour, I have caused the true Figure of a Tilt-staff
or Tilt-spear to be here presented unto
your view without the Vamplet.</p>

This Vamplet demonstrated by the Letter

which is the School of Chivalry and Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
without the knowledge whereof the
Horseman in the wars can do little good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>Tilting is called <hi>Hippomachia</hi> from the Greek

<hi>Ludus Trojae;</hi> for <hi>Troy</hi> was the place where it

               <p>Divers Statutes and Ordinances have been
made by the Commandments of former Kings
of this Realm concerning Royal Justs and Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
within this Kingdom, which do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prove their former use to have been more

which none are to be admitted as Actors by the
ancient Ordinances, but such as are well known
unto the King of Arms of that Province where
it is to be performed, to be Gentlemen of

gave him a Shield, and
therewithal used these
words, <hi>Fili aut hunc,
aut super hunc.</hi> Thereby admonishing him
briefly so to bear himself in battel, that either
he should return with Victory, bringing his
Shield with him, or should valiantly die, and
so be brought home dead upon the same.
Touching signs in ancient times depicted upon
Shields, <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath these words; <hi>Ne Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
aliquando in tumultu praelij à contuberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus
aberrarent, diversis cohortibus diversa
in scutis signa pingebant, quae ipsi nominabant
digmata, sicut etiam nunc moris est: Praeterea
in adverso scuto uniuscujusque Militis literis
erat nomen adscriptum, addito ex qua esset co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte,
quave Centuria.</hi> These Shields are
meerly for defence.</p>
               <p>Touching the variety of Shields or defensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
weapons and their uses, we read that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Captains or Leaders had their light
harnessed Souldiers on foot, armed only with
Sword and Target, and were called <hi>Rorarij;</hi>
whose Office was with a light skirmish to give
the first onset on the enemy, to see if they
could force them to remove their first station,
and so make way for the Horsmen, <hi>sicut Ros
ante gelu, as the dew or moist goeth before
the frost, Alex. gen. dierum. lib. 6. pag.</hi> 369.</p>
               <p>This sort of Souldiers were highly rewarded
of Kings, in regard of their bold adventure in
bearing the first brunt of the battel. Of these
some were called <hi>Peltati,</hi> because they were
armed with a kind of Shield or Target like to
a Half-moon; some <hi>Cetrati,</hi> for that they were
armed with light Targets or Bucklers after the
<hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Africk</hi> fashion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us Marius</hi> did prohibit his Souldiers the
bearing of sleight and small Targets, in regard
of their unserviceable use.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Romulus</hi> had made a League with
<hi>Tatius</hi> King of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside the <hi>Graecian</hi> Shield (which formerly
they used) assumed the <hi>Sabine</hi> Shield; and
<hi>Romulus</hi> did interchange Armours with the
<hi>Sabines,</hi> and continued the use of them It is
a thing that hath been of some men holden for
an infallible observation, that all Nations do
change (if not the form of Martial Discipline)
their Military weapons at the least, once in the
space of an hundred years upon some one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or other.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Germans</hi> it was holden a thing
so ignominious for a man to lose his Shield
in fight, as nothing could be more reproachful;
insomuch as he that was found culpable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was excluded from all Sacred Rites and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councils; yea, so odious was it holden
amongst them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>at many (having escaped
the battel) were branded with this publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and being unable to sustain so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
have hanged themselves.</p>
               <p>Amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> it was in use oftentimes
to lay their Children new born in Shields in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Cradles; because they held it a presage
of future fortitude and valour in the Child.
So we read that <hi>Hercules,</hi> who exceeded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that Age in Fortitude, was rocked in a
Shield.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> skirmishing with
his Enemy, and having his Sword drawn,
and spying some advantage thereto, was
minded to have run him through therewith
instantly: the sign of retreat was given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he forbare; and being demanded why he
slew not his Enemy when it was in his power;
he answered, <hi>Melius est parere Imperatori,
quam hostem occidere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as touching the Shield, we read
that it was usual to hang them up in Churches
instead of Epitaphs, as is the use here amongst
us at this day, though not to that end, as is
gathered by the words of <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> in
the History of <hi>Chaudius Caesar,</hi> where he saith,
<hi>Claudium Principem l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Like as the Shield served in the battel for a
defence and safeguard of the body of Souldiers
against blows and wounds: even so in time of
peace, the same being hanged up, it did shield
and defend the owner against the malevolent
detractions of the envious sort, who do labour
to deprave mens best actions, they themselves
never endeavouring any that were laudable;
whereby they do verifie in themselves that

not only possess, but also beautifie the

mans particular Arms are expressed at this day,

of those that were
called <hi>Levis armaturae

Souldiers (whether
they were Horse or Foot) with the skins of
Bears; like as it was of the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi>
to cover their heads with Otters skins instead
of Helmets; and both of them to one end,
namely, that thereby they should seem to be
more terrible and ghastly in the sight of their
Enemies, and their Enemies eye being occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
in admiration of the strangeness of such
habits, they might be the less able to attend
their fight, and so (with more facility and less

The bearing of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
after these several

close bevered, and
other whiles with their

several intendments;
those of Action, and these of Cessation. So
much briefly of their diverse bearing, as for the

habit, may rather seem
to be a reward for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

may gather by the statue or image of <hi>Minerva,</hi>
whom the Poets do fain to be the Goddess of

Wisedom, and all good Arts and Sciences;
which statue is evermore found to be adorned
with an Helmet on her head, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to our understanding, not so much the
safegard and defence of the head from violence,
as also that the same is inwardly fraught with
wisedom, policy and reason, and is impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by force or guilefull practice. The head so
armed is securely fortified against invasions,
and prepared for answering of all Questions.
It well fitteth Martial men to discourse and sing
of Battels and Victories, of Armour, Horses,

he challenged him to fight with his Army, or
in single Combate: who answered, <hi>Not with
his Army.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Alphonsus</hi> assigned a
day and place for the purpose, and came at
the prefixed time; but the Duke failed. Such
is the Law of Arms in case of single Combat,
that the party defendant shall appoint the time

Swords: he made answer, That these were

expose himself to danger or to death, but may
not in any case leave his Religion, Prince, and
Country void of succour.</p>
               <p>Concerning the defensive furniture of mans
body we read, that anciently they were made
of linen cloth, of exceeding high proof.
Such was that much famoused linen Brigandine
of <hi>Amasis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereof every thread
consisted of 360 other threads, wherein were
pourtraied and set forth the forms and shapes
of manifold sorts of Animals (that he used to
prosecute in his accustomed exercise of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
in gold and divers coloured yarn. And
not only the furniture ordained for the safety
of mans body were made of linen in those
days; but also the furniture of the Horses (of
such as were called <hi>Cataphracti Equites</hi>) as
their Bardings and Caparisons, were also made
of linen artificially wrought with barrs of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
after the manner of feathers, and both of
them so curiously intermix'd and platted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as that (in fine) it becometh a defence of
impenetrable resistance against any sort of
weapons: which kind of furniture was in use
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only for the safeguard
of the Horses, but also for the safety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Cataphracti,</hi> or such as we
term men of Arms compleatly furnished Cap-a-pe
(as the French pharse is) to withstand and
sustain the shock or brunt of the Enemy,

               <p>These were those Souldiers strongly armed
in steel, called <hi>Cataphracti Equites,</hi> which I
lately spoke of: they were habited with Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
which were either Coats of Mail or of
Plate; and differed much from those that we
call <hi>Levis Armaturae Milites,</hi> in respect of
the ponderous we ght of their furniture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
both themselves and their Horses were the
better inabled to receive the shock and strong
encounter of their enemy. Whose Armour
were a Sallad or a Head-piece, their Shield,
Graves and Brigantines, all of Brass, their
Bassenets or Sculls, Spears and Swords, like
those in use with Foot-men. Such was the
force of these <hi>Cataphracti Milites</hi> (or as we
call them, men mounted upon barded Horses)
as that they were able to endure the brunt of
the Enemies, and did oftentimes repair the
Forces of the trembling and distrustful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

               <p>HAVING in the two former Chapters
handled Artificials Military, both inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and defensive, I think it not much
amiss now a little to treat of Trophies &amp; tokens
of Martial Victory, and to shew you some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of Rewards for Victory obtained, born
in Coat-Armour, since Victory and the hope
thereof sweetneth all those dangerous Travels
and intolerable Labours, which the brave Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
man joyfully runeth through, yea even to
the hazard of his life. <hi>Trophies</hi> (saith <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)
are spoils forced from the conquered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
all embrued with blood, and hanged up
as they were upon the next Tree that could be
found to fit that purpose; or else the conquering
Souldiers brought them home to their Houses,
where they hanged them up upon some Pole or
Tree called</hi> Gentilitia arbor, <hi>for a monument of
the encrease of Glory that they had atchieved
to the Family by their valour. The like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
(saith <hi>Wolf. Laz.) do we not only read
of in</hi> Thucydides; <hi>but my self have seen and
observed represented in ancient Coins, an Oak
having the limbs cut off, and upon the snaggs
thereof were hanged a German Cloak made of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55096:136"/>
Badgers skins (or such other like) called</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna
Germanica; <hi>two Shields, a Barbaria
Pipe, and a German Ensign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was also another sort of Trophie,
when a man had subdued his Enemies, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was to express the memory of the victory
atchieved (as it was acted) in Letters engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and cut in stone, together with the names
of the People and Kings that were vanquished;
and this was usually set up in some publick
place for the perpetuating of the memory of
such their famous conquest to all Posterities.
To this purpose is that which <hi>Cicero</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>ad Heren. Hic in Macedonia Trophaea po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
eaque quae bellicae laudis victoriaeque om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
gentes insignia &amp; monumenta esse voluerunt.</hi>
And so is that place of <hi>Pliny, lib. 37. cap.</hi> 2.
where he writeth that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ancient Rewards for victory obtained in
the field, born in Arms are Garlands, which
the Armorists call Chaplets, and in Latin they
were anciently called <hi>Coronae militum:</hi> and of
these there then were divers sorts, which were
conferred on the Victors, and were significant
demonstrations of the manner of the victory
obtained; for the ancient Bearers, Horsmen,
Captains and Lieutenants of Cities, Towns,
and Ports, which had valorously sustained and
indured the siege of their Enemies, and were
delivered from them, were guerdoned in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times with a Garland of Grass, called in
Latin <hi>Corona Graminea sive obsidionaria;</hi>
which although it were made of Grass (being
the only herb that can be supposed to be found
in a place long besieged) yet is the same Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Gramine (as <hi>Pliny</hi> witnesseth) most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and noble, and to be esteemed above
all others; Gold, Pearl, Olive, Laurel, Palm,
Oak and Ivy, giving place to common Grass,
that Royal Herb of Dignity.</p>
               <p>He also that could prudently delay his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and preserve the Army committed to his
charge from loss, without giving battel, was
wont to be rewarded with this kind of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Garland: such an one was <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Qui corona Graminea donatus fuit ab u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversa
Italia; quandoquidem non pugnando
sed cavendo rem Romanam restituisset, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum
sibi creditum conservasset.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another sort of Chaplet called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona
Civica,</hi> which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was in
esteem next to the <hi>Corona Graminea.</hi> And it
was made of Oaken leaves and branches, with
the fruit of Acorns hanging on it. This Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
or Chaplet was given to him that had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Citizen when his life was in extream pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
killing his enemy, and making good the
place where the danger happened. And <hi>Pliny</hi>
maketh mention, that this sort of Chaplet was
to be given to one who slew the first Enemy,
that mounted on the walls of a City or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
being defended by, or for the <hi>Romans.</hi>
And I read, that <hi>Hostius,</hi> the Grandfather of
the Roman King <hi>Hostilius,</hi> for his prowess was
the first that was remunerated by <hi>Romulus</hi>
with a Chaplet called <hi>Corona Frondea,</hi> and
this was <hi>quod Fidenam irrupisset;</hi> it was <hi>Anno
Mundi</hi> 3295.</p>
               <p>The triumphal Chaplet was first made of
Laurel, and such an one did <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi>
use. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Victors had their Chaplets
or Garlands of Olive-leaves; and these Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
were rewards also as well for Mercurial as
Martial Deeds, some of which at first made of
leaves, were afterward altered and composed
of Cold. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth that the Rose, the
Lily, and the Violets, be the flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Chaplets or Garlands of Noblemen
ought to be adorned. I confess he there useth
the Latin word <hi>Corona;</hi> but I think, under
favour, there that word <hi>Corona</hi> cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a Crown, I mean such an one as is in
use with us at this day made of Gold, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a Chaplet or Garland.</p>
               <p>I find also that Chaplets are sometimes made
of other Herbs, as of Rue; as that which is
born bend-wife upon the barrs of the Coat-Armour
of the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony;</hi> which,
as learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> out of <hi>Kran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

noted, was at the time of the Creation of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
(son of <hi>Albert Vrso,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi>
and brother to <hi>Otho</hi> the then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess,
and to <hi>Sifride</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Breme)</hi>
Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> granted to the said <hi>Bernard</hi>
by the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossa,</hi> upon
the request of the said <hi>Bernard,</hi> to difference
his Arms from his brothers; <hi>Tunc Imperator</hi>

               <p>It is not requisite in blazon to name the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours

Rundles, and by no other name. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is sufficient to say, he beareth Argent, on
a Chief, Gules, three Bezants, as I have done
in the blazon of <hi>Russel</hi>'s Coat-Armour, <hi>p.</hi> 219.
without telling of the colour of the Bezants.

confess escaped in the correcting of this Edition;
therefore I do intreat the Courteous Reader
with his Pen in those two places to put out the
word <hi>Proper:</hi> yet I cannot deny but that in
ancient blazon I have seen the Colours of some
of these Rundles named; yea, and some are
of opinion that one or two sorts of these differ
their names in the quantity of their figure, and
not in colour; but of latter times, amongst our
English blazoners, it is accounted a great fault
to tell their colours, except where they are
found counterchanged in a Field transmuted, as
I have formerly said.</p>

               <p>Anciently Blazoners did use to tell the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the position of a Charge, consisting of
three things of one sort or kind placed in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
as you see these here are, by saying,
three Torteauxes, Plates, Mullets, Crescents,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55096:138"/>
or the like, in triangle, or two and one; but
it is now observed as a general Rule, That when
the number three is rehearsed in Arms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further declaration of the location or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the charge demonstrated by that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
then are they always placed in the fashion
that is shewed in this present Escocheon; but
if they have their location in any other form,
then you must always tell how and in what
manner, as in this next Escocheon.</p>

                  </figure>
The Fusil is longer than the Lozenge, having
its upper and lower part more acute and sharp
than the other two collateral middle parts;
which acuteness is occasioned by the short di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the space between the two collateral
or middle parts in the Figure demonstrated unto
you by the Letters <hi>B B;</hi> which space, if the
Fusil be rightly made, is always shorter than
any of the four Geometrical Lines whereof it
is composed, as you may observe in the Figure
thereof: in which you find that the distance
between the two Angles demonstrated by the
Letters <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> is longer than that which is
between the two collateral or middle Angles
marked with <hi>B</hi> and <hi>B:</hi> but all this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood
of Fusils of the modern figure or
form; for anciently they were depicted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
shape. And <hi>Chassaneus</hi> sheweth a
Fusil somewhat near to the ancient, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thus,</p>
               <p>And thus much may suffice to have spoken
of such Charges as are differenced only from
their distinction of their Colours, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
change their Names; all which you
may observe to be composed of a Circula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Now it remaineth that I treat of those
other which have a nearer resemblance among
themselves, yet vary their names only from
their distinction of form.</p>
               <p>Of this sort are <list>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Geometrician calleth the kind of Figure
whereof every of these is composed <hi>Rhombus,</hi>
which <hi>Keckerman</hi> saith, is <hi>Parallelogram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
obliquangulum &amp; equilaterum;</hi> for in
truth every one of these consist of four Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritical
lines of equal length, yet these are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
named by Armorists, as I shall presently
shew you. But I think it first necessary to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
unto you the Figure of every of these, as
in Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
In this Figure you may observe the sides be
not anguled, but rather round. He there thus
describeth Fusils, <hi>Fusae sunt acutae in superiori

tere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Lozenge differeth from a Fusil, in that the
space between its two collateral or middle An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
equals the length of any of the four Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
Lines whereof it is composed, as its
Figure before more plainly manifesteth; where
the space between the Angles demonstrated by
the figures 3 and 3, and 1 and 3, are of equal
length. I confess sometimes you may find in
things made for Lozenges, the distance here
demonstrated by the figures 3 and 3 to be a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55096:138"/>
little longer than that from 1 to 3, but it can
never be shorter, for then it is a Fusil.</p>
               <p>A Mascle differeth from both the Fusil and
Lozenge; first, because the Mascle is always
voided, that is, part of the Field is transparent
through it. I confess in this I dissent from
<hi>Leigh</hi>'s opinion, who in his <hi>Accidence of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
pag. 157. b.</hi> seemeth to grant that a
Mascle may be whole: but of this I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
shewed my opinion and my reason for
the same, <hi>pag.</hi> 234. Next, a Mascle differeth
from a Fusil and a Lozenge in the proportion of
space, which is evidently demonstrated in the
Mascles Figure by the Letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> which
sheweth a Mascle to be as long as it is broad.</p>
               <p>Now proceed we to give you some Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of bearing these Fusils and Lozenges in
Coat-Armour; as for Mascles, I have already
shewed some, <hi>pag.</hi> 234.</p>

To these Charges that thus resemble each

               <p>HAVING finished the former
Section, treating of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
formed of things Artificial,
in which there is tincture (that
is to say, Metal, Colour of Furr)
predominating: I will now (<hi>secundis velis</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give Examples of Coat-Armours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Tincture predominating in them. These
are formed of sundry sorts of lines of Partition,
occasioning oftentimes Transmutation and
Counterchanging.</p>
               <p>Coat-Armours having no Tincture predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
in them, are such as are so composed
and commix'd of two colours, as that neither
of them do surmount other. Such are these
that follow, and the like, which are formed of
lines of Partition only.</p>
               <p>In giving Examples of these forms of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is requisite that I begin with those which
consist of single lines of Partition; and then
proceed to such sorts as are formed of manifold
lines, as in Example.</p>

               <p>Such Coat-Armours
as are formed only of
lines of Partition, do
(generally) yield testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,

noteth (upon the Coat-Armour of the Noble
Race of the <hi>Ranzovij,</hi> which is born parted

in this Distichon:

He beareth parted

In this and the former I
give the preheminence
in blazon to the metal,
not in respect of the
dignity thereof, but for
that it occupieth the
more eminent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
part of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon
which is the Chief; for otherwise the
right side having precedence of the left might

of Arms consisting of single lines of Partition,
both perpendicular and transverse. Now follow
Examples of such as are formed of a mixt
kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leigh</hi> holdeth that
this sort of bearing is
not otherwise blazoned
than quarterly. But
(some Blazoners are of opinion that) when
this composition consisteth meerly of Metals
and Colour, or of any the before-mentioned
Furrs and Colour, without any charge occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the quarters of the Escocheon, such bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is more aptly blazoned parted <hi>per</hi> Cross,
but if they be charged, then they hold it best
blazoned quarterly.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth parted
<hi>per</hi> Pile in point, Or
and Sable. <hi>Only the
Pile part of this Coat
may be charged</hi> (saith
<hi>Leigh) and no other
part thereof, and that</hi>
(saith he) <hi>may be used
as one only Coat. And if
it be charged, you shall
leave the Field untold.</hi>
In this Coat the Pile hath the preheminence;
for if the Escocheon were made after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
fashion, you shall see very little of the
Field.</p>
               <p>Two other sorts of parted <hi>per</hi> Pile I find,
which for their rare use I have thought fit to
insert into this place, whereof the first is, as in
this next Escocheon.</p>

He beareth parted
<hi>per</hi> Pile traverse, Argent
and Gules. Were it not
that these lines had
their beginnings from
the exact points of the
Chief and Base sinister,
and so extend to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
line in the Fess
point on the dexter side,
I should then hold it to
be a Charge and no Partition; and then should
it be said to be a Pile, and not a partition <hi>per</hi>
Pile. This Coat pertaineth to the Family of
<hi>Rathlowe</hi> in <hi>Holsatia.</hi> As touching the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Coat, <hi>Ionas ab Elvet</hi> hath these
verses;
<q>
                     <l>Forma quid haec simplex? Simplex fuit ipsa vetustas:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The other sort of Partition <hi>per</hi> Pile taketh
beginning from the two base points, dexter and
sinister, and do meet in the exact middle chief
point of the Escocheon, as in this next Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth parted
<hi>per</hi> Pile transposed, Or,
Gules, and Sable. This
kind of bearing is rare,
as well in regard of the
transposition thereof,
for that the natural and
accustomed bearing of
Piles is with the points
downwards; as also in
respect that thereby the
Field is divided into three distinct Colours or
Tinctures. This Coat is proper to the Family
of <hi>Meinstorpe</hi> or <hi>Menidorpe</hi> in <hi>Holsatia. Ionas

to <hi>Leigh</hi>) may
be good Armory, if all
the four pieces be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with some thing
quick or dead: But it is
better (saith he) if it be
charged but with two
things of one kind, and that especially upon
the Gules; but best of all it is to have but one

He beareth Gyronny
of six pieces, Ermyn and

manner of blazon is to
begin at the dexter cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Escocheon;
but in this Coat I begin
with the middle part,
not for that <hi>medium est
locus honoris;</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that the Ermyn

consisting of Gyrons are
of old Blazoners termed counter-coined, for
that the coins or corners of their contrary or

the Shield. Therefore Coat-Armours of this

of Coat-Armours of this

predominating, I
think it fit to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
to that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,

I have done in the blazon of <hi>Hawleys</hi>
and <hi>Restwold</hi>'s Coats, and the like, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Chapter. Mr. <hi>Boswell</hi> giveth <hi>Grafton</hi>'s
Coat the same blazon that I do here, beginning
with the colour Sable. <hi>Iohannes Peronus,
Nauclerus, Paradine, Vlpian, Gerrard
Leigh,</hi> and others, both ancient and modern
writers; altogether allow the blazon of this
Coat-Armour to be party <hi>per</hi> Saltire, as afore.
Some others (whose conceit herein I utterly
dislike) whether nicely or ignorantly, have
endeavoured to blazon this Coat Gyronny of
four, or of four pieces: But my opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
with that of the said former writers,
alledged to be the seventh Partition <hi>per</hi> Saltire,
without any term of Gyronny at all. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
of this Gentleman enjoyed a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
in Lands in the City of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and
in <hi>Grafton, Fliford,</hi> and <hi>Pendock</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Worcester,</hi> as other Lands in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Stafford,</hi> as appeareth by a Deed (which
I have seen) dated in <hi>Iune Anno 29. Henrici</hi> 8.
but at this day dispersed into strange hands.
Nevertheless I wish vertue her due reward;
then shall not this Bearer (a true lover of Arms)
depart empty handed.</p>
               <p>As these last mentioned Coats are framed of
straight lines of Partition, so shall you find others
composed of sundry lines before spoken of, in
the beginning of the second Section of this
Book, as well of those sorts that I call cornered
lines, as of those that are bunched. And as
these last handled do utterly exclude all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Tinctures whereof they are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by reason of the straightness of the lines
wherewith they be divided: so contrariwise
those Arms that do consist of those other sorts
of lines, do admit participation and intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of one colour with another, for which
cause they are of <hi>Leigh</hi> termed <hi>Miscils, à mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo,</hi>
of mingling; to whom I will referr you
touching Coats of that kind, for that he hath
exemplified them at large in his <hi>Accidence of

               <p>IN the former Chapter are comprehended

Now shall be handled such other kinds of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

as the last spoken of do; yet (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

lines of Partition) they do constitute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
form of bearing, and receive also a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

in Field and Charge, occasioned by the apposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some one or more lines of Partition.
Such Coat-Armours may be fitly resembled to
the party-coloured-garements, so much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Here you see
that this Coat-Armour

mixture of two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
of several kinds,
to wit, of Pales and of
Bends born one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart
the other; for

consists of a mixture of

this blazon; for <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

and saith it consisteth continually of
eight pieces, and is properly so called without
any other name; but it is by other Blazoners
thought to be better blazoned, Barry-pily of
so many pieces. And so I shall, under corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> now blazon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth Barry-pily
of eight pieces, Gules
and Or. I doubt not,
if the courteous Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
well consider the
form of the Pile used in
Armory, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the position of
the Charge of this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
that he will
not much condemn this
new blazon given to this Coat-Armour.
As for the blazon of <hi>Hoyland</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi>'s Coat
of <hi>Lincolnshire;</hi> I take it to be parted <hi>per</hi> Pale,
indented, Gules and Or.</p>
               <p>This shall suffice for Coat-Armours having
an observe derivation from some of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries;
and do keep their name. Of such as
do lose the name of their Ordinaries, whereof
they are composed, I find only one sort, which
is checky. And this form of bearing is also
chargeable both in part and all over, as shall
appear by these next Examples: wherein I do
omit to exemplifie the single sort of bearing,
because the same is manifestly and universally
known; but will explain the compound only as
followeth.</p>

He beareth Checky,
Argent and Azure, a
Chief, Gules, by the
Name of <hi>Palmer.</hi> This
sort of composition (if
you do well observe it)
is abstracted from Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
and Barrulets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt;
yet doth it not
participate either of the
one name or the other,
but is termed in blazon Checky. As this
Coat is charged in part, so are there others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the same kind that are charged all over,
as in this next Example.</p>

               <head>SECT. VI. CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>FROM our first ingress in this Book,
hitherto hath been handled at large
the first part of the Division of this
whole Work, under the general
Head of Blazoning; wherein have
been confined and illustrated Examples of the
divers and variable kinds of bearing of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Coat-Armours, of whatsoever substance,
form, or quality consisting, together with the
general and particular Rules in their proper
places, for the better instruction of the regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reader. It now succeedeth in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that other general Head (being the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the first Division) termed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling.
Which term I am not ignorant of
how farr extent it is, not only in ordering the
parts of an Armie, but also for disposing of all
persons and things in all Solemnities and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,
as Coronations, Interviews, Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Funerals, Triumphs, and the like, in which
the Office of an Herald is of principal use for
direction of others; and therefore his Learning,
Judgment, and Experience ought to be able to
direct himself in so weighty Affairs. But that
noble part of Marshalling is so absolutely alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
performed by the industrious Pen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> Kt. late <hi>Garter</hi> and
Principal King at Arms, in his Book of <hi>Honour
Military and Civil,</hi> as that it were but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy
joyn'd with Ignorance for me to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
in an Argument so exactly handled:
Neither is here my purpose other, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
my self to Armory only, and so far only to
speak of Marshalling, as it concerns Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
This Marshalling therefore is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
disposing of sundry Coat-Armours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to distinct Families, and of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
Ornaments, with their Parts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
in their proper places. Of these
things, some have their place within the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scocheon,
some without: and of those within
the Escocheon, some have their occasions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
other some manifest; as are those whose
Marshalling (according to ancient and prescript
forms) do apparently either betoken Marriage,
or some gift of the Sovereign. Such as beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55096:150"/>
Marriage do represent either a Match sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
or hereditary: By a single Match I mean
the conjoyning of the Coat-Armours of a man
and a woman, descended of distinct Families,
in one Escocheon Pale-ways, as by Examples
following shall appear. And this form of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paling
is divers according to the several Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of persons, whether Ecclesiastical or
Temporal. Such as have a Function Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
and are preferred to the high honour
of Pastoral Jurisdiction, are reckoned to be
knit in Nuptial bands of love and tender care to
the Cathedral Churches whereof they are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents,
insomuch as when a Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaseth,
<hi>Ejus Ecclesia dicitur viduata.</hi> And
therefore their Paternal Coat is evermore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled

marshal their Coat-Armours belonging to their

Ensigns, which for brevity sake I here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>
               <p>To the end it may be the better conceived
what is meant by the right and left sides of an
Escocheon or Coat-Armour born impaled after
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55096:151"/>
this manner, you may imagine a man to be
standing before you, invested in a Coat depict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Arms of two several Families thus
conjoyned in Pale; and then that part that doth
cover his right side will answer to your left:
So then accounting the Coat to be his that
weareth it, you cannot erre in your judgment
touching the true distinction of the dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Escocheon, that is due to the Man
as to the more worthy, from the sinister part
that is allotted to the Woman, or the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>The manner of such impaling of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of distinct Families (as <hi>Baron</hi> and
<hi>Femme</hi>) by persons Temporal, is divers from
this before mentioned; for they do evermore
give the preheminence (of the dexter side) to
the man, leaving the sinister to the woman,
as in Example.</p>

This Shield is parted

<hi>Femme,</hi> the first Argent,

the second is Pale-ways

               </p>
               <p>If these were not Hereditary Coat-Armours,
yet should they have this form of marshalling
and none other, because the same is common
as well to single marriages having no heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Possessions, as to those that be hereditary.
Only in this these have a prerogative, which
the other have not, that the <hi>Baron</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Issue by his <hi>Femme,</hi> it is in his choice
whether he will still bear her Coat in this sort,
or else in an Inescocheon upon his own, because
he pretendeth (God giveth life to such his Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue)
to bear the same Coat of his Wife to him
and to his heirs; for which cause this Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus born is called an Escocheon of pretence.
Moreover, the heir of these two Inheritors
shall bear these two Hereditary Coats of his
Father and Mother, to himself and his heirs
quarterly; to shew, that the Inheritance, as
well of the Possessions, as of the Coat-Armours,
are invested in them and their Posterity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if the wife be no heir, neither her husband
nor child shall have further to do with her
Coat, than to set up the same in their house,
Paleways, after the foresaid manner, so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the memorial of the Fathers match with
such a Family. Examples whereof behold in

               <p>This form of bearing of divers Coats mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled

years since within the Realm of <hi>France,</hi>
as appeareth by <hi>Frances de Rosiers, lib. Stem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum
Lotharingiae;</hi> where amongst many
Transcripts of Kings Charters made to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Houses, under their Seals of Arms, he

<hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Modoaldus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Trevers,</hi>
for the Cell of St. <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi>
which Charter was sealed with three Seals:
His words are these, <hi>Hoc diploma tribus sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
firmatum est, primo aureo Dagoberti,</hi> which
was (as he had formerly described it) <hi>habens
insculptum scutum liliis plenum, secundo cereo

decorata cruce, ac Escarbocle, seu Carbunculo;

               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the orderly bearing of such Coat-Armours
Paleways in one Escocheon, note that</hi>
Gerard Leigh, <hi>making mention of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling
of divers</hi> Femmes <hi>with one</hi> Baron, <hi>saith,</hi>
If a man do marry two wives, they shall be both
placed on the left side in the same Escocheon
with him, as parted per Pale. The first wives
Coat shall stand on the Chief part, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
on the Base. Or, he may set them both in
Pale with his own, the first wives Coat next
to himself, and his second uttermost. And if
he have three wives, then the two first matches
shall stand on the Chief part, and the third
shall have the whole Base. And if he have a
fourth wife, she must participate the one half
of the Base with the third wife; and so will
they seem to be so many Coats quartered. <hi>But
here you must observe, that those forms of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palings
are meant of Hereditary Coats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Husband stood in expectancy of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his Family, through the possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Issue, that so those Hereditary Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his wife might be united to his own
Patrimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient way of impaling to take
half the Husbands Coat, and with that to joyn
as much of the Wives, as appeareth in an old
Roll, wherein the three Lions, being the
Arms of <hi>England,</hi> are dimidiated and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with half the Pales of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The
like hath also been practised with quartered
Coats, by leaving out half of them, as in
Example.</p>

the daughter and

his wives Arms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Dering,</hi> Baronet, from whose modesty
(though he be the exact Patern of vertuous

Thus also the Arms
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi>
are impaled for the
French King <hi>Lewis</hi> the
Twelfth, and <hi>Mary</hi> his
Wife, sister to our King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, as is
apparent by Escocheons
in colours of the same
Age whilst they lived.</p>
               <p>And for the Antiquity of bearing divers Coats
quartered in one Escocheon, the same Author
<hi>Francis de Rosiers,</hi> reciteth a Charter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
King of <hi>Angiers, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,
&amp;c.</hi> concerning his receiving of the Brethren
of the Monastery named <hi>Belprey,</hi> into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<hi>Actum Nanceij, Anno</hi> 1435. adding in
the end thereof these words, <hi>Arma Arragoniae,
Siciliae, Hierusalem, Andes.</hi> Whereby (if I
mistake him not) he giveth us to understand
that his Seal of Arms did comprehend all these
Coats born together quarterly in one Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because he holdeth the same form of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Seals of that kind throughout all
his Collection of Charters.</p>
               <p>As touching this quarterly bearing of many
Coats pertaining to sundry Families together
in one Escocheon, <hi>William Wicley</hi> doth utterly
mislike it, holding the same to be better fitting
a Pedigree to be locked up in a Chest, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
serving for approbation of the Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Families, or Inducements to title of
Lands, rather than multitudes of them should
be heaped together in or upon any thing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for Military use: For Banners, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
and other like Martial Ensigns, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for no other use, but for a Commander
to lead or be known by in the Field; to which
purpose these marks should be made apparent
and easie to be discerned, which cannot be
where many Coats are thronged together, and
so become unfit to the Field, and therefore to
be abolished of Commanders.</p>
               <p>Only he holdeth it expedient, that a Prince
or Noble-man, having title to some Countrey,
for the obtaining whereof he is inforced to
make warr, should shew forth his Standard of
the Arms of that Countrey quartered with his
own, amongst those people, which in right
and conscience do owe him obedience; that
they may be thereby induced the sooner
to submit themselves to him as to their true
and lawful Sovereign or Lord. So did <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> when he set on
foot his title to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the Arms of <hi>France</hi> quartered in his
Royal Banner with the Arms of <hi>England.</hi> But
for such persons as are but Commanders under
them, it is very absurd, since thereof ensue
oftentimes many dangerous errors; <hi>Et irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuperabilis
est error qui violentiâ Martis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur.</hi>
Having before made mention of an
Inescocheon, and of the bearing of the Arms
of the <hi>Femme</hi> by the <hi>Baron</hi> after Issue received
by her, she being an Inheritrix, I will now
here give you an Example, as well to shew the
occasion of such bearing, as also the manner
and situation thereof.</p>

whereof he beareth her Coat-Armour in the

Baronets mark, because it is not cut in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scocheon.</p>
               <p>As for antiquity of bearing of Inescocheons,
I find them very anciently used a long time by
the Emperours of <hi>Germany;</hi> for they always
placed an Inescocheon of their Paternal Coat
on the breast of the Imperial Eagle. And also
divers noble and worthy Families of this Land,
used the like bearing in the several reigns of
sundry of our Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the second, <hi>Simon Burley</hi> bare in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escocheon
the Arms of <hi>Husly.</hi> In the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Richard Beauchampe</hi> the great
Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> bare the Arms of <hi>Spenser</hi>
and <hi>Clare</hi> quarterly in an Inescocheon over his
own Paternal Coat-Armour, and many other
in like sort.</p>
               <p>Concerning the bearing of the Wives Coat-Armour
by the Husband impaled, or otherwise,
there are some that do boldly affirm, That it is
not permitted by Law, but only tolerated
through custome; and do (with <hi>Chassanaeus</hi>)
alledge for proof thereof, <hi>Quod Arma non trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eunt
ad cognatos &amp; affines, quia cognati de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendentes
ex femina non sunt de familia:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by reason of her marriage she renounceth
the Name of the Family whereof she is descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and assumeth the Name of her Husbands
Family, as we formerly shewed, where we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of differences which are not permitted
to the Females. And an especial reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be this, <hi>Quia Agnationis dignitas sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
debet esse salva;</hi> the Agnation (which is of
the Fathers side) must be preserved entire, and
therefore the Honour or Arms of it not to be
carried into another Family.</p>
               <p>Now because some misunderstanding the
Rule given in the sixth Chapter of the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
where it is said, <hi>That to Daughter never
were any differences allowed,</hi> do hold, that
the Husband in the impaling of his Wives
Coat-Armour with his own, may omit such
difference as her Father (admitting him to be
a younger Brother, or descended of a younger
Brother) bore to distinguish him from the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother; I think it not amiss here to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
unto the young Student in Armory, that
every Gentleman of Coat-Armour which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
a Gentlewoman whose Father did bear
any difference in his Coat, ought in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palement
of his Wives Arms to retain the same
difference which her Father bore, as in these
Examples.</p>

place unto the chief.
Though this Coat may
seem to be over much charged (to be good) yet
the occasion of the addition of the chief and

good and commendable bearing; for that it

King <hi>Iames,</hi> of happy memory, granted
to Baronets of this Kindom, who for certain
disbursments towards the Plantation in <hi>Vlster</hi>

that they and their descendants shall and may

Argent, a hand, Gules; examples of which
bearing by Baronets you may find in divers
places of this present Book. But here I cannot
but give a Caveat to those worthy Personages,
who have been created into this dignity, that
they should be more careful than many of them

               <p>IN the precedent Chapter enough hath
been said of augmentations or additions of
Honour bestowed by the Sovereign in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Princely Favour: Now of such as
he giveth in remuneration of merit, either
immediately by himself, or mediately by his
General or Vicegerent, either in requital of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
service performed, or for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to future honourable attempts, which is
then chiefly effected when vertue is duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
Such remunerations are conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men imployed either in warfare (be it secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or spiritual) or in affairs civil.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort were those that were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the several orders of spiritual Knighthood
of late use in this Land, but now abolished, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
Knights <hi>Templers;</hi> of which the first is the
chiefest, whose beginning, saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi>
was in the time of <hi>Godfrey</hi> first Christian King
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The profession of this Order was to fight for
Gods honour against the Infidels, and (as they
were taught by the Romish Synagogue) for
holy St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> This Order was begun in the
Year of Grace 1120. Their Habit was a long
Gown or Robe of black, with a white Cross
upon the breast. The Ensign Armorial of their
Order was an Escocheon, Gules, a plain Cross,
Argent. And this is now known for the Arms
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reason that the first <hi>Amadeus</hi> or
<hi>Amy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being in Arms with the
Brethren of this spiritual Knighthood at the
siege of <hi>Acres,</hi> after that their Grand-master
was slain by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> least the Infidels
should thereupon take a greater confidence of
Victory by knowledge of his death, at their
request he did put on the Armour of their slain
General, and the long Robe of black Cloth,
with the Arms of the said Order, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
himself with such valour in Battel,
that after he had slain the Admiral of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi>
with his own hand, he sunk and put to
flight the most part of their Foists, Ships, and
Gallies, and in fine, redeemed the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres</hi>
from a perillous Naval siege.</p>
               <p>For which benefit done to Religion, the
Knights of the said Order requested the said
Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> to advance for his Coat-Armour
this Ensign here mentioned. Since which time,
all those that entred the said Order, have also
had their Paternal Coat-Armour insigned with
this Cross on the Chief of their Paternal Coat,
as followeth.</p>

which was used in the blazon of the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

here declared, added to the Paternal Coat. This
Coat-Armour thus marshalled pertained to Sir
<hi>William Clarke</hi> Kt. deceased, by hereditary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
from Sir <hi>Iohn Clarke</hi> his Grandfather,
who took in lawful warrs <hi>Lewis de Orleans</hi>

In memory of which service the Coat-Armour
of the Duke was given him, marshalled on a

to publish the same authentickly under their

in Ordinary to his Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi>

<hi>England;</hi> which said Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> is descended
from Sir <hi>David Kirke</hi> Kt. who was Governor
and Proprietor of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> in <hi>America.</hi>
This augmentation was given to the said Sir
<hi>David Kirke,</hi> to <hi>Lewis Kirke</hi> Governor of

of the English Fleet, and to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants,
for their good services done in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering
and vanquishing the French Navy
under the Command of Monsieur <hi>de Rockmond</hi>
then Admiral, and bringing the said Admiral
prisoner to <hi>England;</hi> and for taking the said
Countrey of <hi>Canada</hi> then belonging to the
French, which was fortified by them, in which
Expedition the said Sir <hi>David</hi> took Monsieur
<hi>Champlaine</hi> their Governor, and brought him
prisoner to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these donative augmentations of Arms,
I will add certain Arms Assumptive, which are
such as a man of his proper right may assume as
the guerdon of his valorous service, with the
approbation of his Sovereign, and of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.
As if a man being no Gentleman of blood
or Coat-Armour, or else being a Gentleman of
blood and Coat-Armour, shall captivate or take
prisoner in any lawful warrs any Gentleman,
great Lord or Prince (as saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>)
he may bear the shield of that prisoner, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it to him and his heirs for ever, if the same be
not by like infortune regained, be he Christian
or Pagan, for that is but a vain and frivolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
These are such as the Bearers or
some of their Ancestors have forced from the
enemy, either in compelling him to flight, and
so to forsake his Arms or Ensigns, or by strong
hand surprise him prisoner, <hi>in justo bello,</hi> or
having slain him, so gained to himself (<hi>jure
gentium</hi>) an absolute interest in the Ensigns
of his conquered Foe. And in this sense may
that assertion of <hi>Bertolus</hi> be verified, where
he saith, <hi>Et jam populares propria authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
arma sibi assumere possunt;</hi> but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
because the base sort of men having no
generous blood in them, are not capable of
Armorial Ensigns, which are the badges of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
disposition or generous birth, and therefore
they ought not to be bestowed upon such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>Quia entia nolunt malè disponi, Arist.
Met.</hi> But in this sense it may be understood
that he that is not descended of gentle blood,
is holden worthy to bear the Coat-Armour
that he hath gained, for the apparent tokens
of vertue and valour that are found in him.
That the vanquisher may bear the Arms of the
vanquished, I shall make apparent by this next
Example.</p>

<hi>Peter Balthazar</hi>
in his Book of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents

saith, <hi>That the Arms
now born by the Earls
of that Countrey, were
won by</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Alsace, <hi>the sixth Earl thereof,
about the Year of Redemption 192. (what time
he made his Voyage into the Holy Land) from</hi>
Nobilion <hi>King of</hi> Albania, <hi>a Turk, whom he
had put to flight, and slain with his own hands
in a Battel.</hi> And this is the Justice of the Law
Military, <hi>Quia dominium rerum justo bello cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum
in victorem transfertur,</hi> as <hi>Ayala</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
Yet this is of many men holden a thing
very injurious, for that oftentimes the more
valourous man by meer casualty falleth into the
hands of the less valiant, and the most worthy
is often surprised by him that in comparison is
of no worth at all. Nevertheless, the Law
whereupon this Custome is grounded, is equal
and just, albeit the event thereof falleth out
oftentimes very hardly, as noteth <hi>Cassius,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Meliores in bello victi quandoque deteric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus

did providently ordain for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of men of action, that the Victor shall
be rewarded on this manner: For albeit the
faculties and inward indowments of the mind
can by no means be discovered, whereby each
man ought to receive remuneration answerable
to the true measure, of his worth and valour,

the persons of the vanquished be subject to this

               <p>COncerning Coat-Armours marshalled
within the Escocheon, whereof the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
are manifest, we have hitherto
intreated; now of such as have their
occasions less manifest. Those are such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereditary Coat-Armours are so obscurely
marshalled in one Escocheon, as that thereby
the beholder can yield no reason or yet conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural
probability of such their union, nor may
well discern them to be distinct Coats: So as
it often falleth out that they are mistaken for
some new coined Coat, rather than two Coats
of distinct Families, and so reckoned to be a
Coat too bad to be born. And such marshalling
is either one above another, or one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Of the first sort may we reckon the
Coat-Armour of <hi>Browne</hi> before exemplified,
as also these following and their like.</p>

               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth, Sable,
an Eagle displaied, Or,
on a Chief, Azure, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
Argent, a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veron
between two Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents
above, and a Rose
below, Or, by the Name
of <hi>Mynors.</hi> This form
of marshalling of divers
Coats doth <hi>Vpton</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
in case where a
man hath large Possessions by his Mother, and
small Patrimony from his Father, then he may
bear his Mothers Arms wholly on the neather
part of the shield, and his Fathers on a Chief,
in this manner. And for the better approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof, he setteth down an exemplary
Coat, which he blazoneth after this manner:
<hi>Portat unum signum capitale de nigro, &amp; tres
Rosas rube as in campo aureo, cum uno capite
rubeo, &amp; tribus talentis in eodem.</hi> Upon some
such like consideration it may seem that these,
being formerly the Coat-Armours of two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Families, were conjoyned as in this Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
appeareth, but now being both thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
and withal invested in the blood of the
bearer, through custome and tract of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring,
reckoned but one Coat, and born by
one name.</p>
               <p>Another form of bearing of divers Coats
(upon like occasion) much different from this,
doth the same Author commend, that is to say,
the bearing of the Mothers Arms upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(by the heir) in a Bend: And this doth
he reckon to be the best manner of bearing such
Arms, saying, <hi>Optimus certè modus portandi
diversa arma in uno scuto habetur in istis Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
quia habens patrimonium à suo patre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missum,
&amp; alias certas terras per matrem sibi
provenientes, quibus quidem terris maternis
certa appropriantur Arma ab antiquo, ut fortè
quia ipsa arma materna sortiuntur nomen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniei
suae; Tunc ipse haeres, si voluerit, potest
portare Arma integra sui patris in scuto plano,
&amp; in tali Benda potest portare Arma materna.</hi>
Of this form of bearing you may see a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
in this next Eschocheon.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
He beareth, Gules,
a Cross flurte, Or, on a
Bend, Azure, three Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
de Lis of the second,
by the Name of <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
The first and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost
of these was of
it self a perfect Coat,
and born by the Name
of <hi>Latimer,</hi> before the
Bend thus charged was
annexed: And that this Coat born on the Bend
is also a perfect Coat, you shall perceive, if by
<hi>Vpton</hi>'s direction you reduce the Bend into the
form of an Escocheon, and place the three
Flowers de Lis in the corners of the same. I
see not, but a man may as well say, that the
bearing of Arms of the Husband or of the
Wife one upon another on a Fess, were as good
and lawful, as upon a Bend, <hi>Quia similium
similis est ratio.</hi> But these may seem rather
to be conceited forms than received grounds of
marshalling; otherwise their use would have
been more frequent. But the most approved
sorts of marshalling with us are those before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
<hi>viz.</hi> impaling, quartering, and
bearing in an Inescocheon.</p>
               <p>Not unaptly may these Coats be said to be
obscurely marshalled, when the occasion thereof
cannot be either certainly discerned, or yet
probably conjectured, neither can it be with
reason conceived, whether the Superiour be
born for the Fathers Coat, or for the Mothers.
And thus much shall suffice concerning Coat-Armours
marshalled within the Escocheon.</p>

               <p>IN the former Chapters hath been treated
of such Coat-Armours as are marshalled
within the Escocheon; in order it now
succeedeth to speak of marshalling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Escocheon.</p>
               <p>These are certain Ornaments externally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Coat-Armour of any Gentleman,
by reason of his advancement to some honour
or place of eminency by the gracious favour of
the Sovereign, as an honourable addition to
his generous birth. Of these there are divers
particulars, which being conjoyned and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Coat-Armour, do constitute an Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>An Atchievement, according to <hi>Leigh,</hi> is
the Arms of every Gentleman well marshalled
with the Supporters, Helmet, Wreath and
Crests, with Mantles and Words, which of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
is properly called in Blazon <hi>Heawme</hi> and
<hi>Timbre.</hi> The French word <hi>Heaulme,</hi> which
we call in English an <hi>Helmet,</hi> seemeth to have
given derivation to that word <hi>Heawme.</hi> And
the word <hi>Timmer</hi> to our <hi>Timbre;</hi> for that in the
<hi>Almain</hi> Tongue is the same that we in <hi>Latin</hi>
call <hi>Apex,</hi> or <hi>Summitas acuminata,</hi> and beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth
the Crest that is usually born upon the
Helmet: For so doth <hi>Kiltanus Dufflene</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it, calling it, <hi>Timber of Timber van
Den Helme,</hi> which is as much to say, as <hi>Crista
galeae, Conus galeae, Summus Apex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, that the general words used by <hi>Leigh,</hi>
in his said description of an Atchievement,
must be restrained only to those particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom Supporters (either by Law or by
Custome) are properly due; for that none un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the degree of a Knight Banneret may bear
his Arms supported. And in some Countries
(as by name in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> saith <hi>Chassaneus)</hi> it
is not permitted to persons inferiour to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Knight, to Timber their Arms, that
is to say, to adorn them with Helmet, Mantle,
Crest, &amp;c. as <hi>Chassaneus</hi> noteth, saying <hi>Nulli
licitum est, nec solet quis Timbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Arma sua,
nisi sit saltem Eques militaris, vulgò Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
But with us the custome is otherwise;
for in bearing of Arms each particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
hath something peculiar to it self, and hath
her proper customes which have the vigour of
a Law, <hi>Quia consuetudo, ubi Lex scripta non
est, valet quantum Lex ubi scripta est.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein the custome of each Countrey is to
be respected, <hi>Specialis enim consuetudo vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
legem in eo loco ubi est consuetudo, dummodo
post legem fuerit inducta, aliàs vincitur à lege
superveniente.</hi> But it may seem that such
bearing is rather tolerated through custome,
than allowed in the strict construction of the
Law of Arms.</p>
               <p>Now that the things so externally annexed
to Coat-Armour, and also the order of their
placing may the better be conceived, I will
handle each part by it self, wherein I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
that course of Natures Method, which
<hi>Zanchius</hi> saith, was by <hi>Moses</hi> observed in the
History of the Creation, which is, <hi>à principiis
componentibus ad res compositas.</hi> The parts
compounding are those before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Helmet, Mantle, Crest, &amp;c. of which
some have place above the Escocheon, some
under it, some round about it, some on each side
of it.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are the Helmet, Mantle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scroule,
Wreath, Crown, Cap, &amp;c. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as with us the Nobles are divided into
<hi>Nobiles majores,</hi> as Dukes, Marquesses, Earls,
Vicounts, Barons and Bannerets; and into <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles
minores,</hi> as Knights, Esquires, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gentlemen; and that to these particular
degrees there are allotted sundry forms of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
whereby their several states are discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I will exemplifie their divers fashions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

Pages, as some do name them, was to precede
their Commander upon whom they attended,
bearing those his Military Habiliments, it fitteth
well the respective care that they ought to
have for the execution of his directions, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a regardful Eye, and attentive Ear,
to observe and listen what he will prescribe
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55096:161"/>
them: and therefore the Helmet, born thus
sidelong (if I erre not in my understanding)
doth denote unto us attention and obedience,
and therefore is properly attributed to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Knight, to whom (among those that
we call <hi>Nobiles minores)</hi> it pertaineth in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Affairs, to give and not attend directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This form of Helmet
(in my conceit) doth best
quadrate with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Knight, though
<hi>Leigh</hi> improperly useth
the same; the same (I
say) in regard of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
standing thereof,
but divers in this, that
the Beaver of that is
close, and this open.
For he assigneth this to the degree of an Esquire,
wherein I altogether dissent, as well for that
the full faced Helmet doth signifie direction or
command, like as the former presenteth atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and obedience, as also for that it is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
honour to bear the Beaver open than close;
the close bearing signifying a buckling on of it,
as a preparation to the Battel, and the open
Beaver betokeneth a return from Battel with
glory of Victory. So said <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
to the messenger that he sent to <hi>Benhadad</hi>
King of <hi>Syria; Tell him, Let not him that
girdeth his harness boast himself, as he that
putteth it off:</hi> which <hi>Tremellius</hi> thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>Qui induit arma pugnaturus, ne ita glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riator
ac si victoriâ partâ illa deponeret;</hi> that
is, according to the vulgar saying, We must not
triumph before the Victory. And for a further
proof that this form is more agreeable to the
dignity of a Knight than the former, you must
observe, that if among <hi>Nobiles majores,</hi> or
their Superiours (having Sovereign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
it be reckoned a chief token of Honour to
bear their peculiar Helmets full faced and open;
then doubtless, amongst <hi>Nobiles minores,</hi> it is
no less Honour for Knights (who amongst them
have a kind of Superiority) to bear their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
after the same manner: <hi>Illud enim est
melius, quod optimo est propinquius; &amp; in
eodem casu idem jus statuendum est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This fashion of side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
Helmet and open
faced with <hi>gardevisure</hi>
over the sight, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all persons of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
under the degree
of a Duke, whereof a
Baron (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) is
the lowest that may
bear the same on this
manner. And of these
each one is subordinate unto other, as well in
Jurisdiction, as in rank of Nobility, as <hi>Chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saneus</hi>
noteth, saying, <hi>Sicut Rex debet habere
sub se decem Duces, ita Dux debet habere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
Comites, seu Marchiones; &amp; Comes seu
Marchio decem Barones, &amp; Baro decem Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datores.</hi>
And for these respects, if I be not
deceived, do they all bear their Helmets side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
for that each one of them attendeth the
directions of the other, to whose Jurisdiction
they are subjected.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Gardevisure,</hi> corruptly imprinted
<hi>Gardeinsure,</hi> is a French term, devised for the
more apert expressing of the use thereof; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they do serve for the safeguard and
defence of the face; for so may we lawfully
invent words in case we want apt terms to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the nature and use of things, as <hi>Lipsius</hi>
well noteth, saying, <hi>Datur venia novitati
verborum rerum obscuritatibus inservien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, there are many more things in
the world, than there are names for them,
according to the saying of the Philosopher;
<hi>Nomina sunt finita, res autem infinitae; ideo
unum nomen plura significat;</hi> which saying is
by a certain (or rather uncertain) Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
<hi>Multis speciebus non sunt nomina: Id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circo

               </p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This kind of Helmet
is proper to persons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over their Subjects
and Inferiours, as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
Monarchs,
Kings, Princes, and
Dukes, and such as do
by an absolute Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
manage the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of free States or
Countries. And a Duke (according to <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is the lowest that may bear his Helmet on this
fashion. As the first and third sort of Helmets
before expressed do signifie attention and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
(for the reasons formerly delivered)
in their several degrees; so contrariwise the
second and this fourth sort in theirs, do beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
authority, direction, and command; for
so do all Sovereigns, as also all Generals, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and Commanders in Martial Affairs,
and Magistrates and Governous in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Civil Government, in prescribing of
Orders and Directions to the Multitude, use a
steady and set countenance, fixing their eyes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
on those to whom they address their
Councils or Commands; and such a gesture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
men of such place, for that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
a kind of Majesty. This property is
observed to be naturally in the Frog, whereof
<hi>Spenser</hi> the Poet making mention, termeth it
the <hi>Lording of Frogs,</hi> because in their sitting
they hold their heads steady, looking directly
in a kind of gravity of State, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:55096:162"/>
Now the bearing of the Helmet in Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is sometimes single, sometimes manifold.
It is said to be born single, when the Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is adorned with one only Helmet, as in
those hereafter ensuing shall be seen.</p>
               <p>I call that a manifold Bearing, when for the
garnishing and setting forth of an Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
two Helmets or more are placed upon
the Shield or Escocheon, because sometimes for
beautifying the Atchievement of some great
personage of noble birth, or eminent place,
three Helmets are placed jointly upon the
Shield.</p>
               <p>Touching the manner of placing divers Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
upon one Shield, these Rules following
are to be observed, <hi>viz.</hi> If you will place two
for the respects aforesaid, then must they be so
set, as the Beaver of the one may be opposite
to the other, as if they were worn by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
aspecting or beholding each other. But
if you place three Helmets, for any of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
above remembred, then must you place
the middle standing directly forwards, and the
other two upon the sides, after a sidelong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with their Beavers turned toward the
middlemost, in representation of two persons
aspecting the third.</p>
               <p>The next in order of these exterior parts of
an Atchievement, is the Mantle, so named of
the French word <hi>Manteau,</hi> which with us is
taken for a long Robe. This was a Military
Habit used in ancient time of great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Field, as well to manifest their high
place, as also (being cast over their Armour)
to repel the extremity of wet, cold, and heat,
and withal to preserve their Armour from rust,
so to continue thereby the glittering lustre
thereof.</p>
               <p>Of this kind of Habit the famous Sir <hi>Geffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chaucer</hi> maketh mention in the Knights
Tale; where treating of the Adventures of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi>
and <hi>Arcite,</hi> for the love of <hi>Emely</hi> the
Dukes daughter of <hi>Athens,</hi> he describeth the
Habits and Ornaments of the Kings that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
them to the Lists of the Combate:
where of <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of <hi>India</hi> he saith,
that he
<q>
                     <l>Came riding like the god of Arms Mars,</l>
                     <l>His Coat-Armour was of cloth of Thrace,</l>
                     <l>Couch'd with Pearle white round and great,</l>
                     <l>His Saddle was of burnisht Gold newly beat.</l>
                     <l>A Mantle on his shoulders hanging,</l>
                     <l>Beate full of Rubies red as fire sparkling.</l>
                  </q>
Where I collect, that this Mantle here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
was worn for the purposes formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that in the hanging thereof from the
shoulders of <hi>Demetrius</hi> it did cast it self into
many plaits (as naturally all garments of large
size do) which form of plaiting in the Art of
Painting is termed Drapery. <hi>Wolfang. Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
speaking of this kind of Habit, calleth the
same <hi>chlamys mantuelis,</hi> saying, <hi>Chlamys man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuelis
recensetur itidem à Tribellio inter dona
militaria a Galieno Claudio, qui post fuit Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,
data. Zanchius ait, De nostris Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicis
paria tria, singilones Dalmatenses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,
Chlamydem Dardaniam Mantuelem unam.</hi>
This sort of Habit have some Authors called
<hi>Toga Militaris,</hi> and other <hi>Lacerna: Ego vero</hi>
(saith <hi>Lazius) togam militarem eandem cum
Lacerna extitisse autumo.</hi> As we shewed a
difference of Helmets used in the garnishing of
Atchievements of persons of different estate and
dignity, so it may seem there hath been in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time a diverse form of mantling used for
the difference betwixt <hi>Nobiles majores</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores.</hi>
For <hi>Franc. de Rosiers</hi> mentioning the
Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> the second. Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
to the Abby of <hi>Belprey</hi> 1420. he saith
concerning the Seal thereof, <hi>Portat in Tymbre
Aquilam cum paludamento Ducali;</hi> whereby
we may probably gather that Dukes in those
days, and in that place, had a different form of
mantling from persons of inferior degrees: But
in these things, each Nation for the most part
hath some custome peculiar to it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> son of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the third, was the first that bare his Arms
Tymbered, as the same Author affirmeth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Hic Princeps fuit Primus qui portavit
Arma cum Galea Tymbrata, ut patet in literis
ejus &amp; aliorum ducum:</hi> But I suppose the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of these words must be restrained to that
particular place. For <hi>Wolf. Lazius</hi> seemeth
to affirm that such a form of bearing hath been
anciently used amongst the Romans, where he
saith, <hi>Atque hactenus de Cristis quae in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorum
nostrorum insignibus magis ad Romanam
similitudinem accedere arbitror, sic ea cum
pictura nostra in frontispicio operis contule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither hath this habit escaped Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but hath passed through the forge of pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
conceit (as well as those Helmets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
handled) insomuch as (besides the bare
name) there remaineth neither shape or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a Mantle: For how can it be imagined
that a piece of cloth, or of whatsoever other
stuff, that is jagged and frownced after the
manner of our now common received Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlings
used for the adorning of Atchievements,
being imposed upon the shoulders of a man,
should serve him to any of the purposes for
which Mantles were ordained? So that these
being compared with those, may be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
termed Flourishings than Mantlings.</p>
               <p>But as they are used in Atchievements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you call them Mantles or Flourishings, they
are evermore said in Blazon to be doubled, that
is, lined throughout with some one of the Furrs
before handled in the first Section of this Work,
as well of those Furrs that do consist of more
colours than one, as of those that be single and
unmixt. For so the Romans used to wear their
Cloaks or Mantles lined throughout, sometimes
with one coloured Furr, and otherwhiles with
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55096:162"/>
Furrs of variable colours, whereof they were
called <hi>Depictae penulae:</hi> of which latter sort <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.
ab Alex.</hi> speaketh, saying, <hi>Tametsi lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Caligulam depictas penulas saepe induisse;</hi>
and <hi>Lazius, Penula picta lascivioris vitae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoribus
in usu f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> whereof he giveth an
instance out of <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> who saith of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi>
that he was <hi>saepe depictas gemmatasque
penulas indutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were called <hi>depictae penulae,</hi> because of
the variety of the coloured skins wherewith
they were furred or lined, which made a shew
as if those doublings or linings had been paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Some of those doublings are of rare use
at these days, which have been more frequent
in former times, as I find in the Church of
<hi>Gravenest</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford</hi> in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
a Mantle, Sable, doubled Varrey.</p>
               <p>Next to the Mantle the Cognizance doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the highest place, and is seated upon
the most eminent part of the Helmet; but yet
so, as that it admitteth an interposition of some
Escroll, Wreath, Chapeau, Crown, &amp;c. And
it is called a Cognizance <hi>à cognoscendo,</hi> because
by them such persons as do were them are
manifestly known whose servants they are.
They are also called Crests of the Latin word
<hi>Crista,</hi> which signifieth a Comb or Tuft, such
as many Birds have upon their heads, as the
Peacock, Lapwing, Lark, Heathcock, Feasant,
Rustcock, &amp;c. And as those do occupy the
highest part of the heads of these Fowls; so
do these Cognizances or Crests hold the most
perspicuous place of the Helmet, as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
following shall appear in their due
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the use of these Cognizances or
Crests among the Romans,</hi> Lazius <hi>(having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Shields and the garnishing of them with
pourtraitures of living things) hath these
words,</hi> Hactenus de clypeorum pictura, sive
sculptura Romanae Reipub. celebrata, unde
nimirum &amp; nostras caelaturas in his clypeis,
quas Wappas dicunt, profectas credendum est.
Iam enim Galeas illa quoque atque coronas su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
positas cum cristis atque avium alis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentabat.</p>
               <p>But that the wearing of such Crests was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to other Nations as well as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>Alex. ab Alex.</hi> sheweth, affirming that
the Almains and the Cymbrians used Helmets
wrought about with the shapes of hideous ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Animals. The Carians had Rustcocks
for their Crests. <hi>Alexander Magnus</hi> did invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
his Helmet with a gallant Plume of purest
white.</p>
               <p>The Galatians bare sometimes horns, and
otherwhiles the shapes of living things. The
Trojans, Mysians, and Thracians bare upon their
brazen Helmets the ears and horns of an Ox.
<hi>Amongst the rest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that of</hi> Covidius <hi>the
Centurion, which he used in the battel that he
had against the Mysians, was holden to be
admirable; that he bare upon his Helmet a
cup, that one while did flash out flames of fire,
and otherwhiles would suck them in.</hi> Many
more Examples could I give to prove as well
the antiquity as the general use of Crests; but
holding this to be sufficient, I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give Examples of things that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
between the Mantle and the Crest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with those of inferiour reckoning,
and so to those of better worth and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
It may seem an inveterate and overworn
fashion in this Age to bear a Crest upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scroll
made of this or some other like manner;
but how obsolete soever the same may be
thought, <hi>Gerard Leigh</hi> doth confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that both in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
fifth, and long after, no man had his Badge
set on a Wreath under the Degree of a Knight:
But howsoever time and usurpation concurring
with prescription, hath so much prevailed, as
that it will be a matter of great difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
men to that form of bearing so long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
yet may you observe that our most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> himself to this day thus
beareth this badge.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
This is an ancient ornament of the head,
and much in use with the Turks and Saracens.
Amongst all the interpositions before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that are placed between the Mantle and the
Crest, there is none of so frequent use as this;
which sometimes is called in blazon a Wreath,
because it is made of two coloured silks or more
wreathed together; sometimes also a Torce,
for the same cause; <hi>Nempe quia torquetur,</hi>
because it is wound or twisted. The mixture
of the colours of this Wreath is most usually
taken from the Metal or Colours contained in
the Paternal-Coat of the Bearer. For the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
making of this Wreath, <hi>Leigh</hi> ascribeth
this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> that you must evermore begin
with the Metal, and end with the Colour.</p>
               <p>

                  <figure/>
This kind of Head-tire is called a Cap of
Dignity; which Cap (saith <hi>Chassaneus)</hi> Dukes
accustomed to wear in token of excellency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had a more worthy government
than other Subjects. Also they used to wear
the same in token of Freedom; <hi>Quia debent
esse magis liberi apud Principem supremum
quam alij.</hi> This Cap must be of Scarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and the lining or doubling thereof Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn.
Some do boldly affirm (saith Sir <hi>Iohn
Ferne</hi>) that as well the Earl and Marquess, as
a Duke, may adorn his head with this Chape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au
or Cap, even by the same reason and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
that they do challenge to wear their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets,
because this Cap, as also their Crowns
are allowed them, not only for a declaration of
their Princely dignities and degrees, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
for tokens and testimonies of triumph and
victory. For the wearing of the Cap had a
beginning from the Duke or General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who having gotten victory, caused the
chiefest of the subdued Enemies, whom he led
Captive, to follow him in his triumph, bearing
his Cap or Hat after him in token of subjection
and captivity.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
Albeit there are divers other sorts of Crowns
more usually born interposed between the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and the Crest; yet because this is sometimes
put to like use, and that it is of all the rest the
chiefest, I have selected this as an Example of
Crowns put to such use, the rather because I
willingly comprehend all those of less esteem
under it. That the Romans did bear Crowns upon
their Helmets after this manner, it is clear by the
testimony of <hi>W. Lazius,</hi> as well in that I have
formerly alledged, where I have spoken of the
use of Crests, as also by his confirmation thereof,
where he saith, <hi>Caetera Coronarum genera in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversum,

               <p>THus far have I touched things placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Escocheon; now I will proceed
to such as are placed elsewhere, of which
some are peculiar, some more general.</p>
               <p>By such as are peculiar I mean those that are
appropriate to persons having Sovereign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and to such as we called <hi>Nobiles Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores,</hi>
of which Rank a Baronet is the lowest.
But amongst the particular Ornaments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Coat-Armours of persons having ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Supreme or Inferiour dignity, there are
some that do environ the Coat-Armour round
about, and do chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly belong to persons exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Sovereign Jurisdiction, and to such others
as they out of their special favour shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the same unto, by associating them
into the fellowship of their Orders. Such are
the most honourable Order of the Garter, the
Orders of the Golden Fleece, of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
of the Annunciation; of all which Sir
<hi>William Segar,</hi> late <hi>Garter</hi> King at Arms, hath
written so learnedly, that to his Works I must
again referr the Reader for satisfaction therein;
the discourse thereof being altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to my intended purpose in this present
Work.</p>
               <p>Yet here you must observe, that a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted into the Society and Fraternity of
any two of the Honourable Orders before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
he may in setting forth his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
adorn the samewith the chief Ornaments
or Collars of both these Orders whereof he is
elected and admitted a Fellow and Companion,
by placing one of the Ornaments next to his
Shield, and the other without the same. In
such manner did the most high and mighty
Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and Earl <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> bear the chief Ornaments
of the Orders of the Garter and of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaving those peculiar Ornaments of
Sovereigns or others, I return to those that are
communicable (by a certain right) as well to
those called <hi>Nobiles majores,</hi> as to Sovereigns.
Such are those which are said to be placed on
the sides of the Atchievements, representing
sometimes things living, and sometimes dead.</p>
               <p>But these of some Blazoners are termed Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters,
whose conceit therein I can hardly
approve, <hi>Quia diversorum diversa est ratio;</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55096:163"/>
and therefore the Blazon that I would give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things so different in Nature is, that if things
be living, and seize upon the Shield, then shall
they be called properly Supporters; but if they
are inanimate, and touch not the Escocheon,
then shall such Arms be said to be (not support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but cotised, of such and such things: For
how can those be properly said to support that
touch not the thing said to be supported by
them? Therefore <hi>Nomina sunt aptanda rebus
secundum rationis normam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To persons under the degree of a Knight
Banneret, it is not permitted to bear their
Arms supported, that Honour being peculiar
to those that are called <hi>Nobiles majores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these Cotises have their name agreeable
to the thing whose quality they represent, and
are so called (as we elsewhere shewed) of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi>
the Rib, either of man or beast; for it is
proper to the Rib to inclose the Entrails of
things Animal, and to adde form and fashion to
the body; in like manner do these inclose the
Coat-Armour whereunto they are annexed,
and do give a comely grace and ornament to
the same.</p>
               <p>Another ornament there is externally annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Coat-Armour, and that is the Motto or
Word which is the Invention or Conceit of the
Bearer, succinctly and significantly contrived
(for the most part) in three or four words,
which are set in some Scroll or Compartiment,
placed usually at the foot of the Escocheon: and
as it holdeth the lowest place, so is it the last
in blazoning. Of this word <hi>Abra. Franc.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in this manner, <hi>Quod à recentioribus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
quaedom ipsis Armis subjiciantur, videtur
id nuper inventum ad imitationem eorum quae
Symbola à nobis appellantur.</hi> And indeed the
Motto should express something intended in the
Atchievement, though use hath now received
whatsoever fancy of the Deviser; and this
Motto is of universal use to all Gentry and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of what rank soever.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the blazoning of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
exteriorly annexed to any Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
it is to be considered, that we are not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that strict observation in them, as in the
blazoning of things born within the Escocheon;
for these are the essential parts of Coats, and
those meerly Accidental. For the Crest or
Timber, Wreath, Mantle, Helm, &amp;c. (saith
<hi>Ferne</hi>) are no part of the Coat-Armour, but
Additions to Atchievements added not many
hundred years ago to the Coats of Gentry.
And therefore when you have aptly set forth
all the Fields and Charges, and their Colours
contained within the Escocheon, your Blazon
is done; so that when we shall describe any of
those Exteriour Ornaments, we stand at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for naming of our Colours, and in those it
is held no fault to name one Colour twice.</p>

Generous Reader.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>My Task is past, my Care is but begun;</l>
               <l>My Pains must suffer Censures for reward:</l>
               <l>Yet hope I have, now my great pains are done,</l>
               <l>That gentle Spirits will quite them with regard.</l>
               <l>For when my love to Gentry here they find,</l>
               <l>My love with love they must requite by kind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But if the ungentle Brood of Envies Grooms,</l>
               <l>Misdoom my Pains; no force, they do their kind,</l>
               <l>And I'le do mine, which is to scorn their Dooms,</l>
               <l>That use unkindly a kind well-willing mind.</l>
               <l>Thus I resolve: Look now who will hereon,</l>
               <l>My Task is past, and all my Care is gone.</l>

            <head>A Conclusion.</head>
            <l>BUt He alone, that's free from all defect,</l>
            <l>And only cannot erre (true Wisdom's Sire)</l>
            <l>Can, without error, all in All effect:</l>
            <l>But weak are men in acting their desire.</l>
            <l>This Work is filde, but not without a flaw;</l>
            <l>Yet filde with Pain, Care, Cost, and all in all:</l>
            <l>But (as it were by force of Natures Law)</l>
            <l>It hath some faults, which on the Printers fall.</l>
            <l>No Book so blest, that ever scap'd the Press</l>
            <l>(For ought I ever read, or heard) without;</l>
            <l>Correctors full'st of Art, and Carefulness</l>
            <l>Cannot prevent it; Faults will flee about.</l>
            <l>But here's not many: so, the easier may</l>
            <l>Each gentle Reader rub away their stains:</l>
            <l>Then (when the verbal Blots were done away)</l>
            <l>I hope their profit will exceed their pains.</l>
            <l>Besides, it may be thought a fault in me,</l>
            <l>To have omitted some few differences</l>
            <l>Of Coronets of high'st and low'st degree;</l>
            <l>But this I may not well a fault confess:</l>
            <l>For, 'twixt a Duke and Marquess Coronets</l>
            <l>Is so small odds, as it is scarce discern'd.</l>
            <l>As here i'th' Earl and Vicounts frontilets</l>
            <l>May by judicious Artists now be learn'd,</l>
            <l>Then these are faults that Reason doth excuse,</l>
            <l>And were committed wilfully, because</l>
            <l>Where is no difference there is no abuse</l>
            <l>To Grace, Arms, Nature, Order, or their Laws.</l>
            <l>This breaks no Rule of Order, though there be</l>
            <l>An Order in Degrees concerning This;</l>
            <l>If Order were infring'd, then should I flee</l>
            <l>From my chief purpose, and my Mark should miss.</l>
            <l>ORDER is Natures beauty, and the way</l>
            <l>To Order is by Rules that Art hath found:</l>
            <l>Defect and excess in those Rules bewray,</l>
            <l>Order's defective, Nature's much deform'd.</l>
            <l>But ORDER is the Center of that GOD</l>
            <l>That is unbounded, and All circumscribes;</l>
            <l>Then, if this Work hath any likelyhood</l>
            <l>Of the least good, the good to it ascribes.</l>
            <l>In Truth, Grace, Order, or in any wise</l>
            <l>That tends to Honour, Vertue, Goodness, Grace;</l>
            <l>I have mine ends: and then it shall suffice,</l>
            <l>If with my Work I end my Vital Race:</l>
            <l>And, with the Silk-worm, work me in my Tombe,</l>
            <l>As having done my duty in my Room.</l>
