         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE PRACTICERS OF THE LAW.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in <hi>Bagnal</hi> and <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Caſe, in <hi>Brownl.</hi> 2 <hi>Rep.</hi> is of Opinion, That the third part of this Realm is in Copy-hold. If we conſider the long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Series</hi> of Practice that this Great Man was Converſant in, either at the <hi>Bar</hi> or <hi>Bench,</hi> and to whom perſons from all parts and corners of the Nation reſorted, as to the <hi>Oracle</hi> of the Law, we ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:101302:4"/>
eaſily conceive his Judgment was not Temerarious, but rather that he had good Reaſon for ſuch poſitive conjecture: However, it is moſt certain, That a vaſt number of Eſtates (and thoſe conſiderable too) depend upon no other than Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, in point of Title, and are no other ways preſerved in point of Evidence, then by Copies of <hi>Court Rolls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we find large and very elaborate Volumes publiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eſtates and Tenures at Common Law, and yet very little hath been profeſſedly wrote upon this Subject, tho' ſo great a part of the Lands and Eſtates of this Nation are protected and preſerved by it; which I the more wonder at, for that to know when a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is good and allowable in Law requires a more than ordinary skill, and amongſt the infinity of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms to try them by, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
<pb facs="tcp:101302:4"/>
to apply them to thoſe four ſtanding Eſſentials, <hi>Antiquity, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, Certainty</hi> and <hi>Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is a Work of great Judgment and Dexterity; beſides Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Expoſitions of Grants and Surrenders, the Penalty and fatal Conſequence of Forfeitures under an obſtinate Lord, eſpecially ſuch as are wilful, the nicety and variety of Cuſtoms, ſeem very well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a particular and deſigned Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I remember but two that have profeſſedly handled this piece of Learning, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>Compleat Copy-holder,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp</hi> in his <hi>Readings,</hi> which tho' they are done with good Judgment, yet, as they do totally omit many Titles which are of great Uſe, ſo they extend to very few more Caſes than thoſe which are amaſt together in the 4th Report; ſince
<pb facs="tcp:101302:5"/>
which we have thouſands of Caſes Argued and Debated, and ſome Points ſtarted which are <hi>primae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſionis</hi>; and in truth it is not fit to croud ſo much excellent Learning, and of ſuch general Uſe into a <hi>Manual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Treatiſe you will find <hi>Totum Domini &amp; Totum Tenentis.</hi> The Lord may ſee his power (tho' moderated) and the Tenant may underſtand his Duty and his Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For <hi>Tempora mutantur</hi>; when <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> wrote, poor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holders <hi>tempeſtive &amp; intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive pro voluntate Domini poſſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumi &amp; revocari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Lord now is not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned like a <hi>Grand Seigniour,</hi> whoſe Proceedings are Arbitrary and his Humors Laws; no, he is a mixt Monarch, he is bound up by the Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions of his little Empire. 'Tis true, they are Tenants <hi>Ad voluntatem
<pb facs="tcp:101302:5"/>
Domini,</hi> yet this Will is abridged, clogged and reſtrained <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem Manerii.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learning of Copy-holds is ſubtle and curious, in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Pleadings. As for the purpoſe, That great Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and how Copy-holds may be Intayled, has been Argued with great ſubtilty and penetration, as you may read <hi>Popham, p.</hi> 32. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>Cro. Car.</hi> 42. <hi>Rowden</hi> and <hi>Malſter</hi>'s Caſe. And in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Reports</hi> 22. <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Shaw</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
            <p>Now the mentioning of this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> hath preſented me with an Anſwer to what I foreſee will be imputed as Faults to me.</p>
            <p>In ſome Caſes I am thought too tedious, and write a great part thereof <hi>Verbatim,</hi> and I think I have reaſon ſo to do (tho' that is but ſeldom.) The reaſon of ſome Caſes will ill bear abſtracting; as,
<pb facs="tcp:101302:6"/>
to Inſtance in that Great Man's Reports, I mean my Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> and Mr. Juſtice <hi>Yelverton</hi>'s Caſes. They that can ſatisfie themſelves with half a Caſe, let them dabble in thoſe ſilly Abridgments of <hi>Moor, Croke,</hi> &amp;c. I was always of this mind, That in the gelding a cloſe and well compacted Argument, the Vigour of it is in a great meaſure dwindled and emaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>Another Crime perhaps may be, that I cite one Caſe two or three times; and I do ſo when I meet with a copious prolifick Caſe, which brancheth it ſelf into ſeveral Points, I thought it more Intelligible and Methodical to Graft each Shoot into its proper Title, whether it be a point in Law, or a Formality in Pleading.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101302:6"/>But not to ſpend time in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Apologies for Crimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps which I ſhall never be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I <hi>ſurrender</hi> the whole to your Uſe, and hope thereby to gain <hi>Admittance</hi> into your favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opinion.</p>

               <note place="margin">Original of Manors.</note>As for the Original of Manors, Take this brief Account out of <hi>Perkins,</hi> 670. <hi>Horns Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> Lib. 1. Cap. <hi>de Roy Alfred. Fulbeck, f.</hi> 18. <hi>Lambert, verbo Thaine. Bacon</hi>'s <hi>Elements of the Law,</hi> 41, 42, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ancient Kings of this Realm, who had all the Lands of <hi>England</hi> in Demeſn (that is, in their own Hands, or totally at their own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal) did grant a certain compaſs or circuit of Ground upon ſome great Perſonages, with liberty to parcel out the Lands to other inferior Tenants, reſerving ſuch Duties and Services as they thought fit, with power to keep Courts, where they might redreſs Miſdemeanors, within ſuch their Precincts, and decide Controverſies of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> within their Juriſdictions; theſe Lords and Noblemen performing ſuch Services, and paying and yielding ſuch Rents, as the ſaid Kings by their Grants reſerved. Theſe Grantees were called Barons, and were ſuch as came to Parliament, and from thence it keeps the name of <hi>Court Baron</hi> to this day, though in proceſs of time, by the Grants of ſuch Barons, theſe Lands and Manors came into the Hands of meaner Men by Purchaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is at this day.</p>
            <p>And according to this our Cuſtom, all Lands holden in Fee throughout <hi>France</hi> are divided into Feifs, and Arrear-Feifs; into Feifs or Knights Fees, and Meſne Fees, whereof the former are ſuch as were granted by the King, the ſecond ſuch as the Kings Feudatories do again grant to others.</p>
            <p>Now by Juſtice <hi>Winch,</hi> in his Argument in the Caſe of <hi>Rowles</hi> and <hi>Maſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Brownlow,</hi> 195. Manors are divided into three ſorts of Tenures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt holds by Knight Service, and this is for defence of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101302:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. The ſecond holds by Socage, and this is to Plow and Manure the Demeſns of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince turn'd into Rent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third holds by baſe Tenure, and theſe are at the will of the Lord, and theſe were to do Services, and ſome had greater Priviledges than others, to encourage them to perform their Services, as it is in <hi>Ireland</hi> at this day. Out of theſe, by length of time and Cuſtom, ſprang up the Race of Copy-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>For the Name or Etymology of the word Manor,<note place="margin">Etymology.</note> ſome fancy it to be <hi>Manerium quaſi Manurium,</hi> from manuring the Ground; and then it takes its Name either from the Lords Demeſns, which the Tenants are bound to Manure, or from the Lands remaining in the Tenants hands; and others (with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) think it to be derived from the French word <hi>Meſner,</hi> to govern or guide, becauſe the Lord hath the government of the Tenants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Juriſdiction. But that I may come to the thing intended (and to leave the flouriſhes of gueſs and fancy)</p>
            <p>It is a Maxim common in our Books,<note place="margin">
                  <p>Of what a Manor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Demeſns, what.</p>
               </note> That a Manor conſiſts of Demeſns and Services.</p>
            <p>As for the word Demeſns, <hi>Dominicum,</hi> or <hi>Domainium,</hi> it is taken it two ſenſes. It is moſt properly taken for thoſe Lands which remain in the Kings hands, and ſo all Subjects are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being ſeized in <hi>Dominico,</hi> and we have little of that now but ancient Demeſn Lands, which are ſuch as were in the hands of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor. But in a ſenſe leſs proper, Demeſn Lands may be ſaid to be in the hands of an inferior Lord or Tenant, and as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> on <hi>Littleton,</hi> f. obſerves, the form of Pleading ſhews this difference;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101302:15"/>
for an inferior Lord or Tenant never pleads, That he is ſeized in <hi>Dominico</hi> abſolutely, but qualified with this addition, <hi>in dominico ſuo ut de feodo</hi>;<note place="margin">Pleading.</note> and the word Fee or Feif implies that his Eſtate is not abſolute, but depending on ſome ſuperior Lord. So that Copy-hold Land may well be parcel of the Demeſns, and the Frank-tenements are reſting in the Lord, but indeed the cuſtomary Inheritance is in the Copy-holder, and he ſhall plead, That he is ſeized (with this farther addition) <hi>In Dominico ſuo ut de feodo ſecundum conſuetudinem Manerij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Services.</note>As for Services, whether Corporeal, Annual, or Accidental, they are Duties accrewing to the Lord by reaſon of his Seigniory. And reſpecting Copy-holds, I ſhall under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Titles hereafter ſpeak of Herriots, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, Amerciaments and Fines for not doing Suit and Service, and the like.</p>
            <p>It was ingeniouſly ſaid by <hi>Doddridge,</hi> in <hi>Herns</hi> and <hi>Strouds</hi> Caſe, <hi>Latch,</hi> 63. That no Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a Manor more than a Rectory: as a Manor is intire ſo is a Rectory, and the Glebe Lands reſemble the Demeſns, and the Tythes the Services.</p>
            <p>If I let my Manor excepting the Demeſns, the Exception is void, <hi>Winch</hi> p. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Deſcription of a Manor.</note>The New <hi>Expoſitor</hi> of Law-Terms, deſcribes a Manor, as a thing compounded of divers things; as of an Houſe, Land, Arable, Paſture, Meadow, Wood, Rent, Advowſon, Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and the like; and this ought to be by long continuance of Time, to the contrary whereof Man's Memory cannot occur.</p>
            <p>So that a Manor conſiſts of Demeſns and Services,<note place="margin">Manor not made at this day.</note> and a Court Baron as Incident, and this muſt be time out of Memory, <hi>for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor cannot be made at this day,</hi> becauſe <hi>a Court

A Court Baron is incident to a Manor, as a Court of <hi>Pye-powders</hi> to a Fair.

            <p>Now though a Man cannot make a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at this day, yet he may make Gifts in Tayl, reſerving a Tenure and Suit of Court,<note place="margin">Yet a Tenure may be created.</note> becauſe, though he may create a Tenure, yet he may not create a Court, and a Court cannot be but with a continuance time out of mind, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Broke Tenure,</hi> 102.</p>
            <p>A Manor, as I ſaid before, may not be made at this day, neither by a common perſon,<note place="margin">The King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Manor, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at this day.</note> nor by the King himſelf; and the King cannot make a thing parcel of a Manor at this day; as if he grants Lands to hold of him, as of the Manor of <hi>Greenwich,</hi> by a certain Rent, this Rent is not parcel of the Manor. Yet though a Seigniory or Appendancy cannot be made at this day, yet if an Advowſon be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant to a Manor,<note place="margin">Advowſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</note> and the Lord grants part of the Manor with the Advowſon to <hi>J.

            <p>THE Stile of a Copy-holder imports three things, according to my Lord <hi>Coke Lit.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nomen,</hi> his Name, and that is Tenant by the Copy of Court Roll, not Tenant by the Court Roll, but Tenant by the Copy of Court Roll; and he is the only Tenant in Law which holds by the Copy of any Record, Deed, or Charter, or any other thing; foraſmuch as the Title or Eſtate of the Copy-holder is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Roll, whereof the Steward delivereth him a Copy, thereof he is called a Copy-holder. But by the Cuſtom of <hi>Godmancheſter</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> they paſs their Eſtates, by writing on wooden Indented Tallies.</p>

            <p>Copy-hold at Common Law is but an Eſtate at Will; but the Common Law ſo takes notice as to eſtabliſh it by Cuſtom, that there may be a <hi>poſſeſſio fratris</hi> of it, and he may have Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt his Lord.

                  <hi>Conſuetudo privat communem Legem.</hi> Cuſtom is a ground and need not be proved, for the reaſon of every Cuſtom cannot be ſhewed, as it was ſaid in <hi>Knightly</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Caſe: But though Cuſtom takes away Common Law, yet Common Law corrects, allows, and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows both Statute Law and Cuſtom; for if there be repugnancy in Statute, or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in Cuſtom, the Common Law diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and rejects it, as appears in Dr. <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe, 8 <hi>Coke</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>Now Cuſtom being the life and ſoul of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold Eſtates, I ſhall in the next Chapter largely treat thereof in the full extent of it.</p>

               <head>Maxims of Cuſtoms.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A Cuſtom ſhall in conſtruction be taken ſtrictly, and ſhall not be extended beyond the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101302:26"/>
words of it. One intituled himſelf to a Copy-hold in this manner, That within the Manor there is ſuch a Cuſtom, that if one taketh to Wife any cuſtomary Tenant of the Manor in Fee, and hath Iſſue by her, if he over-live the ſaid Wife, he ſhall be Tenant by the Curteſie. The Caſe was, he married a Wife, who at the time of the marriage had no Copy-hold; but afterwards, during the Coverture, a Copy-hold deſcended to her. It was held in Sir <hi>John Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi> Caſe, cited in <hi>Beal</hi> and <hi>Langly</hi>'s Caſe, 2 <hi>Leon p.</hi> 208. That no Tenancy by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie did accrew by the Cuſtom, which did not extend, but where the Wife was a Copy-holder at the Marriage. So a Cuſtom was, If a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder in Fee dyes, having Iſſue Three Daughters, the eldeſt ſhall have all. The Caſe was, A Purchaſer of a Copy-hold dyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, having many Siſters, they ſhall be C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>parceners, for the Cuſtom extends only to Daughters. So <hi>Burrough Engliſh,</hi> The middle Brother Purchaſeth Lands, and dyes <hi>ſans Iſſue,</hi> the eldeſt ſhall have it and not the youngeſt, 2 <hi>Rolls Rep.</hi> 368. So a Cuſtom which goes in bar or deprivation of an Eſtate, ſhall be taken ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Carter</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 87, 88. <hi>Yelv. p.</hi> 1. <hi>Baſpool</hi>'s Caſe. Forfeiture of a Copy-hold for Life, ſhall not forfeit the Remainder. Cuſtom was, If any Copy-holder in Fee Surrender out of Court, and the <hi>Ceſty que uſe</hi> doth not come into Court to take his Copy-hold, after three Proclamations, then the Lord ſhall ſeize it, as forfeited: And if a Copy-holder in Fee ſurrender to the uſe of one for Life, remainder over in Fee, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for Life comes not in Court upon the Proclamations, this ſhall not forfeit the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, The Cuſtom ſhall be taken ſtrictly, being in deſtruction of an Eſtate, and it ſhall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101302:27"/>
be intended only of a Tenant in Fee, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and not in remainder, 1 <hi>Rolls Abr.</hi> 568. <hi>Baſpool</hi> and <hi>Long.</hi> And yet it ſhall not be taken li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally always, as in the common Caſe. Cuſtom to grant Lands in Fee-ſimple, yet they may grant in Tayl, for Life or Years; but that ſtands upon this Rule, <hi>Omne majus includit in ſe minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Cuſtoms are to conſtrued according to vulgar apprehenſion, becauſe Cuſtoms grow ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and are bred and brought up amongſt the Lay-gents, therefore they are called <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gares Conſuetudines,</hi> and they ſhall be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the moſt effectual operation of the Law, <hi>Stiles</hi> 146.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Cuſtom does not trench to things collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Eſtate; ſuch as Entries for Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Copy-holder by Licence lets the Land for 60 years rendring Rent, upon condition of re-entry; Copy-holder ſurrenders to <hi>J. S.</hi> in Fee, who demands the Rent, which not being paid, Enters: His entry <hi>per Cur.</hi> is not good, for Copy-hold Land is not within the Statute of Conditions; nor the Surrender of ſuch a Copy-hold, ſuch an Aſſignee as the Statute intends, he being in only by Cuſtom, is not privy to the Leaſe made by the firſt Copy-holder, nor in by him, but may plead his Eſtate immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Lord, <hi>Yelv. p.</hi> 222. <hi>Braſier</hi> and <hi>Beal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When a Cuſtom warrants a greater Eſtate, it warrants a leſs. The Cuſtom was, That Copy-hold Lands may be granted to any perſon in Fee-ſimple; A Grant to one and the Heirs of his Body is within this Cuſtom: So a Grant for Life or Years: And a Fee-ſimple includes all, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 23. The Cuſtom is to grant for one, two or three Lives; A Grant to one <hi>durante viduitate</hi> is good, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 29. <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Hopkins. Cro. El. p.</hi> 323. <hi>meſme</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101302:27"/>5. Cuſtom of a Manor cannot extend out of a Manor; therefore it ought to appear in Pleading, That the <hi>Locus in quo, &amp;c. eſt infra Manerium, Hobart, p.</hi> 286. <hi>Roberts</hi> and <hi>Young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Cuſtom may enlarge a Grant farther than Common Law; as, <hi>Sibi &amp; ſuis.</hi> So to one and his Heirs, by Cuſtom may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to particular Heirs, 2 <hi>Keb.</hi> 158.174.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If a Cuſtom hath a reaſonable commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it may be good. And therefore a Cuſtom for Copy-holders to have, <hi>ſolam &amp; ſeparalem paſturam,</hi> may have a reaſonable commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by voluntary Agreement of the Lord with his Copy-holders, to induce them to hold their cuſtomary Eſtates at Will, and beſtow their pains and labour in improvement, <hi>Sanders</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 326, 327. <hi>Robins</hi> and <hi>Hoskins. Vide Vaughan Rep. North</hi> and <hi>Coe,</hi> good reaſons for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. What may be claimed by Preſcription may be good by Cuſtom, and what may have commencement by Grant, may be claimed by Preſcription, 2 <hi>Sanders</hi> 326.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Cuſtom never extendeth to a thing newly created. If there be a Cuſtom within a Manor, That for every Houſe or Cottage two ſhillings Fine ſhall be paid; now if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant make two Houſes of one, he ſhall pay no Fine, for the new made Houſe; But alteration of Rooms alters not the caſe in Preſcription.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Cuſtom is an entire thing, and cannot be apportioned; yet this Rule ſhall not bind-the King. <hi>Vide ſupra.</hi>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Antiquity.</hi> Every Cuſtom had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, although the Memory of man doth not extend to it. And this is one of the grand Pillars of Copy-hold Eſtates: Therefore in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſay ſuch Lands or Tenements are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and demiſable, <hi>A tempore cujus contrarij memoria hominum non exiſtit.</hi> And yet this Rule fails in the Kings Caſe; <hi>vide ſupra.</hi> It was ſaid by <hi>Rolls</hi> Chief Juſtice in <hi>Pilkington</hi> and <hi>Bagſhaw</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Stiles</hi> 450. That a Cuſtom cannot be urged for a thing that had its beginning ſince the time of <hi>Richard</hi> 1. if a Record can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the contrary. But what meaſure of time ſhall make a Cuſtom, many differ: Some judge it from the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 1. to the Stat. of <hi>Merton, Cap.</hi> 8. which appointeth the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in a Writ of Right, and others ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And by the Statute <hi>W.</hi> 1. the Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was from the time of <hi>R.</hi> 1. and theſe are Limitations as to Writs; but this is ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">What ſhall be ſaid time out of memory.</note> which is reduced to ſixty years next before the Teſte of the Writ. But the true meaſure is <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Rule, Where a Cuſtom hath been uſed ſo long that man's Memory cannot remember the contrary; that is, when ſuch a thing is pleaded that no man then living hath heard or known any proof
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101302:28"/>
to the contrary; for if there be any ſufficient proof of Record or Writing to the contrary, albeit it exceed the memory of any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet it is within the memory of man; and therefore, regularly a man cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe or alledge a Cuſtom againſt a Statute, for that is the higheſt Record, but affirmative Acts do not take away a Cuſtom. If Land hath been demiſed by Copy for fifty years, and yet ſome alive remember the ſame occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by Indenture, this is not a good Copy, hold: And if Land hath been demiſed by 40 years by Copy, and none alive can remember the ſame to be otherwiſe demiſed, this is a good Copy. But ſixty, or eighty, or an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years may make a good Limitation, <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp</hi>'s Reading. <hi>Coke Lit.</hi> 114, 115.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Continuance.</hi> Cuſtom ought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance without interruption, time out of memory; for if it be diſcontinued time out memory, the Cuſtom is gone. As if a Copy-hold be let by the Lord for life or for years, according to the courſe of the Common Law, it ſhall never be demiſed as Copy-hold, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom afterwards. <hi>Conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſemel reprobata non poteſt amplius induci</hi>; and as Continuance makes the Cuſtom, ſo diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance deſtroys it. The Continuance for fifty years is enough to faſten cuſtomary Conditions upon the Land againſt the Lord: And <hi>per Cur.</hi> Though the original Commencement and the cuſtomary Intereſt did commence 10 <hi>H.</hi> 8. from which time ſixty years paſſed, yet the ſeizure for a Forfeiture in the mean time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted utterly the Continuance from the time which might by the Law have perfected the cuſtomary Intereſt.<note place="margin">What ſhall be ſaid an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a cuſtomary Eſtate, or not.</note> Within the time of forty ſeven years, a cuſtomary Intereſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be Attached upon the Land, 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 107. <hi>Tavernor</hi> and <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Lord of a Manor is ſeized of an ancient Copy-hold for Forfeiture, or by Eſcheat, and let the ſame at Will, without Copy, for divers years; this is not any interruption of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary nature of the Land, but that he may grant it again by Copy. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Interruption.</note>If cuſtomary Land hath been of ancient time grantable in Fee, and now of late times, for the ſpace of forty years, the Lord hath granted the ſame for Life only; yet he may, if he pleaſe, reſort to his ancient Cuſtom, and grant it in Fee, 1 <hi>Leon. p.</hi> 56. <hi>Kemp</hi> and <hi>Carter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Cuſtomary Land within a Manor hath been grantable in Fee and it Eſcheats, the Lord may grant the ſame to another for Life; for the Cuſtom which enables him to grant in Fee, ſhall enable him to grant for Life; and after the death of Tenant <hi>pur vie,</hi> the Lord may grant the ſame again in Fee, for the grant for Life was not any interruption of the Cuſtom, 1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 56. <hi>id.</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Certainty.</hi> Cuſtom ought to be certain, for <hi>incerta pro nullis habentur.</hi> 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Fitzh. dum fuit infra aetatem,</hi> 3. A Writ of <hi>Dum fuit infra aetatem</hi> was brought againſt an Infant, the Tenant pleads a Cuſtom, That when the Infant is within ſuch an Age as that he may count twelve Pence, or meaſure an Ell of Cloth, that then his Feoffment ſhall be good; this Cuſtom is adjudged void for the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.<note place="margin">Why an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom ſhall be void.</note> Now the Reaſons why an uncertain Cuſtom ſhall be void, are 1. Becauſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain thing may not be continued time out of memory. 2. A man cannot preſcribe in a thing which may not at the beginning be well granted, and an uncertain thing cannot well
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101302:29"/>
commence by Grant. And if Tenants of a Manor preſcribe that they ought not to pay for a Fine to renew their Copy-hold Eſtates, more than the Rent of two years, but ought to pay the Rent for two years or leſs; this is not a good Preſcription for the uncertainty, for ſometimes they are to pay two years Rent, and ſometimes leſs, 2 <hi>Rolls Abridg.</hi> 264, 265. <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Berry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Cuſtom muſt be reaſonable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt not be againſt common Right, or purely againſt the Law of the Land, as is <hi>Littleton</hi>'s Caſe. The Lord preſcibes, That there hath been a Cuſtom within his Manor, that every Tenant, who marries his Daughter without Licence of the Lord, ſhall make Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Preſcription is void, it is againſt the freedom of a Freeman, who is not bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by particular Tenure. <hi>Alit.</hi> if it be upon a ſpecial Reſervation of Gift of Lands, or Tenure in Villanage, <hi>Lit. Sect.</hi> 209. So in <hi>Sect.</hi> 212. To preſcribe that the Lord of the Manor hath uſed to diſtrain Cattel Damage feaſant, and to retain the Diſtreſs, till Fine were made to him for the Damages, at his will: This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is void, for its againſt reaſon a man ſhould be Judge in his own Cauſe. If the Lord will preſcribe to have of every Copy-holder belonging to his Manor, for every Court he keepeth, a certain Sum of Mony, this is a void Preſcription, becauſe it is not according to common Right, for he ought to do it <hi>gratis,</hi> for Juſtice ſake. But if the Lord Preſcribe to have a certain Fee of his Tenants, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extraordinary Court, which is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed only for the benefit of ſome particular Tenants to take up their Copy-holds, and ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101302:30"/>
like, this is a good Preſcription, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to common Right, <hi>Coke, Cop.</hi> 81.</p>
               <p>But now to diſtinguiſh what Cuſtoms are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and what not, obſerve theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>Every Cuſtom is not unreaſonable which is contrary to a particular Rule or Maxim of the poſitive Law. For its a Rule <hi>Conſuetudo ex certa cauſa rationabili privat communem Legem.</hi> As the Cuſtoms of Gavel-kind and Burrough Engliſh, are againſt the Maxim of deſcent of Inheritance, and the Maxim of Eſcheat; as in <hi>Kent,</hi> the Father to the Bough, and the Son to the Plow. So the Cuſtom that the Wife ſhall have the whole for her free Bench, is againſt the Maxim of Common Law for Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Theſe Cuſtoms might have a reaſonable beginning, where they are not prejudicial to the Common-wealth, nor to the preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of any particular perſon; yet a Cuſtom may be prejudicial to the Intereſt of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, and reaſonable alſo, where it is for the benefit of the Common-wealth in general, as to make Bulwarks upon another mans Land in time of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Cuſtom, which is contrary to the publick Good, or injurious to a Multitude, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial only to ſome particular Perſon; ſuch Cuſtom is repugnant to the Law of Reaſon, and void <hi>ab initio,</hi> and no Preſcription can make it good; therefore the Cuſtom of a Manor was, That no Commoner ſhould put in his Beaſts till the Lord had put in his, and it was adjudged void, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4.24. For if the Lord would never put in his Beaſt, the Commoners ſhould loſe their Common. As to Cuſtoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonable or unreaſonable, <hi>vide</hi> ſeveral more inſtances in the Argument of <hi>Rolls</hi> and

               <p>Cuſtom, Preſcription, and Uſage, are of great Affinity, yet they differ thus:</p>
               <p>Cuſtom is where by continuance of time a Right is obtained concerning divers perſons in Common.</p>
               <p>Preſcription is where by continuance of time one particular perſon obtaineth Right againſt another, either a Perſon or Body Politick.</p>
               <p>Uſage is by continuance of time, and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe of both.</p>
               <p>Limitation is where a Right may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of Non-claim, by the ſpace of a certain number of years, <hi>Calthrops</hi> Reading.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Preſcription, is made in the Perſon, and ſo the Pleading is, That he and all his Anceſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or he and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath time out of mind, uſed to have Common of Paſture in ſuch a place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being the Land of ſome other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as pertaining to the ſaid Manor.

And in <hi>Gateward</hi>'s Caſe, a thing lying properly in Preſcription, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon did in that Caſe, being an Intereſt which muſt inhere in ſome body,<note place="margin">Common for Copy-holders in the Lords Soyl muſt be pleaded by a Cuſtom in the Soyl of another by Preſcription.</note> cannot be pleaded by way of Cuſtom, as there they would have made it for Inhabitants, that are not perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to Preſcribe; but yet Common for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holders in the Lords Soyl, is allowed to be pleaded by Cuſtom, for neceſſities ſake; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Soyl of another, it muſt be laid by Preſcription in the Lord, and yet the nature of both is a Preſcription; but a matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge may be laid by way of Cuſtom, for that is not an Intereſt but an Exemption;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101302:33"/>
thus that great man, my Lord <hi>Hobart, p.</hi> 86. in <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Savage</hi> his Caſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the Argument of <hi>Rowls</hi> and <hi>Maſon</hi>'s Caſe, makes four differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Preſcription and Cuſtom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the beginning, <hi>pugnant ex diametro,</hi> for nothing may be good by Preſcription, but that which may have beginning by Grant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Preſcription is incident to the Perſon, and Cuſtom to ſome Place, and holds place in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſes which cannot be by Grant. As Lands may be deviſed by Cuſtom: So Gavel-kind and Burrough Engliſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot have their beginning by Grant. But Preſcription and Cuſtom are Brothers, and ought to have the ſame Age, and Reaſon ought to be the Father, and Congruence the Mother, and Uſe the Nurſe, and Time out of Memory to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They vary in Quality; for Preſcription is for one man only, and Cuſtom for many, if all but one be not dead.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They vary in Extent and Latitude; for Preſcription extends to Fee-ſimple only, but Cuſtom extends to all Intereſts and Eſtates whatſoever, as appears by the Pleading. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription that a Copy-holder of Inheritance may ſell the Trees, is not good, but ſuch a Cuſtom is good. Tenant in Tayl for Life or Years cannot Preſcribe in a <hi>Que Eſtate,</hi> nor againſt the Lord in his Demeſns,<note place="margin">Who may preſcribe in a <hi>Que Eſtate</hi> or not.</note> but they ought to alledge the Cuſtom, and againſt a Stranger they ought to Preſcribe in the name of the Lord, 2 <hi>Brownl.</hi> 198.</p>
               <p>In a Manor the Cuſtom was, That every Copy-holder for Life, had Eſtovers for Fuel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the cuſtomary Lands: Now if the Lord aliens the Woods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Fee, and after Grant
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101302:33"/>
Copy-hold Lands and Houſes for Lives, the Grantees ſhall have Common of Eſtovers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding the Severance; but after ſuch Severance of the Waſte or Woods,<note place="margin">Common is due to the Copy-holder, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Severance by the Lord, and how to be pleaded.</note> the Copy-holder, when he would entitle himſelf to Common or Eſtovers, the Copy-holder ſhall not plead generally, <hi>Quod infra Manerium praed. talis habetur, &amp;c. conſuetudo, &amp;c.</hi> for after the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, this Waſte or Wood is not within the Manor, but abſolutely divided from it; but he ſhall plead, That until ſuch a time (<hi>viz.</hi>) before the Severance <hi>Talis habebatur &amp; a toto tempore, &amp;c. conſuetudo, &amp;c.</hi> and then ſhew the Severance, as in <hi>Murrel</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> So he muſt do where the Lord aliens the Freehold and Inheritance of the Copy-holder, <hi>Swain</hi>'s Caſe, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid a Preſcription goeth to one man, and a Cuſtom to many, 1 <hi>Brownl. Rep.</hi> 133. in <hi>Rowls</hi> and <hi>Maſon</hi>; and yet in <hi>Foyſtons</hi> Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> the Cuſtom for Common may be applied to one ſingle Copy-holder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Allegation of a Cuſtom ſhall ſerve when it is referred to a thing inſenſible, as that ſuch Lands are deviſable, <hi>&amp;c. Foyſtons</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more common than for the Lord to Preſcribe for his Tenants, by Copy in another mans Land, whereas if it be laid in his own, it ſhall ever be laid by Cuſtom, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart, p.</hi> 286. <hi>Roberts</hi> and <hi>Young.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a difference between a Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Freehold Land and for Copy-hold Land; for Cuſtom which concerneth Freehold,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription for Freehold Land and for Copy-hold Land.</note> ought to be throughout the County, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in a particular place, 45 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription concerning Copy-hold Land, is good in one particular, <hi>Cro. El. p.</hi> 353. <hi>Taverner</hi> and <hi>Cromwel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:101302:34"/>4. A Preſcription muſt be in a thing done, and not in <hi>poſſe,</hi> therefore a Cuſtom that <hi>Quaeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet femina vira cooperta poterit deviſare,</hi> her Copy-hold Inheritance to her Husband, is not good, 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 83. <hi>Skipwith</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>To Cuſtoms and Preſcriptions, theſe two things are inſeparable Incidents, <hi>viz.</hi> Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Uſage,<note place="margin">Interruption in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the right.</note> and Time. Poſſeſſion muſt be <hi>Longa, continua &amp; pacifica.</hi> Now obſerve, a Title once gained by Cuſtom or Preſcription cannot be loſt by interruption of the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ten or twenty years; but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Right. As if a man hath had a Rent or Common by Preſcription, unity of Poſſeſſion of as high and perdurable Eſtate, is an interruption in the Right, <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 114. <hi>b.</hi> And if a man hath Common by Preſcription and takes a Leaſe of the Land for twenty years, the Common is ſuſpended for that time, and after the years ended, he may claim the Common again by Preſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſonal Preſcription, and in that Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants may Preſcribe, as for a Way, or matter of Eaſe or Diſcharge, <hi>Gateward</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Real Preſcription, and this is inherent to the Eſtate, and this is where a man Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, That he and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Local Preſcription, not as to Land, but to the Eſtate, and therefore the Cuſtom was, That the Copy-holder ſhould have Common in the Waſte of the Lord; the Lord by Deed confirms to a Copy-holder, to have to him and his Heirs, with its Appurtenances.

               <p>A Surrender is a giving up of the Land by the Tenant to the Lord, according to the Cuſtom, to the uſe of him that is to have the Eſtate, and is entred in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The form thus, according to Mr. <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton.</hi>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Surrender to the Lord is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without expreſſing any Eſtate, for that he is but an Inſtrument to admit <hi>Ceſty que uſe</hi>; for no more paſſeth to the Lord, but to ſerve the Limitation of the Uſe, and <hi>Ceſty que uſe,</hi> when he is admitted, ſhall be in by him that made the Surrender, and not by the Lord.</p>
               <p>And therefore if Copyholder in Fee Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the uſe of another for Life, nothing more paſſeth from him, but what ſhall ſerve the Eſtate limited to uſe, 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 107. <hi>Podger</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>A Surrender is in nature of a Deed Poll, rather than of an Indenture, and enures by way of limitation of uſe, 1 <hi>Sanders</hi> 151.</p>
               <p>If a Copy-holder Tenant Surrender to the uſe of himſelf, <hi>Habend.</hi> to him and his Wife, and the Heirs of their Bodies, it ſeems this is void; for it is in nature of a Grant at Common Law, for ſhe was not named in the Premiſſes, 2 <hi>Rolls Abr.</hi> 67. <hi>Brooks</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Vide infra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Surrender is to this purpoſe, that the Lord ſhould not be a Stranger to his Tenant.</p>
               <p>A Surrender is but a Conveyance by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and no higher, and therefore where Surrenderer is Infant, and dyes, his Heir ſhall enter, <hi>Cro. El.</hi> 90. <hi>Knights</hi>'s Caſe.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Implication is not good in a Surrender, though it be in a Will.

               <p n="3">3. It is the general Cuſtom of the Realm, That every Copy-holder may Surrender in Court, and need not to alledge any Cuſtom therefore; ſo if out of Court he Surrender to the Lord himſelf, he need not in Pleading alledge any Cuſtom; but if he Surrender out of Court into the Hands of the Lord, by the Hands of two or three Copy-holders, or by the Hands of the Bayliff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by the Hands of

                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:101302:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>The Aſſurance of Copy-hold Land from one man to another (who is not Lord) muſt be made by Copy of Court Roll, according to the Cuſtom, and this muſt be by Surrender, and for the perfecting thereof muſt be Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Admittance generally. For,</p>
               <p>If I would have my Eſtate paſs according to my Will, I cannot deviſe this Copy-hold by Will, but muſt ſurrender it to the uſe of my laſt Will, and in my Will I muſt declare my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

               <p>If I would Exchange Copy-hold Land with another, I cannot do it by Deed of Exchange, but we may Surrender it each to other, and the Lord ſhall admit us accordingly.</p>
               <p>But Copy-hold Eſtates in ſome Caſes may paſs and be transferred from one to another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Surrender, and that by Releaſe:<note place="margin">Copy-hold in ſome Caſes may paſs otherwiſe than by Surrender.</note> But then we muſt obſerve this difference between a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe that enures by way of extinguiſhment, or by way of an enlargement of an Eſtate.</p>
               <p>By Releaſe ſometimes a Copy-hold may be transferred when it enures by way of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment,<note place="margin">As by Releaſe.</note> and ſo may ſerve to drown a Copy-hold Right. As for the purpoſe, A man is admitted upon a void Preſentment, and where the Preſentment and Admittance is not according to the Surrender; as where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment is abſolute and the Surrender conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and ſo void; It was reſolved that the Admmittee had a cuſtomary Eſtate by Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and is in by Title, and is capable of a Releaſe from him who had the right; and here is a cuſtomary Eſtate upon which the Releaſe may well be grounded; beſides the Lord is not prejudiced, he being ſatisfied his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101302:63"/>
Fine upon the Admittance. So if I am ouſted of a Copy-hold, and the Lord admit the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſor, according to the Cuſtom, a Releaſe made by me will extinguiſh my right. But if one be diſſeiſed of a Copy-hold Eſtate, a Releaſe by the Diſſeiſee to the Diſſeiſor is void, for this is a prejudice to the Lord in loſing his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance Fine, if it ſhould be good, and there is no cuſtomary Right upon which a Releaſe ſhould enure, there never having been Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as was in the other Caſe: So is <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Hetly, p.</hi> 150.</p>
               <p>But a man cannot paſs a Copy-hold Eſtate by way of Leaſe and Releaſe, becauſe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe enures by way of enlargement of Eſtate, and to transfer an Intereſt, but this muſt be by a Leaſe for a Year (which is warranted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and by Surrender of the Reverſion into the hands of the Lord, and he to grant it over to the Leſſee.</p>

               <head>Of Admittances upon Surrender.</head>
               <p>The nature of it will be Explained by two or three Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The ſurrender of a Copy-hold to <hi>J. S.</hi> hath no effect till <hi>J.

S.</hi> himſelf had nothing, and ſo can paſs nothing, and the Admittance of his Grantee ſhall not be taken by implication as Admittance to himſelf, for the Admittance ought to be of a Tenant certainly known to the Steward, and entred in a Roll by it ſelf, and in ſuch caſe the Right and Poſſeſſion remains ſtill in him who ſurrendered, and deſcends to his Heir; he to whom the Copy-hold is ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, comes in as a Purchaſer, and his Copy is his Evidence by the Cuſtom, and till he is admitted, he can be no cuſtomary Tenant, and therefore can transfer no right to another, <hi>Yelverton</hi> 145. <hi>Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Weddel.</hi> 1 <hi>Brownlow</hi> 143. <hi>Aliter</hi> in Caſe of Deſcent, <hi>Vide infra.</hi> The Admittance of a Copy-holder is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Induction to a Benefice, which

gives Poſſeſſion. At the end of <hi>Popham, p.</hi> 127, 121. <hi>Rawlinſon</hi> and <hi>Green,</hi> That Caſe was, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder ſurrendred his Copy-hold Eſtate to the Uſe of another, which was preſented at next Court, and found by the Homage, and he to whoſe Uſe the Surrender was made, was there in Court accepted by the Steward, and a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py by him granted unto him; afterwards he to whoſe Uſe this Surrender was made, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders the ſame again to the Uſe of another, which was preſented, and a Copy granted to him, and he accepted as a Copy-hold Tenant, but no Admittance Entred, as <hi>Cepit de Dom. &amp; admiſſus eſt inde tenens, &amp;c.

It was granted, That if the Steward accepted a Fine as of a Copy-holder, it amounted to an Admittance, 3 <hi>Bulſtr.</hi> 237. <hi>meſme</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Surrenders of Copy-holds are not to be likened to Surrenders at Common Law; for if a Copy-holder in Fee ſurrenders to the Uſe of another for Life, nothing more paſſeth out of him than ſhall ſerve the Eſtate limited to the Uſe, and he which made the Surrender ſhall not pay any Fine for re-Admittance to the Reverſion, for this continues always in him, 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 107. <hi>Margaret Podgers</hi> Caſe.</p>

               <p>If a man ſurrender to the Uſe of <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. D.</hi> for their Lives, the Remainder over to another; and <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J.

               <p>Of the Entayling of Copy-hold Eſtates. The different Opinion of the Judges, with an Abſtract of the Reaſons and Arguments how Copy-holds are or may be Entayled, and the Law ſetled as to that Point. How ſuch Copy-hold Entayls may be barred or dock'd. And what acts of Tenant Copy-holder in Tayl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall amount to a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance or not.</p>
            </argument>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Copy-hold Eſtates being Entayled.</head>
               <p>AS to Copy-hold Lands being Entayled, whether there be any ſuch Eſtate Tayl by any particular Cuſtom to be allowed, and how ſuch Entayls aroſe, it hath been <hi>vexatio quaeſtio.</hi> This Queſtion hath been curiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in our Books, and therefore I ſhall be the larger upon it.</p>
               <p>It is clear, That the Statute <hi>de donis per ſe</hi> doth not create an Eſtate Tayl in a Copy-hold, 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 105. the Caſe of <hi>Thornton</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> there cited; for the Statute <hi>de donis</hi> doth not extend to ſuch baſe Eſtates at will.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, if the Statute may co-op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with the Cuſtom as to make an Eſtate Tayl. <hi>Coke</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Warn</hi> and <hi>Sawyer,</hi> 1 <hi>Rolls Rep.</hi> 48. cited one <hi>Haſlerick</hi> and <hi>Grays</hi> Caſe to be ſo adjudged; and in one <hi>Hills</hi> Caſe a Cuſtom was pleaded that a Copy-hold might be granted to one and the Heirs of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, with remainder over; but (ſaith he) we of the other ſide durſt not hazard the matter
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101302:96"/>
upon this, but we deviſed a Plea, That there was another Cuſtom there, that if a Tenant in Tayl alien, this ſhall be a bar to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; and upon iſſue that Cuſtom was found; for it was agreed, <hi>Per totam Curiam,</hi> That if an Eſtate Tayl may be of a Copy-hold by Cuſtom, that by a Cuſtom it may be dock'd and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>It hath been often moved in our Books, When a Copy-holder in Fee ſurrenders to the Uſe of one in Tayl, there being no Cuſtom to warrant ſuch an Entayl, whether it be an Eſtate Tayl, by the Statute of <hi>De donis condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalibus</hi>; or a Fee-ſimple conditional at the Common Law. This point is well argued and ſetled in <hi>Rowden</hi> and <hi>Malſter</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Cro. Car. p.</hi> 42.<note place="margin">Copy-hold cannot be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled within the Statute <hi>de donis.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Yelverton</hi> held, That it was an Eſtate Tayl by the Equity and intent of the Statute <hi>de donis,</hi> but <hi>Hutton, Harvy</hi> and <hi>Croke,</hi> That it was not an Entayl, but a Fee-ſimple conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal at Common Law. 1. Becauſe it would be prejudicial to Lords, for by this means the tenure would be altered, for the Donee in Tayl without a ſpecial reſervation, ought to hold of the Donor, by the ſame Services that the Donor holdeth over, and he who comes in by Surrender and the Admittance of the Lord, to hold to him and the Heirs of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, cannot hold of him who ſurrendred, but ſhall hold of the Lord, and is Tenant at will unto him, and ſhall do the Services unto him as Lord. 2. In reſpect of the baſeneſs of their Eſtate, the Statute never intended to provide remedy for them nor their Alienations; for the words of the Statute are, <hi>Quod voluntas donatoris in Charta ſua manifeſte expreſſa de caetero obſervetur,</hi> which proveth that the intent of the makers of the Statute was, That no Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

But Copy-holds are no ſuch Hereditaments, and therefore not within the meaning of the Act. 3. If Copy-holds might be Entayled, then the perpetuity of ſuch Eſtates might be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a Fine cannot be levied of Copy-hold Lands to bar the Entayl, nor can a Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in value be intended of ſuch an Eſtate where warranty cannot be annexed to it. <hi>Ceo reaſon come jeo penſe ne vault rien pas.

Obſerve <hi>Plowden</hi> in <hi>Manxel</hi>'s Caſe is no Law, 2 <hi>Rolls Rep.</hi> 383. <hi>meſme</hi> Caſe</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 60. As there may be an Eſtate Tayl by Cuſtom with the co-operation of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. So may he have a <hi>Formedon in diſcender, i. e.</hi> a Writing in the nature of a Formedon in Deſcender, in the Lords Court: But as the Statute without a Cuſtom extendeth not to Copy-holds, ſo a Cuſtom without the Statute cannot create an Eſtate Tayl. Now it is not a ſufficient proof, that Lands have been granted in Tayl; for albeit Lands have anciently and uſually been granted by Copy to many men and to the Heirs of their Bodies, that may be a Fee-ſimple conditional, as it was at the Common Law; but if a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath been limited over ſuch Eſtates and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101302:97"/>
enjoyed, or if the Iſſues in Tayl have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the alienation of the Anceſtor, or if they have recovered the ſame in Writs of <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Diſcender; theſe, and ſuch like, are proofs of an Eſtate Tayl: But if by Cuſtom Copy-hold may be Entayled, the ſame by like Cuſtom may be cut off, <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 240.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt Opinion, and by <hi>Clench</hi> and <hi>Gaudy</hi> agreed to in <hi>Grovener</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> 32. The other Opinion is, That an Eſtate is wrought out by the Equity of the Statute <hi>de donis,</hi> for otherwiſe it cannot be that there ſhould be any Eſtate Tayl of Copy-hold Land; for by Uſage it cannot be maintained, becauſe that no Eſtate Tayl was known in Law before this Statute; and after this Statute it cannot be by Uſage, becauſe this is within the time of limitation, aftet which an Uſage cannot make a Preſcription, for a Cuſtom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made after the Statute <hi>de donis.</hi> And it appeareth by <hi>Littleton</hi> and <hi>Brook,</hi> That a Plaint lyes of Copy-hold Land, in the nature of a <hi>Formedon in Diſcender</hi> at Common Law, and therefore the Statue helps them for their remedy for Entayled Lands, which is but cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary by Equity; and if the Action ſhall be given by Equity for this Land, why ſhall not the Statute by Equity work to make it an Eſtate Tayl alſo of this nature of the Land? <hi>Popham</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi> 33. <hi>Gravenor</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi>; ſo <hi>Bullen</hi> and <hi>Grant</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>A Copy-holder Surrendred to the Uſe of <hi>J.</hi> for Life, the Remainder to <hi>H.</hi> and the Heirs of his Body: it was a Queſtion if this Eſtate limitted to <hi>H.</hi> was an Eſtate Tayl, or a Fee-ſimple conditional; for if it were a Fee-ſimple conditional, then there cannot be an other Eſtate over, (but yet in Caſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101302:97"/>
an Eſtate may depend upon a Fee-ſimple precedent, but not as a Will, but as an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory Deviſe.) <hi>Per Wray,</hi> it is an Eſtate Tayl. <hi>Coke</hi> then ſaid, They who would prove the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to Entayl Copy-hold Lands within a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it is not ſufficient to ſhew Copies of Grants to perſons and the Heirs of their Bodies, but they ought to ſhew that Surrenders made by ſuch perſons have been avoided by ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But by <hi>Wray,</hi> that is not ſo, for cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lands may be granted in Tayl, and yet no Surrenders have been made within time of memory, 1 <hi>Leon. p.</hi> 174. <hi>Bullen</hi> and <hi>Grant, Cro. El.</hi> 148. <hi>meſme</hi> Caſe. <hi>Heyden</hi>'s Caſe in 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> 8. is clear, That neither Statute without the Cuſtom, nor the Cuſtom without the Statute, but both co-operating may create Tayl. And as for Cuſtom, if the Cuſtom be to grant Lands in Fee-ſimple, this without queſtion may be granted to one and the Heirs of his Body by Copy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>omne majus includit minus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Bridgman</hi> ſeems to argue this point very accutely and ſuccinctly in <hi>Carters Rep.</hi> 22. <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Shaws</hi> Caſe. Firſt (ſays he) a Copy-hold may be Entayled; not Entayled, as within the Statute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. nor by vertue of any Conſtruction of the Statute <hi>W.</hi> 2. but there may be ſuch an Eſtate before <hi>W.</hi> 2. of a Copy-hold, which is a kind of baſe Eſtate, and which might be grantable to one and the Heirs of his Body, according to the Cuſtom, and if he dyed without Iſſue, it might be aliened again; and that a Copy-holder could not bar his Iſſue, unleſs by a Recovery; ſuch an Eſtate might be by Cuſtom. I hold (ſaith he) That the Evidence may fall out to be ſuch that we may take it for granted, that Lands granted by Copy to one and the Heirs of his
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:101302:98"/>
Body, the Remainder over may be a good Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Reverſion may continue in the Copy-holder, the Donor may have a good Reverſion, and all this without the help of <hi>W.</hi> 2. That which confirms me is the conſtant practice of moſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholds, to have Eſtates over. As for the reaſon of it, if we ſhall give in Evidence (for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) a Surrender in <hi>H.</hi> 7ths time, wherein Lands are limited to one and the Heirs of his Body, the Remainder over; this is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it was ſo in <hi>H.</hi> 7ths time, and we have reaſon to think ſo it was paſt time of memory of Man. And as your Evidence is for Cuſtom, ſo may your Caſe be to make an immemorial Cuſtom. Then all the Queſtion is, whether it will bear it or not? In this Caſe of a Copy-hold being an Eſtate at will, you may have it at will, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Cuſtom; it is not againſt the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and Reaſon of the Law, and it may bear it; the Evidence may be ſuch. If in <hi>H.</hi> 7th or <hi>E.</hi> the 4ths time it appears ſo, it is a good warrant for matter of Evidence for a Jury to find, That there were ſuch Copy-hold Eſtates with limitation over. Now before the Statute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. it had been a good Cuſtom to grant Copy-hold to one and the Heirs of his Body, the Remainder over; or to grant the Land by the name of a Reverſion; for here is no alteration of Common Law Eſtates: The reaſonableneſs of this Cuſtom appears by the Statute of <hi>W.</hi> 2. That Act doth not create the Eſtate,<note place="margin">Proofs of an Eſtate Tayl.</note> neither a Remainder nor a Reverſion; but the Act prohibiting Alienations, <hi>Quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad exitum illorum, quibus tenementum ſic fuerit datum remaneat poſt obitum illorum vel ad dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem (ſi exitus ejus deficiat) revertatur,</hi> by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Law, it comes to a Remainder or
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:101302:98"/>
Reverſion; if by Cuſtom ſuch Eſtates may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main or revert, ſo may Copy-holds by Cuſtom, becauſe they are Tenants at will. Now as by that conſtruction <hi>W.</hi> 2. did make a Remainder or a Reverſion, ſo the Cuſtom of prohibiting Alienations by Copy, may make Reverſions or Remainders of Copy-hold Eſtates.</p>

by Cuſtom the Surrenderer by Petition or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration may direct it to any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the Lord muſt purſue it, and there is no Eſtate in the Lord, but it remains in the Tenants hands till Admittance of ſuch party, and the Purchaſor might come in at any time.</p>

The like Cuſtom is adjudged void, but that was upon a fault in the ſpecial Verdict: Tenant in Tayl of Copy-hold Lands, the Jury find a Cuſtom, That this is to be barred by ſeizure of the Lord as a Forfeiture, <hi>&amp; non alio modo,</hi> and not otherwiſe, as the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Bridgman</hi> well obſerved, and that being naught, the whole Cuſtom is in vain. As for his firſt Reaſon of ſuch a Cuſtom being void, that its a precarious Cuſtom; you muſt have the concurrence of the Lord, or you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it; and Cuſtom implies Right; though this is of weight, yet it might have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in <hi>Pilkinton</hi>'s Caſe and <hi>Grantham</hi>'s Caſe, yet in theſe Caſes ſuch Cuſtom is adjudged good.

               <p>It was made a Queſtion in <hi>Dell</hi> and <hi>Heydon</hi>'s Caſe, If Tenant in Tayl of a Copy-hold, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in Fee, is impleaded by plaint in a Court Baron, in nature of a Writ of Entry in the Poſt,<note place="margin">The manner how, and the reaſon why a Recovery ſhall bar a Copy-hold Eſtate.</note> and ſuffers a Common Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with Voucher, whether if Tenant in Tayl dye <hi>ſans</hi> iſſue, this ſhall bind the Remainder? <hi>Cro El. p.</hi> 372. But <hi>Rolls</hi> in 1 <hi>Abr.</hi> 506. in the ſame Caſe, ſaith this may be barred by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Recovery, for a warranty may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed upon this by a Surrender to an Uſe, or by a confirmation, or by Releaſe with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and it may be intended he ſhall have other Copy-hold in value. And Sir <hi>Francis More</hi> in the Report of this Caſe ſaith, if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenant in Tayl come in as Vouchee, this is a bar to the Iſſues and Remainder. Surrender with warranty to an Uſe, and grant accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, makes the party in the <hi>per</hi> by the Surrenderor, and upon this Warranty the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renderor may be vouched, and Recovery in value ſhall be only of other Copy-hold Lands in the Manor, <hi>No.</hi> 488. and in 4 <hi>Rep. meſme</hi> Caſe, its adjudged that ſuch Recovery ſhall make a Diſcontinuance, and ſhall take away the Entry of the Heir in Tayl.</p>
               <p>If a Copy-holder ſurrenders in Tayl, and the Heir of the Donee is to bring a <hi>Formedon,</hi> he ought to count of a Gift made by the Copy-holder who ſurrendred, and not by the Lord, for he is but the Inſtrument to convey it, and nothing paſſeth from him, <hi>Cro.

in a Plaint, in nature of a Writ of Entry, <hi>in Curia Manerij,</hi> ſhall not bind the Iſſue in Tayl, for it ſhall not bind but upon expectancy of a Recovery in value, which is the reaſon it binds for Land at the Common Law, and here he cannot have any Land in value, neither at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, nor cuſtomary Land; for if it ſhould be ſo Conveyed, the Lord ſhould loſe his Fine, and one ſhould hold his Land as a Copy-holder without Admittance or Grant from the Lord, which is contrary to the nature of a Copy-hold, but its a Diſcontinuance clearly, which cannot be defeated by Entry, <hi>Cro.

               <p>Now as a Feoffment will not deſtroy a Copy-hold Eſtate Entayled, ſo neither a Fine or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery at Common Law.</p>
               <p>It doth not make any Diſcontinuance,<note place="margin">Copy-hold Eſtate, how diſcontinued or not.</note> for theſe being Common Law Aſſurances, they do not work upon the Aſſurance of the Copy-hold, and that that doth not work upon the right of the Eſtate Tayl cannot make a Diſcontinuance. And the ſame reaſon of a Fine, which is but a Feoffment on Record, and the ſame reaſon holds; a Fine may work to the deſtruction of an Eſtate, where it is not preſerved by ſpecial Cuſtom, but this is preſerved by ſpecial Cuſtom: ſo for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, that that is in demand is the Free-hold. True, if the Recovery were in the Lords Court, there the Eſtate may be turned to a Right, and a Recovery at Common Law cannot bar a Copy-hold Eſtate, becauſe of the Recovery in value, to which the Warranty is annexed, doth not go according to the Copy-hold, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Freehold. Theſe being Common Law Aſſurances, work only a Common Law Intereſt, and cannot work upon a Copy-hold; this is the Abſtract of <hi>Glin</hi>'s Argument in <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> and <hi>Shaw</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Carter</hi>'s <hi>Rep.</hi>

               <head>That the Lords act ſhall not prejudice the Copy-holders Eſtate.</head>
               <p>If the Lord makes a Leaſe for an hundred years, the Lands are not ſo ſevered from the Manor, as that the Copy-hold is extinct, and the cuſtomary Intereſt is not determined, but the Lord himſelf hath deſtroyed the Cuſtom as to the Services; for the Services reſerved upon the Copy,<note place="margin">Copy-hold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct as to Services, but remains as to the Cuſtomary Eſtate.</note> and the advantage of waſte, and other Forfeitures are extinct: But by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,</hi> the Rents and Services remain, and waſte ſhall be a Forfeiture, though ſuch waſte can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found by an ordinary Preſentment, and that the Lord ſhall have the Rents and Services, and not the Leſſee; <hi>quod mirum,</hi> ſaith the Reporter, againſt his own Leaſe, 2 <hi>Leon.</hi> 208. <hi>Beal</hi> and <hi>Langley:</hi> But this point is well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Murrel</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi>'s Caſe, 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 25. though the Reverſion of the Copy-hold be granted and ſo ſevered from the Manor, yet the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder ſhall hold his Eſtate, and ſubject to Forfeiture as before, and ſhall perform the ſame Services, (ſuit of Court excepted) as before, and the Cuſtom incident to the Land, as Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Engliſh, Gavel-kind continue ſtill; but Fine upon Alienations and Suit of Court and Admittances are gone.</p>
               <p>The Lord Grants an ancient Copy-hold to <hi>S.</hi> in Fee, and after he grants the Inheritance of that Copy-hold to a Stranger in Fee. <hi>S.</hi> makes his Will, and deviſeth it to <hi>M.</hi> in Fee, which was ſurrendred at next Court. <hi>Per Cur.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Copy-hold though ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Manor, not deſtroyed by the Lords act.</note> By the ſeverance of the Inheritance of the Copy-hold from the Manor, the Copy-hold is not deſtroyed, being the Lords act. 2.

               <p>Leaſe for years of a particular Copy-hold by name, together with the Manor, by the King, hath not ſo extinguiſhed that the Copy-hold (though by the ſurrender of it, it is parcel of the Manor in the King) but that after ſuch Leaſe the Patentee of the Reverſion may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant it as Copy-hold, 1 <hi>Keb.</hi> 720.</p>
