            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A verie fruitefull Prayer to God the Father, for the obtayning of theſe benefites, promiſed in this Booke, and neceſſarie to be vſed at all tymes.</head>
            <p>MOſt holie Lord, the God of the ſpirites of all fleſhe, we giue vnto thée moſt humble thankes, for all thy goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, which thou haſt found in thy ſelfe before the beginning of the world, and haſt declared vnto vs from tyme to tyme, acknowledging our ſelues to be farre leſſe, then the leaſt of thy mercies. Thou arte perfect in thy ſelfe, and haſt no néede of any thing: but it hath pleaſed thée to create all theſe thinges, wherein thy glorie dooth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare as Angelles and men, and all things elſe for them, that them ſelues might know that they are created onelie for thée: not that any thing by them, could be added vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée, but that thy glorie which is perfect in it ſelfe, might be ſéene in them, and they alſo be made pertakers of that happineſſe, which is with thée, the which thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs in thy belooued.
<pb facs="tcp:14861:55"/>
In whome alſo thou haſt choſen vs before all worlds, for ſo thy wiſedome hath apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, that we ſhould paſſe through a world and ſo come vnto thée, and ſee thy glory, and the ritches of thy mercie, and that pleaſure which is with thée for euer. And to this ende haſt thou giuen vs thy moſt holie woorde, and thy ſanctifying ſpirite to attend therevpon: wherby thy elect children might be reformed vnto thée. Holy Father, who is able to comprehend this thy great worke of our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſte: but thine owne wiſedome which is infinite? as thy mercie is, all goodneſſe, mercie and trueth come from thée, and ende in thée: but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill &amp; corruption which befalleth thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures commeth of them ſelues. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this alſo thou turneſt to good, for euen the wicked thou ſuffereſt for a tyme, that at the length thy iuſtice might be ſéene in them: but to thy chyldren thou ordaineſt all thinges to the beſt, for euen the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes for theyr ſinnes, and the afflictions of this life, thou haſt appointed for good: that by thy iuſtice, thy mercie might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and their own happineſſe which thou haſt prepared for them, in more glory might be reuealed. To this ende haſt thou ſet
<pb facs="tcp:14861:55"/>
them from thée for a tyme in this lyfe, that in the lyfe to come they may know the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what it is to enioy thy preſence. Thou haſt made them héere mortal, that they may then perceyue, what it is to be immortall with thée, thou giueſt them ouer ſome time to their owne ſinne, that they may knowe how much better it is to be holy with thée in thy kingdom: thou makeſt them taſte of the afflictions of this world, that they may féele in them, howe great thy glorie is, and to be happye and bleſſed, with thy euerlaſting goodneſſe. Lord, in thy great power haſt thou created all thinges, and ordereſt them in thy wiſedome, preſerueſt them in thy goodneſſe, and haſt redéemed vs in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to thy ſelfe, in thy belooued: but thou knoweſt this vaine and corrupte nature, which is fallen from thée, and can not ryſe againe vnto thée, except it be drawne by thée. Doo away our ſinnes, O Lord, and poſſeſſe vs, ſanctifie vs with thy holy ſpirit, that we may walke before thée, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thy chyldren, and knowe and féele in déede, that there is no pleaſure nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it ſelfe, in theſe thinges which are mortall of them ſelues, but onely in thée the euerlaſting goodneſſe in all thinges elſe, in
<pb facs="tcp:14861:56"/>
thée and for thée. Increaſe our faith, that we may walke before thée in obedience of faith: giue vs alſo thoſe things which thou knoweſt good and expedient for vs, in this mortall life: that wée may vſe them to thy glorie, and to the comfort of our ſelues and others, whome thou haſt commaunded vs to looue in thée, that thou béeing our lyfe, in this life, and in the life to come, we may enioy the preſence of thy Maieſtie, and glorifie thy holie name for euer, among thy elect people, and bleſſed Angelles.</p>
