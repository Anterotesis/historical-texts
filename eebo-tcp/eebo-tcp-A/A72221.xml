         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They are <hi>Learning</hi> and Martiall diſcipline. Of theſe two together Noble <hi>Greece</hi> made ſeparation in her two metropolitanes; when the Citie of <hi>Athens</hi> flouriſhed in learning, and the Citie of <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> glorious in feates of Armes.

in this land and countrie (except among the rude &amp; barbarous Nations) where any were eſpied of prompt and ready nature, or hopefully inclined, they were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee taught and inſtructed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might attayne the moſt holy and learned Sciences: For by this onely way and paſſage is the entry and acceſſe to the higheſt Countries, and Noble houſes of <hi>Dialectica,</hi> that is Logike, <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> that is learned Wiſedome, and <hi>Theologie,</hi> that is the moſt high and excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Diuinitie.

There haue all learned <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> made their apprentiſhippe, who by their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy writings, or by the acte of others, are immortallized with renowned fame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there thus well taught and learned, they haue afterward ſo floriſhingly liued through the high praiſe of their illuſtrious and ſplendant actes, that liuing, they were vnto all men in their time ſetters forth of vertuous examples, and after they were dead (yet as aliue) ſhewed to thoſe that ſuruiued them, as it were by pointing with the finger, the right path and ready way to attaine honourable life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall fame.

Theſe two Kings then being in ſuch concord, as all the affaires of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> were in good appearance and better eſtate, it happened that for a ſmall thing, diſſention ſprang betweene them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vpon a very ſudaine, all was bewrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in vprore and martiall diſpleaſures: For what harme is that, that Wine and inſaeiate eating cauſe not? Thus that ſo great amitie and vnion betweene theſe two Princes was ſo ouerthrowne at one onely banquet, wherein they were both drunken; and ebrietie ſet them in ſo great enmities one againſt another, that either of them, pricked forward with ambitious deſire of regiment (as wild Bulls ſtung of gadde flies) almoſt vtterly ouerturned their owne realmes, and the noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Grammar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let vs ſhew how their debate happened, to the end that euery one may know, that there is no band or knot of amity ſo ſtrong that deſire of ſuperiority may not breake, euery man louing rather to bee ſerued, then to ſerue other.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:150627:8"/>
As theſe two Kings on a time were at a banquet, in the mideſt of the hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, neere to a pleaſant and cleere ſpring, hauing the water bancke on the one ſide, and the other ſide moſt pleaſant, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulatly ſhaddowed with the branches of greene Willowes, and high Plane trees, after they had ſufficiently banquetted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed with Wine, and lightened with drinking, a queſtion aroſe betweene them, whether of them two were greateſt in authoritie, and of moſt importance to performe <hi>Oration?</hi> Then the <hi>Verbe</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to hold the worthieſt place, was ſharply withſtood of the <hi>Noune,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that without him, <hi>Oration</hi> and ſpeach might not bee, and that through him altogether, the ſame is vnderſtood and of better grace: And what doſt thou (ſaid hee) without mee in <hi>Oration?</hi> If I withhould me a part neuer ſo little, the hearers vnderſtand thee no more then one were dumbe and ſpake not. Gather a while a ſmall part of ſpeach without mee, and doe that the hearers may vnderſtand that which thou ſpeakeſt. Doubtleſſe, if I bee not there for an Interpreter, none may ſo much as gueſſe the leaſt thing of
<pb facs="tcp:150627:8"/>

Who is hee that knoweth not the <hi>Noune,</hi> before the <hi>Verbe?</hi> Or who is hee that is ignorant, how the beginning of the <hi>Noune</hi> is more ancient then the <hi>Verbe?</hi> It is infallible, that God made all things, who if hee made all, then hee made alſo the <hi>Verbe.</hi> Now God is a <hi>Noune</hi> and not a <hi>Verbe,</hi> wherefore now of conſequence, by the <hi>Noune</hi> were all things made, yea, <hi>Oration</hi> it ſelfe was made of God, and ſo of the <hi>Noune.</hi> As for thee, O thou <hi>Verbe</hi> (that art ſo proud) thou haſt thy calling of mee: Haſt thou neuer read, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sonnes of Women, is not a greater then <hi>Iohn Baptiſt?</hi> This is Gods ſentence, it is not lawfull to goe againſt it. Wherfore if none be greater then <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> being a <hi>Noune;</hi> it is apparent to bee ſeene, that there is not, neither may any thing elſe bee greater then the <hi>Noune.</hi> I could alledge to this matter ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, whereby it is proued clearer then the day, that as in worthineſſe and antiquitie, euen ſo in authoritie and chiefe place the <hi>Noune</hi> is preferred before the

               <hi>Verbe.</hi> All which things I ſet and leaue apart, to the end that men thinke me not to proceede of the <hi>Verbe,</hi> more through much babling, then of iuſt cauſe. O <hi>Poeta</hi> (anſwered the <hi>Verbe)</hi> I maruailed before now, why that Diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had expulſed thee out of his common Weale: But now knowing how ſhameleſſe and light thou art ſo to intermixe the holy Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy follies: I know well that the learned and wiſe <hi>Plato</hi> iudged rightly of thee. For had not hee exiled thee with many other, forth of the Republike that hee ordained, thou haddeſt by thy falſe coremonies, fearfull Gods, and other things, corrupted the ciuill manners of his citizens. For what pernitious thing durſt not thy great pride and arrogancie, enterprize and attempte? Yea ſeeing that by the deuiſed deceipts, and falſe writhed witneſſes wreſted by force from holy Scripture, thou laboureſt to caſt me down from the dignitie of the chiefeſt place, which I haue long time in this land poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. But certainely, for that it ſhall not ſeeme to thee, that thou alone art lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I will eaſily alledge more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and plaine teſtimonies of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:150627:9"/>
holy Scripture, that maintaine mine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. I will ſet here foremoſt the very beginning of that Euangelicall Scripture, where it is thus ſaid: <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with</hi> God, <hi>and</hi> God <hi>was the word.</hi> Open thine eares now, wherefore hideſt thou thy face ſo? <hi>God</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>was the Word,</hi> and moreouer, <hi>all things are made by him: And without him nothing was made.</hi> It is not therefore the <hi>Noune</hi> that made all things, but the <hi>Verbe.</hi> Againe, God was a <hi>Verbe,</hi> and not a <hi>Noune.</hi> Moreouer, <hi>by the</hi> Word <hi>the Heauens were made firme and ſure, and all their powers.</hi>

            <p>What wilt thou now ſay? There is no meane to defend thee by holy allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but thou mayſt perceiue them to make for mee, and not for thee. But let vs bend to thoſe points that aptlieſt tend to our cauſe: Tell mee I pray thee, whence commeth to thee this folly and madnes?

               </hi> Knoweſt thou not that all comelineſſe, beautie and ſweetneſſe commeth of mee alone? And
<pb facs="tcp:150627:10"/>
that the <hi>Noune</hi> is alwayes ruled of the <hi>Verbe,</hi> and not that the <hi>Verbe</hi> is ruled of the <hi>Noune.</hi> The comely featneſſe of the <hi>Verbe</hi> is that, that beautifieth and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Oration:</hi> And if I gouerne thee not therein, thou ſhalt bee halfe handed, and of no force.

Behold all men know, that I onely that hold the ſeigniorie ouer the <hi>Verbes,</hi> can without the ayd of any other make perfect <hi>Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Wherefore then ſpeakeſt thou ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently?

Not of ſuch authoritie as thou boaſteſt of, I am ſure, that ſo goeſt puffed and ſwollen, that it is maruell thou burſteſt not in the middeſt, I am (thou wilt ſay the King of the <hi>Nounes:</hi> But what is thy name?

            <p>Which alſo by thy chat vſurpeſt ſo much authoritie among the common and ſimple ſort, that thou dareſt ſtriue for the dignitie againſt the renowned ſtocke of the <hi>Verbes.</hi> Fooliſhly doe thoſe fathers that giue thee their children to bee taught of for what is in thee whereby that youth may bee encited to grace and vertuous encouragement, but the Stews of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the iealouſie of <hi>Iuno,</hi> and the Whooredome of <hi>Venus,</hi> and of the Ruffian <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſuch goodly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices imrgined of thine owne brayne, that hauing drunke a little more then well, thou, as filled with a diuine ghoſt, and ouerladen with wine, mad like or deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, dareſt in a Poeticall furie mixe heauen with earth, and earth with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>At theſe words, <hi>Poeta</hi> the King, all fired in ire, not able to ſuffer the ſhame nor the iniury that was ſayd to him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus: O thou moſt miſchieuous head of man, dareſt thou ſpeake ſo bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch contentious things of vs?

there withall caught a Cupp in his hand, which had, violently hit him on the face, had not one of the ſtanders by (holding him by the arme) turned the ſtroake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. It is not to bee doubted now, that in the rage wherein both partyes were then, but that words were no blowes: But certainely of the elder ſort and wiſeſt came vpon the ſame and they beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſayd Kings all drunken into their Pallaces: And on the morrow after that the friends of the partyes were aſſembled, there was great enquirie and diſputation of the contention happened the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

<pb facs="tcp:150627:21"/>
I eaſily make them beleeue that I am through lined in euery corner with all the eloquence of <hi>Attica.</hi> All they which were there, hearing this, fell in a great laughter, and ſaid: By Saint <hi>George,</hi> ſeeing that thou haſt ſuch hearers as thou haſt, that which wee know not the due owners of, thou ſhalt carry with ſafe conduct to thy people and nation: But that which wee ſhall know to belong to any, that wee thinke good to bee rendered to the due owners. Then after they had made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, all the <hi>Greeke</hi> words almoſt were giuen <hi>Iſydore,</hi> whoſe they were, and the remnant of the <hi>Latines;</hi> to which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe was appointed the maſter of the Trench-men, called <hi>Calapine,</hi> with the courteous Captaine, <hi>Anthonie</hi> of <hi>Nebriſſe.</hi> The intermixed, rotten, and ſecret hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den words were giuen him, and ſo they permitted him to goe his way with his Aſſe lighter laden then before: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they forbade him at any time euer after, to bee ſo hardy as to call himſelfe a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> except among the rude and barbarous people.

that hee could not ſuffer the ſaid land to runne into totall ruine through ciuill war and contention, haſted toward the campe in poſt to make an agreement, and being taken, was ſpoiled and ſore beaten of the feloniſh fellowſhip of <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and was ſo wounded on the head, that there was no ſalue able to heale him. Shortly after, among theſe fellowes was taken one, who falſely and ſhamefull ſaid that hee was an <hi>Hiſtoriographer,</hi> and had gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great bundell of Ieaſting fooliſh gaudes in a great volume, called <hi>Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Chronicharum,</hi> who forced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row queſtion, confeſſed that all they were ſtollen things: And ſo hee was exiled for euer into the land of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> As theſe things were doing, certaine of the <hi>Verbes anomales,</hi> as <hi>Sum, voto, fero,</hi> with three companies of their hand-maides, made an aſſault and tooke away a priſoner of the captaines of the <hi>Nounes</hi> named <hi>Caeter,</hi> which was of the race of <hi>Relatiues,</hi> and they tooke him hidden with his fellowes in an ambuſh, in what caue I know not, neere to the by-pathway of the <hi>Coniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the danger they were in, made a vow to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to ſacrifice him the remnant of their goods, and ſo they eſcaped whole and ſound miraculouſly. When tidings hereof were told to King <hi>Poeta,</hi> hee was maruailouſly moued, and it greatly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to looſe ſuch a Captaine: For this <hi>Caeter</hi> was very ſtout and full of ſtomacke euen to the vttermoſt, and in feates of warre hee had no peere.</p>
            <p>The king of <hi>Nounes</hi> therefore feeling himſelfe greately endamaged with the loſſe of <hi>Caeter</hi> and his <hi>Singulars,</hi> diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaited occaſion, whereby hee might render double the like to his enemies. But fortune, who can in all things doe very much, and chiefely in warre, gaue him ſhortly after the way to reuenge him of the wrong. For in thoſe dayes many legions of <hi>Verbes</hi> of no ſmall authoritie were taken priſoners by certain light horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Nounes.</hi> Among whom was <hi>Dice, face, fore,</hi> and <hi>duce</hi> of the bande of the <hi>Imperatiues</hi> and commanders.

them away againe, ſo that euer ſince they were called onely <hi>Dic, duc, fac</hi> and <hi>fer.</hi> Afterward hee commanded that the priſoners ſhould bee ſlaine, namely <hi>Fuo, ſpecio, leo</hi> and <hi>pleo,</hi> whoſe goods were by the king of <hi>Verbes</hi> giuen to their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children, deſcending of them in line, as <hi>Fui, fueram, fuiſſem, fuiſſe,</hi> and <hi>futurus:</hi> And the children of <hi>ſpecio,</hi> who were a great number, as <hi>Aſpicio, conſpicio,</hi> and ſuch like: And alſo to them of <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>pleo,</hi> as <hi>Doleo, impleo, compleo, ſuppleo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleo, expleo, opleo.</hi> At the very ſame ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was bewrayed a great treaſon to the hoſte of the <hi>Verbes,</hi> how certaine horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hooreſons of the ſtocke of <hi>Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectes,</hi> being ſouldiers, to cloake their treaſon, and not to bee knowne, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed after the manner of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> though they were of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, and beeing taken, had two heads. Theſe had conſpired and laid waite for the king of <hi>Verbes:</hi> but being taken and conuict of the fact, were declared traytours, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of treſpaſſe againſt the King: They were called <hi>Momordi, cecidi, cucurri, pependi, ſpoſpondi, pepigi, didici, popoſci, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli, cecini, peperi, tutudi, pepuli, fefelli, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,

pugugi,</hi> and <hi>tetigi,</hi> from whom was cut off one head at that preſent: So that whereas they were before time called, <hi>Momordeo, cecido, cucurro,</hi> they bee now called, <hi>Mordeo, cedo, curro,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. From <hi>Tetuli</hi> were cut off both heads, as well of the <hi>Preter,</hi> as of the <hi>Preſent-tence:</hi> Albeit that <hi>Terrence</hi> through pitie thought to ſimon the ſame againe of the <hi>Preter tence</hi> with Baulme, but it held not. Now as the time of fighting drew neere, the ſaid kings ſet vp in the higheſt place of their hoſte, a red cloake, to aduertiſe the Souldiers that they ſhould ſhortly ioyne together in fight, that they might prepare and propoſe themſelues thereto, taking their repaſt, and whetting their weapons, might make their munitions ready, with all other things pertaining to ſuch affaires. In the morning, after the Souldiers had dined on both ſides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noyſe making, the whole hoſte aſſembled to the ſaid place. Then when they had all ranged in battell aray with diſplayed ancients, the ſaid Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought and required their ſouldiers ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to behaue themſelues well and worthily: But it was no neede, ſeeing that
<pb facs="tcp:150627:24"/>
they of themſelues were already fired enough. For all as mad-men ſhooke their Pikes with ſo great and ſtout a ſtomacke, that they cared for nothing but to ſtrike, and awaighted nought but the ſigne of the onſet and alarme: And hereupon he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the Trumpets blew the onſet, on both ſides. On the other part the earth reſounded and rang againe, and in both hoſtes were made great ſhoutes and cries, the heads of both hoſtes made great vowes, and euery of them ſtomacked and cheered vp their ſouldiers: Then euery one did what hee could and knew to bee done, they ſtroake together with great handy ſtroakes of Swords, brake their Pikes, that the aire rang againe of the crie of the fighters. In the aire was nothing ſeene but clouds of ſmoake and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: On both ſides were great ſtoare wounded, and of dead corpeſes plentie.

In the ſame time of the Warres, ſprang vp many new words, and ſundry old were
<pb facs="tcp:150627:32"/>
put apart &amp; reiected. And had not three honeſt perſons been choſen for arbitrators (of whom wee ſhall ſpeake by and by) which by their power and abillitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the naughtineſſe of certaine <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſtes,</hi> or ſlender <hi>Grammarians,</hi> ſo great Barberouſneſſe had then beene ſo mixed through the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, and the ſame then bin ſo mingled with fooliſh wordes, that all hope had beene loſt euer to reſtore the ſame againe to his honour, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beautie. Therefore after that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate was ſounded of both the hoſtes, and that they had numbred as well the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the ſlaine, and knowne the great loſſe that was of both the hoſtes, they all began to fall on ſighing: and the ſight of ſuch a ſlaughter of their people greatly grieued them, through deſire of ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Wherefore euery of them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſought now nothing elſe then to make peace.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all <hi>Poeta</hi> King of <hi>Nounes,</hi> after hee had called his Souldiers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (but not without teares) ſaid theſe words: <hi>I thinke well that you know (O my fellow Souldiers) how dolefully, and againſt my will, I haue taken armes to defend and</hi>

But when I thinke not onely of our owne loſſe, but alſo of theirs: Againe when I behold the dead corpſes on both ſides, I haue greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to lament then to ſpeake. Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs to remember that, which ſome of our good old Citizens and Burgeſes wrote of the diſcord and ciuill Warres, as well of the</hi> Romanes <hi>as the</hi> Greekes, <hi>and how with great reproaches they blame and deteſt the ambition of them. In trueth if wee had thought of this at the firſt, wee neuer had gone to ſo great folly, neither had wee alſo (as blinded with anger and rage, franticke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and as void of reaſon) torne our propper fleſh ſo with our owne hands as wee haue: That which is done and paſt, is eaſier to bee reproued then amended: Neuertheleſſe it is better to ſtay thus, then to follow on a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beginning: For if wee will bee ſo mad as to continue fighting amongſt our ſelues, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe then is the principalitie of</hi> Grammar <hi>vtterly come to confuſion, and then ſhall bee</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:150627:33"/>
               <hi>made ſo great an exceſſe and entrie into the ſame, to the Barbarous and ignorant people, that they onely will rule all, there being none to reſiſt them, or preuent them. By reaſon whereof (O my fellow ſouldiers) for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of both Realmes, I am willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make peace with the King of</hi> Verbes, <hi>and of mine owne free will, will goe toward him, and giue him mine hand. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, thinke not that I ſpeake thus becauſe I haue loſt ſtomacke, or that I am timorous; but becauſe there is nothing more ſure, that the affaires of the</hi> Nounes <hi>and</hi> Verbes <hi>can continue, vnleſſe they bee friends tigether, knit and quiet in one: Of my ſelfe I doe mine office, not doubting but that I teach you that; which ſerueth to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benefit and commoditie of euery one in generall, being ready willingly to doe what your will is.</hi>
