            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

once thought necessary Attendants of Learning, that <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>fair Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution</hi> of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> were indispensible <hi>Duties</hi> even of <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> and saw those <hi>Rules</hi> so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violated, I then thought my self bound to do right to <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Education</hi> was formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>sure</hi> Method to soften Mens <hi>Tempers,</hi> and to take off the edge from their <hi>Passions;</hi> and he who had not sacrificed to the <hi>Graces,</hi> was hardly allow'd any Pretensions to Acquaintance with the <hi>Muses:</hi> But of late a <hi>Sett of Men</hi> are started up, wiser than their <hi>Forefathers,</hi> who scorn to tread in the <hi>Old Paths,</hi> who covet By-ways never walkt in before; whose Notices are all <hi>New,</hi> their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of managing any Subject they handle, all <hi>New;</hi> and yet talk as if what they affirm'd were the Sense of

And if any Man's Curiosity prompts him to make a further Search, 'tis not improbable, but among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s Manuscripts he may find more <hi>Notes</hi> of the same kind.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">1. WHen Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Epistles of Phalaris, and the Fables of Aesop,</hi> came first into the World, I was somewhat surprized, to find a severe Critick sowr'd into a Fit of unmannerly Rage, against an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Gentleman; and handling a Controversie, in which the Safety of the Commonwealth of Letters is scarce at all concerned, with so much Heat and Haughtiness, and so little Regard to Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95217:6"/>
But when I considered the Man, and reflected seriously upon the Style and Managery of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Writings, my Wonder ceas'd; and I began to despise an impotent Indignation, that evaporated into Smoak and Noise. And in this Humour I should have continued, had not you thought the Author worthy your Examination, both as to his <hi>Ueracity,</hi> his <hi>Manners,</hi> and his <hi>Learning.</hi> The Learned Part of the Controversie you have managed with so great variety of good Reading and Argument, and so much Genteel Wit, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your <hi>Antagonist</hi> will bethink himself seriously, before he replies. His want of <hi>Veracity</hi> you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and chastised, upon many undeniable Proofs, (to which I shall add some others of Moment;) but his <hi>Singular Humanity,</hi> which was your first Charge against him,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95217:6"/>
you have but slightly touch'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining your Censure chiefly to your own particular Case. This gave the Rise to these Observations; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sincere Lover of Truth and good Nature, and in some measure, of good Literature, I could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear expressing my Abhorrence, when I met with an Author who was resolv'd to <hi>run a muck</hi> at all who had written before him; and who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covert of some Philologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knowledge, was bent to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon all the Laws of Decency and good Behaviour; and such I think Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> to be; in all whose Writings a common Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot but Remark an Air of Pride and Contempt, of scornful Censure and supercilious Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But this is not a Subject fit to raise Admiration; for most Men generally pursue the first false Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods they have engaged in. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95217:7"/>
I have known a <hi>Beau</hi> leave off dressing, when his Necessities deplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, and a <hi>Bully</hi> grow peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when he had been soundly beaten; but a <hi>Paedagogue</hi> is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable Usurper; the older he grows, the more Resty and Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick he is: His Looks are haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Mien imperious, his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour insolent, his Conversation surly and contemptuous, his Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates magisterial, and his Style af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and Bombast; and you shall never convince him, that his <hi>Feru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> is not a Scepter, and his Habit the Imperial Purple, till Death sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the incorrigible, imaginary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. He inverts the Story of the <hi>Sicilian Prince</hi>: He begins his Reign over the Boys at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Seat of his Empire to <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi>; but every where he plays the Sophist, and every where the Tyrant.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95217:7"/>2. To fall upon a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had adorned the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Birth, with a Nobler Stock of Knowledge; to rob him of his just Glory, the Reward of his Studies, (only for affirming a strict Truth, unquestionably attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and expressing his Sense of the Affront put upon himself, and all other the Well-wishers to Antient Learning, in a much softer Style than the Rudeness and Injustice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) to transfer the Title of his Labours to the Governour of the College; and then to treat a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his Dignity, Worth, and Station in the Church, the Head of one of the best Colleges in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and to whose Instruction and Care a great part of the Nobility of the Kingdom owe their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if he had been upon his own Level; and in truth, under that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95217:8"/>
to depreciate a most Illustrious University, where himself, whilst he resided there, was treated with most eminent Humanity, are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of such singular Inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that none but Dr. <hi>B.</hi> who will not permit any Man to meddle in the Affairs of the Commonwealth of Letters, except himself, and two or three others, pretending Hyper-Criticks of his own Tribe, durst defend it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And that I may not seem to commit the Crime, which I so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censure, I shall produce other undeniable Instances of his Rude Behaviour to several Great Men, who have been the Ornaments of their respective Professions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Blessings of Heaven to Mankind.

            <p>It is past all Disputes, that there have been a Sett of Vain and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Men, of some Learning, and greater Confidence, who out of an extraordinary, and unaccountable Liberality, have sought to oblige Mankind with several Works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other Mens Names, which the Authors never dream'd of. The Earliest Ages of Literature were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95217:12"/>
scarce exempt from such Impostors; and in the latter Times, <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> with his <hi>Antique Historians; Inghiramius,</hi> with his <hi>Etruscan Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi>; not to mention the finer At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of <hi>Sigonius</hi> and <hi>Mure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> in that kind, are unquestionable Instances.

Whereas, if such ill-natur'd Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations be allowed to supersede the Authority of the Antients, the Church must be robb'd of many of her Venerable Testimonies: One writes against the Epistles, that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between our Blessed Lord, and <hi>Agbarus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Edessa,</hi> though preserved in the Archives of that City to the Days of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who

publish'd them; and by a few trifling Conjectures, fastens the Lye upon all the old Church-Historians. A Second, fights against the Statue set up at <hi>Rome</hi> in Honour of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and thereby endeavours to make the Reverend <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> either a Fool or a Falsifier. A Third, all at once runs down all the <hi>Sibylline Oracles</hi>; which, though some of those we have are interpolated (no Man questions,) and others Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, yet the Earliest Writers of Christianity appeal to them: and <hi>Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> challenges the Heathens, to search their own Books for them. Others will not allow the Story of the <hi>Legio Fulminatrix,</hi> and studiously expose the <hi>Apologists</hi> for our Holy Religion, to the Scorn of its Enemies; as if they had been Men of as soft Judgments, and as hard Foreheads as the Modern Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and durst appeal to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Graevius</hi> omitted doing this Justice to Sir <hi>Edw.

            <p>It is a great Happiness to enjoy a Friend, who thinks himself a Sharer in the Misfortunes of him
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95217:19"/>
he loves; and the Learned <hi>Graevius</hi> will, I doubt not, give the World a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his tender Affection to Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>; but some Accidents may happen, which as they were not foreseen, so cannot be guarded against, and wherein the Assistance of a Brother will prove useless. And such is the Charge now to be exhibited; Mr. <hi>Edw. Sherburn</hi> makes a <hi>second</hi> Complaint, That having generously lent Sir <hi>Thomas Stanley</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Callimachus,</hi> to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> the Dr. has made great use of them, without ever so much as naming his <hi>Benefactor,</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> of those <hi>Acute Observations:</hi> The Learned Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Name will always be Venerable amongst the Lovers of Modesty and good Literature. His Beautiful and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Edition of <hi>Aeschylus</hi> has made him Immortal; and yet what is Printed is but a small Portion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95217:20"/>
what he had written upon that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Cat. MSS. Oxon.</hi> p. 378.</note> his <hi>MSS. Notes</hi> on that, and other Authors, being still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in VIII. Volumes. For his Province was not confin'd only to that one Poet; he hath left behind <hi>Adversaria</hi> now in being, upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles, Euripides, Hesychius,</hi> and many other Authors, and amongst them, <hi>Callimachus,</hi> whose Fragments Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> pretends to have digested, having published them in his own Name, in the late Accurate Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Poet by the Famous <hi>Graevius</hi>; and I doubt not but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the greatest Part of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned World believe, That all those Collections are the Genuine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s own Brain; whereas, it will be demonstrated, That they are of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and himself cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, if he be treated as he deserves,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95217:20"/>

            <p>It may seem a bold Undertaking, to call so absolute a Monarch to an Account; but he who draws his Sword in this Cause, throws away the Scabbard; and the World is to be convinc'd, though the Usurper will not, That he has a Broken Title, and that all his Forces can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend him. It must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, That the Dr. has had such a peculiar Fondness for this his Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, (his <hi>Fragments,</hi> and <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>) that in common Conversation himself calls that Edition <hi>his Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>; and requires all others to do so, treating the Dissenters with insolent Scorn, and even the <hi>Book-binder</hi> fell under his Indignation,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95217:21"/>
for only <hi>Lettering</hi> some Books <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:</hi> Whereas, what he has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished makes up but a little more than the <hi>tenth</hi> part of the Book: And 'tis to be hoped, that he will condescend to allow, That, to omit what had been formerly Printed, the Illustrious <hi>Spanheim</hi> has done that Author some Service, both in his <hi>Collection of Fragments,</hi> and in an entire Volume of Learned <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations</hi> on that Poet.</p>
            <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Stanley:</hi> I shall prove, That his Locks were pick'd, and his Trunks rifled; and that both Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Method, in marshalling his <hi>Fragments,</hi> a great part of his <hi>Notes on several Heads,</hi> and some of his <hi>Animadversions,</hi> are taken from that very Learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and let the World pass a Just Censure upon the Matter of Fact: The very individual <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi> will be left in Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95217:21"/>
Bookseller's hands, for some time after the Publication of this <hi>Treatise,</hi> that every Man of Learning and Candour, may, if he please, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Copies.</p>
            <p>It ought to be acknowledged, That Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> has made some <hi>Additions</hi> to Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and it must have been a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, if a Man who has sifted the old <hi>Lexicographers,</hi> and <hi>Scholiasts,</hi> both Printed and in MS, should not have found out some Passages which had escaped the Diligence of that Learned Gentleman; of whose <hi>Notes</hi> it must observed, That they are an Imperfect Draught of a more Compleat Work: And I have been informed, that he left a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Copy behind him, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preserv'd or not, I cannot learn. But it's very Remarkable, That, to manage the Affair dextrously, Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> has in some places (it may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95217:22"/>
be believ'd wilfully, and to conceal the Fraud) inverted the Order of the MS. but this will be remembred in due Time and Place; in the mean while I shall transcribe Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Method, and add some few <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of my own, leaving the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to give his Verdict upon the whole.</p>

These Books, I question not but Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> reserv'd for his second Thoughts; but what cannot at present be found of his Notes, has been largely supply'd by the above-named <hi>Johnsius</hi>;<note place="margin">l. 2. c. 5.</note> who with true Judgment and Accuracy has treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95217:35"/>
of these <hi>Catalogues, Indices,</hi> or <hi>Tables</hi> of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and collected the greatest and best part of those numerous Quotations, which adorn Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Edition. The Order, which that very Learned Critic (a Title which no Man will deny to <hi>Johnsius</hi>) observes, is very Regular and Beautiful: He affirms, in the first place, That <hi>Callimachus</hi> in those Books hath most excellently illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the History of Letters, of Learned Men and their Works (of all sorts; for as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> informs, he accounted for the Writings of <hi>Chaerephon</hi> and <hi>Corybion</hi> about <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi>; and of <hi>Aegimius,</hi> and <hi>Egesip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Metrobius</hi> and <hi>Phoetus</hi> about the <hi>Ways of making Cakes</hi>;) giving an Account, First of their Names (which Work was of great use to <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Magnes,</hi> when he wrote his Book <gap reason="foreign">

he ascribes the Life of <hi>Homer,</hi> which <hi>Tatianus</hi> says he wrote:<note place="margin">

                  <p>Then he proceeds to consider the second <hi>Pinax,</hi> or Catalogue of those who wrote Fables, according to the Series of Time: In which, First, He treated of the Poets; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He fix'd the several Ages
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95217:36"/>
in which they lived; Thirdly, He gave a Catalogue of their Fables or Plays; with the true Title of each Play, a short History of the Plot and Management, and the Year in which it was Acted; with a further Relation of the other Plays of the same Poet which were never brought upon the Stage; Which were <hi>Genuine,</hi> which <hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>; and to what Author the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Verses, that occurr'd in Books, did belong.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>Pinax,</hi> which <hi>Johnsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> considers, is his Account of the Works of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Words that occur in them</hi>; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Reader may find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Curious Observations (though Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> says nothing) if he will consult the Book:<note place="margin">p. 14 ½.</note> And for this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression I shall beg pardon (tho' to me it seem'd not unnecessary) when I have anticipated an Objection, that

eminent Authors of the best Ages of Literature were corrected: But to do justice first to the <hi>Manes</hi> of the learned Mr. <hi>Stanley,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to that Honour, which he hath merited, in hopes that in the next Impression of the Works of <hi>Callimachus,</hi> the World may be inform'd, to whom they stand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd for so many accurate, and usefull observations; then to that worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>Edward Sherburn,</hi> to whom the Dr. owes his gratefull acknowledgments though he is content to stifle, and suppress them, for many Favours (for so I call all the assistances given to any Man's Studies, as in truth they are, greater than Money or Titles, for those generally make a man Proud, and Impertinent, whereas these make him truly Wise) particularly his Loan of Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Callimachus</hi>; and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95217:42"/>
in the last place to do Justice to Dr. <hi>B.</hi> himself, who professes himself very tender in this Point, and to abhor the name of a Plagiary; for in his Appendix to <hi>John Malela,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 4.</note> he stands upon his guard, and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares, that whereas he could Amasse a greater heap of collections concerning <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore lest he should be accused of citing, what <hi>Paulus Leopardus</hi> had beforehand observ'd upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But the <hi>Emendations</hi> of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate <hi>Flanderkin</hi> were well known to learned Men, and well read, and would easily have been distinguish'd by their Marks if alienated. Nay so nice is he in his management, that in the same Book,<note place="margin">p. 45.</note> he accuses even his best benefactor, Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> for quoting an old Scholiast in his Life of <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> which he borrowed from <hi>Julius Caesar Bulengerus</hi> the Jesuite, without nameing him.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95217:43"/>
Now can any man it his Wits think an Author sound in his Mind, who after he had made such bold chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, and so freely past his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures on the worthy part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind should by undeniable Proofs be convicted a <hi>Notorious Plagiary</hi>; 'tis an affliction, that he was not taken in the Fact, but 'tis not too late to convict him; who professes, to have observ'd <hi>such things, as have escap'd the Observation of others, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the best Wits to hit not only upon the same sence but the same Words</hi>;<note place="margin">Dissert. p. 36.</note> and that the Province of a true Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick obliges him to <hi>adjust every Book, and every Paragraph to its right Author.</hi> And it were to be wish'd he had kept up to his Protestations.</p>
                  <p>This undertaking therefore I call doing justice to Dr. <hi>B.</hi> both because I know as a Divine he is satisfyed, that 'tis a standing Rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Justice, <hi>to do to others, as we

                  </p>
                  <p>His Epistle at the end of <hi>Malela</hi> is a confused Rhapsody, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his discourse about <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Epistles you have well consider'd, and judiciously selected and sorted the materials; the regular digestion of the Works of <hi>Callimachus</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had made, but when the Dr. is sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under his own Government, he

naturally, or through inadvertency, transgresses the Rules of Method; few Men would have thought, but that such an exact observer of times of the Original of rites and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes; of the rise, flourishing, and and Deaths of Great Men (that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Foundation he Builds most of his Arguments against the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Palaris,</hi> and the <hi>Tables of Aesop,</hi>) should, when he undertook to give a Catalogue of the Authors,<note place="margin">

he treats of the <hi>Origine of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In those Lectures, I do profess, there appears much good Learning and some good Argument; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sort of Proof does not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commence Demonstration; and I shall never be easily persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to believe, that it is necessary to confute the Atheist to affirm as a Theological Truth, That <hi>every Star is a World, and every one of those Worlds inhabited</hi>; which, though I think, may be true, yet I do not think infallibly so; nor are those Ancient Sages to be despised, who asserted much different Hypotheses of the State of the Heavens, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Fathers, who defended Christianity from other Topicks, and thought themselves able to prove the World not to have been Eternal, without affirming the Sun

to be immoveable, and the World that we live in, a Planet.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible I have digress'd too far; and return to <hi>Callimachus,</hi> to fulfil my Promise. I expected, when I look'd on the last beautiful Edition of that Poet, to have found every little Passage of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Writers, wherein but his Name was mentioned, gathered to my hands by Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> but I have met with a few, which, I presume, he either had not seen, or forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and because I am persuaded, it will not disserve the Learned World, I shall insert them.</p>

Crates,</hi> with some others of the same Form, could determine at view, what Word or Fragment was <hi>Homer</hi>'s, and which had Relation to any other Poet's Family; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those Judges <hi>Callimachus</hi> made a Noble Figure; they pretended, and their Claim was just, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the several Styles of Authors, as well as they could distinguish se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countenances; the exact Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the one, as well as the Air and Features of the other, nor was this Excellency peculiar to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the acuter <hi>Romans</hi> had an equal Title; <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> could distinguish genuine <hi>Tully</hi> from any fictitious Writings; and the Plays of <hi>Plautus</hi> were discerned in like manner, by <hi>Varro,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>These were Men of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Temper; but in those early days there was a <hi>Zoilus,</hi> a good <hi>Grammarian,</hi> but a Snarler,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95217:51"/>
who snapt at whatever came in his way, and could not be persuaded to spare <hi>Homer</hi> himself; and after him a <hi>Zoticus,</hi> who did the same with the Poems of <hi>Antimachus</hi>; nor is the Family yet extinct, the Race is numerous, and planted in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdoms, and they are to be known by their haughty Aspect, their proud Gate, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly Language; they make Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees for Authors, and reprobate whatever they dislike. And this is not one of the meanest Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities belonging to Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> he hath a peculiar Faculty in bold Stroaks of the Pencil; he can give a holy Angel the Colour and Shapes of a Fiend, and make <hi>Lucifer</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Son of Light, paint the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Men, who have liv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, under the Figures of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Sots,</hi> and <hi>Madmen</hi>; and at the same time give <hi>Aesop</hi> the Shapes

                  <p>In the first Essay the Dr. assur'd the World, That he had retired from the Vanities of the Heathen Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his Diet was different after he became a Learned Bishop's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and his Course of Life more Reserv'd; and yet after that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Protestation, he is relaps'd to his old beloved Studies (nor do I think it blameable, had he not publickly renounc'd 'em) and hath printed the <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Callimachus</hi>; and would he pursue and continue his Design, I should own my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations

            <p>I AM willing to lay hold of the first Opportunity I can, to justifie my self against Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Mis-representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And have therefore begg'd leave of the Gentleman, who has obliged the World with these Papers, to add this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Appendix</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>The Account which I gave the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> under my Hand, and he Printed, was in these Words.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>Whereas the Reverend Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> has thought fit, in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to Mr <hi>Wotton</hi>'s Reflections on Antient and Modern Learning, (pp. <hi>66, 67.</hi>) to insert the following Words, as Matter of Fact, [viz. <hi>A Bookseller came to me in the Name of the Editors, to beg the use of the Manuscript. It was not then in my Custody; but assoon as I had the Power of it, I went voluntarily and offer'd it to him, bidding him tell the Collator, not to lose any time; for I was shortly to go out of Town for Two Months. 'Twas deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95217:54"/>
us'd, and return'd: Not a Word said by the Bearer, nor the least Suspicion in me, that They had not finished the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.]</hi> I think my self oblig'd to give the World the following Account; wherein I have faithfully related what pass'd upon that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                  <p>I was employ'd by the Honourable Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> (and by Him Only) to borrow the <hi>MS</hi> of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> from Dr <hi>Bentley.</hi> After <hi>about Nine Months</hi> Solicitation, it was delivered into my Custody, without any time limited for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it. Within <hi>few Days</hi> after, Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> called upon me, to have it restored, and then told me, that he was to go into the Country. He staid, till I sent to the <hi>Collator;</hi> and word was brought by the Messenger, <hi>That it was not Collated.</hi> I then begg'd of him to let me have it but till <hi>Sunday Morning</hi> (it was <hi>Saturday Noon</hi> when he came) and I engaged to oblige the Collator to sit up all <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday Night</hi> to get it finished. But he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly refused to leave it with me any longer; demanding to have it sent That Day to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> (which was done accordingly); and not giving me any the least Hopes, That if I applied to him upon his Return out of the Country, I should have leave to get the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation perfected. These Circumstances I am thus particular in, because I had occasion to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95217:54"/>
recollect 'em not long afterwards, when Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Book came out, and Letters passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Him</hi> and Dr <hi>Bentley,</hi> concerning the Passage in his <hi>Preface.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may not be proper, considering my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for Me to add an Account of the Reflections Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> was pleased to make from time to time, when I spoke to him from Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> for the use of the <hi>MS.</hi> He has represented Me, as having said too much on that Subject. But, by good Fortune, Dr <hi>King</hi> was present at one of the Meetings, and heard all that passed there. I hope he will do Justice on this Occasion.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>This Account Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> pretends to <hi>Elude</hi> several ways. As to that part of it, wherein I say, that I solicited Him <hi>about</hi> 9 <hi>months</hi> for the MS; He brings Mr <hi>Postle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwayt</hi>'s, Mr <hi>Wright</hi>'s, and other Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to prove, That from <hi>his very first Admission to the Office of Library-Keeper to the time, that I not only had,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xiv.</note> 
               <hi>but return'd the MS, there was but one single Month.</hi> Which may be True, for ought I know, and yet all I have said be true too; As I am sure it is to a <hi>Tittle:</hi> for there is not a single Word, in my Relation, that does in the least imply me, to have thought the Dr <hi>Library-Keeper,</hi> the Whole time I ask'd him for the MS. I apply'd to him, as a Friend
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95217:55"/>
very Conversant in these <hi>Things,</hi> who liv'd not far from the <hi>Royal Library,</hi> had an Interest there, and could procure the <hi>MS</hi> for me; But whether or no I had so Early heard the Rumour of the Dr's stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair for that Office (tho' it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I had) yet I cannot be positive in it: sure I am, that upon my Application to Him, he promis'd readily (and, as near as I can remember, in these very Words) that <hi>He would help me to it</hi>; without intimating in the least, that I asked him a Thing which was out of his Power. This gave me sufficient ground to write Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> word (as I did presently afterwards) That he might depend upon having the MS collated. And that I was not out, in fixing the Date of my Application thus Early, appears from several Letters of Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s, on that Subject; <hi>Five</hi> of which I have luckily preserved on my File, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten between <hi>Octob.</hi> 8. 1693. and <hi>May</hi> 25. 1694. the Time, about which Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> is supposed to have left the Town, and called in the MS. Between these Dates, a Space of <hi>Seven Months and Seventeen Days</hi> is included; and I do verily believe, that I had Letters from the same <hi>Honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> on this Subject, antecedent to all these, though I cannot yet find them; as I am certain I had several others from Him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95217:55"/>
it, during this Space, which are now lost, or mislaid. And I very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I had a <hi>Verbal Order</hi> to this Purpose, from Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> himself, in the latter End of <hi>July,</hi> or Beginning of <hi>August,</hi> 1693. when I waited upon him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I then was upon my own Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Any Gentleman that pleases to be at the Trouble of over-looking these Letters, shall command a sight of them; and by them he will be perfectly satisfied that the Business of the MS was thus long, at least, in Agitation; and from thence will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe me, when I assure him, that it was somewhat longer, though I cannot at this distance produce the same punctual Evidence for it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> has done me the Favour, after Reviewing those Letters of <hi>His,</hi> to write to me in the following manner.</p>

            <p>All the Exception that I can imagine it possible for Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> to make to this Proof is, that I gave Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> all along false accounts of things, and pretended to have asked him for the <hi>MS,</hi> when I had not. But to any man that allows me to be employed thus Early in the matter, This will be incredible: for I could not want an Opportunity of speaking to the Dr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, He passing by my Door very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and calling in there every Now and Then, as he went: for we were at that time in good Terms together, and he was pleased to consult me sometimes about Matters in My Way, wherein He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; so that nothing could be more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and easie, than my making such a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95217:56"/>
Request to Him; and it is inconceivable, in these Circumstances, that I should send Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> word, I had done it, when I really had not.</p>
            <p>I must desire the Reader to take Notice of those frequent opportunities I had of speaking to Dr <hi>Bentley,</hi> without stirring out of my House for it; because it utterly takes off his Pretence about my Inventing this story to Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> on purpose to cover <hi>my own Negligence:</hi> He would willingly have Insinuated,<note place="margin">p. xxxvii.</note> as if I declined the trouble of Soliciting Him for the MS, because he lived at a distance from me, and Journeys were to be taken for it: Whereas there was really no more Trouble in it, than just to make the Request to Him, and renew it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as He either stopp'd at my Shop, or pass'd by it. He was mistaken therefore, when he said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Diss.</hi> p. 66. Edit. I.</note> 
               <hi>That a Bookseller</hi> CAME <hi>to him to beg the use of the MS</hi>; for in Truth, and as He Himself upon second Thoughts begins to Own, I never <hi>came</hi> to him on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but only <hi>ask'd him for it at my own Shop</hi> occasionally:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref.</hi> p. xx.</note> though I ask'd him so often (<hi>twenty times</hi> at least) that I might well say, I <hi>solicited</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> Indeed, finding Him roundly affirm <hi>that I</hi> CAME <hi>to him for the MS,</hi> might suppose what he said to be true, and speak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: but I, who know it to be otherwise,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95217:57"/>
think my self oblig'd to declare it;<note place="margin">p. xx.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding what Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> has Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially offer'd to prevent me in it.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Dr is all over mistaken, upon this Head. I had formerly declar'd, that I applyed to him in Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Name; whereas He assur'd the Reader, that I came to him in the <hi>Name of the Editors.</hi> He would now Qualifie that expression: for by <hi>Editors</hi> He pretends that he meant Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> only;<note place="margin">p. xxxix, xl.</note> which They who can believe, may believe all the rest of his Story.<note place="margin">p. xvi.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in one part of his late Preface, he says, that in <hi>May</hi> he <hi>deliver'd the MS</hi> to the Bookseller; which in the next words he further Affirms: <hi>For,</hi> says the Dr, <hi>as I said before, as soon as I had it in my Power, I went Voluntarily, and offer'd it to him.</hi> He would be understood here to have come to me, of his own accord, as soon as he had the Key; and to have offer'd me the <hi>MS,</hi> before I had renewed my Application to Him: Nay, he would be thought to have brought it himself to me; for That I think his Words plainly Imply: But that none of these Circumstances are True, He himself is my Witness; who in his Letter to Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> (writ a while after the Edition of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and since, by great Accident, retriev'd, and communicated to me,) has these Words: <hi>When I got the Key, Mr</hi> Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95217:57"/>
               <hi>meeting me again, renewed the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and I very readily granted it.</hi> And in the Preface to his last Book the Dr says, That <hi>I sent my Apprentice to the Library for the MS,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xx.</note> 
               <hi>by his appointment, and received it.</hi> How he could <hi>come, as soon as he had it in his Power and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offer it to me</hi>; and yet not <hi>grant it me, after he got the Key, till, meeting me again, I renewed my Request:</hi> How he could bring it himself to me; which the Words I mention'd were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently design'd to Imply; and yet my <hi>Servant</hi> come to the Library by his Appointment, and receive it from Him: These are Inconsistencies which Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> may perhaps reconcile, but, I dare say, no body else can.</p>
            <p>Nay, He was so far from Offering, and Delivering it to me, <hi>as soon as it was in his Power,</hi> that even from his own Account it will appear, that he kept it three Weeks (and probably longer) after it was in his Power; and gave it out but five or six days at the farthest, before He intended to take His Journey. For the Key of the Library was delivered back to the Vice-Chamberlain by Mr <hi>Postlethwayt</hi> and Mr <hi>Wright, some Weeks after Easter which, fell that Year on April</hi> 8. We will suppose,<note place="margin">p. xvi.</note> it was deliver'd in by them, a fortnight after that: for why should they keep it longer in their Custody, when they had now finished the Catalogue, and Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> was actually possessed of his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95217:58"/>
Pattent? as he was, he tells us, <hi>April</hi> the 18. We may be sure,<note place="margin">p. xx.</note> that the Key rested but a Little while after this in the Vice-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain's hands; and may fairly suppose, that the Dr had it in his keeping, for a whole Week in <hi>April:</hi> And if so, then I had not the <hi>MS,</hi> till above three Weeks after he had the Key; allowing him to have set out for <hi>Worcester,</hi> Monday, <hi>May</hi> 21. but there being no Evidence of his arrival at <hi>Worcester</hi> till <hi>June</hi> the 1st, we may as well suppose that he did not set out, till Monday <hi>May</hi> the 28th: and then it will follow, that he had the Key a month before He delivered out the <hi>MS.</hi> And yet the Dr says, that he gave it me <hi>as soon as he had it in his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this only by the bye: My Intention was, to show that I cannot, with the least probability, be suspected to have pretended an application to Dr <hi>Bentley,</hi> without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, when it was in my Power to do it so often, and so easily; and when there can be no Imaginable Reason given why I should not do it: For, what end could I propose to my self in thus abusing both Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> and Dr <hi>Bentley?</hi> What Visible Interest could I have in promoting a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding between them? It had been probably more to my Advantage, in the way of my business, to have preserv'd the good will of Both, and prevented this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95217:58"/>
Breach; which I sincerely endeavoured, as much, and as long as I was able: for I all a-long conceal'd from Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> the odd Manner in which Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> delay'd me, though I could not conceal the Delay it self, and let him know nothing of the many slight and Injurious things Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> threw out, now and then both of Him and the Work he was about: And this I did, till the very last Push, when (as the Matter appear'd to me) there was an absolute Necessity for me, either to send the Collation of the <hi>MS,</hi> or a positive Answer that I could not. And for the Truth of my willingness to do these good Offices those Letters of Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, are my Vouchers: In each of which, from <hi>Oct.</hi> 8. 1693 onward, though the expediting the Business of the <hi>MS</hi> with Dr <hi>Bentley,</hi> be always pressed, yet is there no appearance of his knowing any thing of the Dr's Rude usage of him, till that of <hi>May</hi> 1st. 1694, which begins in these Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am almost asham'd to trouble you any more, Mr</hi> Bennet, <hi>about the</hi> MS; <hi>I wish, I had it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, if at all, I must have it very quickly; and though I can do pretty well without it, yet Mr</hi> Bentley's <hi>rudeness is not the less,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Little before this, it seems, I had given Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> an Account of Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Delays and Expressions: This was probably in the very latter end of <hi>April,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:95217:59"/>
when the Dr, being now in full possession of his Office, spake ('tis to be thought) a little bigger to me then ordinary, about the <hi>MS</hi>; and (for what end he best knows) began to give me less hopes of it then ever. And this I suppose, was the Conference Dr <hi>King</hi> was witness to, and has given some Account of. 'Twas high time for me now to let Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> know, that I found fresh difficulties in getting the Collation; and Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> having been so open and so unwary in his <hi>Reflections</hi> (the <hi>meaning</hi> of which word he pretends not to understand but I hope by this time it is pretty plain to him) it was to no purpose for me to think of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing them.</p>
            <p>This I Solemnly declare to be a faithfull and punctual account of that Transaction, as far as my Memory at this distance can reach the Circumstances of it. 'Tis therefore Amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, how Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> could express himself on this occasion with that Assurance he has done. I shall give the Reader his Words, and then, after observing a few things upon them, leave my self to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Judgment on this Article.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I suppose it's sufficiently Manifest</hi> (says the Dr) <hi>from his Majesty's Patent, Mr</hi> Postle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwayt's, <hi>and Mr</hi> Wrights <hi>Testimonies, and the Residence-Rolls of the Church of</hi> Worcester, <hi>that the</hi> MS, <hi>was delivered, used and Return'd
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95217:59"/>
within the space of</hi> ONE MONTH, <hi>after I had the Custody of the Library</hi> (he should have said, in the space of <hi>five Weeks:</hi> Further than which, I have shew'd, that his <hi>Evidence</hi> will not go, should we allow every Syllable of it) <hi>so that</hi> (continues the Dr) <hi>the deposition of the Bookseller, that he could not obtain the</hi> MS <hi>till after about</hi> 9 <hi>Months Sollicitation is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to be a notorious falshood:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xviii.</note> 
               <hi>And since he has further declared, that it was in his Intention a perjury; He has Pillouried himself in Print, as long as that Book shall last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are Gross Words, and might tempt me to forget the Respect that is owing to his Character; he having first forgot it, when he stoop't to such Rude Expressions: Especially after the care I had taken to express my self in my Relation as inoffensively as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: but let him allow himself the use of what Language he thinks fit; I shall endeavour to keep within my Bounds. I only ask therefore, how it follows, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the</hi> MS <hi>was delivered, us'd, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Month</hi> (or rather <hi>five Weeks) after it was in his Custody</hi>; therefore my <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> which says, <hi>I could not obtain it till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about</hi> 9 <hi>months sollicitation is demonstrated to be a falsehood</hi>: For might not I apply to him, and he receive my Application (as he most certainly did) for 7 or 8 <hi>months</hi> before the forms of his admittance were fully compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95217:60"/>
Ay, but <hi>his Warrant was but taken out of the Secretarys Office,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xix.</note> Dec. XXIII. 1693; <hi>and there were therefore but five months in all, from the first</hi> RUMOUR <hi>of his being Library-keeper, to the time that I had the</hi> MS. But why must the first RUMOUR of his being <hi>Library-keeper</hi> needs be dated from the time of his taking out his Warrant? Mr <hi>Justel</hi> dyed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months before this; and was there no RU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOUR of Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s coming into the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, till the very time that he Actually <hi>took out</hi> his Warrant for it? Particularly, when Mr <hi>Postlethwayt,</hi> and Mr <hi>Wright</hi> were taking a Catalogue of the Books from <hi>Oct.</hi> 1693, to <hi>April</hi> 1694. will Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> pretend, that, during that whole <hi>six Months</hi> time, he had no acquaintance with the Library, nor Interest enough to procure any thing out of it? will he say, he did not accompany these Gentlemen often to the Place, and assist them in their Work? I have some Reason to believe He did both: But upon good Grounds I can assure the Reader, that he often did the first: And if Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> thinks fit to deny it, I will produce my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. What signifies it then to say, that Mr <hi>Postlethwayt,</hi> and Mr <hi>Wright had the Key Constantly in their keeping,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xix.</note> 
               <hi>from Oct. till May?</hi> for did their keeping the Key shut out Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>? Or had he a less freedome of Resort on that Account, than if the Key had
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95217:60"/>
all the while been in his own Custody? to what purpose is it to ask, <hi>How could I</hi> DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAND <hi>the Key of the Library before I had a</hi> RIGHT <hi>to it?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </note> as if there was no other way of <hi>Procuring</hi> the <hi>MS</hi> for Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> but by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> the <hi>Key</hi> of the Library, as of <hi>Right</hi> due to him. I desire no more, but that these Worthy Gentlemen, whose Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as far as it goes, I do not distrust, will be pleased to give us the Rest of it: And then I question not but it will appear, that Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> both before and at the time of their taking the Catalogue, had Interest enough in the Royal Library, to get a <hi>MS</hi> of much greater Value than this was, out of it; and that it was no ways unreasonable either for Me to ask it of Him, or for him to undertake <hi>to help me to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Account he says, <hi>carrys this Accusation in it, that he could much sooner have lent me the Book, if he pleased:</hi> and I say,<note place="margin">p. xx.</note> it does not, but only that He could, if he pleased, have GOT the Book TO BE LENT me: or at least, that so he pretended: And that he did so, I most sincerely affirm. Why after these pretences he delay'd so long to do what he had promised, and why he at last ordered me the <hi>MS,</hi> just at that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nick of time when he was leaving the Town, without any Intimation how soon it was to be restored (which is a Circumstance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95217:61"/>
that I am very positive in) it becomes not Me to conjecture; only I may, I hope, without offence, repeat his own Words, without the least Variation. <hi>It appears</hi> (says the Dr) <hi>upon Record,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxi.</note> 
               <hi>that I took a Journey soon after the Lending, which was not a sudden and unexpected one, for the time of my Residence had been fixed Six Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I must needs know then of my intended Journey, when I lent the MS to the Bookseller: and 'tis very unlikely that I should omit to give him notice of it</hi>; UNLESS <hi>it be supposed, that I had then a private Design to disappoint him of the use of the MS.</hi> Whether he really had any such Private Design as this, or for what Reasons he took it up; Whether out of a particular pique to any Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Body, out of the abundance of good Humour which is natural to him on such occasions; or out of a Resolution of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncivil to me, because I had not been <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> to him in some <hi>Way</hi> that he expected; I leave to his Conscience, and the Opinion of the Reader.</p>
            <p>He is pleas'd himself to own, that he told me, <hi>after the various Lections were once taken and Printed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxx.</note> 
               <hi>the MS would be like a squeez'd Orange, and little worth for the future</hi>: And if my not taking this Hint as readily, and in the manner I should have done, was the occasion of all this Troublesome Work
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95217:61"/>
that has happened since; I heartily beg Mr <hi>Boyles</hi> and his Pardon for it. For whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his meaning was, I had rather have comply'd with it, than have brought my self into this Controversie; which I assure him, does not please me in the least, tho' it has turned to so good an Account.</p>
            <p>However, I can never allow the Account which the Dr himself has given us of the Occasion and Rise of this Passage about the <hi>Squeez'd Orange</hi>; because it contradicts ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account, which I have much more reason to rely on. <hi>After I was Nominated</hi> (says he) <hi>to the Library-keepers Office,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxx.</note> 
               <hi>before my Patent was finish'd,</hi> (that is, some time between Decemb. 23. (93.) and April 18. (94.) <hi>I was informed, that one Copy of every Book Printed in</hi> England, <hi>which was due to the Royal Library by Act of Parliament, had not of late been brought into the Library, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said Act. Vpon this I made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Master of the Stationers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to whom the Act directed me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Copies. The effect whereof was, that I procured near a Thousand Volumes of one sort or other, which are now Lodged in the Library. While this was Transacting, I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to call on Mr</hi> Bennet <hi>(whom I had several times obliged) and acquainted him with it, not questioning but he would be very Ready to comply as far as his share went; which was then
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95217:62"/>
but very little: But to my surprize, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me very Pertly, that he knew not what Right the Parliament had to give away any Mans Property; and he hoped the Company of Stationers would refuse, and try it out at Law. They were a Body and had a Common Purse, and more to this purpose. Some little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calling there again, upon a fresh Discourse about the MS Phalaris, which I had</hi> formerly promised to lend him, <hi>as soon as I had power; I asked him upon what Account he could refuse to give the Royal Library its due, settled on it by Act of Parliament; and at the same time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a favour out of it, that would make his own Book more vendible, and the MS less valuable: For after the various Lections were once taken and Printed, the</hi> MS <hi>would be like a squeezed Orange, and little worth for the future. Since therefore he was resolved to try the Law against the Library, he ought in Justice to present to it some Books of competent value, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the damage it would sustain by his using the</hi> MS.</p>
            <p>In this Account the Dr labours at three Things; he would be thought to have first set a-foot this <hi>Collection</hi> of one Book of a sort due to the Royal Library; for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Books (Mine in particular) as at that time actually uncollected.</p>
            <p>He would raise an ill opinion of Me, as if I was tardy in sending in my share; and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95217:62"/>
talked <hi>pertly</hi> and foolishly about the Power of the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And He would perswade the Reader, that it was at such a Discourse, and on such an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as this, that the famous passage about a <hi>Squeezed Orange</hi> dropt from him.</p>
            <p>But now, if I can prove beyond exception, that these Books due to the Royal Library were collected from the several Booksellers, and particularly from Me, some Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dr <hi>was nominated to his Office</hi> (in his sense of the words;) and that I complied rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily with the Demand that was made of my share, without any dispute whatsoever: If I can shew the Dr's memory to have misled him evidently in these Two particulars, his Third point must necessarily be a mistake. For if no such Discourse could happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and me, after he was nominated to his Office; then the passage about the <hi>Orange</hi> must needs have been said upon some other Occasion, and with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Design than what he mentions.</p>
            <p>For a true Account of the two first of these points, I refer my self to the following Certificate.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>I find likewise by my Accounts that His Books, and those from most of the other Booksellers, were delivered in, before the <hi>13</hi>th Day of <hi>July 1693.</hi> and on that Day part of them were sent to the Vniversities.</p>

            </floatingText>
            <p>Dr <hi>Bently</hi> says he set about this project of getting the Books due to the Kings Library collected, (for so he would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him) <hi>after he was nominated to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-keepers Office,</hi> and <hi>before his Patent was finished,</hi> that is, some time between <hi>Decem.</hi> 23. 1693. and <hi>April</hi> 18. 94. and that <hi>while this was transacting,</hi> (we will suppose in <hi>Jan.</hi> 1693/4.) He called upon me, and had the discourse he pretends with me. Now from the Officers Certificate, it appears that both <hi>my</hi> Books, and those of <hi>most other</hi> Booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, were actually delivered in before the 13th of <hi>July</hi> 1693; that is 6 Months earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Date of this pretended Discourse of mine: I leave the Reader in this case to believe which he pleases, the Dr, or the Beadle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:95217:63"/>I remember nothing of any such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course ever happening between Dr <hi>B,</hi> and me; but if it ever happen'd, it must be before the <hi>thirteenth</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1693. And if so, then this will be a Clear Proof that the Dr Interested Himself Publickly in the affairs of the Library, for <hi>above ten Months</hi> before he took his Journey to <hi>Worcester</hi> (for so long it is between the begining of <hi>July.</hi> 1693. and the end of <hi>May.</hi> 1694.) and this will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Testimony I gave about my <hi>nine</hi> Months Solicitation beyond dispute: for sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I might Solicit the Dr as <hi>Library-keeper about nine months</hi> before he went to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>; if he himself, as <hi>Library-keeper,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly solicited others <hi>above ten Months,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the same time. I thank the Dr for supplying me with a more direct and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Proof of my whole <hi>nine months</hi> Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Him, than, I must confess, I at this distance had, without his help, been able to produce.</p>
            <p>Whether the Dr and I might not have some General talk together about the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears due to the King's Library (tho' not at the time the Dr says we had) I will neither affirm, nor deny; because I Remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, and do not love to talk at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but the discourse he puts in my Mouth on this occasion, is all over so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and senseless, that no body that knows
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95217:64"/>
either Me, or the World, will think me Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it; or if they do, I shall not much care, what such Persons think of me. I was ready, from the first moment the thing was started, to deliver in my share, according to my Duty: if he had such a dispute with any body else in this matter, and now Fathers it upon me, God forgive him for the Calumny.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole it appears, that this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dr's, about a <hi>Squeez'd Orange,</hi> and a <hi>Collated</hi> MS <hi>being worth nothing,</hi> could not be uttered with relation to the Affair, to which Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> tacks it: with what View it was really spoken, I take not upon me to say; the world will Guess, but cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Know, untill He, in a Relenting hour, shall think fit to inform them.</p>
            <p>I am bound also to Justifie my self upon another particular wherein Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> has laid himself more open, if it be possible, than the former, he remembers a second Discourse between him and me concerning <hi>Phalaris then in the Press. I ask'd his opinion</hi> (he says) <hi>about the Edition, whether it would be a</hi> Vendible <hi>Book</hi> (a word I dare say I never used in my Life) and told him <hi>that I had a Concern in the Impression, and hop'd that it would sell well.</hi> I utterly deny that ever I spake a Syllable to him tending this way; and 'tis improbable to the highest degree,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95217:64"/>
that ever I should. For the Dr's manner of telling the Story shews, that I should hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have said what he represents me to have done, out of the Vanity of being thought concern'd in the Edition of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; and that I had no way any <hi>Interest</hi> in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, the following Certificate will plainly prove.</p>

            <p>The Book, it appears, was altogether Printed at another Man's Costs and Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (and it was designed from the beginning so to be; Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> giving the Profits of it to Mr <hi>Crooke</hi>:) when the Impression was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, the greatest part of it was sold to Mr <hi>Crosley</hi> Bookseller in <hi>Oxford</hi>; and from Him I had 50 Books at first, and a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95217:65"/>
few more, some years after, from another hand: which is the whole number that I was any ways concerned in the Sale of, and is far less than I commonly use of any <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Impression. If the Reader can believe after this, that I told Dr <hi>Bently I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the Impression,</hi> he must believe me to be out of my Wits; and that I love to tell Lies to no manner of purpose, and where 'tis in every Body's power to trace me.</p>
            <p>This misrepresentation of the Dr's then is easily set right: If the Dr could Justifie himself as well, upon another part of the Story he has told of this Edition, it would be much for his Credit. The particular I mean, relates to the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Publication</hi> of <hi>Phalaris</hi>; and that being a thing which my business may be supposed to give me some light into, it may not be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for me here to consider it.</p>
            <p>The Dr lays great stress upon the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he gave Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> of having the Story of the <hi>MS</hi> clear'd up, before his Book was published. <hi>The very Day</hi> (he says) <hi>that he saw Mr</hi> Boyle<hi>'s new Phalaris in the hands of a Person of Honour, to whom it had been presented, while the rest of the Impression was not yet Published, he wrote to Mr</hi> Boyle <hi>at</hi> Oxford <hi>to give him a true Information of the whole matter: expecting</hi> (says he) <hi>that upon the Receipt of my Letter, he would put a stop
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95217:65"/>
to the Publication of his Book, till he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that Passage, and Printed the Page anew; which he might have done in one Day, and at the Charge of Five Shillings. I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly desire him to take out that passage, and Reprint the whole Leafe; That I thought was too low a Submission. But I said enough to make any Person of Common Justice and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity have own'd me thanks for</hi> PREVENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING <hi>him from doing a very ill Action.</hi>

               </note> bears upon, through out his Preface, and one would imagine it impossible almost, but that a Matter of Fact, which he is so full of, should really be as he has represented it. But it so happens that the very Letter he wrote to Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> being still preserved, manifestly destroys all the Dr has said on this occasion. It is dated from the Bishop of <hi>Worcesters</hi> in <hi>Park-Street, Jan.</hi> 26. 1694/5. a good while before which Mr <hi>Boyles</hi> Book was certainly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and sold publickly in <hi>Oxford, London,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:95217:66"/>
and other Places. On the first of that Month above one Hundred of them were dispersed in <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a Custom, which Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> appears to be no Stranger to; and in the 25 Days between this and the date of the Doctors Letter, they were distributed into all the Booksellers Hands who deal that way: And yet Dr <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> would have the World believe, that he writ so early, that Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> upon the Receipt of his Letter, might if he pleased, <hi>have stopp'd the Books in the Printing-house.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. ix. p. xviii.</note> This in his own Expression, is now demonstrated to <hi>be a Notorious Falshood,</hi> by one of those <hi>Notes of Time</hi> which he talks of,<note place="margin">p. xiii.</note> and which he well observes, to be <hi>the truest and surest Helps towards detecting Impostures.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xiv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed not only the Date, but the whole Course of the Letter is an evident Proof, that Dr <hi>Bently</hi> when he writ it, could have no such Aim in his Eye as he pretends, for it all runs upon a Supposal, that the Affront had been publickly given, and was past Recall; nor is there from the beginning to the end of it, a single Word that hints otherwise: And yet Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> is not afraid to tell the World, that he sent this Letter on pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose to prevent Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s inserting the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95217:66"/>
Passage into his Preface; in the same sence, I suppose, that Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> inserted it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s denying him the <hi>MS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We that know nothing of the Learned part of the Controversie, must judge of the Dr's Performance there, by his Exactness in the other Branches of it, that lie within our Reach: And I am sure then (nor will it be improper for me to say,) That if the Dr's Old Accounts of Time, be adjusted with no more Sincerity and Skill than his New ones are, he is not likely long to keep up his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in <hi>Chronology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will be pleased to take my Word awhile for this Account of Dr. <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Letter: If it be false, the Letter it self, when it appears, will quickly disprove it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Collator</hi>'s <hi>Testimony,</hi> which he says, <hi>to what purpose it was produced,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxiv.</note> 
               <hi>is hard to conjecture</hi>; I will endeavour to shew him, that it was produced <hi>to very good purpose.</hi> Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> had affirmed, that upon the Return of the <hi>MS, he had not the least suspicion that the Collation was not finished.</hi> To prove that he had more than a <hi>Suspicion,</hi>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95217:67"/>
and so then is the Collator's Testimony, which expresly Confirms it.</p>

            <p>It appears, That Messages went to and fro between Me and the <hi>Collator</hi>; and that the <hi>MS</hi> was taken out of his Hands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me, while Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> staid at my Shop; for by his saying, that my Man <hi>came back without it the</hi> first time, he plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that he came back <hi>with it</hi> the next; as he certainly did: And this second Demand was made <hi>presently</hi> after the first, while <hi>the Gentleman that own'd the Book, and could spare it no longer, staid at his Shop for it.</hi> Can any Body believe now, that the <hi>MS</hi> was not actually returned, while Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> was in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95217:67"/>
my House; Especially, if it be considered, that the Collator lived hard by me, and the Messenger could not well be above 5 or 6 Minutes going backwards and forwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us? But whether the Dr staid, or not, till he saw it actually returned to me; it is as clear as the Sun, that he was by, when my Apprentice was sent the second time, with Orders to bring it back imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately: And with what Conscience then can he pretend, that when the MS was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down to him at <hi>Westminster</hi> a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>he had no suspicions that the Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not finished</hi>; unless he means, that he did not <hi>suspect it,</hi> because he most certainly <hi>knew it.</hi> God forgive him this Untruth; which, with several others, I hope, before he goes out of the World, he'll be so Just, both to Himself, and Me, as to retract pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>I beg'd of Him,</hi> (I had urg'd) <hi>to let me have the</hi> MS <hi>till</hi> Sunday. <hi>Morning, (it was</hi> Saturday <hi>Noon when he came) and inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to oblige the Collator to sit up all</hi> Saturday <hi>Night to get it finished.</hi> This, he says, is <hi>False and Silly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxvi.</note> For <hi>the whole Collation is but the Work of four Hours; as he proves by an Experiment of his own Collating the first</hi> 40 <hi>Epistles in an Hour, and</hi> 18 <hi>Minutes; and yet he made no very great haste neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:95217:68"/>Now all this Experiment proves (I think) is, That I perhaps was not so well skill'd as to know, what time exactly such a sort of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> would take up; which I might be <hi>Silly</hi> enough to think a Work of more Labor than it really was, and yet might <hi>Honestly</hi> say, what I pretended to say upon that Occasion: For, I hope, silly People may tell Truth.</p>
            <p>But indeed, I was not quite so <hi>Silly,</hi> as the Dr would represent me to be: For when I engaged on <hi>Saturday</hi> at Noon, to get the Collator to sit up <hi>Saturday</hi> Night to finish; <hi>I knew</hi> the Collator, who was <hi>Corrector of a Press,</hi> could allow no part of his <hi>Days</hi> from that Laborious Service; and, which is more, Dr <hi>Bentley knew it too:</hi> For it was what I then urg'd to Him, to excuse the <hi>Collator</hi>'s Delay, and to procure a further Term; and it was so much insisted upon by Me, at that time, that I cannot think it possible for the Dr to have forgotten it. But he refused to allow me the use of the MS any longer, and ordered it to be sent to his Lodgings out of Hand, as it was immediately <hi>after Dinner:</hi> Though the Dr by another slip of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory says, that it was not returned, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be returned, <hi>till Evening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true Reason of Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi>'s being so much behind-hand in the <hi>Collation</hi>; the Press employed Him, and left Him no Hours to Himself, but in the Evening; and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95217:68"/>
He was not careful to make the very best use of Those, because I had not, when I delivered Him the MS, <hi>limited Him in His Time,</hi> having not been my self in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>limited</hi> by Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>; as I protest I was not, not so much as in general, or by an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation that I should make what Dispatch I could:</hi> so far was the Dr from having ty'd me to Days, or Hours, or from giving me any Notice of the Time fix'd for his <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> Journey.</p>
            <p>The Dr Labors to have it thought very <hi>Vnlikely and Improbable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. xxv.</note> that He should leave me thus at large. How <hi>Improbable</hi> it is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be determined, without knowing the <hi>Ends</hi> the Dr might have in his Eye, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> He might Act upon in it. Had He fairly indeed designed that Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> should have the full use of the <hi>MS,</hi> it is not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> that he would have delivered it to me, without any Notice at what time He intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Demand it: But if He designed only to make a shew of lending it, and to avoid the Scandal of Refusing it; if He designed to manage things so that He might seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige Mr <hi>Boyle,</hi> and yet certainly defeat Him; then it is not <hi>Improbable</hi> that Dr <hi>Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> might Act just in the manner I affirm him to have done. I do not directly charge Him with having such Intentions as these; but the Reader, who has observ'd me to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95217:69"/>
have prov'd, That he kept the MS from me 3 Weeks, or a Month, at least; even after He had his Patent, (tho' I had been many Months before that solliciting Him for it) and that He put it into my Hands, but 5 or 6 Days at the most, before He was to leave the Town,<note place="margin">p. xxi.</note> upon a Journey <hi>fixed</hi> 6 <hi>Months before:</hi> The Reader, I say, that has obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these things, may perhaps venture to be somewhat freer in his Opinion of Him, then it becomes me to be. However, since the Dr is arguing from <hi>Probabilities</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,</hi> on this Head, he must give me leave to offer mine in my turn: And to what I have urged already therefore I add this Remark; That, had the Dr set me so short a time, when he put the MS into my hands, it is utterly <hi>improbable,</hi> that I should not have given notice of it to Mr <hi>Gibson</hi>; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially apprehending the Collation to be a Work of more Trouble, than, it seems, it was; and knowing Mr <hi>Gibson</hi>'s hands to be so full of other business. But that Mr <hi>Gibson</hi> had no such notice from me, this <hi>second</hi> Certificate from him will shew.</p>

                  <p>As to his <hi>Experiment</hi> about <hi>Collating the first forty Epistles,</hi> which, he says,<note place="margin">p. xxv.</note> he did <hi>in One Hour and Eighteen Minutes:</hi> I should have thought that the Dr had known Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self better, than to measure another Man's Abilities by his Own: The Dr, who is a great Master of these things, might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch the Matter as fast as He pretends; and yet, my <hi>Collator</hi>'s Eyes and Fingers (without any Reflection upon 'em) not be near so nimble. However, I must beg his Pardon, if I do not believe him, when he says, He made no <hi>very great Haste,</hi> in the doing it; for 'tis not conceivable, why he should keep such an exact Register of his Minutes, while he was at the Work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Intention of disparaging Me, and the Person I employ'd: And if he had That in his Eye, I dare say, He made as much haste as possibly he could; because the sooner He could say, he had finish'd it, the greater Disparagement it would be.</p>
                  <p>Allowing then the Doctor's Calculation of <hi>Four</hi> Hours for the whole, to be just, as it relates to Himself, who is under the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of a particular <hi>Genius</hi> this way, and was quickned perhaps in his Work, by a Prospect of Gratifying his Spleen; yet an
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95217:70"/>
Ordinary Man, who had none of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or Views, might very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire double or treble the time, to do it in. And if so, then it was not very <hi>silly</hi> in me to say, The <hi>Collator should</hi> (after he had done his <hi>Saturday</hi>'s Work) <hi>sit up all Night to finish the</hi> Collation. But were the Saying never so <hi>silly,</hi> yet it was not <hi>false,</hi> I am sure, that I said so: And this sufficiently satisfies me; who am an Hundred times more concern'd to Vindicate my <hi>Honesty,</hi> than my <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had said, that Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> gave me not the least hopes, <hi>That if I apply'd to Him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Return out of the Country, I should have leave to get the Collation Perfected</hi>; To which he Replies, <hi>that I gave him not any hopes of it by an Express Promise, I verily believe.

                     <note place="margin">p. xxvii.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> FORBAD <hi>him to hope it, if there should be Occasion, I cannot Imagine.</hi> 'Tis not for me to help out his Imagination in this Case; but I am sure I both <hi>Saw</hi> and <hi>Heard</hi> such Things, at <hi>That,</hi> and several other Times, that I thought very <hi>Forbidding:</hi> His Peremptory manner of withdrawing the <hi>MS,</hi> the Slight with which He spake of the Edition of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> and the <hi>Editor</hi> himself, made me apprehend, That the way towards his favour in this Matter, would not lie very open, should I again at his Return have attempted it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95217:70"/>
I had given Mr <hi>Boyle</hi> an account of the Dr<hi>'s</hi> parting Civilities; and it would then have been too great a Freedom in me to have made a fresh Application to the Dr, without a new Order from Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>; which he has told the World, that, after such a Repulse, He thought it beneath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to give.

                  <p>He has given me an Opportunity of soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Testimony I gave about the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections he made from time to time:</hi> But I cannot with a good Conscience make use of it. He says,<note place="margin">p. xxviii.</note>

                  <p>He reproaches me with several Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons formerly laid upon me,<note place="margin">p. xxxi.</note> which I am not in the least Conscious of; one only I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my self to have receiv'd from him very lately, that when resolved to use me so very Ill, he was pleas'd to joyn me with such very good Company: 'Tis a favour, and I now publickly thank him for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I Justified my self (I hope effectually) from Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s undeserv'd and Groundless Aspersions: I have Considered all the Exceptions he has taken to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony I formerly gave, and have confirm'd every part of It, with further Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Proofs: which will (I perswade my self) to every Man that Stands <hi>Neuter</hi> in the Cause, and desires fairly to know the Truth, be satisfactory and Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>

                  <p>And now I have done with the Dr, who is much Mistaken however if he thinks, that this is all that will be said to him: For I am allowed to tell the Reader that his last Book will be throughly Consider'd, both as to the <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Criticisms</hi>; notwithstanding the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he has used, to escape an Answer, by making the Controversie so Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>

            <p>I have Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Allowance, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating this immediately to the World; as I have Dr <hi>King</hi>'s also for publishing the following Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To the Honourable <hi>Charles Boyle,</hi> Esq;</head>
                  <p>GIve me leave, Sir, to tell you a Secret, that I have spent an whole Day upon Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s late Volume of Scandal and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism; for every one mayn't judge it for his Credit to be so employed. He thinks meanly, I find, of my Reading; as meanly as I think
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95217:72"/>
of his Sense, his Modesty, or his Manners. And yet for all that, I dare say, I have Read more than any Man in <hi>England</hi> besides Him and Me; for I have Read his Book all over.</p>
                  <p>If you have look'd into it, Sir, you have found, that a Person under the pretence of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism, may take what Freedom he pleases with the Reputation and Credit of any Gentleman; and that He need not have any regard to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's Character, who has once resolv'd to expose his Own.</p>
                  <p>It was my misfortune once in my Life to be in the same Place with <hi>Dr</hi> Bentley, and a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a great deal of his Rude and Scurrilous Language: which he was so Liberal of, as to throw out at Randome in a <hi>Publick Shop;</hi> and is so silly now as to call it <hi>Eves-dropping</hi> in Me, because He was so Noisy, and I was so Near, that I could not help hearing it.</p>
                  <p>You desired me at some Years distance to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect what pass'd at that Meeting, and I obey'd your Commands. Shall I Reckon it an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that <hi>Dr Bentley,</hi> who disputes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Testimonies, falls in intirely with mine? I would, if I were not apprehensive, that on That very Account it might be one step further from being Credited.</p>
                  <p>However, such is his Spite to me, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Truth of all I told you. For the only particular I could call to Mind, he Grants, with some slight difference in the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95217:73"/>
And as to the general Account I gave of his Rudeness and Insolence, He denies it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but in so Rude and Insolent a Manner, that there is no Occasion for me to Justifie my self on that Head.</p>
                  <p>I had declared, it seems, that He said, The <hi>MS of</hi> Phalaris <hi>would be worth nothing, if it were Collated.</hi> He sets me right, and averrs, the Expression was, <hi>That after the Various Lections were once taken, and printed, the MS would be like a squeez'd Orange, and little worth for the future.</hi> The Similitude of a <hi>Squeez'd Orange</hi> is indeed a Considerable Circumstance, which I had forgot; as I doubtless did several others: But, for all that, I remember the general Drift and Manner of his Discourse, as well as if all the particular Expressions were present to me. Just as I know his last Book to be a Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, Vain, Confus'd, Vnmannerly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; though, to my Happiness, hardly any of His aukward Jests, or impertinent Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations stick by me.</p>
                  <p>I had own'd it to be my Opinion, that a <hi>MS was worth nothing</hi> unless <hi>it were Collated.</hi> The Dr Cunningly distinguishes upon me, and says, <hi>'Tis worth nothing indeed to the rest of the World, but it is better for the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if a Price were to be set upon it.</hi> I beg his Pardon for my mistake, I thought we were
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95217:73"/>
talking of Books in the way of <hi>Scholars,</hi> whereas He Answers me like a Bookseller; and as if He <hi>dealt in MSS,</hi> instead of <hi>Reading</hi> them. For my part, I measure the Value of these kind of Things, from the Advantage the Publick may receive from them, and not from the Profit they are likely to bring in to a private Owner. And therefore I have the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Alexandrian MS</hi> (which, He says, He <hi>keeps in his Lodgings</hi>) now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I should have had before the <hi>Editors</hi> of the English <hi>Polyglot</hi> published the Collation of it; though it may not perhaps bear up to the same Price in St <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-Yard,</hi> or an <hi>Auction.</hi> But I hope, if it be <hi>safely kept,</hi> it need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the Experiment.</p>
                  <p>As to the particular Reflections he has cast on me, 'tis no more than I expected. I could neither hope, nor wish for better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from one that had used You so ill. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable both to Men and Books to be ill spoken of by him; and a favourable Presumption on their side, that there is something in Both, which may chance to recommend them to the rest of the World. 'Tis in the Power of every little Creature, to throw Dirty Language; but a Man must have some Credit Himself in the World, before any thing he says can lessen the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of another. And if Dr <hi>Bentley</hi> must
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95217:74"/>
be Thus Qualify'd in order to mischief me, I am safe from all the Harm that His malice can do me. I am,</p>

            <p>I have still a Page or two to spare, and shall take this opportunity to acquaint the Reader with Dr <hi>Bentley</hi>'s handsome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in Relation to Sir <hi>W. Temple.</hi> In the first Edition of his <hi>Dissertation</hi> he had, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provok'd, treated Sir <hi>William</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Contempt; had said, <hi>He was not able to discover the True Time or True Value of his Authors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. vi.</note> and that <hi>His Criticisms were of a Peculiar Complexion and must proceed from a Singularity of Palate and Judgment.</hi> These, and several other as decent Expressions,<note place="margin">p. vii.</note> the Dr has dropt in his late Edition: For while his <hi>Dissertation,</hi> and the Defence of it were Printing, Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> was <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live</hi>: But he was <hi>dead,</hi> I suppose, by that time the Dr got to Page the xcth of his <hi>Preface</hi>; For there he falls upon Him for his <hi>absurd Vse of the Word</hi> DELPHOS, for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95217:74"/>
Pages together. And that the World may be sure to know at whom his Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are meant, he informs them, by a scornful Flirt, <hi>at Men of business and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</hi> This is honourable Dealing, and will doubtless recommend Him to His Reader, as a fair and Generous Adversary.</p>
            <p>I have that Respect for the Character and Memory of Sir <hi>William</hi> (whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands I once receiv'd to Print something for him) that I could not forbear stepping a little beyond my Line, to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Notice. Were he alive, I am sure, He would be very easie to hear of any new Instance of ill Usage, from One whom he thought so Ill of, as he did of Dr <hi>Bentley.</hi> I speak not this at a Venture, but from a Knowledge of what He has said in his Private Conversation, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: One of which, written to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Acquaintance, I have seen, and have his Leave to transcribe so much of it, as belongs any ways to this Debate.</p>
            <p>I beg Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Pardon, for publishing any Passages from thence, that relate to Him, or his Book, without his Express Knowledge. Some other People will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, if I am not so nice with them.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Think there can be no Exception to any thing in it; <hi>[Mr Boyle's Book]</hi> besides His Partiality to me; which perhaps will be less forgiven him by the Dr, than any other Fault. For the rest, the Compass and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so much Learning, the Strength and Pertinence of Arguments, the Candour of his Relations, in Return to such Foulmouth'd Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the pleasant Turns of Wit, and the Easiness of Style, are, in my Opinion, as extraordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the contrary of these all appear to be, in what the Dr and his Friend have written. So that I have as much reason to be pleased with finding my self in Mr <hi>Boyle</hi>'s good Opinion, as I should be sorry to be in Theirs.</p>
                  <p>You needed no Excuse for any thing in your former Letter, nor Mr — for giving you the Occasion for it.
