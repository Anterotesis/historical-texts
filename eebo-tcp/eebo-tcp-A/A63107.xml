            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot think there needs much Apology for an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of this Nature to your Lordship, although from a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Patronage of Poetry has always belong'd to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Virtuous: On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:93149:3"/>
therefore as well as others it is dangerous for any Person of Honour to be so early Eminent as your Lordship, because those Excellencies that create Envy in evil Minds are sure to meet the Applause of the Muses; which to some Tempers may be the greater Persecution. Such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters indeed are now so thin sown in Courts that they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily singled out. Your Lordship may think that Flattery which the World knows to be Truth;
<pb facs="tcp:93149:3"/>
I will not therefore pretend to draw your Lordships Character, or to speak more properly I need not. As far as Constancy of Temper, Loyalty, Justice, and Generosity in the most eninent degree can oblige a Nation: the Court and Age are indebted to your Lordship. It was this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and integrity of Soul that plac'd your Lordship above the example of Nature, and against the general Frenzie made you declare for oppressed innocence.
<pb facs="tcp:93149:4"/>
It is therefore no wonder that such endowments of mind have gain'd the Favour of the most Just and Pious Prince. I could descend to particular Instances of Honour and private Friendship; but I design no Panegyric, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ambitious to pay my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your Lordship by this small present, most humbly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by</p>

            <p>I <hi>have with some pains and trouble collected the following Poems: in which undertaking I have one pretence to your Favour, which is, that I have in the Volumn troubled you with very little of my Own. Amongst such various Hands and Arguments, it cannot be expected that they should all be equally perfect, neither if they were so, would they be so esteemed by Readers of different Palats. It is sufficient that we presume there are none unworthy perusal, and I am certain, none that can give offence to the chastest Ear.</hi>

               <l>All my ambition I would here confine,</l>
               <l>And only this Elezyum should be mine:</l>
               <l>Fond Men by Passion wilfully betray'd,</l>
               <l>Adore those Idols which their fancy made;</l>
               <l>Purchasing Riches, with our time and care,</l>
               <l>We lose our freedom in a gilded Snare;</l>

               <l>Opprest with Blessings which we fear to use.</l>

               <l>Whose modest Cloaths no wanton eyes invite,</l>

               <l>Whofree from Storms which on the great ones fall,</l>
               <l>Makes but few Wishes, and enjoys them all;</l>
               <l>No care but Love can discompose her breast,</l>

And whilst a Blush confesses how she burns,</l>
               <l>His faithful heart makes as sincere returns;</l>

                  <l>THE Muses, and the Muse inspired Crew,</l>
                  <l>This always, as their best-lov'd Theam, pursue</l>
                  <l>The Honour of immortal Gods to raise,</l>
                  <l>And crown the Actions of Good Men with Praise.</l>
                  <l>For Deities the Muses are, and use</l>
                  <l>(As such) to give to Deities their Dues.</l>
                  <l>We Poets are but Mortals, sing we then</l>
                  <l>The Deeds of god-like, tho but mortal men.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>None kindly yet our Graces entertain,</l>
                  <l>But send them unrewarded back again.</l>
                  <l>This made the Girls, when bare-foot they came home.</l>
                  <l>Chide me, for idly sending them to roam</l>
                  <l>On sleeveless Errands: wearied here to stay,</l>
                  <l>They sigh their melancholy Souls away.</l>

                  <l>For where's the generous Mortal now a-days</l>
                  <l>That loves to hear a Poet's well-tun'd Lays?</l>

                  <l>Love te be prais'd; none a good Deed will do.</l>
                  <l>They value not their Honours, as of old,</l>
                  <l>But are meer Slaves to Avarice and Gold.</l>
                  <l>Just or unjust, all Practices they try</l>
                  <l>For heaps of Treasure, but will rather dye</l>

               <l>TO sing of <hi>Mars</hi> and his Heroic Trains</l>
               <l>My Muse began, and in becoming strains,</l>
               <l>With equal pace the numbers took their way</l>
               <l>Slow, but Majestic, grave without delay.</l>

While <hi>Cupid</hi> at the fond endeavour smil'd,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Ceres</hi> for Woods forgo the fertile Field,</l>
               <l>Woods with <hi>Diana</hi> to the Fields may yield.</l>

                  <l>Oh my <hi>Philander</hi> ope your Brest,</l>
                  <l>I can no longer keep my heart,</l>
                  <l>Why do you call it from its nest</l>
                  <l>With such a soft resistless Art?</l>
                  <l>It sighs and looks it self away,</l>
                  <l>Dissolving with each word I speak;</l>
                  <l>Oh! take it, take it, if you stay</l>
                  <l>You will have nothing left to take.</l>
                  <l>There will be no injustice done,</l>
                  <l>Tho you have fir'd its native house,</l>
                  <l>If you will lodge it in your own,</l>
                  <l>Where it can only find repose.</l>
                  <l>And there i'll rest secure from harm,</l>
                  <l>Let angry Winds roar as they will,</l>
                  <l>That Tongue can ev'ry Tempest charm,</l>
                  <l>Those Eyes the blackest Cloud dispell.</l>

Then the bright Nymph, with all her blaze of Charms</l>
                  <l>Shot like a falling Star into his Arms;</l>
                  <l>He crush'd her killing Beauties to his Breast,</l>
                  <l>And all her sweets into his Bosom prest;</l>
                  <l>Her willing Soul out of her Lips he drew,</l>
                  <l>Which wing'd with Joy to her <hi>Philander</hi> flew;</l>
                  <l>And then an innocent Revenge he tries,</l>
                  <l>Attempts to kiss the fire, out of her Eyes;</l>
                  <l>And he devour'd a fierce unruly flame,</l>
                  <l>Which all her Charms let loose could scarcely tame.</l>
                  <l>'Tis well he had the liberty at least</l>
                  <l>The living Nectar of her Lips to tast;</l>
                  <l>To quaff her breath, and drink her flowing heart,</l>
                  <l>Which broke the Banks, and gush'd from ev'ry part;</l>
                  <l>And this was all he wish'd, his Heav'nly fire</l>
                  <l>Was purg'd from ev'ry loose unchast desire,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Eirenes</hi> eyes had purify'd the Air;</l>

                     <hi>Eirene</hi> could the dross and dregs remove,</l>
                  <l>Extracting the pure spirit of his Love;</l>
                  <l>And that was all divine, and would not mix</l>
                  <l>With the gross inclinations of his Sex.</l>
                  <l>Thus Angel like the Youth and Virgin lov'd,</l>
                  <l>And pleasure to the highest pitch improv'd;</l>
                  <l>The circling Year roul'd in its usual round,</l>
                  <l>And still their Eyes fix'd on each other found;</l>
                  <l>The circling Year did various seasons bring,</l>
                  <l>But their young Love was always in the Spring,</l>
                  <l>It never alter'd but from bliss to bliss,</l>
                  <l>No angry Sky blasted their happiness;</l>
                  <l>For whilst <hi>Eirene</hi> smil'd his Heav'n was clear,</l>
                  <l>And she would always smile when he was near.</l>

               <l>With thee alone I had much rather fall,</l>

               <l>Ready to execute their dire Command,</l>
               <l>By Heav'ns a vengeance I with ease might die,</l>

Here <hi>Hector</hi> finds her with a Lovers Pace,</l>
                  <l>She flies, and breathless, sinks in his Embrace:</l>
                  <l>The Nurse came after, with her Princely care,</l>
                  <l>As <hi>Hesperus</hi> fresh: promising, and fair,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Hector</hi> in little, with paternal Joy</l>
                  <l>He blest in silent Smiles the lovely Boy.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Andromache</hi> come to her self again,</l>
                  <l>Pressing his hand, did gently thus complain:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>My dearest Lord, believe a careful Wife,</l>
                  <l>You are too lavish of your precious Life:</l>
                  <l>You formost into every danger run,</l>
                  <l>Of me regardless, and your little Son.</l>
                  <l>Shortly the <hi>Greeks,</hi> what none can singly do,</l>
                  <l>Will compass, pointing all the War at you.</l>
                  <l>But before that day comes (Heavens) may I have</l>
                  <l>The mournful Priviledge of an early Grave:</l>
                  <l>For I, of your dear Company bereft,</l>
                  <l>Have no Reserve, no second Comfort left.</l>
                  <l>My Father, who did in <hi>Cilicia</hi> reign,</l>
                  <l>By fierce <hi>Achilles</hi> was in Battel slain:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:93149:174"/>
But yet his Arms that Conqu'rour not spoil,</l>
                  <l>But paid just Honour to his Funeral Pile:</l>
                  <l>Wood-Nymphs in rows of Elms have planted since</l>
                  <l>A poor memorial of a powerful Prince:</l>
                  <l>Seven Brothers who seven Legions did command,</l>
                  <l>Follow'd their Father's Fortune by his hand.</l>
                  <l>My Mother too, who after them did reign,</l>
                  <l>With a vast Treasure was redeem'd in vain;</l>
                  <l>For she soon clos'd her Empire, and her Breath,</l>
                  <l>By Wretches last good Fortune—sudden death.</l>
                  <l>Thus Father, Mother, Brothers, all are gone,</l>
                  <l>But they seem all reviv'd in you alone.</l>
                  <l>To gain you, those Endearments I have sold,</l>
                  <l>And like the Purchase if the Title hold.</l>
                  <l>Have pity then, here in this Tower abide,</l>
                  <l>And round the Walls and Works your Troops di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.</l>
                  <l>Just now the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by both their Generals led,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ajax, Idomeneus, Diomede,</hi>

Some God their Courage to this pitch did raise,</l>

                  <l>I have revolv'd in serious Thoughts before.</l>
                  <l>But not my Foes upon that Plain I fear</l>
                  <l>So much as Female Men and Women here;</l>
                  <l>For they, if I should once decline the Fight,</l>

                  <l>Others may methods chuse the most secure,</l>
                  <l>My Life no middle Courses can endure.</l>
                  <l>Urg'd by my own and my great Father's Name,</l>
                  <l>I must add something to our ancient Fame;</l>
                  <l>And in <hi>Troys</hi> Cause engag'd, I cannot fly,</l>
                  <l>With it will conquer, or must for it dye:</l>
                  <l>But yet some boding Genius does portend</l>
                  <l>To all my Pains an unsuccessful end, tend?</l>
                  <l>For how can man with heavenly Powers con-</l>

                  <l>And these proud Towers lay level with the ground:</l>

But all compar'd with you does scarce appear</l>

                  <l>And as you measure out the tedious way,</l>

                  <l>See to what Fortune <hi>Hector</hi>'s WiFe is brought,</l>
                  <l>The famous General that for <hi>Ilium</hi> fought:</l>
                  <l>This will renew your sorrows without end,</l>
                  <l>Depriv'd in such a day of such a Friend.</l>
                  <l>But this is Fancy, or before it I</l>
                  <l>Low in the Dust will with my Country lye.</l>
                  <l>Then to his Infant he his Arms addrest,</l>
                  <l>The Child clung crying to his Nurses Breast,</l>
                  <l>Scar'd at the burnish'd Arms and threatning Crest.</l>
                  <l>This made them smile, whilst <hi>Hector</hi> doth unbrace</l>

                  <l>Nor was she long behind, but running o're</l>
                  <l>Each Note of his, yes, and a thousand more,</l>
                  <l>Gave him a taste of what she could, to shew</l>
                  <l>That even she could chirp a Prelude too.</l>
                  <l>With that he took his Lute, and with a dash,</l>
                  <l>'Twixt sport and scorn, he makes a careless Rash,</l>
                  <l>Stops every Fret, and to each trembling string</l>
                  <l>Gives a soft Beat; when presently again,</l>
                  <l>With a sweet touch he strikes an even strain,</l>
                  <l>And takes up all with his first Rash again.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And here he paws'd, and now expects her part,</l>
                  <l>Which she strait gives, and answers Art with Art.</l>
                  <l>One while, as if she could not find her Throat,</l>
                  <l>She plays it here and there with her field-note,</l>
                  <l>And draws it out in length, to let him see</l>
                  <l>Her discords too carry'd their Harmony.</l>
                  <l>Then quavering out Division, with shrill</l>
                  <l>And open Throat, gives every Note its Trill.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He stood amaz'd (and well he might) to meet</l>
                  <l>So small a Pipe, and yet a Note so sweet,</l>
                  <l>So soft, so various, that he concludes, to get</l>
                  <l>The Victory, he must run higher yet:</l>

And with it, chang'd his Cliffs; now sharp, then flat,</l>
                  <l>Now Bass, then Treble; nor content with that,</l>
                  <l>Jumbles his strings in such disorder'd Rattle,</l>
                  <l>As if his Lute were to enform a Battel.</l>

                  <l>Anger &amp; Shame by this time stirr'd his blood;</l>
                  <l>Nor shall my little Quirister o'th' Wood</l>
                  <l>Carry it thus: Not conquer her? I'll do't,</l>
                  <l>I'll do't he cry'd, or I will break my Lute:</l>
                  <l>Nor said he more, when thundering amain</l>
                  <l>A sprightly, bold, unimitable strain,</l>
                  <l>His careless hand from this to that he flings,</l>
                  <l>And runs it up, as he would crack the strings:</l>
                  <l>From Bass to Tenor, Counter-tenor, Alt,</l>

                  <l>Expecting what his little Rival cou'd:</l>
