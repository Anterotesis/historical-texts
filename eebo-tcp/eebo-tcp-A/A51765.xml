         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

leave Publiſh by command from the ſaid Duke and in
his name, what-ever we can with truth alledge, either as
to the matter of Fact or Law, in behalf of the moſt Serene
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> ſubmitting it to the juſt Cenſure of the
whole World: And we are perſwaded that theſe our
endeavours can offend no perſon, who loving true Piety
follows the precepts of Chriſtianity, which allows of
no War to be lawful, but when it is juſt and neceſſary,

or elſewhere) together with other great Men, lovers of
Juſtice, may not be tyred with a prolix diſcourſe; We ſhall
propoſe thed ſtate of the caſe in a few words, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Accuſations wherewith the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> is
charged, which we do not queſtion but to anſwer ſo
fully, that all unprejudic'd perſons may clearly judge
of the matter of Fact, upon which the ſaid Accuſations
are for the moſt part grounded. Theſe Aſperſions being
wip'd off, we ſhall add the Laws and Conſtitutions, in
vertue whereof the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> ought, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Treaty to which he was forced at <hi>Rendsburg,</hi>
to be entirely reſtored.</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt to all that know any thing of our affairs,
that the moſt Serene Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> poſſeſſing ſeveral
Provinces bordering upon <hi>Denmark,</hi> which they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
governed jointly with the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant
to a Treaty between them, That King has no
reaſon to fear any thing from the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> if he
will but ſuffer it to enjoy it's own Rights quietly;
VVhereas on the contrary the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> lyes
expoſed to the Invaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> whenever they
ſhall have a mind to lay hold of any fair opportunity, and
abuſe their Power contrary to Juſtice and the Publick
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61869:3"/>
Faith. For although heretofore the Earls of <hi>Holſtein</hi> have
had grievous Wars with the Kings of <hi>Denmark;</hi> yet
the ſtate of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and the neighbouring Provinces,
being much altered from what it was, the <hi>Danes</hi> can
have no reaſon to ſuſpect the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and
much leſs fear any harm from it, except what they
may bring upon themſelves, by provoking it by frequent
Injuries and Aſſaults to it's own Defence.</p>
                  <p>Since the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi> is come to the Family
of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and that theſe Provinces have been more
than once divided between theſe Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and
the Dukes of <hi>Sleswick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> the Power of the
ſaid Kings has been much encreaſed by the ſaid Diviſions,
and by their Succeſſions to the Crown of <hi>Norway;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it will appear that the Royalties of the Houſe of
<hi>Gottorp</hi> have not been therefore in the leaſt diminiſhed.
The Dukedomes of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein</hi> have been
both ſo divided, and the firſt held at leaſt for many
years from the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as the other
alwayes from the Empire. The whole Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick</hi> is a part of <hi>Juitland</hi> reaching from the borders
of <hi>Holſtein</hi> to the Bridge of <hi>Coldingen;</hi> one part of
it being poſſeſſed by the Houſe of <hi>Holſtein-Gottorp,</hi>
and the other by the Kings of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as Dukes
of <hi>Sleſwick.</hi> Amongſt the ſeveral Conditions from
time to time agreed upon, the following have been
more than once confirmed, <hi>viz. That the King of</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<hi>ſhould not engage in any War unleſs for his own defence,
or the maintenance of his Dignity, and then not till after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
communicated the ſame to the ſaid Dukes; and that if
thereupon a War ſhould be agreed upon, that then the Dukes
of</hi> Sleſwick <hi>(of whom the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>is one) ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61869:4"/>
ſend to the ſaid Kings aſſiſtance, a certain number of Horſe
and Foot, maintaining them at their own expences, the King
contributing proportionably for his part of the Dukedome, and
promiſing to defend both their Vaſſals.</hi> Chytr. lib. 24. Sat.
p. 719. And we find that upon the ſaid Kings not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
this Agreement, but making War of their own
heads, the Dukes of <hi>Gottorp</hi> have not been obliged to ſend
the aſſiſtance ſtipulated, though it has been demanded
from them.</p>
                  <p>There have been almoſt perpetual VVars between the
<hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> which in former Ages have had dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
ſucceſſes, but in this laſt Age been more favourable
to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> eſpecially ſince the ſucceſs of their Arms
in <hi>Germany.</hi> Hence it is come to paſs, that the <hi>Danes,</hi>
exaſperated by the remembrance of the Loſſes they had
ſuſtained by their Provinces and Places which they had
loſt, in hopes of better ſucceſs, and by the Inſtigation of
evil Counſellors, pouring oyle upon the Fire, have taken
all opportunities of making VVar againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
without acquainting the Dukes of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> much leſs
conſulting with them about it; but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that
they have been ſtill puniſht with greater Loſſes, having
likewiſe thereby involved the Provinces and Subjects of
the ſaid Duke in all the calamities attending a VVar;
by which, though the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> hath ſuffered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Damages and Violations in its Rights, yet were
they never extinguiſhed, nor lest to the ſole pleaſure and
determination of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> as Supreme
Prince.</p>
                  <p>But not to take the matter too high, and to come
nearer to our Subject, let the beginning and end of the late
VVar between the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> be diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61869:4"/>
for from thence ſprings all the miſchief. <hi>Carolus
Guſtavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> making VVar againſt <hi>Poland,</hi>
and having raiſed up many powerful Enemies, who ſeemed
to have reduced his Army to great ſtreights; <hi>Frederick</hi>
the III. King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> of happy Memory, taking
that opportunity, declared VVar againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
making great preparations both of Men and Arms, as
thinking he ſhould never have a more favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to recover his Loſſes, and humble the <hi>Swedes.</hi> And
the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being by Marriage with the Daughter
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Gottorpe</hi> of happy Memory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
nearly allied to that Houſe; the ſaid Duke <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
obtained a Promiſe from his Son-in-Law, that he
would hearken to a Peace, which he undertook to
mediate with the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Duke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wrote ſeveral Letters with his own hand to the King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to perſwade him to Peace, and not only
profer'd his own aſſiſtance to conclude it, but earneſtly
recommended the promoting of it to the Ambaſſador of the
moſt Chriſtian King. Yet ſo far was the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
from taking this Office in good part, that he never
thought fit to give the Duke any Anſwer herein. But the
event of this unneceſſary War was, that the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
inſtead of reaſonable conditions of Peace which
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> might have obtained for him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpent his Forces, was obliged at laſt to admit of ſuch as
a Conqueror would impoſe upon him. And whilſt this
Treaty was a concluding (by which <hi>Schonen</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Provinces were yielded up to the <hi>Swedes)</hi> the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> thought himſelf obliged to take care of
the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> which having ſuſtained great
damages in this War, he thought ought likewiſe to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61869:5"/>
receive all juſt Satisfaction. Amongſt other things it
was agreed, that the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> ſhould hold and
enjoy the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> hereafter, not as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
from the Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but independently
and abſolutely, without ſubjection to any other Power.
To this the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſeemed at firſt very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to conſent; but when the States of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
offered him the ſame Right over that part of the
Dutchy of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> which was his, and thereby gave him
occaſion to aſpire to the Monarchy of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he approved thereof both for himſelf and the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not long after the King having compaſſed his deſign,
and obtained the Monarchy of the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
from that time governed all things by his ſole will and

Thus the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commonwealth being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all things having put on a new Face, the King
endeavoured all he could, ſo to order the affairs of the
Kingdom, as might beſt eſtabliſh his Authority, enable
him to repulſe his Enemies, and recover his Loſſes. And
nothing ſeeming more to oppoſe his deſigns then the
Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> eminent in Riches,
abounding with Valiant men, and unaccuſtomed to ſuch
kind of Dominion, which would adhere to the Duke of
<hi>Gottorp,</hi> who had Souldiers and a well-fortified Town
there, and that probably <hi>Holſtein</hi> might demand help
from the Emperor and Empire; the <hi>Danes</hi> begun to have
an ill Eye upon the Duke and his Fort of <hi>Tuningen,</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
his League with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and Journey to that
King; which they endeavoured many ways to traduce,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61869:5"/>

to put them in practiſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Deſigns of <hi>Denmark</hi> being now grown ſo ripe,
that nothing but an opportunity ſeemed wanting, it
quickly offered it ſelf. For the King of <hi>France</hi> having
made War upon the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Netherlands,</hi> and they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eaſed themſelves of the burthen thereof upon <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> joyned himſelf, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with others, with the Confederates, in oppoſition
to the moſt Chriſtian King, and afterwards concluded a
Peace with him by the Mediation of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>
upon moſt advantageous Terms, who having interpoſed
his Guarantee to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Elector ſoon
after taking up Arms contrary thereunto, the Emperor Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and others, fearing leſt the <hi>Swedes</hi>
ſhould make good their Guarantee by force of Armes,
drew the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to their ſide for a diverſion
to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> No ſooner had the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> got
this opportunity, but he Muſter'd his Army in <hi>Juitland,</hi>
and preſently after put them into Quarters; yet ſo as the
Enemies of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> at the Court, had an opportunity
ſtill to perſwade that King to a War againſt them;
which the <hi>Swedes</hi> endeavoured to divert, by ſending a
ſplendid Embaſſy to <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> but without ſucceſs,
being able to obtain only a ſhort delay of that Expedition.</p>
                  <p>In this conjuncture of Affairs, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
had fully reſolved upon a War againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> but
ſuſpecting that the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> to which he had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61869:6"/>
ſhewed ſo much ill-will, would not neglect their own
Defence, whereby his Deſigns might miſcarry; He
thought in the firſt place, by depriving it of all its Riches,
Arms, Forts, and Force, to ruin it wholly; and in order
thereunto, the King made ſeveral exorbitant Demands, and
moveing frequently with his Army, ſeemed to Threaten
open Violence; afterwards in the Aſſembly of the States of
the Province, he challenged to himſelf the major part of the
Revenues, which had always been equally divided between
him and the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> leaving a very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Duke: But his Highneſs having ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his Ambaſſadors to the Kings Commiſſioners,
that he would oppoſe this Demand, as contrary to the
Antient Cuſtoms, the Aſſembly was diſſolved without
doing any thing, and Adjourned to another time, theſe
Controverſies encreaſing daily more and more.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt remarkable was that about the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the County of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt,</hi> which
being long debated, was at laſt left to the Imperial Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
for a final deciſion, the moſt Serene Dukes of
<hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> being Plaintiff againſt the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
and Dukes of <hi>Gottorp:</hi> whilſt theſe two laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
joyntly the Dukes of <hi>Ploen,</hi> according as they had
agreed between them, the buſineſs remained undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> going another way
to work, found means to tranſact with the King ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo that obſtacle being removed, ſentence was given
in the Emperours Court againſt the Duke of <hi>Gottorp.</hi>
This Tranſaction was carried ſo ſecretly, that the Duke
of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has not yet been able to learn the particulars
and conditions of the Agreement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61869:6"/>
The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in the mean time challenging
to himſelf the whole Power in theſe Countries againſt all
Right, and excluding the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> from all ſhare,
not only there, but alſo in the Diſtrict of <hi>Stad-budjad,</hi> a
Fief of the Houſe of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when this Cauſe was under debate in the Imperial
Court, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> himſelf by Letters to the
Duke of <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> deſired him, amongſt other things,
to intercede with the Emperour, that the ſaid Diſtrict
<hi>Stad-budjad,</hi> no ways belonging to thoſe Provinces,
might not be involved in that Controverſie. The Duke
obtained his deſires from the Emperour, and therefore,
when the Sentence given by his Imperial Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe Countries came to be put in Execution,
The Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick, Lunenbourg,</hi> exempted again
the ſaid Diſtrict from the Execution, and in expreſs terms
reſerved to the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> their Rights in it.
Notwithſtanding all this, the King commanded Homage
to be paid to him alone by all the Subjects of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict,
not only excluding the Duke, but uſing his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador

to diſpoſſeſs the Duke of both.</p>
                  <p>While theſe Differences encreaſed more and more,
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in order to the carrying on his
deſignes againſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> the
more ſecretly and ſuccesfully, cauſed the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61869:7"/>
And at the ſame time the Chancellor of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
wrote very civilly to the Reſident of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> then at
<hi>Hambourgh,</hi> telling him he would meet him half way,
to endeavour a fair compoſition of all the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the King and the Duke, which, he ſaid, he deſired
above all things, and doubted not but a few hours would
put an end to what had been kept on foot ſo many years,
if he would be pleaſed to meet him accordingly. The
King himſelf afterwards declared his mind to the ſame
purpoſe to the Preſident more than once, and laſt of all
by the Earl of <hi>Oldenbourgh,</hi> who told the Preſident, that
the King deſired nothing more then to have his Preſence
and aſſiſtance to accommodate theſe difficulties in ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
a juncture, by which compliance of his, he would
oblige his Majeſty, who was inclined to hearken to an
accommodation. After this the Earl was ſent by the
King to the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> to aſſure him of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and let him know the neceſſity of the Preſident's
going to his Majeſty, and after a ſhort ſtay went to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
with Letters from the Duke to the Preſident, for
whoſe further ſecurity to come to the King at <hi>Rensbourgh,</hi>
his Majeſty ſent him a Paſſeport, and one of his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> going to <hi>Holſtein,</hi> to
put his deſigns in Execution, acquainted the Duke of
<hi>Gottorp</hi> with his Journey, deſiring him not to be troubled
at it, as having no other intention therin but to compoſe
all things to both their ſatisfactions. The Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi>
truſting to ſeveral Letters full of the like aſſurances, when
the King was on his way with all his Army to <hi>Holſtein,</hi>
ſent one of his Gentlemen to <hi>Hadersleby,</hi> to complement
him, and went himſelf ſoon after with his Brother the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61869:7"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Lubeck</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Aldenburgh,</hi> then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from <hi>Hambourgh</hi> to meet his Majeſty, waiting upon
him at <hi>Hensbourgh,</hi> after which the King being to go
through <hi>Dennewerk,</hi> and his Highneſs having entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him there with all imaginable reſpect and ſplendour,
the King deſired him to come and ſee him at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi>
where he was to ſtay for ſometime, and for a larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of kindneſs, both his Majeſty and his Chancellor
drunk ſeveral times to the good ſucceſs of the approaching
Conſultation.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Adolphus Kielmannus</hi> chief Miniſter to the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> notwithſtanding his Sickneſs and the
diſſuaſions of his Friends, went directly from <hi>Hambourgh</hi> to
<hi>Rensbourgh,</hi> where having confer'd with the Chancellor
of <hi>Denmark</hi> above eight hours about the principal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in debate, he offer'd the Government of <hi>Tunderen</hi> for
the County of <hi>Oldenbourgh</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt,</hi> and having
removed all other Impediments he could think upon, and
taking the buſineſs to be near its concluſion, and to want
nothing but the ratification and ſubſcription of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
he went to <hi>Gottorp</hi> to let his Maſter know, how far
they had proceeded, and with what ſucceſs. The Prince
himſelf, that nothing might be wanting on his part for
compoſing the remaining Differences, deputed <hi>Adolphus
Buchwaldius</hi> Governour of <hi>Sleſwick, Frederick Kielman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the Preſident, and <hi>Andrew Cramer</hi> one of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
of State, with a ſpecial Commiſſion to go to <hi>Rends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,
June</hi> 22. 1675. being Arrived there, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
the next day with the Earl of <hi>Rantzo,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Wibius,</hi> and <hi>Gloxinius</hi> his Majeſties Counſellors of State;
and they being the ſame that had aſſiſted at the Aſſembly
of the States at <hi>Kilon,</hi> on the part of the King, without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61869:8"/>
effecting any thing, renewed the matter of the Taxes,
ſaying, That the King perſiſted ſtill in his demand of the
greater part of them for the maintenance of his Army,
which granted, his Majeſty would bind himſelf by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi>
Letters, as they call them, (a thing not ſo much
as mentioned in the Aſſembly of the States) never to
make this a Preſident for the future. But the newneſs
of that being a prejudice great enough, the Duke of
<hi>Gottorp</hi> thought it not ſecure to recede from the Antient
Cuſtoms; yet to gratify the King, he made this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
That the greater Taxes ſhould be paid, but to be
equally divided and employed by each Prince, in raiſing
and maintaining Souldiers for the defence of the ſaid
Dukedomes; and that the States might the eaſier conſent
thereunto, he deſired the whole buſineſs might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them, it being moſt agreeable to Antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and former Treaties, eſpecially that of the Union,
to conſult the States about raiſing of an Army, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and quartering it, and then proceed according to their
reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>While they were thus debating concerning Taxes, and
other things, the Chancellor of <hi>Denmark</hi> wrote from
<hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> to the Preſident <hi>Kielmannus,</hi> acquainting
him that the King being ready for a Treaty, it would be
advantageous to both Princes, if the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi>
would pleaſe to come to the King at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and by
his Preſence promote an Amicable compoſure of all theſe
matters. The Duke remembring his Majeſty had deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the ſame thing of him at <hi>Dennewerk,</hi> to ſhew at once
his duty to the King, and his inclinations to Peace, ſent
one of his Gentlemen upon St. <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> day to his
Majeſty, to acquaint him, that his Maſter was ready to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61869:8"/>
wait upon him, if he would give him leave. The King
commending this Reſolution of the Prince, ſaid twice,
he hoped the Preſident <hi>Kielmannus</hi> would come along
too. Accordingly next day, the Duke being perſwaded
that all was ſincerely and honeſtly intended, begun that
unhappy Journy with the Preſident and ſome others, and
being near <hi>Rendsburgh,</hi> was received with the ſhooting
of ſeveral Guns. But hearing there from ſome of his,
what had been ſaid in the Kings Name about the Taxes,
his Highneſs deſired it might be regulated according to
former Treaties and Antient Cuſtomes; and as to other
things, he declared himſelf as above, proteſting he would
always obey the King, and wholly employ theſe Taxes in
a War for the defence of his Country.</p>
                  <p>At laſt comes that fatal and unfortunate day, the 26. of
<hi>June,</hi> in which all the deſigns that had been ſo long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatching
againſt the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> to its Ruin, were
to be put in Execution, and that hidden Fire to break
out into open Flames. It was haſtened by ſome Letters,
that came that very day from the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi>
and brought the News of the defeat of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the
Province of <hi>La Mark:</hi> Aſſoon as they were read, all things
ſeemed to favour the Kings deſigns, and conſpire to the
Ruin of the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi> glad and proud
of this good <hi>Omen,</hi> thought it not ſit to delay or diſſemble
it any longer, but called a Council of VVar, ſhut the
Gates, drew up their Draw-bridges, ſent their Forces to
<hi>Sleſwick, Tonninghen,</hi> and up and down; ſhut up the
Harbour with a Boom, diſarmed and ſecured the Dukes
Troop of Guards, and permitted none to ſti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, unleſs they
could ſhow the Kings leave under his own Hand. The
Duke himſelf, inſtead of being Invited to Dine with the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61869:9"/>
King, as formerly, had his Dinner brought him apart in
his drawing Room, and Guards ſet to watch him; his
Chamber-doors being bolted every Night: None of the
King Miniſters being ſuffered to come near him for ſome
days, except the Sieur <hi>Winterfield,</hi> High-Marſhal of the
Court, to whom the Duke, having called him to him,
ſaid, That he was a Prince of the Empire, there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
Treated, contrary to his expectation, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly;
nay, contrary to the greateſt Proteſtations and
aſſurances of Friendſhip, and Publick Faith, deſiring
him to acquaint the King therewith, that his Majeſty
might permit him to depart. But alas, all was in vain,
it being reſolved, that the Blow ſhould be followed, this
Detention being but a Prologue to more miſchief.</p>
                  <p>For the Duke and his Miniſters being now in their
Power, and a fair opportunity preſenting it ſelf to invade
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> weakned by their loſs at <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>berlin,</hi> the
Kings Deputies having ſent for <hi>Buchwaldius, Frederick
Chriſtian Kielman,</hi> and <hi>Cramer,</hi> to Court, told them,
that the Caſe being alter'd, they were no more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about giving the greateſt part of the Taxes to the
King, who would now challenge the whole alone, and
quarter his Army up and down in the Dukes Territories
to preſerve them from the Enemy, and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<hi>Requiſitorial</hi> Letters might be obeyed, which they
would therefore now exhibite to them, ſhewing alſo by
this their ill-will and premeditated Deſigns againſt the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp.</hi> Moreover they added, that the King
had for a long time been jealous of the Dukes deſigns
and inclinations, and being to carry his Army out of the
Country, he thought he ought to take care to leave no
Enemies behind him, wherein he could not ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61869:9"/>
but by ſeizing upon the Caſtle of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> the ſtrong
Town of <hi>Tonningen,</hi> and all the Dukes Forces, till the
change of Affairs might ſecure him otherwiſe. That it
was not ſit for the Kings Majeſty to exchange the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Oldenbourgh</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt,</hi> for that of <hi>Tunderen.</hi>
That theſe and other things could not be done in haſte,
but required more time than the King could now ſpare,
fearing leſt ſome third Party might in the mean while
ſeize thoſe Provinces. That the King therefore would
put Garriſons into all the Fortified places of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and provide all other things neceſſary for its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
proteſting withal, that if any loſs ſhould happen
by the Dukes delay, the Reparation of it would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
from the Author thereof; but if the Duke would
accept of one hundred and fifty thouſand <hi>Dollars</hi> offered
him at <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> to renounce his Right to them, they
ſtill hoped his Majeſty might be prevailed upon at the
Dukes requeſt to pay that mony.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> having propoſed theſe ſevere conditions,
and the Dukes Commiſſioners having been to conſult
their Maſter, returned this Anſwer, That as to the
Taxes, the Duke, without prejudice to his Right, was
forced to yield to the preſent juncture of time in that
Matter. That the <hi>Requiſitorial</hi> Letters of the Emperor
concerned onely the Dukedom of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> not that of
<hi>Sleſwick;</hi> and they being according to the Conſtitutions
of the Empire, and the Pragmatick Sanction, could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
nothing of him but a ſafe Paſſage, which his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
would never deny, when ever the King ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it. That the Caſtle of <hi>Gottorp</hi> was neither by Art nor
Scituation ſo ſtrong as to be formidable, and therefore
the King might well permit the Duke to ſecure the place
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61869:10"/>
of his Reſidence and Habitation, with ſome Souldiers;
and for an evident proof of his reſpect, the Duke was
contented his Majeſty ſhould have as ſtrong a Garriſon in
<hi>Tonningen</hi> as he himſelf, provided both ſhould take the
Oath of Fidelity to each Prince; and that the King
would oblige himſelf, that upon the change of Affairs,
all things ſhould be reſtored again as they were. That
if the King would diſpoſe ſolely of all things in theſe
Countries at his Pleaſure, the Duke muſt yield to it,
but hoped his Right ſhould be ſaved entire: That he had
never committed nor omitted any thing that might entitle
the King to demand reparation of him; and for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
of an Exchange, they were neither ſuch as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a neceſſity upon his Majeſties will, nor derogated from
it. That he would leave the Tranſactions of <hi>Copenhaguen</hi>
till they were ſet on Foot again. And laſtly, That he
earneſtly begged, that the King would no longer delay to
grant him and his, Liberty to go where they would.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This moſt reaſonable Anſwer of the Duke proved of
no effect, the</hi> Danes <hi>being reſolved to paſs to the greateſt
Extremities: For the Kings Deputies ſignified again in
Writing,</hi> That their Maſter perſiſted firm in his firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
hoping to provoke the Duke to diſcover his mind in the
ſame manner. <hi>But he replyed only as before, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again,</hi> That the King would not urge ſo much the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of his Caſtles and Forts, but conſent to ſome eaſier
Terms than theſe; which the <hi>Danes</hi> ſaid were only <hi>Baga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But that King and his Miniſter were ſo far from remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing of the Rigour of their Demands, that they
added Rebukes and Threats;</hi> For, <hi>ſaid they,</hi> the Dukes
abſolute Power over <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> being extorted from the King
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61869:10"/>
by force of Arms, the Duke had thereby loſt the Fief of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and his being in a League with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> an Enemy
to the Empire, might probably cauſe him to be diſpoſſeſt of the
Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and the King to be inveſted therein.
Moreover, that the King was fully reſolved, That neither
the Duke, nor any of his Miniſters, ſhould be ſet at Liberty,
uniil he had ſeized all the Dukes ſtrong-holds, and that he
would even confine his Highn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs apart from all his Miniſters and
Servants, and proceed to the Execution hereof by force of
Arms. <hi>For as we have before mentioned, they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Body of Horſe and Foot in</hi> Sleſwick, <hi>which block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up the Caſtle of</hi> Gottorp, <hi>where the Reverend Biſhop
of</hi> Lubeck, <hi>Brother to the moſt Serene Duke, then was,
and had alſo inveſted</hi> Tonningen <hi>and</hi> Holme: <hi>and that
nothing might retard the Surrender of</hi> Tonningen, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was drawn by the Kings command for the Duke to
Sign, and ſend to the Perſon that commanded for him
there.</p>
                  <p>The Duke ſeeing himſelf betrayed, and without any
help, deprived of his Liberty, and fallen into a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
diſtemper, fearing greater Evils might be intended
againſt him and his Miniſters, (which was not obſcurely
given him to underſtand) ſuffered at length the Surrender
of all his Forts and Forces to be extorted from him: and
though he only deſired from the King that the Caſtle of
<hi>Gottorp,</hi> the place of his Reſidence, might be free from a
Garriſon, he could not obtain it, nor ſo much as that the
King would annex to that fatal Surrender, a Promiſe to
ſecure him by <hi>Reverſal</hi> Letters of the Reſtitution of his
Forts, and what belonged to them. But though this
was promiſed by the Chancellor of the Kingdom, in the

it; yet his Majeſty refuſed to oblige himſelf to it
in Writing, the Chancellor anſwering again for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that a Kings promiſe by word of Mouth was more
to be valued than any other Security. And when the
Caſtle of <hi>Tonningen,</hi> with all his Magazins and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was ſhortly after delivered up to <hi>Charles Arenſtorf</hi>
for the King, he added theſe words to the foot of the
Inventory, which was ſigned by him, That all things
ſhould be reſtored fully and faithfully according to the
Kings Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> being Maſters of the Caſtles of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and
all the other Forts, the Duke was carried to <hi>Gottorp</hi> on
the 6. of <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

had not only ſeized the Paſſages, Gates, and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that place, but ordered a Company to watch
night and day near his Highneſſes Chamber, to let him
know that he was ſtill their Priſoner. The Prince being
thus in their Power, the Princeſs his Wife, whom he had
not been able by all his kind Letters to get out of <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haguen,</hi>
where her Mother had invited her before all theſe
Troubles, and kept her, was at laſt reſtored to him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for fear, leſt ſhe might prevail upon the King her
Brothers mind, and avert thoſe great Violences deſigned
againſt her Husband and Children.</p>
                  <p>VVho would not have thought the King fully ſatisfied
with this? but it proved otherwiſe; For the Earl of <hi>Alefield</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61869:11"/>
done, and they returned to <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> did according to
their Inſtructions declare his Highneſſes mind upon every
Head, delivering alſo his Letters to the King and the
Chancellor, and intreating them to have ſome regard at
leaſt to Juſtice and Equity. But all was in vain; for the
Chancellor and the Governor having ſent for the Dukes
Deputies, and read to them theſe Eight Articles of their
own Penning, demanded with great Threats, that the
Duke ſhould ſign them without any Alteration or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
adding, that if the Duke refuſed to obey the
Kings will, both Dukedomes and all belonging to them,
being now in the hands of his Majeſty, he could eaſily
force a diſarmed and forſaken Prince to do what his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
had a mind to, and then it would be too late to
Repent. The Duke ſenſible of this new Violence, and
of his being kept a Priſoner by the <hi>Danes,</hi> in his own
Caſtle and Houſe, yielded at laſt to Force, and with great
reluctancy ſubſcribed to theſe ſevere conditions, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in vain to hope for any more reaſonable, and with
his Brother, the Biſhop of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> renounced their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and Independent Right over the Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> which was extorted from them by meer Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the Duke being impatient to be kept always a
Priſoner in his own Houſe, and to be forced every day
to conſent to what the <hi>Danes</hi> would exact, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that the City of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> though unfortified, was
yet full of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Souldiers, begun to be more jealous of
the deſigns of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſeared either yet a cloſer
Impriſonment, or to be conveyed God knows where.
The moſt Serene Queen Dowager of <hi>Denmark</hi> was now
come to <hi>Auguſtberg,</hi> and had ſent for her Daughter the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61869:12"/>
Dukes Wife, who had acquainted the Duke her Husband
with her intended Journey, in obedience to her Mother,
praying him to accompany her: But the Duke remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that when the King went to <hi>Holſtein</hi> juſt before
theſe troubles, the Dutcheſs his Wife had been ſent for to
<hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> upon which all theſe miſchiefs had befallen
the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> apprehended new Evils to him and
his, from this ſecond Journey, and thought of his eſcape.
Therefore to lay hold on the occaſion, his Highneſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſome Horſes to be made ready, took a few of his
Servants with him, commanded that his Dogs ſhould
follow, pretending his intention was to accompany his
Dutcheſs part of the way, and then recreate himſelf with
Hunting; but having gone a few hours with her, taking
his leave of her, he rid away as faſt as his Horſe could
carry him to <hi>Kilonium.</hi> Being there, as he was reſolving
to leave his tired Horſes, and proſecute his Journey in a
common Coach, word was brought him, that the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Troopers were riding, not only about <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> but every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
as far as <hi>Hambourgh,</hi> and guarded all the ways;
not ſtaying therefore to Dine, he was ſcarce gone out of
Town, but he was met with two <hi>Daniſh</hi> Troopers, who
taking hold of the Reins of the Horſes to ſtop the Coach,
the Duke telling them he was a certain Nobleman, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to <hi>Eutin,</hi> where he heard, that both the <hi>Kielmans</hi>
were carried away Priſoners to <hi>Copenhaguen.</hi> From <hi>Eutin</hi>
he came to <hi>Hambourgh</hi> indeed, but as a Baniſht Perſon,
and one forc'd to leave his Country and Subjects, expoſed
to the will and pleaſure of the <hi>Danes.</hi> For the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
contrary to the Engagement the 11. of <hi>March
1676.</hi> demoliſht the ſtrong Town of <hi>To<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Caſtle of <hi>Holme</hi> to the ground, the Drums beating, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61869:12"/>
the Trumpets ſounding; and having cauſed the Dukes
Armes upon the great Guns to be defaced, ſent them with
all the Ammunition partly to <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and partly to
<hi>Copenhaguen;</hi> and exacting alſo Contributions to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of many Millions of Gold, and a prodigious quantity
of Corn, Chariots, and Horſes; waſting all the Dukes
Villages and Towns with Quartering his Souldiers in them,
and cauſing them continually to paſs and repaſs to and
fro. This his Majeſty does to this day, not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a penny of Taxes and Impoſitions for the Dukes
Subjects thus expreſſed, though many times deſired to it
by the Dukes Letters and his Ambaſſadors, and uſing
the Duke at the ſame rate, not permitting his Subjects
and Servants to pay him any thing of his Revenue, that
both Prince and Subjects might at laſt periſh by Famine,
and the many other Calamities they are forced to endure.</p>
                  <p>The King nevertheleſs being extreamly vexed, that the
Duke had choſen his abode in a City ſo Famous and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
from whence the whole Story of the Barbarity
exerciſed againſt him, and the breach of ſo many reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Engagements, might be ſpread over all the world,
employed all ſorts of Perſuaſions and Cunning to get his
Highneſs back, and have him again in his Clutches, and
at his diſpoſal; but his Highneſs warned by his former
Uſage, having learnt to diſtruſt, would not be prevailed
upon. His Majeſty for all that, remitted nothing of his
Proſecution againſt the Duke, and both by Letters and
Envoys demanded eſpecially, with great earneſtneſs, that
the Duke in compliance with the late Treaty (if it may
be ſo called) at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> would ſolemnly receive from
the King the Inveſtiture of the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi>
threatning for default thereof to Confiſcate the ſame.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61869:13"/>
On the other hand, the Duke ſent him word, that the
Tranſactions at <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> were ſo unjuſt, that he
thought his Promiſe leſs engaged thereby than the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Reputation. Yet for fear of expoſing his Subjects to
greater Cruelties, and to comply with the Times and the
advice of thoſe, who thought, that in Civility to the
King, the Duke would do well to ſend ſome Gentlemen,
to know his Majeſties pleaſure, and upon what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he was reſolved to grant that Fief; (for it is certain
that it had been held formerly upon different conditions)
the Duke thereupon ſent his Ambaſſadors to <hi>Copenhaguen</hi>
to deſire the King, that he would be pleaſed firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
ſome of the chiefeſt grievances, which had Relation
to the Fief it ſelf, and then declare his pleaſure about
it. The Ambaſſador during their ſtay at <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi>
had no ſucceſs, and having once mentioned the Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
were ſcarce ever after admitted or heard; the
word Grievances offending the <hi>Danes</hi> extreamly, and the
Kings deſign being, without any regard to them, to order
all things according to his own Pleaſure. Therefore the
Ambaſſadors, being adviſed by the Queen-Mother to return
to their Maſter, and let him know the whole buſineſs,
and the eminent danger a delay would caſt him into, and
to return with new Inſtructions from him, agreeable to
the Kings will; they parted from <hi>Copenhaguen</hi> without
their Maſters knowledge, or effecting any thing. But the
King interpreting this and other things in the worſt ſence,
ſent a little after three Commiſſioners to <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> the
<hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Dukedome, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Rantzo,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Gloxin,</hi> and the Baron <hi>Lenten</hi> Aſſeſſor of <hi>Gluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtad,</hi>
with Orders to Sequeſter the Dukedome in the
Kings Name, and abſolving the Magiſtrates and People
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61869:13"/>
from their Allegiance to the Duke, oblige them to take
an Oath of Fidelity to the King, and if any refuſed it, to
deprive them of all their Offices; to bring in all the Dukes
Revenues into the Kings Treaſury, and put a Garriſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Caſtle of <hi>Gottorp;</hi> adding theſe ſecret Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that if the Duke did not comply with the Kings
pleaſure within ſix weeks, and accept this Fief upon the
Kings terms, it ſhould for ever be annexed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Denmark.</hi> And that theſe new Orders of the
Kings might be more publick, and the better obſerved,
the Kings Proclamation to that effect was publiſhed and
affixed at <hi>Sleſwick;</hi> in oppoſition to which Uſurpation,
the Duke publiſhed another, together with his ſolemn
Proteſtation, commanding the States of the Dukedome
and all his Subjects, to continue in their Loyalty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Highneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Narrative of the matter of Fact might very well
end here, but that many calumnies thrown upon the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> muſt make part of it. Therefore, that
the Truth and the Innocence of the moſt Serene Duke
may appear the better, and to take off all ſubject of cavil
from the <hi>Danes,</hi> we will ſay ſomething about what the
<hi>Danes</hi> pretend to be moſt offended at, that ſo the Juſtice
of the Dukes Cauſe may be more evident.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, we ſhall ſpeak about the Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> and ſhew that the <hi>Danes</hi> had not always the
ſame right over it, but ſometimes little or none. For
when antiently the <hi>Venedi</hi> had great Wars with the
<hi>Danes,</hi> the Dioceſs of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> being chiefly in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſted
by their Inroades and Robberies, to prevent it, the Kings
of <hi>Denmark</hi> erected it into a Lieutenancy to oppoſe them,
as formerly the Emperor had erected <hi>Denmark</hi> into a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61869:14"/>
Marquiſate. In the beginning of the twelfth Century,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he <hi>Vandals</hi> having invaded <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> and razed the chief
City thereof, no body would accept of that Lieutenancy,
till at laſt <hi>Nicholas</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> turn'd it into a
Dukedome about the year 1118, and made his Brothers
Son firſt Duke of it, who being Murthered by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
was Canoniz'd, and call'd St. <hi>Canut.</hi> Now whether
this <hi>Canut</hi> received the Dukedome to hold as a Fief of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> is not only queſtioned, but rather denied by
the great Hiſtorian <hi>Jo. Adolphus Cypraeus,</hi> in his <hi>Annals</hi> of
<hi>Sleſwick, lib. 1. cap.</hi> 21. 'Tis true, it cannot be diſputed,
but that the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> grant the ſame to be held
as a Fief from them, but the terms upon which, have been
different; and the Kings ſometimes reſerved nothing to
themſelves but the Solemnity of the Inveſtiture. <hi>For</hi>
Waldemar <hi>the Third, with the Advice of the States of the
Kingdom, gave to</hi> Gerhard <hi>Earl of</hi> Holſtein <hi>his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkle,
for him, and his lawful Heirs, the Dukedome of</hi> South-Juitland,
<hi>cum Dominio utili &amp; directo, and all things
belonging to it, and all the Vaſſals in the Dioceſs of</hi> Sleſwick,
<hi>to be enjoyed for ever by him and his, quietly and peaceably,
and to be held as a Fief with the Armes of it. Renouncing
for him, his Heirs and Succeſſors, all the Right that ever they
had in the ſame. Two years after, King</hi> Chriſtopher <hi>made
over the Iſland of</hi> Femeren, <hi>with the Propriety of it, to</hi> John
<hi>the</hi> III. <hi>Earl of</hi> Holſtein, <hi>and all his Heirs, as well Male as
Female, to be held likewiſe as a Fief; which Donation was
confirmed by</hi> Waldemar <hi>the</hi> IIII. <hi>his Son.</hi> And <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>
the II. being reſtored to his Throne, <hi>Waldemar</hi> the III.
who had Reſigned it, had the Hereditary Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick</hi> conferred upon him. <hi>John Meurs</hi> an excellent
Writer of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Hiſtory, relates of <hi>Margaret</hi> the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61869:14"/>
prudent and careful Queen of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that ſhe made
a Peace with <hi>Gerhard</hi> Duke of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> and thoſe of

and her Husband <hi>Eric</hi> demanded the Guardianſhip of his
Children, and under that pretence, ſeizing upon many
Caſtles and Places of the Dukedome, at laſt endeavoured
to get the whole, and reunite it to the Crown of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
which being perceived by <hi>Gerhards</hi> Sons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes, and that ſhe demanded of them, firſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to reſign that Dukedome to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> before they ſhould receive the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture
of it, occaſioned a ſharp War for Thirty years.
At laſt when the Dukedom came to <hi>Adolph</hi> the laſt, Duke
of the Houſe of <hi>Schawenburg,</hi> and that by his Intereſt,
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> the firſt, Son to <hi>Theodorick</hi> Earl of <hi>Oldenburgh</hi>
and <hi>Hedewig Adolphus</hi>'s Siſter, had been Elected King of
<hi>Denmark, He promiſed by a ſolemn Deed to his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nckle, and
the States of the Province of</hi> Sleſwick, <hi>that he would never
unite or incorporate the Dukedom of</hi> Sleſwick <hi>to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and that they ſhould Swear Allegiance to
him as Duke of</hi> Sleſwick, <hi>and not as King of</hi> Denmark.
<hi>And</hi> Adolph <hi>dying Ten years after without Children,</hi> Chriſtian
<hi>ſucceeded him, and from that time the Fief of the Dukedome
of</hi> Sleſwick <hi>was not ſolemnly granted by the Kings of</hi> Denmark
<hi>to any Body, that I know (ſays the Learned</hi> David Chytraeus,
lib. 24. Saxon. Hiſt. p. 717. ſeq.) <hi>for above 120 years after.</hi>
There have been beſides other diſputes about this Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as, That this Fief ſhould be exempted from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61869:15"/>
performance of all Services; That the Succeſſion ſhould
come to Women as well as Men: by which it appears,
that it was not always granted or held upon the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and that there is little Reaſon to envy the Houſe
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> for having at its own great charges and coſt,
obtained for that Dukedome an Independent Authority,
and thereby taken away all occaſions of diſcord between
them and the <hi>Danes.</hi> For after this Independent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
was granted, though they might have juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
other ſatisfactions to be made them, the Duke
preferred a Peace which they had juſtly ſought by the
alteration of this Dukedome, and which was confirmed
by the conſent of the King and States of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as moſt
advantageous both to the King and the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi>
to all the Monies they might expect. And as all other
humane things or goods may by commerce paſs from one
hand to another, ſo there is no doubt, but the Right of an
Independent and Supreme Power may likewiſe be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and alienated. Therefore if a proportioned ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
be demanded to a great loſs ſuſtained, it may be
given, not only in paying ſo much mony, or delivering
up ſo many Towns and Provinces, but by quitting and
transferring the Right of Supreme Power by thoſe who
have a right to Alienate; ſo that a Perſon, who before he
had due ſatisfaction made him, had but a Dependent
Power, may receive and retain it Supreme and Abſolute:
This being confirmed by a late inſtance of the Elector of
<hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who, not many years ago, obtained <hi>Pruſſia</hi>
in this manner.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that the moſt Serene Dukes of <hi>Gottorp</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<hi>Tonningen,</hi> levied Forces, entred into a League with
the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and made a Journey to <hi>Stockholme,</hi> is but a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61869:15"/>
frivolous Accuſation. For what ſhould hinder the Duke
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> or by what Law is he prohibited to fortifie a
Town, or raiſe a Fort? and Building one in the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> he only does what all the Princes and
States of the Empire think they may do, and do every
day. And if he would do the ſame in his Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> we know no Law or Treaty by which he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to do it. <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> having to
his own coſt found that he was expoſed to all ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and damages, when-ever the Enemies of the Kings
of <hi>Denmark</hi> were by War, or otherwiſe, drawn into his
Territories, and that he was ſecure no-where; towards
the latter and of the year 1644. (during the War) began
to fortifie <hi>Tonningen,</hi> which was not oppoſed by the King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> as there was no juſt reaſon to do it. But
about the year 1660. that King laid Siege to the place, to
force the Duke to aboliſh and annul the Treaty made at
<hi>Roſchild</hi> for the benefit of the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp;</hi> whence
you may well judge with how little ſincerity the <hi>Danes</hi>
intended to keep this Treaty, which they had ſo ſolemnly
agreed and bound themſelves to. But the Duke refuſing
to hearken to ſo unreaſonable a demand, endured the Siege
ſtoutly, till after ſome time a Peace was concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt mention that theſe Fortifications ought not
to have been raiſed, or promiſe of demoliſhing them:
For as this Fort was built only for the ſecurity and defence
of the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> that the Dukes might have a
Place to retire to in times of danger; ſo they never raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more Forces than were neceſſary for the defence of
the Place: And if the Duke had intended to invade <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
he muſt have provided much greater Forces, and
taken other Meaſures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61869:16"/>
That the Duke has entred into a League with the
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> is not denied, but it is only ſuch an one,
as may enable him to reſiſt an unjuſt Force, and defend
himſelf. If the <hi>Danes</hi> do accuſe him of making any other
Leagues to the Ruin of <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Denmark,</hi> his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
denies it abſolutely, and deſires no credit may be
given them in a thing for which they can bring no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
But if they alleadge, that the Conditions by
which the Duke has ſought to ſecure his own Houſe from
their Oppreſſions, are Hoſtile and againſt them; they
plainly ſhew that they have a mind to wrong thoſe they
ought rather to Protect, and not provoke to a juſt Defence,
which in the end may prove dangerous to <hi>Denmark</hi> it
ſelf.</p>
                  <p>That Objection of the Dukes journey into <hi>Sweden</hi> is
much of the ſame nature: For although his Highneſs
would not be diverted by the Councils and demands of
the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> tending to nothing but a War,
from going to ſee the King and Queen Mother his near
Relations, and take their advice; yet this Journey was
never undertaken to enter into new Alliances, thoſe
Princes being entred into one long before, but in reſpect
and deference to the moſt Serene Queen his Siſter, who
had promiſed to come and ſee him. Nay, if the <hi>Danes</hi>
(who are generally very clear-ſighted in the affairs of the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp)</hi> did not interpret all that which the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> does in the worſt ſence, they could
have ſatisfied themſelves eaſily, that that Journey was
never intended againſt their Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay, that it was not lawful for the Duke
of <hi>Gottorp</hi> to make a League with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
becauſe he was declared an Enemy to the Empire. Such
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61869:16"/>
fooleries are ſo ridiculous, that they deſerve no Anſwer:
But becauſe they are ſpread abroad, and may deceive the
ſimple, who are the greater number, we muſt ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to them. VVhy the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> have been
declared Enemies of the Empire, is a matter we ſhall not
meddle with. The Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> is not concerned in
the Quarrel of either of them, and ſo ought not to be
involved therein. The Duke has been allied with <hi>Sweden</hi>
ſince 1661, long before the <hi>Swedes</hi> were declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Empire, and at a time when all the Parties in
War, even the Emperor, and alſo <hi>Spain,</hi> courted the
Friendſhip of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and earneſtly deſired their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to compoſe the differences then on Foot: Beſides,
there is no Article of that Treaty with <hi>Sweden,</hi> which
may endanger the ſafety of the Empire, or any of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
ſince it is wholly Defenſive. Nay, the Duke has by
expreſs words excepted the Empire, declaring he would
not be bound by this Treaty whenever any thing ſhould
happen to the prejudice of the ſame: And alſo the King
of <hi>Sweden</hi> in it recommends to the Duke by all means to
entertain a friendſhip with the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> And
the <hi>Danes</hi> themſelves will not deny, but that they, the
Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> and others, have invited <hi>Sweden</hi>
to enter into a League with them; and therefore cannot
blame in the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> what they themſelves did or
would have done, eſpecially ſince the Duke ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than to render the Peace and publick Safety
more firm and ſecure. It is then a meer cavil to object,
that the Dukes of <hi>Holſtein</hi> have made a League with the
<hi>Swedes,</hi> who are Enemies of the Empire, as ſuch, ſince
their help was never intended to be uſed but for a
juſt defence againſt thoſe, who contrary to the Faith of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61869:17"/>
Treaties, would invade them, and not to the prejudice
of the Empire, or any body elſe, there being reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fear an Invaſion by the face of things then, as
the event has too unfortunately ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the <hi>Danes</hi> are of opinion, as to the Taxes,
that their Kings demand of the greater part of them for
himſelf was very juſt, and that the Duke had no reaſon
to deny it, ſince his Majeſty had an Army in Pay, or at
leaſt more Troops than his Highneſs, to defend both
Dukedomes; this muſt be more particularly examined:
And firſt, 'tis certain that the King would never acquaint
the Duke, nor the States of the Province, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
of this VVar, though it was to be carried on with
their Monies, and ſo was far from undertaking it with
their will and conſent, according to the Treaties and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Cuſtoms. Moreover, though he had undertaken
this VVar with the conſent of the Duke and States, he
could not demand more mony than was agreed by the
antient Treaties, and was wont to be granted. Beſides,
this VVar was not entred into for the defence of theſe
Dukedomes, but that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> might take
that occaſion of invading the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and recover his
loſſes in the laſt VVar. Again, if the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
thought, that becauſe of his League with the Emperour
and the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> he could juſtly attack
the <hi>Swedes;</hi> yet could he not violate the Agreements made
by the Treaty of <hi>Roſchild,</hi> trample it under feet, ruin
the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp;</hi> and to that end demand firſt the
greater part of the Taxes, then overcharge the Dukes
Subjects with Impoſitions, exhauſt them almoſt totally,
by forcing from them in leſs than half a year, ſeveral
Millions of Gold. Nay, when the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61869:17"/>
put upon a neceſſary and defenſive War, 'tis but juſt he
ſhould bring into the Field a greater Army than the Duke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the Dukedoms of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein</hi> lying as a fence
to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and its ſecurity depending upon theirs, each
Prince is bound to find Forces proportionably to the Land
they poſſeſs, and which are to be ſecured from the Enemy.
And though perhaps the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> may ſay, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he will with his own Souldiers alone, defend thoſe Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and therefore has right to demand money from
them, and all other neceſſaries for War at his pleaſure;
yet it is to be conſidered, that this cannot be done but by
violating in the higheſt manner the Rights of the Duke of
<hi>Gottorp;</hi> for we muſt not think, that by reaſon of a War,
the King may do every thing, and the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi>
have no Power left in their own Territories. Nay, that
Serene Houſe pretends to as much Power and Right, as
to the making and carrying on a VVar, as the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> in quality of Duke of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein</hi> can
any ways pretend to. The <hi>Danes</hi> now do not queſtion,
whether the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> hath the Power of VVar,
ſince they have enjoyed it in all Ages, and made uſe of
it againſt the oppreſſions of the <hi>Danes:</hi> but that King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to get it to himſelf, having in theſe late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
manifeſted his deſigns of abſolutely depriving the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> of the Power and Right of VVar; for
when the Duke and all his Territories were in the Kings
poſſeſſion at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> demanded an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of what Troops the Duke had ſent for the defence
of the Empire, ordering that they ſhould be paid only by
the Kings Commiſſioners, (as they are called) that the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> might underſtand from thence, that he
was not to keep any more Souldiers for his Defence, nor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61869:18"/>
to have any part of the Right and Power of VVar in the
affairs of the Empire; or the Circle of <hi>Lower-Saxony,</hi> but
that the King would challenge it wholly himſelf, to the
great injury and oppreſſion of the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and
danger of other Princes.</p>
                  <p>But the Proceedings at <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> are covered with
this further pretence, as if by it the Antient Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> was
reſtored, and thoſe Provinces re-eſtabliſht in their moſt
flouriſhing Condition; and therefore ſince the greateſt
Maſters of Prudence teach us, that that Government
which makes both the Prince and his Subjects moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
ought to be preferred and kept, the King ſeems to
have rather done well than ill, by having diſpoſed and
brought the Dukedomes from a leſs, to a more happy,
nay, moſt happy ſtate, by the tranſactions of <hi>Rendsbourgh.</hi>
This is a fair Speech, but if we conſider it a little nearer,
we ſhall eaſily diſcover its fraud: For whereas the Kings
of <hi>Denmark</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> have their Lands,
Governments, and Towns, in the Dukedomes of <hi>Sleſwick</hi>
and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> not only contiguous, but intermixed with
one another, and the ſafety and happineſs of <hi>Denmark</hi>
depending not a little upon the good Government of theſe
Dukedomes, there were Treaties of Union made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and exchanged on both ſides, by which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of theſe two Countries was left to both Princes
joyntly, and they to command in them every year alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively,
and to have the whole Nobility and other the
States, ſubject to them. And as it cannot be denied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but that this conjunction contributed very much to the
peace and qulet of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſo the Dukes of <hi>Gottorp</hi> have
uſed this Right ſo carefully and diſcreetly, that none of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61869:18"/>
their Acts have in the leaſt derogated from theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Union, which is more than can be ſaid of the
<hi>Danes;</hi> for though they talk of the Union, when it is
advantageous to them, yet have they often violated the
ſame in things of the greateſt Importance, which is proved
by this: That the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> cannot without
breach of the Treaties, (as moſt manifeſtly appears, by
the Articles of the Union) enter into a VVar, nor carry
it on at their own pleaſure, without firſt acquainting the
Dukes of <hi>Gottorp</hi> with their Deſigns, and obtaining his
conſent to it; nor in time of VVar diſpoſe at his will of
their Subjects, or their Eſtates, who are either in his or
in the Dukes Territories. But as the will and authority
of the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> have ſometimes prevailed in
other Affairs relating to theſe Dukedomes, ſo have they
affected hitherto to take greater power than the Dukes,
though but their equals there. And this having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
many times before the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Monarchy was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
and the <hi>Danes</hi> ſince ſtrengthning themſelves by
little and little, are now come to that, as to make and
expound all manner of Treaties for the advantage of their
King, and either think themſelves no longer oblig'd to
them then as they are found ſuch, or as they may by them
enſnare the Dukes of <hi>Gottorp.</hi> For the <hi>Danes</hi> publiſh
openly, that their King will hereafter order matters in
theſe Provinces, (the Government whereof is joyntly in
him and the Duke) as a Prince having the Soveraign
Power, and conſequently uſe the Duke as his Vaſſal.
This Joynt-Government being by the Treaties extended
to both Dukedoms, it is eaſily to be ſeen, that the King
intends to exerciſe a Soveraign and Independent Power
in <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> and afterwards by little and little Uſurp the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61869:19"/>
ſame under divers pretences, and eſpecially that of the
Union in the Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and ſo wholly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the Dignity and Authority of the Dukes of <hi>Gottorp,</hi>
either by the Right of a Military Power, or by degrees
in time of Peace. Therefore, what one of the Fathers ſays
of Religion, <hi>That ſhe brought forth Riches, but the Daughter
devoured the Mother,</hi> may be ſaid upon this occaſion;
<hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion brought forth this Joynt-Government, but the
quarrelſome Daughter has deſtroyed her Mother.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi>
have no reaſon then to deceive the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and
the VVorld with the ſpecious word of Union, ſince every
one may ſee, that the former condition thereof is much
alter'd, and the farther this <hi>Daniſh</hi> Soveraignty ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
her VVings, the more the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> will be
endangered thereby.</p>
                  <p>And no body can look upon this as a meer Conjecture
and Gueſs, ſince the <hi>Danes</hi> have in times paſt and of late
confirmed the Truth hereof, and forced the moſt incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to Believe it: For in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> 1677,
the King began to demoliſh the VValls of the Fort of
<hi>Tunderen,</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained
to the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> without ſpeaking a word
to him of his deſign or reaſon for it. Not long before, a
laden Ship belonging to ſome Merchants of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> was
ſtranded upon the Shore near <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> a Town of the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi>'s, in the Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> Now
this being without diſpute in the Territories of the Houſe
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and ſome monys being due to the Duke as
Lord of the Place for ſalvage of the Goods and the keeping
of them, the Officer of the Place, to keep his Maſters
right, cauſed the Goods to be brought a-Shore, and to
be ſhut up in a Barn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Duke intending they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61869:19"/>
ſhould be reſtored to their Owners: But ſoon after came
ſome of the Kings Officers with orders to confiſcate the
Goods, and having broken open the Barn-door, without
any regard to Law, or the Soveraignty of the Place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
the Goods away upon ſeveral Waggons to <hi>Hilgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haven,</hi>
one of the Kings Towns, and thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
violated the Dukes right, having no Orders for the
ſame but from the Kings Commiſſioners. Beſides, in
the latter end of <hi>March</hi> 1677, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> that he thought fit ſome
Publick days ſhould be appointed for the Subjects, to
Pray for the Preſervation of the Country. But herein
likewiſe was a deſign, for it being uſual to ſet three days
apart for publick Prayers yearly in his Highneſſes Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
in the week before <hi>Rogation-Sunday,</hi> the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to take that time, and would not expect the conſent
of the Duke for it; but taking no notice thereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thoſe days to be kept in the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick</hi>
in his own Name alone, and in the Dukedom of <hi>Holſtein</hi>
in his and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi>'s Name, thereby infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Articles of Union in ſeveral reſpects. And though
the King publiſhes, he acquainted the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi>
with this deſign, yet the Duke did never conſent to
the thing, nor the manner of it. It is by meer force and no
right, that the King deteins that part of the Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> which does and did belong to the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi>
as we ſhall at large prove: The Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> having
already contradicted, and firmly contradicting all what
his Majeſty ſhall publiſh or command there in his Name
alone. Beſides, the King alone has no right to order
matters of the Government of the Dukedome of <hi>Holſtein,</hi>
(which ought to be ſetled by both Princes) not having
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61869:20"/>
the conſent of the Duke, though he cauſe his Orders to
be Publiſhed and Proclaimed in the Dukes name as well
as his own. For a thing is not done by two perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there be a joynt conſent. It is evident therefore,
that this alſo has been done contrary to the ancient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and becauſe that the Kings Order had only his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Seal, and that the King alone cannot enjoyn the
States of the Provinces any thing, and eſpecially becauſe
that all this hath been done at a time when the Duke,
according to courſe, ought to have had the direction and
Prerogative of the Soveraign Power, and Joint-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(from whoſe Power and Right herein, howſoever the
<hi>Danes</hi> endeavour to detract by theſe pretended Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
the moſt Serene Duke did on the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1677,
proteſt againſt it; and having appointed the uſual days
for publick Prayers, doth again hereby repeat his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Proteſtation in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this Calumny has alſo been added to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
as if the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> (though almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ruined by the <hi>Danes)</hi> ſhould intend dangerous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
againſt their ſtate. And firſt, this Story has gone
about, that he was raiſing Eight Thouſand Men in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to Tranſport into his Territories, and a great many
have believed it. But it being impoſſible to begin ſuch
a thing, much more to perfect it, without the knowledge
and conſent of the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Envoy at <hi>London</hi> having complained hereof, his Majeſty
deſired him very prudently to prove it; which he not
having hitherto been able to do, all good men are ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of the Vanity of the Fable. Afterwards another
Story has been raiſed and ſpread in the Court of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
and other Princes, having been preſented in writing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61869:20"/>
by the <hi>Danes</hi> to the Deputies of the Circle of the <hi>Lower
Saxony</hi> at <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> that the Dukes Deputies being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from that Aſſembly, and the deliberations thereof,
it might ſerve as a Preſident to help them to perfect their
yet worſe Deſigns. It is alſo charged upon the Duke,
that he has taken meaſures with the Duke of <hi>Mecklen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi>
to contrive how they ſhould with their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or thoſe of the <hi>Swedes</hi> or others, retake <hi>Wiſmar</hi> and
<hi>Gluckſtadt</hi> from the <hi>Danes.</hi> They endeavour to prove
this Story by I know not what diſcourſe, of a certain
<hi>Frenchman</hi> called <hi>De Luis,</hi> who was carried away Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> and by ſome Letters they found about
him.</p>
                  <p>VVe ſhall not now diſpute what the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi>
ſo unjuſtly oppreſſed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> may lawfully do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and why he ſhould not uſe all means for his
own Defence: Neither is it neceſſary we ſhould plead ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Cauſe, ſince it may be preſumed, that no man will
deſert himſelf. But we ſolemnly affirm here with all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
in the Name, and by the Command of the Duke of
<hi>Gottorp,</hi> that he never thought upon any ſuch thing, nor
exchanged a word with the Duke of <hi>Mecklenbourg</hi> about
it, as that Duke has himſelf aſſerted to the Duke of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi>'s
Miniſter ſent to him expreſly, promiſing to declare
the ſame publickly, and that he never gave any Orders to
this <hi>De Luis,</hi> nor truſted him with any Letters. The
<hi>Danes</hi> themſelves, when they think of it, inſult over the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and ſay, they wonder extreamly he will
not ſubmit to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dominion, that is ſo eaſie, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf deſtitute of all help, and no Prince willing to
raiſe an Army in his behalf. And yet at other times
they make him ſo formidable, and ſo full of pernicious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61869:21"/>
deſigns againſt the Empire, the Kingdome of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and the Confederates, that they would have him decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an Enemy of the Empire, excluded from all publick
Aſſemblies, and having almoſt entirely ruined him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to be quite oppreſſed by others. This is indeed
a great Malice and Hatred, ſit for none but men full of
Gall, who are not aſhamed to obtrude ſuch Lies upon
their King and the whole Chriſtian world, that they
may take away from the Duke all means of helping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſo ſtain his Innocence with calumnies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſo
good a Prince might be thought not to deſerve any pitty,
and much leſs the help of Juſtice againſt ſuch manifeſt
Injuries, the greatneſs and ſplendor of whoſe Family is
ſuch, that there is ſcarce any great Family in <hi>Germany,</hi>
to whom he is not Allied and Related. In a word, ſince
the diſcourſes or Letters of this <hi>De Luis,</hi> that are ſpread
abroad, and pretended to be intercepted, do not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Duke, we deſire no Faith may be given to theſe
Stories of the <hi>Danes,</hi> till they ſhew the Truth of them
to the World, which undoubtedly they can never do.</p>
                  <p>The falſehood of theſe Stories and Inventions thus
plainly appearing, it remains we ſhould give the Reaſons
why the Duke ought in any impartial judgment to be
entirely reſtored to all his Rights, which the <hi>Danes</hi> have
ſo contrary to all Juſtice Uſurped. His Highneſs obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
three points chiefly by the Treaty of <hi>Roſchild, viz.</hi>
The Soveraignty or Supreme Power over the Dukedome
of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> without any dependence from the King or
Crown of <hi>Denmark;</hi> the Territory of <hi>Schwabſtadt,</hi> and
the Cathedral Church of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> with its Eccleſiaſtical
Juriſdiction, and ſome other things. And becauſe the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had at that time entred into an unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61869:21"/>
War againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> not only without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> but contrary to his Opinion,
and notwithſtanding his diſſuading the ſaid King from
the ſame, and had brought great Calamities upon the
Provinces and Subjects of the Duke, by drawing the
<hi>Swedes, Imperialiſts, Brandenburgers, Polanders</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
into them; the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a proportionable ſatisfaction to his Father-in-Law,
and his Highneſs might juſtly have admitted of it; but
was contented for all the damages he had ſuſtained, with
the remiſſion of the Vaſſalage of the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
and the yielding up of the Soveraignty thereof to
him, without demanding any thing more for his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
This occaſion of the Controverſies and Wars
between them being cut off, and both Princes having
ſolemnly Sworn to keep this Peace, it ſeemed as if none
more firm and ſecure could have been wiſhed for; but the
<hi>Danes</hi> continually tormented ſince the Peace at <hi>Roſchild,</hi>
by the remembrance of their having yielded up this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,
have ſo far indulged their deſire of Revenge,
that they have ſtudied nothing more than how to regain
this Dukedome and its Soveraign Right, and wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp;</hi> which is fully proved by
what we have ſaid already, and the moſt ſevere conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and the means uſed to force the Duke
and his Miniſters to conſent to them; which being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be known by thoſe that would judge aright of
theſe Differences, we ſhall, before we have done, give the
world ſome account, leaving it to their juſt cenſure.</p>
                  <p>And though the <hi>Danes</hi> have obtruded theſe conditions
upon the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and have extorted from him
the Authentick Inſtrument of the Peace of <hi>Roſchild;</hi> yet
hereby they have done nothing but ſhown their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61869:22"/>
and the diſ-ingenuity of their Proceedings; and
rendred themſelves obliged upon many accounts to make
the Duke amends for their violating of his Rights, and to
reſtore him entirely to the ſame; which if they refuſe to
do, they deſerve to be forced thereunto by all Princes who
have any conſideration for Faith, Juſtice, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And this we ſhall endeavour thus to demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>1. VVhatſoever was given, yielded, and promiſed to
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> by the King and Kingdom of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
at the ending of the laſt War 1658, was yielded
deliberately With their Will and Conſent; and it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
provided, that neither of the Parties, under
what pretence ſoever, ſhould ever recede from the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
agreed upon, and that they ſhould be kept invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable.
Neither can the <hi>Danes</hi> object here, that they did
not conſent to theſe things freely and frankly, but only as
forced by the Arms of <hi>Sweden;</hi> for having freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
attacked the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they were free certainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to conſent to what ſatisfaction and compenſation the
<hi>Swedes</hi> would inſiſt upon; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> having juſtly
extended what they demanded to the benefit of the Houſe
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> which had ſuſtained ſo many loſſes by the
War, the <hi>Danes</hi> have no reaſon to complain of them for
it; the <hi>Swedes</hi> having then a juſt right by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to require yet more from <hi>Denmark:</hi> And here this

Peace of <hi>Roſchild</hi> was procured, have alſo approved the
ſame as Guarantees; and thence it is manifeſt, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
of the Parties ſhall violate this Treaty, or refuſe
to be obliged by the ſame, doth not only offend againſt
God and his Conſcience, but alſo the Law of Nations,
and particularly provokes the Arms of thoſe Princes who
are engaged ſolemnly in the Guaranty of the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Danes</hi> have conſented to this Agreement twice
already; firſt, by a general Approbation in the 22 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the Peace of <hi>Roſchild,</hi> made the 26 of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1658,
and then more ſpecially by the Agreement made at <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haguen</hi>
the 12 of <hi>May</hi> the ſame year. A little after the
War between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> being renewed
of a ſudden, the <hi>Danes</hi> beſieged <hi>Tonningen,</hi> and the
Duke with all his Court reſiding in it, to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Articles above-mentioned, and renounce his
Soveraignty in the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi>
indeed complained at that time, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
Arms againſt them, but whether juſtly or unjuſtly,
is not our buſineſs now to diſpute. For what has the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> to do with it? The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> his
Son-in-Law, did not give him the leaſt notice, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to paſs into <hi>Denmark</hi> and renew the War there;
neither was his Highneſs charged of having committed any
offence againſt the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But ſuppoſe this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
War of the <hi>Swedes</hi> was unjuſt, as the <hi>Danes</hi> alledge,
muſt therefore the Innocent and the Guilty be treated
alike? what the Duke enjoyed, was as a juſt ſatisfaction,
the Juſtice whereof he never did any thing againſt.
Therefore when there was an end put to this War by the
Peace of 1660; the <hi>Swedes</hi> indeed remitted again into
the hands of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſome things that had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61869:23"/>
been granted them by the Treaty of <hi>Roſchild.</hi> But all
that had been yielded or promiſed to the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi>
remained as before without the leaſt diminution. The
<hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the
States General of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> thinking it juſt
to leave it ſo; the <hi>Danes</hi> for the third time now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
that Treaty, and agreeing beſides with the Duke
of <hi>Gottorp</hi> to paſs a general <hi>Amneſty</hi> for all Injuries and
other matters committed before that time, as appears by
the 27 and 28 Articles of that Treaty.</p>
                  <p>4. Beſides, when the Treaty of Peace was concluded
between the <hi>Swedes</hi> and the <hi>Poles,</hi> with their Allies, the
Emperor and Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh</hi> at <hi>Oliva</hi> 1660,
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> were not
only included therein: But the Treaty between them the
<hi>Swedes</hi> and the Duke made at <hi>Roſchild,</hi> and renewed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
1660, was alſo included in it, as if it had been
tranſcribed word for word; the <hi>Danes</hi> ratiſying what
the Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Emperour
and Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> had ſtipulated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and ſo now the fourth time ſolemnly approved the
Agreements between themſelves and the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp.</hi>
And to the intent that this Peace might be ſtrictly kept
by all Parties, not only the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> with their
Confederates, promiſe one another a mutual Guaranty;
but the King of <hi>France</hi> alſo entred into the ſame, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongſt other things, That if any Prince thought
himſelf grieved by any other way than force of Armes, he
ſhould not Revenge it by way of Arms, but complain to
the ſeveral Princes, who were Parties in this Treaty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
them to procure him a preſent and ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
<hi>Vid. Artic.</hi> 22. 26. 31. &amp; 35. of that Treaty.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61869:23"/>
I would fain have the <hi>Danes</hi> tell us, what Injuries the
Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has done them, either by way of Arms,
or otherwiſe: If they cannot tell, nor prove any, the
Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has reaſon to expect to be reſtored to all
his Rights by the Princes that have engaged their Faith
in this Treaty, and that the <hi>Danes</hi> ſhould be uſed as break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Peace. If the <hi>Danes</hi> will make theſe trivial
objections, which have been already anſwered, paſs for
Injuries, and eſpecially the League made with <hi>Sweden</hi> by
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> for his own defence; I am afraid they
will find few expert Miniſters of their mind. It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and ever will be lawful to make ſuch Leagues. Nay,
if the <hi>Danes</hi> will but remember their own Deſigns, and
examine their Conſcience, they muſt needs own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Authors, or occaſion of this League. <hi>For ſuch
Principles muſt never be neglected, nor the Power of any ever
be raiſed to ſuch a greatneſs,</hi> (or it muſt not be left in any
ones power to do hurt, who has a mind to do it) <hi>that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you may not be in a condition to diſpute your right upon
equal terms.</hi> Saith <hi>Polyb. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>5. The diſſenting minds of Princes having been in all
Ages happily reconciled by Marriage, and their Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
thereby laid down, and ſometimes totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht;
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> thought fit to uſe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and having humbly demanded, and obtained as a
Pledge of ſincere Friendſhip between both Princes, the
Daughter of <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
for his Wife; and ſeveral Articles being at the
ſame time agreed upon by the King and the Duke, as well
relating to the Dowry as other things, the King then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ratified all that had been ſo many times agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them concerning this Dukedome. So that the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61869:24"/>
King now for the fifth time gave his conſent to it in the
year 1667, moſt freely, and without the leaſt appearance
of conſtraint by War or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>6. The <hi>Danes</hi> without the leaſt provocation or new
injury (all former matters being by an <hi>Amneſty</hi> in the
Treaty aboliſhed on both ſides) but out of a deſire of
Revenge, and hope of regaining their loſſes, have firſt
broken this Peace and Agreement made and concluded
between the King and States of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Houſe
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> ſo often Sworn to and approved by both, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by committing Violences upon old aboliſh'd pretences,
and which by ſeveral Conventions have been before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted,
and partly by doing things either directly againſt
the tenor of the Articles, or the neceſſary conſequences
of them; for whatever is acted contrary to Friendſhip,
breaks the Peace which ſubſiſts by nothing elſe; <hi>And
what other men are obliged to by Friendſhip alone,</hi>

                     <hi>Princes are further tied to by their Promiſes and
Treaties.</hi> And therefore we hope it will find
little credit what the <hi>Danes</hi> falſly accuſe the Duke of, as
if he ſhould have provoked them juſtly to what they have
done. <hi>For thoſe break the Peace who firſt commit Violences,
and not thoſe that repel them, and much leſs thoſe that only
endeavour to defend themſelves,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thucydides;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
agrees the common opinion of the Learned in the
Law, who ſay, That to make a Defence lawful, it is not
neceſſary to expect or receive the firſt blow. Therefore
what is objected to <hi>Choſro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> in <hi>Procopius,</hi> may be applyed
here; <hi>Thoſe break the Peace, who in time of Peace or League

                        </gap>ſe
that are firſt in Arms.</hi> Now, if any one will impartially
conſider all Tranſactions ſince the Peace of <hi>Roſchild,</hi> it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61869:24"/>
can never be made out, that the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has
conſpired againſt the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that the King hath laid ſnares for the Duke from
time to time, and at laſt ſurpriz'd him at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> as
hath been before ſaid.</p>
                  <p>7. If we conſider well the means taken by the <hi>Danes</hi>
to gratifie their deſire of Revenge, though they have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their intentions with many fair words, we ſhall
find them very falſe and unjuſt. For the Duke of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi>
and his Miniſters having been drawn to <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi>
upon the hopes given, and ſo many times confirmed of a
fair compoſure of things, and ſeveral proteſtations of
friendſhip and kindneſs, were preſently after ſhut up,
and detained in Priſon, where they were forced to moſt
unjuſt conditions: there was quite another thing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than what was acted; and any man may eaſily ſee by
what trick they were betrayed and trepanned. Therefore,
whatever was concluded there, is void in Law; and the
<hi>Danes</hi> have done nothing, either in forcing the Houſe of
<hi>Gottorp</hi> to agree to theſe unjuſt conditions, or extorting fit
and juſt ones from it. Neither have they hereby confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their old Right, nor got a new one. They have only
taken Papers and Parchments from the Duke, but not the
Right they lookt for; and in truth there has been only a
Play Acted at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> but it was a Tragedy. For if we
weigh this by the Law of Nations, which is chiefly of
Force between free Princes and People, the Convention
at <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> is abſolutely null and void; nothing being
more contrary to Faith and Juſtice than ſuch tricks as
theſe, and Princes being more ſtrictly bound not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from it than any private perſon; eſpecially ſince the
Articles with the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp</hi> of 1658, were agreed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61869:25"/>
upon, and ſigned with ſuch Ceremony, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as equal them to an Oath; and that by them, not the
King, but the injur'd Duke is to be entirely reſtored. It
was a ſaying of the Antients, That <hi>amongſt good men all
proceedings ought to be ſincere.</hi> Now Princes ought not
only to be counted good, but the beſt of men; and the
more punctual and ſincere they are in their Treaties
with others, the greater will their Reputation be.</p>
                  <p>8. This Tranſaction was likewiſe no ſmall breach of
the Law of Nations. The King had deſired the Duke,
after they had Feaſted together friendly and kindly at
<hi>Dennewerk,</hi> to come and ſee him at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and
the Chancellor of the Kingdom having repeated this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the Kings, the Duke ſent word he would do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the Honour to come and wait upon his Majeſty. His
Highneſs was received with the ſhooting of Guns, and all
other demonſtrations of kindneſs and reſpect, that he
might believe himſelf welcome. But when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Priſoner, with Guards to watch him, and that
thoſe who ought to have been uſed like Gueſts and well
entertained, were not permitted to go away, nay, not ſo
much as to ſtir out, the Law of Nations was eminently
broken, and ſufficient occaſion given for Reparation.
Many wonder that the Duke would truſt his Perſon and
his Miniſters with the King, and that in a very ſtrong
Town. But they will ceaſe wondering when they know
all the repeated proteſtations of true Friendſhip made by
the King and his Miniſters, ſo that the Duke, who has a
generous and great Soul, was afraid to be thought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful,
or give a ſuſpition of it, eſteeming with <hi>Livy,</hi>
that to truſt was the way to be truſted. Thus of old pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd
<hi>Dio,</hi> who knowing that <hi>Calippus</hi> had laid ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61869:25"/>
for him, was aſhamed to uſe precaution againſt a
Friend, and one whoſe Gueſt he then was, ſaith <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. And here we muſt not omit the Violences uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> and his Miniſters, and the
Troubles they were put to. <hi>If a man puts another in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Cuſtody to extort from him, all what is done by it is null,</hi>
ſay the Civilians, <hi>Vid. Paulus I<hi rend="sup">ctus</hi>. Lib. 22. ff. quod

a Gueſt, a Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being come to viſit his Friend,
Relation, Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> endured not only many hard vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
injuries and unjuſt things, as well as all his Servants,
but was terrified daily with new threats and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of great Evils, by which his Mind and his Body
were brought ſo low, that his grief caſt him into a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
diſtemper. Some of the <hi>Danes</hi> have endeavoured
to conceal the diſguiſe, nay, deny too what paſſed at
<hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and perhaps are yet unwilling to confeſs the
truth; not becauſe they can ſtiffle what hath been done
in the view of ſo many people, then at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> but
to ſuppreſs all they could the remembrance of this Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Story. For we do not doubt but that there are
many good men among the <hi>Danes,</hi> who abhor the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61869:26"/>
of that man, who was then the great man with the
King, and never kept within bounds.</p>
                  <p>But however the <hi>Danes</hi> may be thought of by impartial
judges of theſe things for his inexcuſable proceeding,
they can neither reap any advantage thereby, nor cauſe
any damage to the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> or render its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
worſe. For though by the Principles of Philoſophy,
whoſoever has promiſed any thing by force or fear, ſeems
to be bound to it in ſtrictneſs of Law: Yet ſince the
Ancients have been of opinion, that <hi>ſummum jus</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
injurious, and that the Law of Nature abhors an
unjuſt force or conſtraint; no Prince ought to be bound
by this <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> when accompanied with force, but
rather reſtored to what has been forced from him, which
the following words of <hi>Grotius</hi> explain and confirm. <hi>I am
wholly of the opinion of thoſe, who believe, that laying aſide the
Civil Law, (by which the Obligation may be taken away or
diminiſht) whoſoever has promiſed a thing through fear, is
bound, becauſe he has given his abſolute conſent, and not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
one, as in the caſe of one that miſtakes. For as</hi>
Ariſtotle <hi>ſays very well, he that throws his goods into the Sea
for fear of Shipwrack, would willingly ſave them conditionally,</hi>
viz. <hi>if the danger was not imminent; but he is abſolutely content
to loſe them, conſidering the circumſtance of time and place. But
I eſteem this moſt true, if the man to whom the Promiſe is made,
has terrifyed <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he other not juſtly, but unjuſtly, though but a little,
and upon this has got a Promiſe, he to whom the promiſe was
made, is bound to releaſe him from it, if the other deſires it;
not becauſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Promiſe is of no force, but for the injury done.</hi>
L. 2. de Jure B. &amp; P. c. 11. n. 7. He explains theſe laſt
words thus in another place; <hi>He that has by cunning, force,
or unjuſt fear, obtained from another a Contract or Promiſe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61869:26"/>
is bound to releaſe the Perſon of his ſaid Contract; for he had
a right neither to be deceived, nor to be forced; the firſt by
the nature of Contracts, the other by the Liberty of Nature.</hi>
Lib. 2. de Jure B. &amp; P. c. 17. n. 17. And he repeats the
ſame, <hi>lib. 3. c. 19. n.</hi> 4. 10. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> can ſo
much the leſs deny this right of Reſtitution to the Houſe
of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> becauſe he himſelf would have challenged the
ſame right when it was his own caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For his Majeſty
having extorted from the Duke, by meer force, all he
thought fit, his Highneſs was reproached, that he had
gotten theſe things before by force, and the Arms of an
Enemy, and had given juſt cauſe conſequently to the
King to repoſſeſs himſelf the ſame way; It will then be
very juſt, that the King ſuffer the Duke to make uſe of the
ſame Law againſt his Majeſty, which he would have uſed
againſt his Highneſs, ſince this is a Rule of the Law of
Nature, which obliges all Princes without diſtinction. I
ſay the King would have made uſe of this Law againſt the
Duke, that having been forced to the Treaty in queſtion,
he ought to have been reſtored unto his Rights again.
But in this the <hi>Danes</hi> are very much miſtaken, that they
do not diſtinguiſh by what kind of force or fear one is
conſtrained, whether juſt or unjuſt; and have gone about
fooliſhly to perſwade themſelves and others, that the King
had recovered the Soveraignty of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
the ſame way he had loſt it. For as Juſtice offers
Reſtitution with both hands to a man, forced unjuſtly to
a promiſe or grant; ſo it denies it flatly to one juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Therefore when any one has himſelf been the cauſe
of his being compelled to promiſe o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> give, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it the ſame way, having loſt his right of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by giving a juſt cauſe to the other, who has
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61869:27"/>
juſtly employed a juſt force. <hi>Grot. lib. 2. c. 17. n.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>11. This Reſtitution due upon ſo many accounts,
ought not to be denied, becauſe of the great Evils and
dangerous Errours which may ſpring from ſuch a denial.
For if we take the Treaty of <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
we ſhall find the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> deprived of
all his Royalties, and the King alone inveſted with them,
and all ſubmitted to his Pleaſure. For the King alone
having undertaken the defence of both Dukedoms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
all the Dukes Treaties null, deprived him of his
Souldiers, demoliſht his Towns and Forts, detained him
againſt his will in Cuſtody, raiſed ſuch great Taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Lands, that his Highneſs and his Subjects have
nothing remaining; whence it is manifeſt that the Right
of Peace and War, and the other great Royalties, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from the Duke by this Treaty, or at leaſt ſo
much incroached upon, that all the Authority which he
might of right, and has hitherto, after the Example of his
Anceſtors, enjoyed and exerciſed, is now in the King
alone, and at his diſpoſe, under whoſe power and pleaſure
his Highneſs muſt hereafter live, under the Notion of a
Client or Vaſſal, but really as a Subject. So heretofore
the <hi>Latins</hi> complained, <hi>That under the colour of a League
with the</hi> Romans <hi>they lived in Slavery; and the</hi> Achaians,
<hi>that their League was now become a precarious Slavery;</hi> and,
as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>A miſerable Slavery was now falſly called
Peace.</hi> And though <hi>Proculus</hi> be of opinion, that free
Tenants are not under the Dominion or Subjection of
the Patron, yet when a Prince or People come under the
Protection of a Superiour Prince or People, we know by
experience that a fall is eaſie in ſlippery ground, and that
the Tenantſhip is ſoon changed into a ſoft Slavery, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61869:27"/>
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has the more reaſon to fear and avoid;
For that the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Power reaching from the
further part of <hi>Norway,</hi> as far as <hi>Holland,</hi> is very great,
and that under the pretence of the Union at the Treaty of
<hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> vainly called by the Name of <hi>Pragmatick
Sanction,</hi> an occaſion may be taken to oppreſs or ſuppreſs
the Authority and Dignity of the Houſe of <hi>Gottorp.</hi>
Who ever ſaw a Soveraign Prince without Royalties?
Who can ſhew a Duke of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> thus wholly diveſted
of his high Prerogatives? If the Dukes of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> are to
be inveſted hereafter by giving them a Banner, and with
the Ceremony obſerved at <hi>Ottenwaldt</hi> in 1580, will not
that be a Proclaiming of them Subjects with the greater
Pomp only, and telling the world by this Inveſtiture, how
proud they are of this Subjection? If the Dukes of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi>
were caſt into this condition or abandoned in it, and
on the contrary, the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> might govern at
their Pleaſure the Dukedomes of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi>
and that part of them alſo which belongeth to the Duke,
what an augmentation of Power would that be to them,
and how might they abuſe it if ever they would make uſe
of it againſt <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſpecially the Circle of the
<hi>Lower-Saxony?</hi> This may be made out by an exact account
of the vaſt ſums of mony, and all other things they have
extorted in a little time from thoſe Provinces; it is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
credible how great the ſums are. And we know well
enough what an ambitious Example they have ſhown,
and there is no queſtion but opportunity and power will
invite others to follow them. Therefore Prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
rather that the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> ſhould be in time
reſtored to his former condition, and all his Rights, than
that ſo many Princes, Provinces, and Towns, be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61869:28"/>
by his Ruin, which will be eaſily prevented, if the
injury now done to his Highneſs be looked upon by every
one of them as done to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe we ſhould grant that the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has
effectually bound himſelf by the conditions of <hi>Rendsbourg</hi>
to a Vaſſalage for the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> (which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
we yet conſtantly deny as falſe;) yet the delay of
demanding the Inveſtiture cannot be imputed to the
Duke, but to the King alone: for who does not know
that the Strong-holds of <hi>Tonningen</hi> and <hi>Holme</hi> are ſeated
in the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick?</hi> And the King without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his Word, having razed them both, taken away
the Garriſons and all the Artillery, kept the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
in his Caſtle of <hi>Gottorp;</hi> and all this relating to the
Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> hath not the Duke juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that all theſe Grievances be firſt redreſſed, and
ſatisfaction be made to him for them? If he had done
otherwiſe, and blindly asked the Inveſtiture, truſting
himſelf to the Kings pleaſure, there had never been any
notice taken of the old and new Grievances, and his
Highneſs had raſhly ſubmitted himſelf to a Vaſſalage,
that had deprived him and his Poſterity of all his Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and expoſed them to the eternal Scorn of the world.
Beſides, ſince it was ſuggeſted to the Dukes Ambaſſadors
ſent to <hi>Copenhaguen</hi> about the Fief and Grievances, that
they would do well to return to his Highneſs for new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
about the Fief, without expecting any Orders
from him; the King had certainly no cauſe given him
for Sequeſtrations, and thoſe other acts of Hoſtility com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by his Order in the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick.</hi> And
ſo we muſt not yield that the King, by doing Acts by
which the Lord of a Fief uſes to loſe his Right, ſhould take
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61869:28"/>
away anothers Right; and not only gain by the Ruin of
the other, but even by what ought to turn to his own loſs,
contrary to the Laws of Nature; Nations, Feudal, and all
others whatſoever. <hi>Eric</hi> Duke of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> having left
after his Death his Son <hi>Waldemar</hi> a Child, <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>
the Second King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> poſſeſſed himſelf of that
Guardian-ſhip of <hi>Waldemar,</hi> and at the ſame time of the
whole Territory of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> except <hi>Gottorp,</hi> which when
he alſo beſieged to gain the whole Dutchy, <hi>Gerhard</hi> Earl
of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> Unkle to <hi>Waldemar,</hi> with ſome others, oppos'd
him ſtoutly, and for this Felony committed by the King in
1326, there was great Debate, which <hi>Meurſius</hi> thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates;
<hi>The Dukedom of</hi> Sleſwick <hi>having been held till then
as a Fief from</hi> Denmark, <hi>and theſe Princes by reaſon of this
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Kings, being unwilling it ſhould continue
ſo hereafter, was the occaſion of a long Contention, lib. 4. p.</hi> 70,
which ended, as we have ſaid before. If this demand in
the Name of <hi>Waldemar</hi> was not unreaſonable, with how
much more Juſtice doth our Duke deſire that he might
have his own, and a full Reſtitution from the King of what
he detains from him ſo unjuſtly, and has Sequeſtrated by
meer force; and God Almighty having ordered Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be made where Covenants are broken, it is but
juſt that his Vice-gerents upon Earth ſhould endeavour to
put his Decrees in Execution.</p>
                  <p>13. If we look upon his Sequeſtration rightly, and
examine it by the Rules of Juſtice, we ſhall find it wholly
void by Law. For it was neither done by any Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Parties, nor by any Judicial Authority. The
<hi>Danes,</hi> I preſume, will confeſs the former, and the other we
do not queſtion but to make them alſo agree to. The
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having made himſelf Plaintiff againſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61869:29"/>
the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> in the buſineſs of the Dukedome of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> his Majeſty cannot be a Judge in the ſame cauſe:
Which is explained by ſeveral Civilians, <hi>Ad. Tit. Cod.
Nequis in ſuâ cauſâ judicet vel jus ſibi dicat;</hi> that is to ſay,
<hi>Let no man be Judge in his own Caſe, or do himſelf juſtice.</hi>
And this muſt not be underſtood, as if the Poſitive <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Law only (by which the <hi>Danes</hi> are not bound) did
prohibite any one to be Judge in his own cauſe, for the
Law of Nature dictates the ſame, and right reaſon which
obliges all the world, proclaims it. <hi>Men blinded by their
affections do not ſee the truth in their own affairs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle.</hi>
And for this reaſon the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
conſented heretofore, that all Diſputes about this
Fief ſhould be determined by Impartial Judges, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the contents of the Treaty of Union, and that
both parties ſhould abſtain from haſty Sequeſtrations,
<hi>Ord. jud. prov. part. 3. tit.</hi> 3. A judicial Sequeſtration
being thus prohibited, becauſe it is a kind of Execution
wherewith a State ought not to begin; This Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> cannot certainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by any Law, nor by any Judicial Authority, nor
by a previous cognizance of the cauſe, upon which a juſt
Sentence had followed, but only by the way of violence
and abſolute force; by which the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> has
been thrown out of a certain Poſſeſſion and all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
and an uſurped Poſſeſſion transfer'd by pure Fact
upon the Sequeſtrator, againſt the nature of all Judicial
Sequeſtrations, which are made uſe of only for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
keeping of things: ſo that this pretended Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is really a violent ſpoil committed by the King (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with more than one Army) upon the Duke naked
and diſarmed: Now it is the Opinion of all wiſe men,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61869:29"/>
that a perſon who has been ſpoiled, ought firſt of all to
be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>14. And this Reſtitution is ſo much the more earneſtly
to be preſſed, as this Sequeſtration may be dangerous
both in Temporals and Spirituals. For the King having
ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded, that he could abſolve
the common people, Prieſts, and Magiſtrates, Subjects to
the Duke in the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> from the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
they have ſworn to their Prince, he has cauſed
ſometimes one, and ſometimes another to be carried away
by Souldiers from their habitations, and from their Sacred
and Civil Functions, and ſome to <hi>Rend<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bourgh</hi> (where
this whole Tragedy was begun, and where they have
been put in Priſon, at leaſt detained for ſome time.) Thoſe
of the Dukes Officers and Subjects, that have ſeen and
underſtood all that hath paſſed between the King and the
Duke, muſt needs know, that his Majeſty has indeed a
great Power over his Subjects, but none over thoſe of
other Princes; at leaſt not ſuch a one as can free them
from their Oath to God, and Allegiance to his Highneſs;
eſpecially whilſt the matter in difference is not onely
doubtful, but before no Judicial Court, much leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
Nay, they know that they are bound to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
rather the greateſt Miſeries, and the loſs of their whole
Fortunes, than to act againſt their own Conſciences and
Oaths, or do any thing to the prejudice of their Prince,
leſt they ſhould provoke the Anger of God, and the
Dukes juſt Revenge; no obedience being due to any
body, that gives ſentence out of his own Territory, where
he has no Juriſdiction. <hi>L. Vel. ff. de Juriſd.</hi> And if others
frighted with the noiſe of an Army, or the fear of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Evils, renounce their Allegiance, let them conſider how
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61869:30"/>
they enſnare their Conſciences, if not expoſe themſelves
to the puniſhments for Perjury and Perfidiouſneſs. To
prevent which, let a full and quick Reſtitution take away
this illegal Sequeſtration.</p>
                  <p>15. The King cauſed this Sequeſtration of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> to be Proclaimed with a Threatning of
Deprivation. It is apparent from what has been ſaid, that
this Sequeſtration is ſuch, executed with that Rigour, as
if the Duke was actually deprived and deveſted of the
Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick;</hi> though this Deprivation be as
unjuſt and violent as the Sequeſtration. How can the
Authors of ſuch Counſels be ſufficiently wondred at, by
thoſe that remember, that a Fief is a Contract obliging
both Parties, and that the Obligation between the
Lord and his Vaſſal is as reciprocal, as that between
Husband and Wife, ſaith <hi>Cujacius.</hi> Therefore, as a
Vaſſal promiſes to his Lord upon Oath to perform truly,
ſafely, ſecurely, honeſtly, well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo alſo doth the
Lord to the Vaſſal, and is oblig'd to fulfil it; if he doth
the contrary, he is declared of no Faith, Perjur'd and
Perfidious by the Feudal <hi>Longobardick</hi> Law, 2 <hi>Feud.</hi> 6.
Thence it is that all Felony which deprives a Vaſſal of a
Fief, d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>prives the Lord alſo of the Propriety thereof, if
committed by him, and confers it upon the Vaſſal; moſt
eſpecially if the Lord ſpoils him, that holds a Fief
from him, of his Forts, wherein he may keep himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
much more: if the Lord demoliſhes and deſtroys
them to the ground; If he uſes the Vaſſal and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
ill, charges them with Impoſts and Taxes, and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
them; if he lays Siege to the Vaſſals Caſtle, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his place of habitation: If the Lord bereaves him
of the Fief by his own Authority, without cognizance of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61869:30"/>
the cauſe, and judgment thereupon; or if judging the
cauſe himſelf, he alienates the ſame: For though the Lord
accuſe his Vaſſal of having done ſome act deſerving De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
yet he is not to be abſolutely believed, though
he be a Supreme Prince, ſaith <hi>Vult<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In a word, to repeat the proper Terms of the Law, <hi>If the
Lord enters into the Fief by a bad way,</hi> that is to ſay, as Baron
<hi>Schenkius</hi> explains it, <hi>ad lib. 2. F<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o Poſſeſsion not by the way of the
Law or Juſtice, but by Violence.</hi> For in ſuch a caſe, if he
refuſes wholly to reſtore the Fief, and what belongs to it,
he may be forced to it by the way of Arms. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if the Lord and Vaſſals are to be judged in the ſame
manner, according to the opinion of all <hi>Feudiſts;</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath loſt all his Right long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he had any, in that part of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
which belongs to the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi> and the Duke
ought to be Reſtored againſt the King, according to all
Laws.</p>
                  <p>16. For the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> having received this
Dukedome with the greateſt Right, and in the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
manner, free from all Vaſſalage, and obtain'd and
kept at a very chargable rate the Soveraign Dominion
thereof by the ſo often repeated conſent of the King and
States of <hi>Denmark;</hi> the unjuſt Convention at <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi>
cannot ſavour the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s cauſe in this, nor
take away the leaſt part of the Dukes Soveraign Power
in the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick.</hi> This forced Agreement
his Majeſty himſelf having not a little receded from, and
firſt broken, by demoliſhing the ſtrong Towns, in which,
by this very Agreement, he was only to put a Garriſon
for a while, and then to reſtore them: carrying away the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61869:31"/>
Dukes Miniſters Priſoners, who had already bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the King by the Allegiance he required from
them; reducing the Dukes Subjects to the laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
though his Majeſty had promiſed before, that not a
Hen ſhould be touched, and other like things; by which
things his Majeſty ſeems not to deſire the ſaid Treaty
ſhould remain in force.</p>
                  <p>17. Laſtly, an entire Reſtitution being the common
refuge of Princes and Commonwealths, to which they
have recourſe in their Afflictions, the Duke of <hi>Sleſwick</hi>
cannot be excluded from this Priviledge of all Mankind.
For though in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> Reſtitution
was to be demanded from the <hi>Pretor</hi> within a certain time;
this and the like are only Pleas of the Civil Law. Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
abſolutely conſidered, is grounded upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Equity, which takes its Original from the pureſt
Springs of the Law of Nature; and is ſo much the fitter
for injured Princes and free Nations, as it is more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
to provide for the ſafety of Commonwealths than of
private men. For why ſhould not a Prince, as well or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a private Perſon, be reſtored unto all his Rights,
if he has been deceiv'd or injur'd by fraud; force, unjuſt
fear, or the like? Certainly there is no reaſon againſt it,
Equity requires this remedy for both. Neither is it limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to theſe alone, but it is applicable as often as there is
any cauſe of Reſtitution. <hi>L. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. ff. de reſtit. in integ.
Natural Equity it ſelf requires, that a man deceived in any
thing, where others ought to have proceeded with ſincerity, be
fully reſtored, eſpecially ſince by ſuch deceits whatever is done,
is anaulled,</hi> ſaith a great Lawyer.</p>
                  <p>Now, who muſt reſtore the Duke unto all his Rights?
What hath been ſaid before doth furniſh us with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61869:31"/>
The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who has unjuſtly injur'd
the Duke, is beyond all others obliged to do it in the
Court of Equity and Conſcience, which demands as
ready an obedience, as the King himſelf doth from his
Subjects. <hi>For thoſe that do an ill act knowingly, or are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to it, are to be put in the number of thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
go to Heaven without Repentance. And true Repentance
requires abſolutely, if there be time and power, that he that has
done the Injury make ſatisfaction for it, Grot. lib. 3. de
J. B. &amp; P. c. 10. n.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. From whence it appears
too, that the King ought not only to reſtore what he hath
extorted from the Duke at <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> and afterwards,
but make good alſo thoſe damages his Highneſs and his
Subjects have ſuffered by the War, and the occaſion of
it. What if the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> for reaſon of State,
excepting againſt this Court, refuſes to reſtore the Duke?
Firſt, I ſay, that the great God is Judge, and the truth
of his word will not ſo eaſily wear away as the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Coyn upon which it is ſtamped. Beſides, the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
would give the Duke juſt reaſon to endeavour to right
himſelf. <hi>If an unj<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſt fear cauſed by another, has forced any
one to make a Promiſe, he that hath promiſed may demand
Reſtitution, and, if denyed, may take it himſelf, Grot. lib. 3.
de J. B. &amp; P. c. 23. n.</hi> 2. When any one demands ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from his Fellow-Subject, the Authority of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
muſt be employed as Superiour, to force the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.
And ſo in the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<hi>Pretor</hi> having heard the cauſe, was wont to order Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
But when a Prince muſt be reſtored againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prince, that is Soveraign as well as he, and his
Equal, the injur'd Prince, or any for him, may perform
the Office of <hi>Pretor,</hi> uſe all means to procure a full and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61869:32"/>
ample Reparation of his damages. If the Duke of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp</hi>
is not ſtrong enough to do it himſelf, all Chriſtian
Princes and Commonwealths muſt make this cauſe theirs,
and employ all their Power to reſtore him; <hi>For Wars
may be undertook not only for Friends and Allies, but for men,
as ſuch, if they are barbarouſly injured. Grot. lib. 3. de I. B. &amp;
P. c. 25. n. 1. &amp; ſeq.</hi> And who is more injur'd than he,
who by a Couſin of the ſame Family, his near Ally, and
Brother, againſt his Faith ſo many times ſworn, is ſo ill
uſed, as to be deprived of all his Authority and Dignity?
Therefore ſince other Princes are not a little concerned,
when the condition of any Prince is brought ſo low, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all Juſtice, and when perhaps his entire ruin is
endeavoured, eſpecially if theſe baſe Counſels proceed
from Miniſters, who in their actions and ſpeeches, have
no regard to the great Aſſerter of Faith, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leſs to Faith it ſelf, the foundation of Juſtice, and the
tie of all human Societies; all Princes and States ought
firſt of all to take care, that Faith be kept inviolable,
and Treaties and Contracts between them be not violated,
leſt this tie of Friendſhip and Society being broke, the
world ſhould fall into confuſion by their c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the time decreed by Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe Princes and States are chiefly obliged to
take care of this Reſtitution, who have guaranted the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torp,</hi>
and have ſigned the Inſtruments of Peace between
<hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and that of <hi>Roſchild</hi> and <hi>Oliva,</hi>
engaging for the performance of them in ſuch terms and
expreſſions, that if they were meant, as they are ſet down,
(which is not at all to be doubted,) no man but will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they intend to perform their Promiſes. And to

induce them thereunto without any delay, let the great
danger of this example, and the greatneſs of the Injuries
be conſidered; and that it is alſo the earneſt requeſt of

                  <p>VVe were extreamly troubled to hear of the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
lately ariſen between your Majeſty and Our good
Couſin the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> for the nearneſs and tie of
Blood and common Intereſts between you; and therefore
out of the Affection VVe bear to both your Families, and
the good and advantage of the ſame, VVe did almoſt
a Year ago offer our Mediation and good Offices between
you; and VVe had long ſince charged Our Miniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding
at your Court to do it more ſolemnly, if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Envoy reſiding with Us had not induced and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
Us, as in favour of himſelf; that all VVe ſhould
reſolve to do therein, might be done through his hands,
which We the rather conſented to then, becauſe he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61869:44"/>
charged himſelf ſeriouſly to repreſent to your Majeſty
the offers VVe made of Our Offices and Mediation. But
your Majeſty having not hitherto ſent Us any direct
Anſwer thereunto, and your ſaid Envoy having only by
the by inſinuated to Us, that your Majeſty rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
that ſince this Affair ſeemed to be purely Domeſtick,
and concerned only the private Intereſts of two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſame Blood, it might be left to be determined
among your ſelves; VVe hoped not to have found your
Majeſty in this mind which VVe perceive by your Envoys
diſcourſe, you are of: However, VVe cannot but, out
of the deſire VVe have to reconcile two Princes that are
of a Blood, ſo nearly Related to Us, and for other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
(which induce Us to concern Our Selves with
a more ſpecial care in this matter, than perhaps VVe
ſhould otherwiſe) repeat again in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the firſt Offer of Our Mediation and good Offices,
not doubting but that your Majeſty, after having ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
reflected upon the thing, will think fit to admit of
Our good Offices and Mediation, which you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
VVe ſhall always apply on all occaſions which
may concern your Majeſty, in ſuch manner, as you have
reaſon to expect from the mutual Friendſhip between
Us, of which VVe ſhall always give your Majeſty thoſe
Proofs and Arguments which you can deſire, <hi>&amp;c.

                  <p>By your Majeſties Letters of the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> laſt paſt,
VVe have underſtood more at large what Reaſons induced
you to offer Us your Mediation and good Offices for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the Differences ariſing between Us and Our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
and Kinſman <hi>Chriſtian Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Holſtein.</hi> This
Offer of your Majeſties has been the more pleaſing to Us,
becauſe VVe do not doubt at all, but it proceeds from a
ſincere and Brotherly affection towards Us; and We put
ſo great a truſt in your Friendſhip, that if there were place
for any Mediation in theſe Differences, VVe would as
readily accept of your Interpoſition for the compoſing of
them, as VVe have accepted of the ſame in the preſent
Negotiation for an Univerſal Peace, which We have
conſtantly endeavour'd ſhould remain ſolely in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
But the Diſputes and Controverſies complained
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61869:45"/>
of by the Duke of <hi>Gottorp</hi> to your Majeſty, being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon no other foundation than his endeavours to lay
aſide all the Alliances and Treaties which have ſubſiſted
for many Ages betwixt Our Royal Predeceſſors and his,
and eſpecially that which he Voluntarily made with Us
at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and approved ſeveral times after, and ſo
to free himſelf from all thoſe ties, by which he is bound
to Us as a Vaſſal of Our Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Our
Dukedoms of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and <hi>Holſtein</hi> are united together,
hoping after the Example of his Father, (who in the laſt
unhappy VVar ſupported by the Arms of the King of
<hi>Sweden</hi> his Son-in-Law, and by the favour and unjuſt
Authority of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Uſurper <hi>Cromwell,</hi> without any
reſpect of his obligations to Our Kingdom, under colour
of ſome frivolous and groundleſs pretenſions, extorted
moſt unjuſt, and almoſt intolerable conditions from Our

and perfect his pernicious deſigns and unjuſt
attempts, in theſe troubleſome times, as well by the help
of his Neighbours Armes as your Majeſties Authority.
The Truth hereof appears alſo by this, that though VVe
have divers times propoſed to his Dilection, to reſtore
him unto the former condition of his Anceſtors, if he
would keep to the aforeſaid Treaties, and fulfil their
Tenor, he does not ceaſe nevertheleſs to complain of
Force, and to ſollicite the help and ſuccours of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and States, to finiſh thoſe unjuſt Enterpriſes he has
propoſed to himſelf. From whence your Majeſty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

VVe can, without the greateſt prejudice to Our
Rights, recede from the ancient Treaties, and thoſe which
have been made between Us and the Duke of <hi>Gottorp,</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:61869:45"/>
upon which the ſafety of Our Kingdoms and Dominions
in great meaſure depends, or ſuffer them to be diſputed,
and thereby expoſe Our Selves to new and everlaſting
Differences and Quarrels; eſpecially ſince it is expreſly
covenanted by the ſaid Treaties, that if any diſputes ſhall
hereafter ariſe, they ſhall not be compoſed by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of other Princes, but by other friendly and amicable
means. For theſe and other Reaſons which we have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Our Envoy Extraordinary, Reſident at your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Court, to repreſent more amply to your Majeſty,
We do not doubt in the leaſt, but your Majeſty will not
only think it wholly unjuſt, that We ſhould conſent to
ſuch prejudicial Treaties, and ſo contrary to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Conventions and Domeſtick agreements, but alſo
that by vertue of the Alliances VVe have with your
Majeſty, by which each of Us is obliged to promote the
good of the other, and to keep all dangers from him,
your Majeſty will compel the aforeſaid Duke to a better
and more exact obſervance and execution of the Ancient
Treaties, and all others, to the performance whereof he
has bound himſelf, and ſeriouſly diſſuade him from his
uſual pernicious deſigns againſt Us. The many proofs
VVe have of your Juſtice, and your experienced com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
Conſtancy and Faithfulneſs in keeping your

by them, that his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> does indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your Majeſties offers of Mediation for compoſing
Our Controverſies, but in reality ſhews an averſion
thereunto, and declines it as unneceſſary, endeavouring
to demonſtrate the ſame by colouring his Actions with
the ſpecious pretence of ancient and late Treaties, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
Our Lord and Father, and Us with a great many
things. Theſe Letters being full of ſuch complaints,
VVe cannot but defend Our Innocence, and free Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from ſuch accuſations, by letting your moſt Serene
Majeſty underſtand Our Reaſons, why the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Us and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
out of the Negotiations for an Univerſal Peace, not
indeed can be debated any-where elſe without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and prejudice to Us. VVe have been ſo obſerving
of the ancient Treaties and Alliances, that for ſeveral

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61869:46"/>
VVe are not by any Treaties to be oppreſſed by thoſe who
are obliged by Vertue of Our Alliances to defend Us, nor
are VVe to ſubmit Our Selves to a voluntary Slavery, but

Let the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> but conſider how they could
make VVars upon VVars, and involve the Dukes of

conditions, (which the very way of proceeding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
to be null). Therefore VVe are ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to them freely and voluntarily, that VVe have
never ſo much as freely ratified them. For thoſe things
that are done by force, and through fear, may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made valid by a ſubſequent free conſent; yet no
conſent is to be eſteemed ſuch, except the perſon who is
ſaid to have conſented freely, be firſt ſet at full liberty:
when on the contrary, fear once cauſed in any tranſaction
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61869:47"/>
is ſuppoſed to continue ſtill: and VVe were the more
diſturbed thereby, becauſe VVe were by the King depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all good Counſels, Our Principal Miniſters being
violently carried away Priſoners to <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> and the
reſt frighted from Us by this unheard-of Example. The
Soveraignty of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> purchaſed with
a very good Title, and at a dear rate, was yielded up to
Our Houſe by <hi>Frederick</hi> the Third King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
by his own free and often repeated conſent, and has been
quietly poſſeſſed by Us for above Sixteen years; neither
is it any matter, that it was obtained partly by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Succeſſes of the Arms of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſince it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
true, that VVars may be made not only for
O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r own good, but for the good of others, and that the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was then juſtly provoked to take up Arms
againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> and that if the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> has
ſuffered any force, it being but juſt, he cannot pretend to
any Right of Reſtitution. VVe cannot like wiſe conceal,
that by this and the foregoing Wars made by the Kings
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> VVe have contracted many great Debts;
and Our Subjects are ſo exhauſted by Contributions, that
part of them have been forced to quit the Country, and
the reſt are glad if they can get the coarſeſt ſort of Bread
to eat. Now when VVe quitted, by the laſt Treaty,
all Our pretenſions of ſatisfaction from the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
in conſideration of the Soveraignty which was yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to Us; what have we got, I pray, that any one
ſhould envy Us for? It is the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> only is
the gainer, who by that opportunity got the Soveraignty
of that part of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> which is his, and
thereby ſoon after an occaſion of getting the Monarchy of
the whole Kingdom. Therefore, ſince that Our Lord and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61869:47"/>
Father was by ſo many Solemn and publick Treaties ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
freed from the tie of Vaſſalage and Homage, it
cannot certainly be imputed to him, that he had without
any regard of his Alliance to the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
extorted the Soveraignty of the ſaid Dukedome, unleſs
the King will ſlight all the Treaties of Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
that have been made upon that occaſion, and by
his Example incite the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> nay
his own Subjects to repoſſeſs themſelves of their loſt
Provinces, and Ancient Rights and Authorities, as ſoon as
they ſhall have an occaſion and power to do it. We do
with all gratitude acknowledge your Majeſties favour,
that beſides the general Guaranty of all the conditions of
the Peace at <hi>Roſchild,</hi> you have been pleaſed to oblige
your Self to a ſpecial one for the Preſervation and Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Soveraignty. It is without any ground the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> pretends, that VVe obtained the
Soveraignty by the favour of <hi>Cromwell</hi> only: For beſides,
that the good Offices and Mediations of other Kings and
States intervened in this Affair, and the concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
VVe do not well conceive how the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
can ſhow which of the Uſurpers Acts your Majeſty is
pleaſed to hold <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or good, and which not: For it will not
conſiſt with reaſon of State, and the publick good, that
they ſhould be all annulled. Nay, if the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
will be pleaſed to look into the circumſtances of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he will find that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who Reſided
at that time at <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> was unknown to the King of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> brought to his Majeſty by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
and by them Sollicited to employ his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
for a Peace. It appears from hence, that all Our
Complaints of the great Injuries We have ſuſtained by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61869:48"/>
the <hi>Danes</hi> are juſt, and that We never deſigned any thing
to the Kings prejudice, but that what may perhaps have
diſpleaſed his Majeſty, was ſolely intended for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Our Houſe and Dominions, which is every way
lawful; and therefore VVe are moſt unjuſtly reproached
of intending and having ſuch pernitious Deſigns, ſince
we have only ſought for a lawful Defence againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
Domination and Oppreſſion. VVhich things being
thus, as your moſt Serene Majeſty may be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
informed by a deduction we have lately cauſed to
be Printed of this whole Affair, or by Our Envoy Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Reſiding in <hi>London,</hi> we hope nothing will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more reaſonable, than that we ſhould be admitted
into the Treaty for an univerſal Peace, and that your
moſt Serene Majeſties Mediation ſhould not be rejected
by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> eſpecially ſince he ſeems wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to admit of the good Offices of other Princes of the
Empire. Neither will their Objection, as if the matters
between the King and us were purely Domeſtick, be any
ways material; ſeeing it is known by all the world, that
a Peace confirmed by ſo many Proteſtations, was broken,
and no regard had of any Domeſtick conſiderations; and
therefore your Majeſties Mediation is declined, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reaſon, but that which makes Criminals fly from
their Tryals. For your Majeſty will by what follows ſee,
how improper a Jury of Sixteen men (as they call it) is
to decide this Domeſtick buſineſs. In the year 1533, a
Treaty was made between the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> and
the Dukedom, and between the Princes and States of
both, which uſually bears the name of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> and
among other things, a certain form of Judicature was
agreed upon, according to which all the Controverſie,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61869:48"/>
that ſhould ariſe between the two Princes, or between
them and the States, ought to be determined; <hi>viz. That
the differences between them ſhould be left to the Arbitration of
Sixteen Counſellors, to be in equal number named by both
Parties.</hi> And though by the Articles of this Treaty a very
ample power ſeems to be given to theſe Judges, of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and deciding all ſorts of cauſes; yet we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that ever diſputes of Moment, and about the
Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> were brought to them, but they
have always been left to the Mediation of Forrein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For there is not only not a word in this Treaty, by
which it may appear that theſe Princes have renounced all
other Judgments and Arbitrations; but the expreſs words
of it, as well as the uſage and cuſtom, (which is the beſt
interpreter of Laws and Treaties) have confined the Power
of this Tribunal of Sixteen men, to affairs of leſſer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
That is to ſay, when the complaint concerns
any Lands or private Subjects. Therefore, not long after
the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> made, ſeveral Tranſactions have been about
the Fief of the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> firſt at <hi>Coldinga
1547,</hi> and then by the Interpoſition of the Elector of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrick</hi> Duke of <hi>Mecklenbourgh,</hi> and <hi>William
Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi> at <hi>Odenſea 1557;</hi> though nothing
was then agreed on: but at laſt 1579, in the ſame place,
it was expreſly provided by a ſolemn Convention, <hi>That
if there ſhould happen any diſpute about the Succeſſion to the
Dukedom of</hi> Sleſwick, <hi>which was not decided by this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
the Dukes of</hi> Sleſwick <hi>ſhould either themſelves,
or by the help of other Princes and Friends, endeavour
to compoſe the ſame, or that it might be determined by
a Judicial Sentence.</hi> Here is no mention of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Sixteen men, but rather all Controverſies, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61869:49"/>
may ariſe about the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words exempted without any contradiction from
the States. And therefore the queſtion about the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
is ſo much the leſs to be referred to their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
becauſe in that Age, wherein the <hi>Vnion</hi> was
made, ſuch a thing was not ſo much as thought of; and
therefore its Articles cannot extend to affairs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which are wholly above the condition of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
And though we can (without prejudice to Our
cauſe) allow, that ſometimes feudal differences about the
Dutchy of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> have been left to this ſort of Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which it ſeems may be done by the conſent of both
Princes,) yet there has happened ſo great a change in
the <hi>Daniſh</hi> affairs and Ours, that we cannot be forced
to conſent thereunto againſt Our will; and the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
can no longer be debated there, at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great inconvenience, becauſe ſuch Conſtitutions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
only in force, ſo long as the ſtate of publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
is the ſame and unalter'd; which being entirely
changed, as well in <hi>Denmark</hi> as in theſe Duckedomes,
and all the Power of the States of <hi>Denmark</hi> being devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unto the King and in his hand, and there being no
ſuch thing now as Senators of the Kingdom, who had
great Authority when the <hi>Vnion</hi> was made, it is not
reaſonable his Majeſty ſhould ſit as Judge in his own
cauſe; and that a matter of ſo great moment ſhould be
ſubmitted to the deciſion of thoſe, who, for fear of the
Kings Power, or to gain his favour, may be ſo much by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed,
that Our loſs may be irreparable. And therefore
ſeeing that amongſt free people and Princes, it has been
always allowed to refuſe to ſtand to the Arbitration of a
Judge juſtly ſuſpected, and that this preſent conjuncture
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61869:49"/>
of Affairs, as well as the Tranſaction at <hi>Odenſea,</hi> ſhows
Us another way, VVe earneſtly deſire your moſt Serene
Majeſty will endeavour to prevail with the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
that Our Differences may be Treated of at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
that ſo We may find ſome Remedy abroad for thoſe
vaſt Damages and Injuries VVe have ſuſtained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
which VVe cannot hope for at home. For as the
Peace at <hi>Roſchild</hi> was made by the Interpoſition of ſeveral
Kings and States, ſo it is of publick concern, that it
ſhould be reſtored and confirmed by the like means. All
who think themſelves injur'd contrary to the Treaties of
<hi>Weſtphalia, Roſchild,</hi> and <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> have liberty to
come to <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> And why ſhould VVe who are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
contrary to all theſe Treaties, be hindred from it?
At <hi>Nimeguen</hi> a general Peace is Treated of; why ſhould
our cauſe then not be admitted there, who have without
all reaſon ſuffered moſt grievous injuries from the <hi>Danes,</hi>
and been almoſt undone by them? We ſuppoſe the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is not conſiderable, that none are to be admitted
there, but thoſe who have joined their Arms to either of
the Parties now in War. For if thoſe who were in a
condition to reſiſt Arms by Arms, and return Force by
Force, are admitted; with how much more reaſon ought
VVe to be received, who being deprived of all Our Arms
and other helps by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to endure all his affronts and injuries? VVe know
that the Laws of Nature and Nations are for Us, and we
do not think that any Prince will oppoſe it, but thoſe
who over-byaſſed by Partiality, or the deſire of their own
advantage, would have a Peace for themſelves and theirs
though at Our Coſt, and the loſs of Our Dignities and
Dominions; not reflecting that the ſum of Our Cauſe is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61869:50"/>
only, whether VVe ſhall become a Subject, or be a free
Prince again; and after Our Example, Whether the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes of the Empire muſt not hereafter rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Subjects than enjoy their ancient Rights of free
Princes. This being contrary to all Juſtice, to the
Treaties ſo often repeated, and ſo Religiouſly Sworn to,
to the common Intereſt of all Princes, and to the Honour
and Authority of your moſt Serene Majeſty, and other the
Princes who are Guarantees, VVe do earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Our Cauſe to their good VVill and juſt Affection,
and VVe have particularly great hopes in your moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Majeſties Equity and Protection. And if the King
of <hi>Denmark</hi> deſires to be admitted and heard at <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
ſure it cannot be upon any other Terms, than that
he muſt in all things ſtand to that Law which he intends
to uſe againſt others; and endure as patiently the juſt
Complaints of thoſe who have been highly injur'd by him,
preferred to that great Aſſembly, as he has perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
vigorouſly to proſecute others there. Nay, let
the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> be willing or not to accept of this
Mediation and Place, certainly VVe will rely ſo entirely
and conſtantly upon the Guaranty of the ſeveral Princes,
who have entred into it, and eſpecially upon the general
and particular one of your moſt Serene Majeſty, that
VVe had rather ſuffer any thing whatſoever, then be
forced away from that Sacred Anchor, being well aſſured,
that your Majeſty will employ your Authority as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that decline your Mediation, as for thoſe that
have accepted thereof; and that Our Reſtoration and
Safety will be ſecure and certain upon your moſt Serene
Majeſties Faith, which the Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> have
always Religiouſly kept to God and men. May it pleaſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61869:50"/>
God, that this Great Affair of the Peace may ſucceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Auſpices of your moſt Serene Majeſty, and to your
Immortal Praiſe, That every body may have his own,
and none be hereafter Injur'd. And ſo we moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recommend your moſt Serene Majeſty to his Grace
and Protection. <hi>Given at</hi> Hambourgh <hi>the firſt of</hi> Octob.

                  <p>IT is not unknown to your Dilection, what hitherto
hath paſt about the receiving of the Inveſtiture over
the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> whereunto you have
obliged your Self by the late Agreement of <hi>Rends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh;</hi>
and how your Dilection ſince that time, upon
Our ſeveral well-meant Admonitions, by divers Letters
directed to Us, hath promiſed the performance thereof;
and in order thereunto, ſent hither ſome of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who nevertheleſs under the pretext of going for
ſome more particular inſtructions from your Dilection, are
lately parted again from hence, without having diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing at all. And whereas We have hitherto in
vain expected their promiſed return; the time likewiſe
at the ſaid Agreement of <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi> appointed for the
receiving of the above-mentioned Inveſtiture being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſt in the Month of <hi>July</hi> laſt, beſides divers other
Terms ſince indulg'd which are long ago expired; We alſo
having a ſufficient and true information of thoſe moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Machinations, which your Dilection hath in hand
againſt Us and Our State; and beſides, it being very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
that VVe carefully do mind what is neceſſary for
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61869:55"/>
the preſerving of this Inveſtiture, depending upon Us and
Our Crown of <hi>Denmark:</hi> Therefore have VVe found
Our Selves unavoidably, and as it were againſt Our will
obliged, now to Sequeſtrate that part of the ſaid Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
wherewith your Dilections Anceſtors have been
heretofore Inveſted; and to iſſue out a Commiſſion to
ſome of Our Counſellors and Officers there reſiding, for
putting in Execution the ſaid Sequeſtration, and for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
all that is neceſſary to be done about the ſame.
Since therefore We would rather have deſired any thing
elſe, than to come to this Extremity, VVe have thought
good to give notice of this Our Reſolution to your Dilecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to appoint yet, out of a ſuper-abundance, another

that already ſome days before had been publiſhed by
ſome Letters Patents affix'd in Our Dukedome of <hi>Sleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,
viz.</hi> That your Majeſty hath been induced to
Sequeſtrate that part of the ſaid Dukedom, which
doth belong to Us, and to nominate to that effect
certain Commiſſaries, with the annexed warning, that
in caſe we did not within Six weeks, from the date
of the ſaid Letter, effectually accompliſh the receiving
of the Inveſtiture over that Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi>
your Majeſty would proceed <hi>ad ipſam Privationem
Feudi,</hi> or the cutting of the Feif, and take ſuch
further courſes as the <hi>Feudal Laws</hi> do allow of,
being moved thereunto by theſe Reaſons: That
We in the point of the receiving of the ſaid Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither had performed that ſo called late Agreement
of <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> nor the Promiſes made by Our
Letters under Our own hand, nor ſent back our
Miniſters, who without any diſpatch of Affairs were
gone from <hi>Copenhaguen;</hi> but that on the contrary we had
in hand moſt dangerous, and, by a ſingular accident,
diſcovered machinations againſt your Majeſty, and your
State; and had alſo, as it were, unavoidably obliged
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61869:56"/>
your Majeſty to the preſervation of your Majeſties and
the Crown of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Rights.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon we cannot but with all due reſpect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
this our Anſwer to your Majeſty, that for the ſake
of your Majeſty's own Glory, and high Reputation,
and your Realms and Dominions welfare, We have
moſt ardently deſired and wiſhed, that our thoughts at
the firſt ſeeing of your Majeſty's afore-mentioned
Letters Patents, (as if they might have been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without your knowledge) might have a ſure ground,
and your Majeſty ſuch a kindneſs for us, as not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
any longer our Perſecutors, but rather to put a
period to thoſe unuſual hard proceedings, which we
undeſervedly have ſuffered from them, and to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
and conſolidate that ancient tie and friendſhip, which
hath proved ſo uſeful and beneficial to both Great Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and their reſpective Kingdoms, Territories, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
ſeriouſly conſidering withal, that it cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable,
neither to the repute of your Majeſties innate
Generoſity, nor to your Majeſties Realms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

and never failed either in due Reſpects, or required
Faithfulneſs to your Majeſty,) thus oppreſſed, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a quite deſperate condition, without having been
able to obtain the leaſt redreſs, which yet lies ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
in your Majeſties own hands.</p>
                  <p>However, this is our only and eſpecial comfort in all
our daily encreaſing calamities, that your Majeſty by
your Letters doth furniſh us with an occaſion to make
our juſtification before your ſelf, and briefly to refute

in that State God Almighty hath been pleaſed to ſettle us
in, by making us a lawful Heir and Succeſſor to the Duke

ſame to our Poſterity, as we had got it. VVe our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
have not made that Agreement concluded at <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haguen</hi>
on the <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1658, but
have inherited thoſe Rights, which in due conſideration
of the manifold damages ſuſtained have thereby accrued
to our Family. And it is alſo known to the World, that
we have employed none at all at the Treaty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the reiterated Northern Peace in the Camp
for <hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> on the 27th. day of <hi>May</hi> in the year
1660, although we had then already taken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Us; and the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Copenhaguen</hi> hath
nevertheleſs been confirmed therein, and the Guaranty
thereof undertaken by the three moſt Puiſſant States of
Chriſtendom. And preſuppoſing his Majeſty the King
of <hi>Denmark, Frederick</hi> the Third, our moſt Honoured
Father-in-Law of glorious Memory, unwillingly and
againſt his mind, (which yet is altogether unknown
to us, ſince his Family as well as ours hath been benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby,) ſhould have proceeded to the granting of
that Sovereignty, and other advantages promiſed to our
Family; yet it was but a meer ſpontaneous Act; nay,
it hath been an evident token of his Royal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards us, that having obſerved by our Addreſſes
for a near Alliance of Marriage in his Royal Family, our
ſincere inclination towards him, his Majeſty in the year
1667, when the Contract of Marriage in his own Fortreſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61869:57"/>
at <hi>Gluckſtadt</hi> was a-making up, hath in all and the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Articles, Points and Clauſes, wholly, and to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
confirmed to us the aboveſaid Treaty of <hi>Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haguen,</hi>
grounded upon the Soveraignty over the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the ſame joyntly with
that ancient Union for a perpetual rule betwixt both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
with this engagement, and Royal firm Parol, that
himſelf and his hereditary Succeſſors in the Government,
neither directly nor indirectly would act, nor cauſe to be
acted againſt the ſame. But in what manner we have
ſince been dealt withal at <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> in the year 1675,
and how we have been conſtrained by a moſt troubleſome
detention to ſurrender our Fortreſſes, Artillery, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition

certain Articles have been preſcribed to our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and Counſellors remaining behind in Arreſt, and we
forced to the pretended Ratification thereof, even as we
were to the ſurrender of our Fortreſſes without any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
left us, only therein to alter things quite inconſiſtent
with the Dignity of a free <hi>German</hi> Prince of the Empire:
We are as unwilling to relate, as your Majeſty can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to hear, and ſhould alſo have forborn to mention it
either to your Majeſty, or to any others, if we were not
aſſured in our Conſcience that your Majeſty, out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Heroick Love to Juſtice, doth deteſt ſuch a way of
proceeding, and in that regard hath laid a Ground for
that high diſpleaſure your Majeſty thereupon conceived
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61869:57"/>
againſt him, who out of Reaſons unknown to us, hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
all that miſchief which then did befal us.</p>
                  <p>And ſince that time we have not been able to imagin,
that your Majeſty ſhould ever have intended, to ſet up
that ſo called Agreement of <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> proceeding
from ſuch derogatory and extorted Principles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
made void by Law, into a <hi>Pragmatical Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
after your Majeſty hath charged our Subjects with
ſuch Contributions as are intolerable, and do quite cut off
both our extraordinary and ordinary Revenues, and hath
quite demoliſhed to the ground our Fortreſſes, your
Majeſty having thereby introduced an impoſſibility to
perform what the pretended Agreement of <hi>Rendsbourgh</hi>
doth import: For if we by virtue thereof are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Inveſtiture over the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> it
muſt be done at leaſt after ſuch a manner, as the Duke
our Father of Bleſſed memory the laſt time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
year 1648, received the ſame; and then we ought
to be Inveſted not only with the bare Land, but alſo with
thoſe Fortreſſes, ſince the laſt Feudal Letter doth make
expreſs mention thereof. It is true, we do confeſs, that
even after ſuch rigorous proceedings, to teſtifie our defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to your Majeſty, and our deſire of Peace, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to eaſe our Subjects ſomething groaning under their
burthen, and to promote their freedom according to our
Power; we have come ſo far, as to condeſcend at length
to the receiving the Inveſtiture upon theſe terms, that all
things ſhould be reſetled in ſuch a ſtate, as they had been
before the pretended Agreement of <hi>Rendsbourgh,</hi> and that
the weighty burthen lying upon our Territories, ſhould be
taken off, and due ſatisfaction effectually made for the
damages ſuſtained: And for that purpoſe we have ſent
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61869:58"/>
ſome of our Miniſters to <hi>Copenhaguen;</hi> but our juſt deſires
have been rejected, an unconditional performance of the
Feudal duty inſiſted on, and the redreſs of our Grievances
ſet out of doors, and our Miniſters having alleadged the
want of full Powers thereunto, have been ſent back
for new Inſtructions, without being recalled by us from
<hi>Copenhaguen,</hi> as her Majeſty the Queen Mother by her
own Letters deted at <hi>Copenhaguen</hi> the <hi>19th</hi> day of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1676,</hi> hath informed us. And we do confeſs very
freely, that in caſe our Subjects preſently after our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Promiſe made, had been eaſed from their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
the Fortreſſes reduced to their former ſtate, and
due ſatisfaction effectually given us, we would have done
the utmoſt, and undergone afreſh that Feudal Duty. But
whereas alſo, ſince poſſeſſion hath been taken of our
part of <hi>Stadt</hi> and <hi>Butjadinger-Land,</hi> notwithſtanding
the ſame hath no Relation at all to that Proceſs, which
was made at <hi>Vienna</hi> in the Cauſe of <hi>Olden<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

his deſcending as a Fief from the Ducal Houſe of
<hi>Brunſwick-Lunenbourgh;)</hi> our Subjects likewiſe both in
<hi>Holſtein</hi> and <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> have been forbid to pay us the few
remaining ordinary dues; and furthermore ſuch aims are
taken, as to exclude us from that Treaty of a General
Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and conſequently from all hopes
of redreſs; and lately Navigation hath even been by
open Proclamations abſolutely Interdicted to all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
and Subjects of the Dukedoms of <hi>Sleſwick</hi> and
<hi>Holſtein,</hi> without affording us, as Prince Regent, the
leaſt knowledge thereof, much leſs deſigning us to
joyn in the ſaid Publication, if the ſame had been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
We therefore have had good reaſon to wave the
ſending over our Deputies the ſecond time again, after
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61869:58"/>
they were thus diſmiſſed before, but rather have taken a
firm reſolution to get our Cauſe ventilated and diſcuſſed
at the Treaty of the General Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> with
this certain hope and confidence, that no Potentate
concerned therein will diſpute our admiſſion, in regard
that amongſt other high concerns, the re-eſtabliſhment of
the Northern Peace, will be alſo treated there, which is
not only the foundation of our Soveraignty over the
Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> with the other advantages ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated
for us and our Family, but alſo is an eſſential
part thereof, and ſtands comprehended under the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
General and Special Warranty. Neither do we
think that your Majeſties Miniſters in <hi>Holland</hi> have had
any orders to render difficult the impetrating of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,

ſeeing they have not been able to alledge any thing at all
which ſhould deſerve the leaſt reflection, and exclude us
from the General-Treaty, if we were but to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a <hi>German</hi> Prince, and had no concerns in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment
of the Northern Peace, which nevertheleſs
hath firſt of all been endangered on our ſide. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thoſe machinations diſcovered by a ſingular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
whereby, as we do conceive, ſome endeavours
are uſed, to juſtifie that (in all points formally commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced)
Sequeſtration, we have not the leaſt cauſe to clear
our ſelves in that reſpect, before any particulars are
nearer touched, and it be duly made appear to us, that
we have been concerned in any of thoſe Machinations
repreſented to your Majeſty. However we are ſure and
confident, that we never have been ſo deſervedly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
privy to any thing as that thereby juſt cauſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61869:59"/>
ſhould have been given, to charge us therewith by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
both within and without the Empire, and to
alienate their former inclination from Us and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
much leſs can a Pretext thereby conveniently be
taken to ſequeſtrate that part of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi>
which with all right Hereditarily and Properly doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to us, and to menace us with a total deprivation
thereof; and we do alſo fully perſwade our ſelves, that
your Majeſty will put this to the ſerious conſideration
of your Miniſters, who have brought this Proceſs upon
the Stage, and perhaps do endeavour to aſſert it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
with the Feudal Laws, That as your Majeſty
doubtleſs makes great doubt, to aſſume a Judges part
in your own Cauſe, ſo neither the Sequeſtration of
the Fief, nor the Deprivation of the ſame, can or may
conſiſt after that manner, as it is intended againſt us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we ſhould be indiſputably oblig'd to that Vaſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> which yet, ſaving all
due reſpect to your Majeſty, we find our ſelves neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſolemnly to contradict, except one would preſume to
Act by nullities, or by making no reflection upon the
Law. And the common Feudal Laws, whereupon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ancient Unions and Hereditary Agreements,
(in caſe any difference as well in Feudal as other matters
ſhould ariſe) are uſually grounded, do ſhew, That not
only in the total deprivation of a Fief, but alſo in the
Sequeſtration, the hearing of the Cauſe before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judge, ought ſolemnly to precede it, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
one ſhould preſume to aſſert the neceſſity of a
Sequeſtration,) in caſe the Parties ſhew themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
the reaſons whereof, nevertheleſs, will never be

Having therefore pondered all the above-mentioned,
and ſuch other concomitant circumſtances, we cannot
but ſtill keep to our reſolution once deliberately taken,
and remit that point of our undeſervedly queſtioned
Soveraignty over the Dukedome of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> with all

<hi>Lintz</hi> of the <hi>6th</hi> Inſtant, hath been ſome days

got Information, as if I had not only, for my part,
approved of thoſe Propoſals which had been made to me
by <hi>Graventable</hi> the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſter, lately Reſiding

Self according to what Duty doth require of a Loyal
Member of the Empire, leſt otherwiſe your Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
ſhould be obliged to cauſe Me be proceeded againſt
according to your publiſhed Imperial Avocatories.</p>
                  <p>It is true, I can promiſe my Self nothing elſe from
your Imperial Majeſties moſt mild and yet moſt juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
but that your Imperial Majeſties very gracious
Letter, (although occaſioned by the induſtrious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of ſome envious perſons, who, by all ways and
means, ſeek very watchfully the oppreſſion and ruin of
my ſelf, and my Ducal Houſe) hath been ſent to me for
no other end, but that your Imperial Majeſty might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
get a fitter occaſion to diſcover my Innocency, and
conſequently, by your Imperial Majeſties Authority and
higheſt Power, to Protect me as a Loyal Member and
Prince of the Empire, againſt thoſe who have made no
Conſcience for the ſpace of theſe 19 Months, to Treat
me unworthily, and oppreſs me undeſervedly, leaving
me nothing of all my Princely Dignity but bare life.
However, when I call to mind again, in what manner
your Imperial Majeſties Requiſitorials concerning me,
which were delivered into his Majeſty the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi>
hands, have been (by the contrivance of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
bearing an hatred to me) abuſed ſo far, that they
begun almoſt from that very hour to exhauſt my poor
Subjects, as well of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> as of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
Contributions, and to render them quite unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to contribute ſo much, as they were lawfully bound
to do for the upholding my Princely State and Dignity;
(which proceedings are yet till this very moment conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
to the utter deſtruction of my Territories, though
no further Imperial Requiſitorials have been ſignified to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61869:62"/>
me, which have been granted to other States of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Circle of <hi>Saxony</hi> in the point of Quarters:) Then have
I juſt reaſon to fear, that they likewiſe now under your
Imperial Majeſties higheſt Name and Authority,
though againſt your Imperial Majeſties will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
do go about to colour, and palliate what they
newly have contriv'd for the finiſhing of my premeditated
ruin, and partly have already brought to an Execution.
All which I have by my former complaints, with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
repreſented to your Imperial Majeſty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
moſt humbly implored your ſpeedy Protection; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
alſo I do now refer my ſelf, in hopes your Imperial
Majeſty will be pleaſed, not only moſt graciouſly to hear,
but alſo ſee them according to your Imperial Clemency
forthwith redreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Concerning thoſe Accuſations brought before your
Imperial Majeſty, and laid home at my door, I ſhould
never have Imagined, upon what bottom and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they could be grounded, unleſs your Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
by the Nomination of certain Perſons had obliged me
to a more exact Information; whereupon I moſt humbly
can aſſure your Imperial Majeſty, by the true and faithful
Word of a Prince, that I never had the leaſt knowledge
of theſe ſpecified Projects, touching the Levies of ſome
Forreign Forces, much leſs have I approved of the ſame,
or dealt or agreed about them, directly or indirectly, with
any man in the VVorld. And I can proteſt with Truth
it ſelf, that <hi>Kleyhe</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Preſident, hath
not, all the time of his abode here, made any Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to me concerning my Conjunction with Forreign
Crowns againſt your Imperial Majeſty, and your high
Allies, nor ever offered to perſwade me to any ſuch thing.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61869:63"/>
But this I do declare willingly and freely, that I have
cauſed my diſconſolate condition, whereunto I find my
ſelf undeſervedly reduced, to be fully repreſented to his
Majeſty the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as Guarantee of the
Northern Peace, which firſt of all began to bleed and
ſuffer on my ſide; to whom I made it my humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
that his ſaid Majeſty would be pleaſed, (in reſpect
both of that General and Special Guaranty taken upon
him concerning my Soveraignty over the Dukedom of
<hi>Sleſwick,</hi> lawfully obtained,) to procure my Reſtitution,
and due Satisfaction; which I have been ſo far from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning,
that I was content that the Memorials about the
ſaid Subject exhibited from time to time by my Deputy,
ſhould be faithfully communicated to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Miniſter
reſiding in <hi>England.</hi> For which end I have alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
at that Court the ſame <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcken</hi> my Counſellor
there, whom I did for almoſt two years imploy at your
Imperial Majeſties Court; and have amongſt other
Negotiations alſo cauſed my moſt humble Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
and frequent Inſtances by him to be made
to your Imperial Majeſty for my Protection, with
certain hopes, that he hath behaved himſelf ſo well,
that no cauſe is left to miſtruſt him, or to charge him
with any ſiniſter and ill-grounded accuſations. Since
therefore the aboveſaid foul aſperſions, ſtudiouſly
contrived by my ill-wiſhers, can never be proved nor laid
to my door; the reſt conſequently muſt fall to the ground,
which charge me that for the carrying on of ſuch fictitious
Levies, I ſhould have taken and employed the ſaid Sum of
200000 <hi>Rixdollers</hi> belonging to the Heirs of <hi>Kielman,</hi>
which monies I do not know in the leaſt if they do lye
here or no. Whereas now my Innocency, and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61869:63"/>
Fictitiouſneſs of thoſe Siniſter imputations do
ſufficiently appear by the premiſes; I can with all
ſubmiſſion aſſure your Imperial Majeſty that nothing
in the World ſhall be ever forced from me, which may
offend and interrupt my Loyal Duties tendred to your
Imperial Majeſty, and to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that
Devotion which my Anceſtors have Sealed with their
Princely Blood to the Mighty Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> I do
therefore again moſt humbly implore your Imperial
Majeſty, as the moſt Sacred Head of the Empire, that your
Imperial Majeſty would be pleaſed not to give way to the
Suſpicions raiſed againſt me, but rather, out of your
Higheſt Fatherly care provide ſuch ways and means,
whereby I, as a devoted Co-member of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, may be upheld and freed from all my preſſing
Calamities. Thus longingly I do look for your Imperial
Majeſties effectual and gracious Reſolution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
