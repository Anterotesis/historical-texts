            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere has been lately a deſign ſet on foot, for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Company all the Wooll not Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factur'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to prevent the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it into Forreign Countries, they would be oblig'd to ſell it only to the Cloathiers and Manufactors here, as Perſons who cannot be ſuppoſed to be ſo ignorant of their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, that they would for ſome little gain, ſend Wooll abroad to hinder the Sale of all they ſhall Work at home. By what Method, and how far this affair proceeded I will ſhew you as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN Order to the Erecting this Company, it was humbly offer'd to his Majeſty, that in regard the Wooll of <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Commodity Prohibited, to be Exported out of that Kingdom under great Penalties, by ſeveral Statutes there made, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 13. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Eliz Ch.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Eliz. ch.</hi> 4. and notwithſtanding thoſe Statutes were made both to hinder the <hi>Dutch</hi> and other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners from carrying away the Wooll, and to neceſſitate the Subjects of that Kingdom to Manufacture it at home, (which cannot be done without prejudicing <hi>England,</hi> by making any other place the Staple for Woollen-Manufactures:) yet from time to time, almoſt ever ſince thoſe Laws were Enacted, the chief Governors, by Authority from the Crown, have given Licences to Tranſport what Wooll could not there be Manufactur'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96018:3"/>
into <hi>England;</hi> obliging the Tranſporters expreſly to enter in the Cuſtom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Houſe every Stone, and to pay the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties impos'd by Act of Cuſtoms on that Commodity, when Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd to be Exported; and to enter into Bond to return Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate of its being Landed in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this caution, many Merchants greedy of gain, have adventur'd by ſtealth to Tranſport Wooll into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> (whereby the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woollen-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures have been much prejudic'd, and Forreign by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence advanc'd,) for they, if they ſucceeded in one Voyage of three, were conſiderable Gainers; ſo much the rates of the Wooll of <hi>Ireland</hi> were higher in thoſe Forreign parts than in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Act againſt bringing the Cattle of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did Neceſſitate the People of that Kingdom to breed fewer black Cattle, and fall into the breed of Sheep, whereby that Kingdom has much more Wooll in it, than ever it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is likely to encreaſe every year; ſo that if ſome ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and effectual Regulation be not made in the Trade of the Wooll of <hi>Ireland</hi> (the Manufacture of that Country not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to employ the fortieth part of it:) particular perſons will, notwithſtanding the Laws, venture to Tranſport it into Forreign Countries, rather than make it a drug at home.</p>
            <p>It were therefore to be wiſh'd, that ſince none can Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Wooll out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> but by his Majeſties Licenſe; and that He, or His chief Governour may grant or deny ſuch Licenſe to whom they ſhall think fit, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to take the whole Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trade of <hi>Ireland</hi> into his own hands, and advance the Stock ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to carry it on, which is computed to be about 150000 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> &amp; would Employ ſome honeſt &amp; knowing Perſons to buy up Annually, all the Wooll brought to the Ports for Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at honeſt and equal Rates, to be adjuſted between Buyer and Seller: And faithful and honeſt Commiſſioners in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to manage the Trade, by which His Majeſty will advantage
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96018:3"/>
His Subjects of both Kingdoms, and gain into his own Exchequer a ſufficient profit: Nor is it unbeſeeming his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be concern'd in a Trade, which, by ſecuring all the Wooll from Forreigners hands, enriches, re-peoples, and ſtrengthens His Subjects and Kingdom, by giving a full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to all, and adds ſo many loſt hands to the labour of the Publick; ſeeing other Princes abroad (where the effects are not ſo glorious) have Stocks going in Trade. The <hi>French</hi> King in the Manufactures of Lace, Paper, and Salt. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> are great Merchants.</p>
            <p>But if his Majeſty thinks not fit to advance the ſum requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for carrying on his Trade, then others of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will advance the Sum, if the ſole liberty of Tranſporting Wooll be granted to them: They will give conſtant and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rates for the Wooll to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as high as they receiv'd formerly from ſingle Merchants: And whereas heretofore they were often forc'd to batter their Wooll for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commodities at dear and unconſcionable rates; or give long days for payment; they will pay them ready money im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon delivering their Wooll, and engage to Land it all in <hi>England;</hi> and they will yearly pay unto His Majeſties Exchequer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 10000 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> over and above the uſual Fees, to the chief Governour of that Kingdom for granting the Licenſes.</p>
            <p>This <hi>(Sir)</hi> is the ſubſtance of the Propoſal made to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; but before it was deliver'd, one of the Propoſers did long ſince, in <hi>December</hi> laſt, give an acc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>unt of this whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to a perſon of great Honour; one, as eminent for his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Prudence, as for Quality; a Privy Counſellor in both Kingdoms, entreating his Lord<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hip would promote it, if it prov'd juſt and rational. He, wiſely conſidering the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, firſt made his Objections, to which, receiving ſatisfactory anſwers, he communicated the buſineſs to the moſt eminent Perſonages of both Kingdoms; and in <hi>March</hi> laſt, writ, <hi>If the</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96018:4"/>
               <hi>Stock to carry on this honeſt deſign could be rais'd, the grant would be obtain'd, and prove grateful to both Kingdoms:</hi> Upon this Encouragement, one of the Propoſers haſted into <hi>England,</hi> attended moſt of the Perſons of Quality of <hi>Ireland</hi> then here, to receive their ſence alſo in the thing, to which they all conſented; afterwards he diſcours'd the matter with the Factors of <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> as the likelieſt men to know the ſenſe of the Cloathing-men of <hi>England,</hi> and he ſatisfied their Objections, partly by diſcourſe, but more by the following Letter,</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <head>To Mr. <hi>Langworth,</hi> and the Factors and Cloathiers of <hi>Blackwell-Hall.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>There being a deſign on foot, for the joynt good both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein Perſons of your Trade would be nearly concern'd; I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought fit to communicate it to you, and to give you the offer of partaking in it: But, yeſterday you all ſeem'd I know not how to reſent it, deſiring me to draw up the ſtate of the thing, and you would further conſider it; which in as few words as I can comprehend it, ſtands thus:</p>
                  <p>It has bin this long time the great out-cry and general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint here, that many thouſands are ruin'd, and undone, by the decay of Woollen Manufactures, which was ſaid to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd partly, by the Importation of <hi>French</hi> Wares; but moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Tranſportations of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> to remedy which Evils, though many things have bin thought on, nothing was hitherto found ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>Ireland</hi> on the other hand complain, that the Wooll-buyers combine ſo to under-value their Wooll, that they are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eceſſitated to ſtudy all wayes to make the moſt of it; eſpecially ſince that, by the Act againſt Importation of their Cattle into <hi>England,</hi> their Wooll is encreas'd. Now, to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate both Kingdoms, there is an honeſt and fair deſign laid, for the buying up all the Wooll of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſhall not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96018:4"/>
there be Manufactur'd, and for its Tranſportation into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> only. I then told you, This could no otherwiſe be effected, than by erecting a Company of Staplers, who ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to buy up Annually, all the Wooll of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at certain rates, according to its goodneſs, which ſhould be, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, determin'd by indifferent ſworn Perſons, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently skilfull in that Commodity; and you all unanimouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that it was mightily for the advantage of <hi>England</hi> to have all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll Imported into <hi>England,</hi> and that, no doubt, 'twould yearly be Manufactur'd here, and would yeild at leaſt the ſame price, if not better, than in ſeveral years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the late Dutch War; and that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wooll were ſecur'd from <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> hands, it would raiſe our Cloaths a ſixt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

You alſo allow'd, it would be hugely prejudicial to the People and Trade of <hi>England,</hi> to have all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll Manufactur'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for that their advance in this would be your loſs, ſince Proviſions being cheaper there, and they having that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity at eaſier rates than you can thence in <hi>England;</hi> there being three ſhillings charge on every Stone, beſides the hazard and riſque of the Sea, which together with the Intereſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney laid out, will conſiderably add to the enhancement of the price; inſomuch, that upon the whole, it may be concluded, ſhould Cloathiers from <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant themſelves into <hi>Ireland,</hi> they would be able to work up the Wooll, at leaſt ſix ſhillings a Stone cheaper than it can be wrought in <hi>England.</hi> Then, <hi>Ireland</hi> in reſpect both of S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

By this means alſo, in a little time, the Engliſh Artiſts who are gone abroad, will be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to return, and with them bring, like Decoy's, (but to better purpoſe) a multitude of Proteſtant Forreigners, and with Them, all their Riches, which will chiefly fall into the hands
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96018:5"/>
of the Cloathing-men of this Nation, (though it will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enrich all other ſorts of people) they being allowed no other liberty, than as Journey-men and Servants to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, at leaſt till by intermixed marriages they are imbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died with, and become one people with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which a very few years will bring to paſs. And this will further ſhew a way for another, or the ſame Company, by an Addition of Stock to buy up all the Wooll of <hi>England,</hi> which may eaſily be done, by propoſing handſome and equal rates between Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sellers, for all the Wooll, for a certain number of years; which will remove all pretenſions for ſending it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and though ſomething dearer than ordinary be given, there can be no loſs, ſince 'tis demonſtrable, that what is given in the Wooll, is got in the Cloath. And for an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch a brave undertaking, 'tis to be conſidered, that Cloathing is neceſſary, and that all the Wooll of <hi>Europe</hi> is ſomewhere or other yearly Manufactur'd, none burnt, or thrown away as uſeleſs; and that moſt of the Wooll of <hi>Europe</hi> is made uſeful by the mixtures of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and that if theſe can be ſecur'd in <hi>England,</hi> this Country muſt then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently get into all the Cloathing Trade of the World, they being the only People that will have to ſpare beyond their own conſumption; though His Majeſty ſhould be graciouſly pleas'd by his own example to diſcourage, (which 'tis hop'd He will ever continue to do for the good of His Subjects) all other ſorts of Garments but what ſhall be made of Cloath or Woollen Stuffs, in which no doubt all People may be clad as richly, and as conveniently according to the ſeaſons of the year, as in any other ſort whatever.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the preſent deſign of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll: 'Tis not to be ſuppos'd what you ſeem'd chieflieſt to deſire, that the Laws of that Kingdom ſhould be alter'd in granting Liberty of Tranſporting Wooll out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England</hi> duty-free; ſince thereby, His Majeſty would not only ſuffer in the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Iriſh</hi> Revenue, but the ſame inconvenience of carrying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96018:6"/>
it elſe-where, and at an eaſier rate to the Tranſporter would ſtill remain. Nor is it to be imagin'd, that his Majeſty will erect ſuch a Company as you ſeem to deſire, granting to them only the ſole liberty of Exporting Wooll, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging them to give a certain and conſtant price, which would be a very great hardſhip to His Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and would tend only to the giving the Company an opportunity of making their own Markets on the People of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And if you imagine the price will be rais'd here, though that be already anſwered, you may prevent that by joyning in this Society, or by reſolving to give certain rates for ſuch a number of years for all the Wooll, good and bad.</p>
                  <p>That the erecting ſuch a Company is no Monopoly, but a real advantage to both Kingdoms, will appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations: And firſt, You are to underſtand, that there are ſeveral Statutes made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which wholly forbid the Exportation of Wooll into any Kingdom what ever. Now theſe Undertakers will give conſtant Rates to all the Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers of <hi>Ireland</hi> for their ſeveral ſorts of Wooll, leaving them to their liberty, to take, or refuſe thoſe Rates as they ſhall find their greater advantage; provided the King Licenſes no others to Tranſport any Wooll but theſe Undertakers only, during the Term; which Grant, can't be judg'd an Monopoly, ſince they do not deſign the Wooll-ſellers ſhould be oblig'd to ſell (they having ſtill the liberty the Laws leave them to Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture it at home) but if they will ſell, they bind themſelves to give greater rates then have been given; and ſince a Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly is a reſtraint of liberty of Trade without Law, the Licenſe is a taking off the reſtraint laid on by Law, as to ſuch Perſons to whom the Grant is made, which is in favour of Trade, and to an act of favour all people are not intitul'd, and therefore may be given to one and not another, without injuſtice or injury: For His Majeſty is not oblig'd to give Licenſe to any Perſon contrary to an act of Parliament, but by His Prerogative may diſpenſe with that act, that diſpenſation being for the good of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96018:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
His Subjects, and He may choſe whom He thinks fit to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute His favours to.</p>
                  <p>In this Trade there will be little or no hazard; ſor, no bad debts need be made, the Wooll being to be delivered before any mony pay'd for it, and the Tranſportations into <hi>England</hi> may be made before the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or ſooner, and all go in three Fleets, according to the number of Ports deſign'd, which makes the riſque of the Sea little or none in time of Peace; and in War His Majeſty may order a ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy for that ſhort Voyage, without any prejudice to His other Affairs: Then Wooll being a Staple and neceſſary Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, can never fail to ſell within the compaſs of the year.</p>
                  <p>This will be a great advantage to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe greateſt wealth the Woollen Manufacture would be, if reſtor'd to what it has bin, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to what it may be.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>Irelands</hi> advantage will be in this, that they ſhall have a certain Market for their Wooll, aſſoon as it is ſhorn, and ready money as ſoon as they deliver it; whereas they now ſell commonly at ſix or nine moneths, and are forc'd to take Shop-goods at unreaſonable rates for payment; and ſhall have as good pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es for it in ready money, as they had before the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War, when they gave time, or took goods.</p>
                  <p>The People and Trade of <hi>England</hi> will be advantag'd in this, that all the Exported Wooll of <hi>Ireland</hi> will certainly be carried into <hi>England,</hi> none into Forreign parts, which for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate advantage is many times now Tranſported into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to the unſpeakable prejudice of <hi>England;</hi> whereby the Forreign Manufactures will be diſcouraged, and thoſe of <hi>England</hi> flouriſh, and the Eaſt-land Trade; That with <hi>Turky, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi> will be regain'd; and in time both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> inſtead of Selling to Us, will be forc'd to Buy from Us; it being indiſputably certain that <hi>French</hi> Wooll is too courſe, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooll too fine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mixture of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> with each of theſe (for they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96018:7"/>
will not mix with one another) to effect any thing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Trade of Woollen Manufacture: And of how great advantage and Glory this will be to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is eaſie to gueſs, ſince 'twill fill the Kingdom both with Artiſts and Riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ireland</hi> will be under no neceſſity of endeavouring to raiſe the Manufacture at home, (which was the deſign of the Acts Prohibiting the Exportation of Wooll) while they have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reaſonable price at a certain publiſh'd rate, and ready money paid for their Wooll.</p>
                  <p>Now, from what I have here Writ, you will eaſily with me make this Concluſion; that, if this Company ſhould raiſe the price of Wooll, yet the Cloathiers cannot reaſonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but rather the Merchant-Tranſporters, who buy the Cloath ſo much the dearer; nor yet they, ſince they ſell it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad accordingly; ſo that ultimately the profit tends to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the diſadvantage (if there be any) to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys; it being evident, that the cheapneſs or dearneſs of Wooll depends, not only on the Conſumption at home, but on the Trade abroad of our Woollen Manufactures; which we ſhall vend at our own Rates, if <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> (our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in Trade) be diſabl'd; which can't otherwiſe come to paſs, than by a due proſecution of this deſign, which tends to the vaſt advantage of the Trading People, both Merchants and Handycrafts-men of this Nation; and conſequently, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Particular, but a very General good, and ſo intended by the Propoſer.</p>

            <p>Having theſe Reaſons to perſwade himſelf, he had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken nothing but what would be pleaſing and profitable to both Kingdoms, he procur'd a Petition with this Propoſal (as to the main) to be delivered to His Majeſty, which received a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable report from the two greateſt Miniſters of State, to whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96018:8"/>
it was refer'd; hereupon there was in Order to the paſſing of Letters Patents for the erecting this Company, a Letter fram'd to be ſent from His Majeſty to His Excellency the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which, (among other things,) there was direction for putting a preſent ſtop to the Wool Licenſes.</p>
            <p>When the thing was brought to this fair Iſſue, the Propoſer (with all others that I could hear of) apprehended, there wanted nothing to the perfecting of his deſign; but gathering <hi>Their</hi> Subſcriptions, who had before promis'd to be of the Company for the raiſing of the Stock; in Order to this, he went to the <hi>Change,</hi> where he met one of <hi>theſe</hi> Promiſers, transform'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Oppoſer of the whole deſign. He was very loud and clamorous, and though he chang'd none from their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the thing, he frighted ſome from engaging in what he pretended would be oppos'd. How he came to be alter'd I will not determine, (though ſome do pretty probably aſſign his change to a fuller conſideration of his private intereſt) but, give you the <hi>mighty</hi> Objections which <hi>he</hi> made by the mouth of another, with their Anſwers to 'um.</p>
            <p>It was Objected all in a breath, that this was a <hi>French</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the bottom, what-ever the pretences were to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and by I know not what new Logick, this Objection was grounded on the giving the King 10000. <hi>l.</hi> a year, which by a better conſequence, is an inſinuation, that His Majeſty is a Party in the plot, and could be perſwaded by a trifle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at leaſt, to the undoing of His two Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>That it was a Monopoly, and would engroſs the Exchange between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in time all other Trades of <hi>Ireland;</hi> &amp; that this Company could with more ſecurity carry the Wooll into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> than ſingle Merchants, and therefore it would be a greater prejudice to erect this Company, than to leave the Exportation at large as now.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To the firſt Objection the Propoſer Anſwer'd, that this was ſo far from being a <hi>French</hi> deſign, that directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, never any <hi>French man</hi> was either ſpoken to, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96018:8"/>
cern'd in it; he alſo affirm'd, he ſet this buſineſs on foot, not to ſerve any perſon or party what-ever; but was prompted to it, chiefly by the conſideration of its being a publick good, and then that it might be ſo regulated as it would prove a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage to any that ſhould engage in it; and had it been a <hi>French</hi> deſign, it had been unreaſonable to believe it would have been propos'd to the Cloathiers of <hi>England;</hi> to whom it was all along intended to have been communicated, and was ſo, when once it was known grantable, that <hi>They</hi> might advance the whole, or the biggeſt part of the Stock to carry it on.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That it was not a Monopoly, he prov'd ſufficiently in his Letter to them of <hi>Blackwell-Hall;</hi> to which he added, that nothing can be a Monopoly, but the engroſſing into one or few hands a Trade or Commodity by Law left free to all men; and ſince only Wooll of all the Commodities of <hi>Ireland</hi> is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Law to be thence Exported, even into <hi>England,</hi> this Grant is ſo far from being a Monopoly, that 'tis (if rightly conſider'd) the greateſt advantage imaginable to the Intereſt of <hi>England;</hi> ſince if His Majeſty thought fit altogether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Licenſe, (which none can deny, but He may do) 'twould prove greatly prejudicial to this Kingdom; and then, if it be further conſidered, that by this Grant, there is no more intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than inſtead of a 100 (ſuppoſing that the number of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants) taking Licenſes ſingly, they ſhould be oblig'd to take them joyn'd in a Company as one man; and no man being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this Society, there can be no Prejudice nor Monopoly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if this Company ſhould engroſs the Exchange, which they can no otherwiſe do, than by giving and taking Bills at very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rates; this moderating the Exchange, would prevent money being carryed out of either Kingdom in Specie; which would be of great advantage, not only to this Company, but to others alſo; ſince the unreaſonable height of Exchange is found very injurious to Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96018:9"/>
And as for this Companies Monopolizing in time all other Trades of that Kingdom, This may be, I hope, ſatisfactorily ſaid, that there is no Commodity in <hi>Ireland,</hi> except Wooll, the Trade of which can legally be confin'd to a Company; beſides, this Company aims at nothing elſe but the Trade of Wooll, which will certainly be work enough for them to mannage.</p>
            <p>The next Objection was, that the Tranſportation of Wooll would not be more reſtrainable in Society, than while the trade remains in the hands of ſingle Merchants; which would be fully Anſwer'd by any Perſon that conſiders, that if there be but one Exporter, ſuch a fraud is eaſier diſcover'd, than when there are perhaps 200 to commit it: But this Objection will fall, if it appear that it will be this Companies Intereſt (whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Cloathiers or others) to bring all the Wooll into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> only; in order to this, let the Reader conſider what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and is tranſcrib'd almoſt word for word out of a little piece (which within theſe three days came to my hands) call'd <hi>The Intereſt of</hi> England <hi>in the improvement of the Trade of Wooll,</hi> &amp;c. writ by a Cloathier, whoſe words at large are here inſerted as being more likely to gain belief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſo it is (ſays my Authour)</hi> That for ſome years paſt, the diligence of Forreigners to enrich themſelves upon us, has ſo far exceeded our care to preſerve our ſelves, that not only, <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> have long ſuck'd the ſweetneſs of our Trade; but <hi>Fiance</hi> is likewiſe learning to be too hard for us, as is manifeſt by the great quantities of Wooll that of late years have been Tranſported from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> thither; how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious it muſt be to us, will appear unqueſtionable, if we conſider that every Pack of Wooll ſent to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>France</hi> does prevent us, not only of the Manufacture thereof, but of two packs more beſide it ſelf; it being combing and combed Wooll for the moſt part that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thither, the <hi>French</hi> having no Woolls of their own, but ſuch as are very courſe, and are not able to make Cloath or fine Stuffs, without the conjunction of ours therewith; there being none to my beſt information in all the World fit for that purpoſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96018:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but ours only, except in <hi>North-Holland,</hi> and that a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fine worſted Woll, all other being likewiſe courſe, but Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Wooll, and that much too fine, eſpecially for Worſted, Stuffs, and not in any wiſe fit for Combing; ſo that without <hi>Engl ſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woolls there can be no quantity of fine Worſted Stuffs, nor a middle ſort of Cloth made in the whole World. Neither will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny VVoll be all mixt together, but Engliſh and Spaniſh (and that for Cloth only) becauſe the Spaniſh is with the Engliſh of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, onely a little finer; and in proportion the ſame may be of the Spaniſh and Iriſh Wooll; wherfore the exportation of Engliſh or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wools into <hi>France,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be greatly prejudicial to this Nation, not only in the Quantity ſent over, but alſo in the advantage which is hereby given to them to manufacture a double proportion of their own Wooll (which otherwiſe would be little worth) into ſuch Commodities, as ſpoil us of the advantages of our proper Trades, not onely thither, but alſo into other Parts in theſe three Reſpects.</p>

            <p>Now if we conſider theſe things together, the dammage of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting one pack from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France</hi> at about <hi>10 or 12</hi> l.

               </gap> pound, of fine Wooll would make at leaſt two pair of Hoſe worth <hi>5. s.</hi> a pair, that is <hi>10. s.</hi> for a pound of Wooll; or reckon thus, to ordinary Hoſe three pair to a pound of Wooll, at <hi>3. s. 4 d. per</hi> pair, comes to the ſame ſum, and <hi>12</hi> ſcore pound of Wooll making a pack, and a pack of Wooll making <hi>480.</hi> pair of Hoſe, accordingly the pack makes <hi>120. l.</hi> without any reſpect to the advantage given them in rough Wooll. Moreover conſidering the Cuſtoms of the product, when Imported, it would double that ſum, ſo that the Exportation of one pack of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll is <hi>200. l.</hi> dammage to the King and Country in general; the conſequence of which will be the ſpoyling our Trade with <hi>France</hi> in woollen Manufactures, which (ſince the great Importation of our Woolls thither) appears from the great Impoſt put upon the Same there; and will in time capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to under-ſell our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in Forreign parts, and poſſibly in our own Countrys; ſo that the advantage we give them, beſides in the mixtures of our W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ortations of Woolls from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſtructive Nature to the very being of the Trade of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Another neceſſary conſequence of carrying Wooll into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> will be to bring the price of Wooll to be <hi>6 d. per</hi> pound, as it was <hi>300</hi> years ago, when the Cloth then made in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96018:10"/>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> of our Wooll at <hi>6 d. per</hi> pound was ſold here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>10 s. per</hi> yard; when at this day Cloath made in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> of Woll at <hi>12. d. per</hi> pound, will hardly yeild <hi>7 s. per</hi> yard, which is above <hi>30 per cent</hi> worſe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade now, than it was to the <hi>Flemings</hi> formerly, which is ſolely occaſion'd by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> being able by much to under work, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to under-ſell us; whereas if the Wooll was not Exported beyond Sea to thoſe places, there to be Manufactur'd, they muſt of neceſſity buy our Woollen Manufacture, becauſe they have not Wooll enough of their own to ſupply their occaſions, and that alſo they would want thoſe advantages of improving by our Woolls the <hi>French</hi> and ſhort <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wooll, and their fine ſpun Linnens. The difference of keeping our Wooll at home, and ſending it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad appears hence, experience teſtifies, that when the Wooll was all us'd at home, or very little Exported, the Wooll was <hi>18 d. per</hi> pound, and when all, or the greateſt part was Exported, it was at <hi>6. p.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more very pertinent to this Deſign, may be gathered out of that diſcourſe, as in the Preface; he tells of a Deſign propos'd of allowing liberty to Export Wooll out of <hi>Ireland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Forreign Countrys, adding 2 <hi>d.</hi> or 3 <hi>d. per</hi> pound Cuſtom; the diſadvantage of which Act he there ſhews; as alſo that a Lord in the Committee for Wooll, affirmed he was offer'd 100000 <hi>l. Sterl.</hi> to get an Act paſs'd for the Tranſportation of Wooll, which with what goes before, ſufficiently teſtifies the great advantage the <hi>French</hi> gain, and we loſe by their Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing our Wooll; to which I will add, that there being at leaſt 10000. packs yearly Tranſported from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if not a great deal more, (of which we may allow the one half, if not more to <hi>Ireland)</hi> by this Authours computation, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. the Loſs to <hi>England,</hi> in general, can be little leſs than Two Millions a year, and to the King in particular, 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which would otherwiſe be advanced in his Cuſtoms; which would eaſily prove true to any conſiderative Perſon that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in theſe 10000 packs, there can be no leſs at the loweſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96018:11"/>
Computation than 150000 Stone, 16 pound to the Stone, and 12 ſcore pound to the pack, and that working up every Stone, is worth in very labour 50 <hi>s.</hi> which makes loſs to the Tradeſmen in Wages only, 375000 <hi>l.</hi> and ſince the <hi>French</hi> work up Wooll much cheaper than we can, and alſo gain the advantage of making a double quantity of their own Wooll uſeful by ours, they can afford to give greater rates for Wooll than we do, and yet by at leaſt two thirds under-ſell us; the conſequence of which will be the lowering the price of Wooll both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and beating us out of the Trade by our own weapons: Whereas, if we keep the Wooll from them, we ſhould then ſell in Cloath the quantities of Wooll, and two thirds more, which would be of vaſt profit to all people of this Country; prevent the Exportation of coin thither to ballance that deſtructive (as now mannaged) Trade, encreaſe Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Navigation, and give full employment to all the poor of the Kingdom (with which it now ſwarms) this one Trade of Cloathing uſing as many hands as perhaps all other Trades of the Nation, 27 perſons being ordinarily imployed to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Stone of Wooll into Cloath.</p>
            <p>But at the worſt, ſuppoſe (which none did ever yet that I could hear of) that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> could make a ſhift without our Wooll to Cloath their Natives, we ſhould at leaſt gain the Trade of all other Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome men may fancy that <hi>France</hi> has no need of our Woollen Manufactures, becauſe of the great Impoſt that King of late put on our Cloaths, which would ſoon be a burthen to his own people, if the Tables were turn'd, and we kept our Wooll; ſeeing then we ſhould ſell them our Cloath ſo much the dearer, it being indiſputable, that if they need our Wooll, they will much more our Cloath; which alſo will add to us an encreaſe of Artiſts, becauſe thoſe Perſons abroad wanting the materials for their Trade, will be under a neceſſity of learning new Arts, or going where they may be employ'd in their own (which is the moſt likely.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96018:11"/>
There is yet one thing not taken notice of, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Companies giving His Majeſty 10000 l. a year, which is done as a grateful recognition of His Majeſties particular favour to this Company, which ſum I preſume at very reaſonable and moderate exchange would be rais'd by this Stock, or perhaps ſav'd out of the very charge of the mannagement of this Trade. And it ought to be remembred that this is not the tieth of what was granted to be loſt by the Exportations of Wooll, which alſo will at length be pay'd by Forreigners; for 'tis certain, for the firſt, ſecond, or third year the Wooll was never intended to be ſold dearer than it was in <hi>England</hi> before the late Dutch War, when in ſeveral hands, and after that time, when the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſtock of Wooll is ſpent, the raiſing the price would be no prejudice to the Cloathiers.</p>
            <p>Beſides this would diſcourage the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> by any ſiniſter practiſes to endeavour the breaking this grant, ſince 'twould appear a Loſs to the Kings Revenue, as well as to all the People of <hi>England;</hi> for by how much the Subjects are impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, by ſo much is the Princes power weakned; nor is it on any pretence what-ever imaginable, His Majeſty would ever be induc'd to break this Grant; ſince the great care He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken in ſecuring the Wooll within theſe Dominions, ſhews His Gracious Inclinations and readineſs to effect it by any further way that ſhould be propos'd. And after a ſmall time He in His Priucely Wiſdom obſerving the vaſt benefit He and all His people would reap by this Act in the great advance of His Coſtoms and their Riches would by his own Example encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the wearing of Wollen Manufacture; and frequently iſſue forth His Proclamations for the due executing of all Laws tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto; and particularly the prohibition of Forreign Manufactures, and the Law for Burying in Woollen, which ſure is practicable, or elſe had never been made: If the Clergy be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to Bury none otherwiſe, it will quickly become Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96018:12"/>
And now it may be concluded all the Objections are fully Anſwer'd: As to the practicableneſs of the thing, 'tis very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and the Stock not very great, which the Cloathiers among themſelves may advance, or the greateſt part of it; and They having their votes in the mannagement of it, cannot fear its miſcarriage: though whether They be concern'd or not, it is plain 'tis the Companies intereſt to ſecure the Importation of all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wooll into <hi>England,</hi> and likewiſe to prevent the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which may be done either by buying it all up, or by re-eſtabliſhing Staple-Towns where only the Wooll ſhall be ſold, and the quantity Regiſtred, with the Buyers and Selles names, by which it may be trac'd to the very Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture. And beſides, that 'tis the Companies Intereſt (which will never lye) not to ſend any of their Wooll abroad, They will further give Perſonal ſecurity (if requir'd) not to Export any directly or indirectly into any Country but <hi>England,</hi> and be content the forfeiture of their Bonds be to <hi>Blackwell-Hall,</hi> or the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> if it appears the number of Stones bought, and ſhip'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be not actually landed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the danger of the Seas only excepted.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe the Magiſtrates in the ſeveral Ports in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be ob<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ig'd by an Act of Council to take yearly an exact account of all Wooll bought by the Company, and fixing theirs &amp; the Cuſtom-Houſe Seals, it may be ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and compar'd with the number of Stones landed there; the Account of which may alſo be certified by the chief Magiſtrate of the City, as well as chief Officer of the Port; and unleſs theſe two Accounts do agree, the Bonds to be forfeited.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome will ſay, though the Company ſhould not carry any abroad, yet others may, ſince the Wooll-growers have liberty to ſell to whom they pleaſe: To which it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd that it will behove this Company to prevent this by all imaginable care not only in <hi>Ireland</hi> but <hi>England</hi> alſo, by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ports abroad and at home: Beſides, after the firſt year, there cannot be a flock of Sheep in <hi>Ireland</hi> which they may not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96018:12"/>
know, and by that knowledge, eaſily find what becomes of of the Wooll; and their private Intelligence at home and abroad will diſcover ſuch Artifices, which (as things ſtand) can never be prevented, but by this Company, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage it will be to ſtop all the ways of doing it.</p>
            <p>Now in caſe any diſpute ſhall ariſe in diſtinguiſhing the ſeveral ſorts of Wooll, His Majeſty may appoint in every Port three indifferent Perſons choſen for Judges and skilful in Wooll, whoſe ſentence ſhall be definitive to both Buyer and Seller; and this will be no difficult matter when the Wooll is divided into Combing and Cloathing, which are eaſily diſtinguiſhable by their lengths: Now the Combing being of two ſorts, of a fine hair, and a courſe hair, becauſe the fineneſs of the one is countervail'd by the length of the other, there is no difference made in the price propos'd; but the Cloathing-Wooll being of two ſorts more unequal, they are conſequently differenc'd in value; the one ſort is of a thick grown, clotty, and fine hair, the other of a thin grown ſpurt, or courſe hair. Theſe three ſeveral ſorts are to be of a years growth, Tarry, Yoaky, Matty, Sandy, and extraordinary courſe excluded: The qualities of the fell Wooll are to be well ſorted, well waſhed, and well dryed.</p>
            <p>But if the People of <hi>Ireland</hi> think it troubleſome to have their Wooll ſorted, as is conſtantly done in <hi>England,</hi> when there ſold; there may be this courſe taken to give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: It is agreed on all hands that the Wooll of <hi>Tipperary</hi> is the beſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and 'tis generally known whoſe Wooll is the beſt of all that County, which being <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound, ſufficient Patterns, may be yearly taken of that, and ſent to the ſeveral Ports, which being concluded the Standard, ſhall be the meaſure of all the reſt; what equals it to be of the ſame ſort; that which comes nearer to it, or is further removed in goodneſs from it, to be the ſecond and third ſort.</p>
            <p>And if men imagine theſe Judges will not do equal Juſtice, by the ſame Analogy of Reaſon they muſt conclude
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96018:13"/>
ſo of all Judges, ſince upon the delivering their Commiſſions to them, they muſt be ſworn to be juſt, and that they may not forget their Duty, the Oath may yearly be given them before the chief Magiſtrates of the City, and not only turn'd out, but puniſh'd on complaint and conviction.</p>
            <p>As for the three Ports deſign'd in <hi>Ireland, Dublin, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and <hi>Cork,</hi> they are moſt conveniently Situated for all the Sheep walks of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and are thoſe from whence all the Wooll is Ship'd now, except what is Tranſported for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and what is Ship'd from one or two Ports very near adjacent to theſe, and in the ſame Line Eaſtward, only for the greater conveniency of a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Merchants dwelling in thoſe Ports. And that none may be Strangers to the Priſes offer'd, they were 10 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi>—6 <hi>d.</hi> &amp; 7 <hi>s.</hi> for the firſt, ſecond, and third ſort of Wooll, in caſe the Wooll-growers would not divide their Wooll into Combing &amp; Cloathing, which Rates were high enough when this propoſal was firſt ſet on foot, before the concluſion of the Peace, when the beſt was not worth above 7 <hi>s. per</hi> Stone; and though theſe rates were judg'd ſufficient by moſt of the Perſons of Quality of <hi>Ireland,</hi> lately in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by ſome of them, too great, as well as by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> yet it was intended by the Propoſers for a full ſatisfaction to the People of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give them, if they approv'd not of theſe, the ſame rates they receiv'd one year with another for the laſt 7 or 10 years, by making a computation of them altogether, and after dividing, to take the Quotient for the ſtanding price, during the Term; which may be done at the Lent-Aſſizes, before the Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they there producing ſufficient proofs of the prices year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd, or before others appointed for this matter. The occaſion of this alteration was, that after the Peace, the Wooll for a little while ſtarted to higher Prices, but fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen ſoon, inſomuch that now the beſt Wooll of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be bought at 8 <hi>s.</hi> &amp; 8 <hi>s.</hi>—6 <hi>d.</hi> as appears by ſeveral
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96018:13"/>
Letters from <hi>Ireland</hi> to Merchants here, and alſo by Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates from thence under ſeveral mens hands, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the former; and further add, that Wooll will fall lower, if the Markets in <hi>England</hi> do not riſe, of which 'tis ſaid here, there is no probability. And that is likely enough, if it be conſider'd that the Quantity of Wooll is much more in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than it was ſeven years ago, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year likely to encreaſe; and that the Wollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures are leſs, inſomuch that great quantities of old Wooll in both Kingdoms, even at this day, remain un-ſold. To prevent which inconveniencies, both to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> this honeſt Deſign was ſet on foot, which when rightly underſtood, will appear to be greatly the advantage of both Kingdoms. And ſince the ſeveral ſorts of Wooll are valued at ſuch certain rates in thoſe three Ports of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thoſe who live at a greater diſtance from them, though the carriage of their Wooll ſtands them in more; yet are equally dealt with, ſeeing the inequality is founded on this; that every Commodity of the growth or produce of that Country, and of every other, is ſo much the leſs worth in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, by how much farther they are from the chief ſeats of a Kingdom; and they have amends made by paying proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in the Rents of their Lands, as they are nearer or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Metropolis.</p>
            <p>'Tis poſſible one ſort of men will yet Object againſt this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, I mean thoſe who deal more upon Credit than Stock; to ſatisfie whom, it may be anſwer'd, if their Credit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be good ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be much more in Company; and this will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their making uſe of their Credit a part, which if in <hi>Ireland</hi> will gain them Wooll for their proportions of this Stock; if in <hi>England</hi> it will procure them money: And ſure 'tis far better to truſt theſe men, if aſſociated in a Company, who intends to leſſen the risk of the Sea, and to make the hazard leſs than when ſingle; for then every Creditor is more an Adventurer than he, or at leaſt as much; for if an accident at Sea or Land
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96018:14"/>
breaks him, the Creditor is a looſer, who truſting him, entred into Society, runs very little or no hazard: But if this ſatisfie not, they may employ their Credit in ſome other Trade, and if they could not, and this do appear a publick good, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few, than all ſhould ſuffer.</p>
