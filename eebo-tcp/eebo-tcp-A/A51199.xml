         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

without something of ostentation, I have ever own'd
and extol'd them; yet (my Lord) those men are so
few, and the beforementioned obligations of so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a nature, that I confess I have a desire both to
be more universally known your servant, and that the
world at the same time should take notice, that
though you may in my person have plac'd your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
upon an unworthy, yet that they have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
been conferr'd upon a grateful man. Such a
one (my Lord) I profess my self to be, and having no

diversion and acceptance, not suspecting that
you who have honour'd me so many other ways should
discountenance me in this, but rather protect me from

who know your Lordship for the noble person you are,
that I should here salute you with a finer Epistle
than peradventure I can write, or at least than this
is either likely, or in truth intended to be; not that I
would not present you with the best I have, but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Lordship aversion to such impertinencies
as men sometimes stuff their Dedications withall, I
should not only willfully offend you, but moreover step
out of my own design, which is very clear from the
vanity of thinking to advance your Honor or Name

            <head>The TRANSLATOR's
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man that has had no better luck in Printing
Books than I, and receiv'd from the world so
little thanks for his labour, should, one would
have thought, have taken some reasonable
warning, and in some moderate time have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over scribling; but notwithstanding these
disencouragements, I have hitherto, and do yet continue incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible,
as, whoever will take the pains to read them, will see
by the following Commentaries: and seeing I acknowledg this
to be a fault, and that every fault requires some excuse, I think
fit to give the Reader some account why I still persist so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to pester the world with my writings.</p>
            <p>It is not then out of any ill natur'd desire I have to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or any great ambition I have to be laught at; but beeing,
by a perpetual confinement to the solitude of my own House,
put eternally upon reading, that reading, when I meet with any
thing that pleases my own fancy, inspires me with a desire to
communicate such things as I conceive are worth knowing, and
are out of the common Road of ordinary Readers, to their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to dedicate those hours which I my self have
spent with some delight in such Translations, to their vacancy
and diversion.</p>
            <p>This is the true and only reason why I have, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do spend so much time about such things as these, and it
ought the less to offend the generality of men, because, though I
only pretend by it to oblige but a few persons, and those none
of the most considerable; yet it can be prejudicial to none, the
Author only excepted, and he can suffer by it, with none nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but such as will not take the pains to read him in his own
Language; for such as cannot do it ought to rest satisfied, and
<pb facs="tcp:105656:5"/>
provided the Subject be without reproach, are better with an ill
Translation than none at all.</p>
            <p>Such a one in plain truth is this; not that I am willing to
confess I have much missed the sense of the Author; but though
elegant enough for those times, 'tis a knotty piece in it self, and
though wrapt up in very good sense, yet writ by the rough
hand of a Soldier, and a rough one, and stuft up with old musty
Proverbs (the mode of wit it seems at that time) and such as
we have not sometimes Proverbs of our own to render them by,
and to English a Proverb without a Proverb, is to make that
unpleasant, and almost unintelligible in one Language, that is
queint and elegant in another; to repair which I have in some
places been necessitated almost to create Proverbs, or at least to
render his after a Proverbial way, to make them a little like the
Original.</p>
            <p>But I could wish this was the worst fault the Reader will
find in the Book; I am afraid it is not, and know also very
well there are some others, for which no man living could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a remedy (unless upon the Author's heads he would have
made a History of his own) to wit, intolerable digressions, and
those intolerably long, with so many, and so long-winded A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parenthesies,
included within tedious periods, as very much take
from the grace of his Style (of it self a rude one) and strangely
perplex the Reader; for which whether I should accuse Monsieur
<hi>de Montluc</hi>'s want of Art (which he himself confesses) or the
luxuriency of his fancy (which often hurries him from his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
I am yet to seek.</p>
            <p>I must also add, That though this Treatice have generally a
very good reputation in the world, yet there are some, who are
men of very great judgment, and who have no inclination to
discountenance either good writings, or good men, that decry
this Book for one of the vainest pieces that ever was writ; and
indeed they have reason on their side, there being a continued
thread of vanity and ostentation throughout the whole work,
<hi>ou par tout on trouvera les Gasconades a bon marché.</hi> But the Author
being a Gascon (to which Nation bragging is as natural, as bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very)
and the things he relates of himself being undeniably true,
I conceive he ought to be excus'd, and the rather, because it is
for the most part in vindication of himself from the ill offices
and slanders of those little Monsieurs of the Court, of whom he
so often complains, and gives himself the best description: a
sort of vermin, that in truth have evermore insinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into all Courts of Princes, especially that of <hi>France,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:105656:5"/>
the worthiest men in all Ages have ever been subject to the clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and private calumny of such as durst not so much
as have lookt on, to have beheld the brave actions perform'd by
those they were not afraid to traduce, and bespatter at the distance
of an hundred leagues, and under the protection of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
presence and favour.</p>
            <p>After all these objections which I have here set down, as well
to prevent others, as to excuse my self; I am now to tell you,
that had I not for all this thought this Book a very good
one, I should have found my self something else to do; and I
may venture to declare I think it so, since it has had so great a
reputation, with almost all sorts of men, that the truth of it in
no one particular (that I ever heard of) was ever disputed by any;
and that it has been allowed by all to be the best Soldiers Book,
that is, the best Book for the instruction of a Soldier that ever
was writ. Never certainly were Enterprizes design'd with more
judgment and resolution, nor ever carried on with greater bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and conduct than all his were; besides the labour, hazard,
and diligence, with which they were ever executed, were such as
perhaps had never been practis'd before, nor, for ought I ever heard
or read, ever imitated by any Frenchman since: from whence I
am apt to conclude, that either Monsieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Soldier of a Subject that ever was in <hi>France,</hi> or that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
of that Kingdom have not been so just to the rest, as he
has been to himself.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny but that to an invicible spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
constancy in suffering all the hardships of war, the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his nature, prompt, and perfectly Gascon, or else his zeal
to Religion, and the service of his Prince, or both, made him
sometimes do things which seem'd bloody and cruel; but the
necessity of the time, and the growing faction of the Hugon ots,
would have it so; neither do I think (I know not how discreet
I am in declaring so much) that Sacriledge and Rebellion can
be too roughly handled; and severity must needs appear a virtue,
where clemency would evidently have been a vice. As to the
rest, the Reader will find his Harangues well fitted to the several
occasions, his Deliberations prudent, and well grounded, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
sound, his Arguments rational, his Descriptions plain
and intelligible, and the whole well enough coucht, from a hand
that was better acquainted with a Sword than a Pen, and by a
man whose design, as well as profession, was rather to do
things worthy to be written, than to write things worthy to be
read.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105656:6"/>To conclude, I shall beg of the Reader in the behalf of the
brave Author, to consider him a poor Gentleman, bred up to
Arms, by which alone he pusht on his fortune to the highest
degree of honor, without any addition of Letters, or other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of education, the ordinary foundations of greatness,
than what he forg'd out of his own courage, and form'd out
of his own natural parts, which were notwithstanding such as
approv'd him a Captain of extraordinary valour and conduct,
and made him moreover allow'd to be a man of wit, Characters
which all the Historians do generally allow him, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Davila,</hi> though he only here and there glances upon his
name. For my self, I have nothing to say, but this, that although
this be no elegant, it is nevertheless (if I mistake not) an useful
piece: and though we have lost the use of Bows and Targets,
yet design and diligence will be in fashion, so long as the Practice
of Arms shall endure. I expose my share of it then to every
ones mercy, and good nature; such as will buy the Book, will
keep me in countenance; 'tis no matter whether they take the
pains to read it or no, for by that means my Bookseller's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
will be done, and as to the rest I shall not be much disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
my design being in plain truth (though I should be
glad, I confess, and proud it might take) chiefly to pass away
my own time, and to please my self.</p>

great abundance, which are elsewhere rarely to be

and peculiar to that Climate, and that compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively

'Tis to her Womb that the World stands oblig'd for those noble

those at this day living, who generously enflam'd with the Trophies

Mareschal of <hi>France.</hi> That Prerogative of Honor cannot be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him, no more than the gifts Heaven was pleased to conferre
upon him of a prompt and marvelous vivacity of understanding; of a
present, and nevertheless a very reserved prudence, which he discover'd
upon the most sudden and surprizing occasions in the management of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
of an admirable memory, and so rich, as the like is rarely to be
found, of a great facility of speech, strong, and bold, and full of incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of honor in the ardours of Battel; and in affairs of State,
of a grave and temperate eloquence, heightned and illustrated with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
Reasons, and Arguments, and all accompanied with so clear
and lively a judgment, that although be was destitute of Letters, the
beauty of his natural parts notwithstanding darkned the splendor of
those, who to a long experience in affairs, had joyn'd a perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act

            <p>The greatest part of you who knew him, and have often fought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

but the younger sort, who never had the good fortune to see this
great man, besides what they may have gather'd by report, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
know and understand him by his own commentaries, the actions
whereof you have seen him perform when living, and which he dictated
when sick, and languishing of that great Harquebuze shot which shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
his face at the Siege of <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> where for a farewel to Arms
he serv'd his Prince in the quality of Pioneer, Soldier, Captain, and
General at once, after which from his Bed to his Grave this generous
soul could never find any rest, which he was wont to say was his capital
Enemy, and gave him occasion towards his end to command this Distick
to be engrav'd upon his Tomb.

to posterity in a Chronicle of Honor. And, if I mistake not, there
will hardly be found a History more repleat with variety, more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

very wise and circumspect leaders: but if any such there be, this,
above all others, will easily obtein the precedence, and enform you (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Nobless) of all the good and evil events that attend the fortune,
or misfortune, the valour or the cowardize, the prudence or inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of him who is Chief or General of an Army, or who is Prince
or Sovereign of a mighty Kingdom. You have here wherewith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
your fancy, to discretion your valour, to martialize your wisdom,
and to form the true honor of a School of War. The Commentaries of
this second Caesar will make you Doctors in Military Discipline, and
will serve you for Model, Mirror, and Exemple; they have no ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
lustre, no affected artifice, no foreign ornament of borrowed beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
'Tis nothing but simple Truth that is nakedly presented before you.</p>

This is he, who having the first arriv'd to the highest step of all the

Country both by his Sword and his Pen, and to such a degree, that
the name of the <hi>Montluc</hi>'s shall gloriously live in the memory of a long

that your Captain and Historian, as he knew how prudently to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,

his Pen, but equally eminent in that faculty, to record with truth
and judgment, what he had acted before with the greatest courage and

               <l>Thy self must thy own deeds commend,</l>

House, there to seek some little Repose after the infinite Pains
and Labours I had undergone, during the space of above fifty
years, that I bore Arms for the several Kings my Masters, in
which Service I past all the Degrees and through all the Orders
of Soldier, Ensign, Lieutenant, Captain, Camp-Master, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of Places, his Majesties Lieutenant in the Provinces of
<hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> and Mareschal of <hi>France:</hi> finding my
self maimed in almost all my Limbs, with Harquebuz-Shots,
Cuts and Thrusts with Pikes and Swords, and by that means rendred almost useless
and good for nothing, without strength or hope ever to be cured of that great Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>buz
-Shot in my Face, and after having resign'd my Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> into his
Majesties hands: I thought fit to employ the Remainder of my Life in a Description
of the several Combats, wherein I have been personally engag'd in the space of two
and fifty years, that I had the Honour to command: assuring my self, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains
who shall take the pains to read my Life, will therein meet with Passages, that
may be useful to them in the like Occasions, and of which some Advantage may be
made to the acquiring of Honour and Renown. And although I have in the several En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
I have undertaken (and some of them perhaps without great Reason on my side
justifie my Proceedings) been exceedingly fortunate, and successful beyond all humane
Aim; I would not yet any one should conceive that I attribute the Success or the
Glory thereof to any other, than to God alone; and indeed whoever shall consider the
Dangers and Difficulties I have gone through and overcome, cannot but therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Almighty and immediate Arm. Neither have I ever fail'd to implore
his Assistance in all my Undertakings, and that with great Confidence in his Grace and
Mercy, and Assurance of it; wherein his Divine Majesty has been pleased so far to be
gratiously assisting to me, that I have never been defeated nor surpriz'd in any Exploit
of War, where I have been in command; but on the contrary have ever carried away
Victory and Honour. And it is very necessary and fit, that all we who bear Arms, should
ever consider and always confess, that we, of our selves, can do nothing without his
Divine Bounty, which inspires us with Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and supplies us with Strength to
attempt and execute those great and hazardous Enterprises which present themselves to
our Undertaking.</p>
            <p>And because some of those who shall read these Commentaries (for it will be very
hard to please all, though some will set a just value upon my Book) may perhaps think
it strange, and accuse me of Vain-Glory for writing my own Actions; and say, that
I ought in Modesty to have transferred that Work to another Hand: I shall tell such
once for all, that in writing the Truth, and attributing to God the Glory thereof, there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105656:12"/>
will be no harm done: Neither (besides that the Testimonies of several Men of
Honour yet living will justifie the Truth of what I shall deliver) can any one give a
better Account of the Designs, Enterprizes, and Exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntions, and the Actions happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereupon, than my self, who was an Eye-witness, and an Actor in them all;
and who also design not herein to deprive any one of his due and particular Honour.
The greatest Captain that ever liv'd was <hi>Caesar</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caesar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and he has led me the way, having
himself writ his own Commentaries, and being careful to record by Night the Actions
he performd by Day. I would therefore by his Exemple contrive mine, how rude
and impolisht soever (as coming from the hand of a Soldier, and moreover a <hi>Gascon,</hi>
who has ever been more solicitous to do, than to write or to speak well) Wherein shall
be comprehended all the Exploits of War, in which I have either been personally enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
or that have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en performed by my Direction; and those beginning from my
greener years, when I first came into the World; to signifie to such as I shall leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
me, how restless I (who am at this day the oldest Captain in <hi>France)</hi> have ever been
in the Search and Acquisition of Honour, in performing Services for the Kings my
Masters, which was my sole and only end, ever flying all the Pleasures and Delights,
which usually divert young men whom God has endowed with any commendable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and who are upon the point of their Advancement, from the Paths of true Virtue
and undisputed Greatness. A Book not intended however for the Learned Men of the
World, they have Historians enough of their own, but for a Soldier, and wherein a
Captain, and perhaps a Lieutenant of a Province may find something that may be worth
his Observation. At the least I can affirm that I have written the Truth; having my
Memory as good and entire at this instant as ever, and being as perfect in the Names
both of Men and Places, as if all things had past but yesterday, as yet I never committed
any thing to Paper, for I never thought at such an Age as this, to undertake any thing
of this kind: which whether I have well or ill performed, I refer my self to such, as
shall do me the Honour to read my Book, which is properly an Account of my own
Life.</p>
            <p>To you therefore (Captains my Companions) it is, that this Treatise does princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
address itself, to whom peradventure it may in some measure be useful. And
you ought to believe that having so many years been in the same Command wherein
you now are, and having so long discharg'd the Office of a Captain of Foot, and
thrice that of Camp Master and Colonel, I must needs have retein'd something of that
Condition, and that in a long Experience I have seen great Honours confer'd upon
some, and great Disgraces befal others of that Degree. There have been some who
in my time have been cashier'd and degraded their Nobility, others who have lost their
Lives upon a Scaffold, others dishonoured and dismist to their own Houses, without
ever having been more regarded either by the King or any other: And on the contrary,
I have seen others who have trail'd a Pike at six Francs pay, arrive at great Preferments,
performing things so brave, and manifesting themselves men of so great Capacity,
that several who in their Original have been no better than the Sons of poor labouring
Men, have rais'd themselves above many of the Nobility by their Prowess and Virtue.
Of all which having my self been an Eye-Witness, I am able to give a precise and a
true Account. And although I my self am a Gentleman by Birth, yet have I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
been rais'd to that degree of Honour wherein I now stand, as leisurely,
and as much step by step, as any the poorest Soldier who has serv'd in this Kingdom
these many years. For being born into the World the Son of a Gentleman, whose
Father had made sale of all his Estate, to only eight hundred or a thousand Livres
yearly Revenue, and being the eldest of six Brothers that we were, I thought it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
concern'd me to illustrate the Name of <hi>Montluc</hi> (which is that of our Family)
as I have also done with as much Peril, and as many Hazards of my Life, as Soldier or
Captain ever did; and that without ever having the least Reproach from those by whom
I was commanded; but on the contrary with as much Favour and Esteem as ever
any Captain had who bore Arms in the Armies, wherein I had the Honour to serve.
Insomuch that whenever there happened any Enterprise of Importance, or Danger, the
Kings Lieutenants, and Collonels, would as seon, or sooner, put me upon it, as any
other Captain of the Army; of which the ensuing pages will give you sufficient Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>From the time therefore that I was first advanc'd to the Degree of an Ensign,<note place="margin">Play, Drink, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it my business to understand the Duty of an Officer, and to learn to be wise by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple

To which purpose I first totally wean'd my self from Play, Drink, and Avarice; as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105656:12"/>
knowing well, that all Captains of that Complexion, are so unfit ever to arrive at any

which Youth is very prone unto, and which are very prejudicial to the Reputation of
a Chief. Of these Play is of such a Nature, that it subjects a man, neither to do nor
intend any other thing, and that whether he win or lose; for if you win, you are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
solicitous to find out new Gamesters, being prepossest with an Opinion, that you
shall still win more, and continue in that Error until all be lost. Being reduc'd to this

Enemy by laudable Stratagems of War, you plot nothing else, but how to ruin your
Camrade and Friend by an infamous Cheat at Cards or Dice? This must of necessity
wholly divert you from your Duty; whereas you ought to be continually amongst
your Soldiers, and so frequent, as if possible to know every man by his distinct Name;
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that for these two Ends, first to prevent any Acts of Insolence in their Quarters, for
which you may expect and fear a just Reproach from the Lieutenant of the Province or
your own immediate Colonel: And in the next place to take care that there happen no
Mutiny amongst them; nothing being more pernicious to a Company, nor of more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Consequence to an Army, than mutinous Spirits. And how can you possibly have an
Eye to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch Disorders, or give any tolerable Account of the Trust reposed in you, when
your Heart shall be wholly bent upon Play; that will alarm you a hundred and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times a day, and put you besides your self. Fly then (my dear Companions)
fly I beseech you this hateful Vice, which I have often known to be the Ruine of many,
not only in their Fortunes; but which is more, and that ought to be dearer, in their
Honour and Reputation.</p>
            <p>Now for what concerns Wine; if you be subject to debauch, you cannot avoid
falling into as many and as great Inconvenienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s as he that Plays; for nothing in the
World so much stupefies the understanding of a Man, and that inclines him so much
to sleep, as Wine. If you drink but little you will consequently not eat too much;
for Wine calls upon the Appetite to eat, that you may the longer enjoy the Pleasure
of Drinking: So that in the end being full of Meat and Drink before you rise from
Table, it will be necessary to go sleep, and perhaps at such a time when you ought to
be amongst your Soldiers and Companions, near your Colonel and Camp-Master, to
enquire what News or Orders they have received from the Kings Lieutenant, that you
may know when any Occasion is presented, wherein you may employ your Valour and
Wisdom. To this; Excess in Wine brings along with it another and extreme Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which is, that a Captain being drunk knows not how himself to command, and less
how to permit others to do it; but will fall to striking and beating his Soldiers without
all Sense or Reason; whereas, if there were a just Occasion, he ought first to chastise
his Soldier with Remonstrances, mixt with some tart Menaces and Reproofs, giving
him to understand, that if he relapse into the same Offence, he is to expect nothing
but an exemplary Punishment. And is it not better to chastise your Soldier with
Words and Threats, than with Bastinadoes, Cuts and Thrusts, killing him or maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Limbs which Wine will prompt you to do? Neither must you expect to
be the more fear'd for such Usage of your men, but on the contrary mortally hated by
all your Soldiers. And what rare Exploits can you think to perform with men that
hate you? I beseech you believe me, for I have seen the Experience of it, as much
as another of my Age, I have seen no less than four Captains die by the hands of their
own Soldiers, who have assassinated them behind, for the ill Usage they have receiv'd
at their hands. They are Men as we are, not Beasts; if we be Gentlemen, they are
Soldiers; they have Arms in their Hands, which inspire Mettle into any man's Brest,
that bears them. Wine is apt to make you unreasonable and bloody for the least Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and that without all manner of Discretion, for you are not your selves. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
neither the Kings Lieutenant, nor your own Colonel, nor Camp-Master will
ever put you upon any Enterprize of Honour, that might perhaps procure your
Advancement; but will say, Shall we entrust an Execution of this importance to such
an one as will be drunk, when he ought to have his Wits about him to know and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
what he has to do? He will do nothing but throw away so many men, and
by his ill Conduct bring upon us Loss and Confusion. O the vile Repute that this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105656:13"/>
Wine will brand you withal, when nothing of good shall be expected from you! Fly
then (my Companions) fly then this Vice, equally hateful, and more beastly, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
than the former.</p>
            <p>A Captain likewise should in no manner be covetous; for though Wine and Play
may most aptly be term'd Companions, yet Avarice is also one of the Gang that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
a million of Mischiefs, and brings as great or greater Inconveniences upon a
Leader, as any other Vice whatever. For in the first place, if you suffer your self to
be carried away by this insatiate Thirst of getting, it is most certain, that you shall
never have a Soldier worth any thing under your Command; all the good Men will
avoid you, and report of you, that you value a <hi>French</hi> Crown more than a valiant Man;
so that you shall never have men of any Resolution about you, but such as upon the
first Occasion wherein you ought to give a Testimony of your Valour and Conduct,
will leave you in the lurch, where you must either fly to your eternal Infamy, or stay
to lose your Life, and that without any hopes notwithstanding, whether you live or
die, ever to recover your Reputation. For if you be kild, though you have done
bravely in your own person, every one will be apt to say, that your great Avarice
brought you to your Ruine, for want of good men to stand faithfully by you; and if
you save your self by running away, be you sure you will imprint such a mark in
your Fore-heads, as it will be hard ever to wash away; at least you will be oblig'd to
hazard your Life upon all Occasions more than another man, to clear the Prejudice that
all men will have against you, and to wipe away the Blemish wherewith you have
spotted your Reputation; wherein 'tis great odds you will lose either Life or Limb.
And after all (as it is the ordinary Recompence of men who are more than commonly
adventurous upon such occasions) for the Reward of your Merit it shall be said, that
the Despair of your former Miscarriage, has push'd you upon the Execution you shall
have perform'd, and not your own Bravery and Resolution. O how many more
Misfortunes could I here reckon, that have befaln, and do daily befal Commanders, who
have been and are tainted with this avaritious humor?</p>
            <p>I know you will ask me now, what shall we do, if we do not lay up money, and
clip the Soldiers Pay? When the War is at an end, we must go to the Hospital,
for neither the King nor any one else will regard us, and we are poor of our selves.
But can you imagine that a wise and valiant Captain, a man of great Attempt and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
shall be sent to starve in an Hospital, as if such men flutter'd in a Camp by
hundreds; It were well for the King and the whole Kingdom, if there were but
a dozen such in an Army. Put forward then to get but a Leg amongst this dozen,
and try to get in by your Valour, Wisdom, and Virtue. For these twelve cannot live
for ever, and one being dead, though you cannot skrew in your whole Body at that
time, yet you may edge in the one half, and the next that dies, you are in. And
can you then believe, that either the King or any of the Princes, who have taken
cognizance of your Valour, will suffer you to go to the Hospital? This is an Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
so unb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>coming a wise and valiant Captain, that it is only sutable to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, and mean hide-bound fellows of no Value nor Account. And
whoever applies himself to great and generous Actions, and has a care with Diligence
and virtuous Resolution to exclude and banish from his Thoughts all the fore-mention'd
Vices, nothing can be wanting to him. I have said that it were a great deal, if there
were a dozen only such men in an Army; but if there were an hundred, yet the King
is rich enough to provide that men of that Merit need not be sent to the Hospital.
Or suppose that the King could not suddenly provide for the support of such deserving
men;<note place="margin">A brave Man is never to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of his Fortune.</note> there is notwithstanding no Prince, nor any other great Person, who has been
engag'd in the War, where you shall have signaliz'd your selves for men of Honour,
who will not be proud to receive and take some one into his Care and Protection,
and that will not take hold of all occasions of doing you a good Office to the King, and
of advancing you into some degree, and then on the other side, can you think the King
will always continue you in the same Condition, or leave you in the same Command?
Do not believe it, but assure your selves, that such men will be lookt after, on whom
to confer the Care and Honour of greater Employments, who have honourably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged those of less moment and account.</p>
            <p>I pray what was I, but a poor Soldier like one of you? What were, or what yet
are so many valiant Captains yet living, for whom the King and all Mankind have a
singular Esteem? Have we who are yet in being enrich'd our selves by nimming from
our Soldiers Pay? Have we purchas'd any great Estates out of the Thefts of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
I could name some of our own Country of <hi>Guienne</hi> (who could get nothing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105656:13"/>
but I must know it, no more than I could unknown to them) who have never got five
hundred Crowns by their Service; and yet are those men despis'd? Are they sent to
the Hospital? The King, the Queen, the Monsieur, all the Princes of the Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d,
and all the Lords of the Court have so great a Respect for these men, out of the esteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
very one has of their Valour, that they have got the start of many great men in the
Kingdom. Nay when they are in their own Country (where no man is a Prophet)
they are there honour'd by men of all sorts and conditions, not from the Families from
whence they are descended, nor for the Possessions they enjoy; but upon the single
account of their own Merit. Now there are some who perhaps will say, If I do not
purloin from the King, and poll from the Soldier, now whilst I am in Command,
how shall I make Provision for my Children? To wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princes will then make of the Sons of such Fathers as I have mentioned, and of yours,
who will not dare to appear before Men of Honour, having their Faces covered with
their Fathers Shame? But perhaps some one may say, that I for my part, by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Commands I have been invested withal by the King, have rais'd great Profits
and got a great Estate, and therefore may talk at my ease: But I protest before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, and call him to witness, that in my whole Life I never had thirty
Crowns more than my Pay; and what Condition soever I have been in, or what
honourable Commissions soever I have had, whether in <hi>Italy,</hi> or in <hi>France,</hi> I have
ever been necessitated to borrow money to carry me home.</p>
            <p>At my Return from <hi>Sienna,</hi> where I had the Honour to command in the quality of
the Kings Lieutenant, Monsieur the <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>schal de Strossy</hi> gave me five hundred Crowns.
When I returned a second time from <hi>Montalsin,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Beauclair,</hi> who was our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
was fain to examine all the Purses in Town to provide me three hundred and
fifty Crowns to carry me to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and yet I had no less than ten Gentlemen in my
Company. The Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> furnish'd me with a supply when I put my self into
<hi>Verseil,</hi> and afterwards to carry me to <hi>Lions,</hi> where I found in <hi>Catherin Ican</hi> the Post-Masters
hand, two or three thousand Francs that <hi>Martinean</hi> had there deposited for
me, of my Pay, with which I defrayed my Charges to Court. To a worthy and a
brave man, nothing can ever be wanting. Now would I fain know, if for all this
I ever went to the Hospital, and whether I have not advantaged my self a hundred
times more in serving my Kings and Masters, in all Integrity and Loyalty, than by all
the Tricks and Shifts I could have? Oh (my Companions) take exemple by those who
for having been loyal in their Charges, can walk with their Faces erect before all the
World, and are therefore honoured and esteemed by all sorts of men; and not by
such who by the Conscience of their Crimes are constrained to hide their heads in their
houses, or that make their Posterity blush for them. Wealth will fall upon you
when you least dream on 't, or expect it; and one Reward or Bounty from the
King, is worth more than all the sharking Tricks, Thefts, and Larc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O how happy are those Soldiers, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow Leaders, that for their Prowess and
Virtue are esteem'd by all the World! How secure are their Lives and Honours under
such Captains, and into what Disasters and Disgraces do those frequently fall, who
follow the more unworthy sort of men. For with the former you shall learn and
acquire Honour and Renown, that will raise you to an equal degree with your Chiefs,
and on the contrary following the latter, you shall learn nothing but Vices, or at least
things of very little Value, and they will rather lead you on to the ruine of your Lives,
than to the Advancement of your Honour and the Improvement of your Name, there
being nothing else to be learn'd of such as have no Valour nor Virtue in themselves.
A man may serve a long Apprenticeship under a bad Master, and perhaps, not be much
the wiser when he has done: but provided you be free from the three fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Vices, and that you have Honour in your Prospect, it is impossible but
that all things must succ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and as soberly as you can, and without losing your selves in the Labyrinth, and
that is, the Love of Women. Imbark not by any means in that Affair, for it is utterly
an Enemy to an heroick Spirit. Leave Love at home whilest <hi>Mars</hi> is in the field; you
will afterwards have but too much leisure for those Delights. I can safely say, that
never any fond Affection, or affectionate Folly of that kind could ever divert me from
undertaking and executing what was given me in command. Such little Amoroso's as
these are fitter to handle a Distaff than a Sword. Love is a great Enemy to a Soldier, and
besides the debauch and the time lost in those little Intrigues, it is an Occupation that
begets a numberless number of Quarrels, and sometimes even with your dearest
Friends. I have known more People fight even upon this account, than upon the score
of Honour. And what a horrid thing it is, that a man should forfeit his Reputation,
and very often lose his Life for the Love of a Woman! As for you Soldiers, above all
things I recommend to you the Obedience that you owe to your Commanders, to the
end that you may one day learn how to command: for it is impossible that Soldier
should ever know how to command, who has not first learn'd to obey: And take
notice, that the Virtues and Discretion of a Soldier are chiefly manifested in his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and in his Disobedience lies the Ruin of his Life and Honour. A resty Horse
never yet made good Proof. The Proverb will serve, and you ought not to flight the
Advice I give you, if but in respect to my Experience, who have seen a great deal;
and I must needs be a very ignorant and senseless fellow, if in all this time of my Life,
I have made no Observations of the Successes and Misfortunes both of the one and the
other. But I have committed some to memory, and that is it which has given me
occasion to write this Book in the latter end of my days.</p>
            <p>Having in my greener years been bred up in the Family of <hi>Anthony</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Montluc</hi>'s Education.</note>
and now grown up towards a Man, I was presently preferred to an Archer's Place in
the Dukes own Company, Monsieur <hi>Bayard</hi> being at that time Lieutenant to the same.
Not long after being enflam'd with the Report of the noble Feats of Arms every day
perform'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> which in those days was the Scene of Action, I was possess'd with
a longing desire to visit that Country. To this end making a Journey into <hi>Gascony,</hi>
I made shift to procure of my Father a little Money and a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, and without
further delay began my Journey in order to my Design, leaving to Fortune the hopes
of my future Advancement and Honour.<note place="margin">His first Sally.</note> About a days Journey from my Fathers
house, and near unto <hi>Leitoure,</hi> I turn'd a little out of my way to visit the Sieur <hi>de
Castetna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> an antient Gentleman who had long frequented <hi>Italy,</hi> of him to inform
my self at large of the State, Condition, Manners and Customs of that Country in
order to my future Conduct. This Gentleman told me so many things, and related
to me so many brave Exploits which were there every day perform'd, that without
longer abode, or staying any where longer than to refresh my self and my Horse, I past
over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and took my way directly to <hi>Milan.</hi> Being come to <hi>Milan,</hi> I there
found two Uncles of mine by my Mothers side, call'd the <hi>Stillatts,</hi> both of them men
of great Reputation and Esteem, of which the one serv'd under Monsieur <hi>de Lescut,</hi>
Brother to Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> (the same who was afterwards Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi>
and then known by the Name of the <hi>Mareschal de Foix)</hi> by whom I was presently put
into an Archers place in his own Company, a Place of great Repute in those days,
there being in those times several Lords and great Persons who rode in Troops, and
two or three who were Archers in this; but since that Discipline is lost and grown
degenerate, and all things are turn'd upside down, without hopes that any man now
alive shall ever see them restor'd to their former Estate.</p>
            <p>At this time the War betwixt <hi>Francis</hi> the First and the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth
broke out again with greater Fury than before, the later to drive us out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
we to maintain our Footing there, though it was only to make it a place of Sepulture
to a world of brave and valiant <hi>French.</hi> God Almighty rais'd up these two great
Princes sworn Enemies to one another, and emulous of one anothers Greatness; an
Emulation that has cost the Lives of two hundred thousand Persons, and brought a
million of Families to utter Ruin; when after all neither the one nor the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd any other advantage by the Dispute, than the bare Repentance of having been
the causers of so many Miseries, and of the Effusion of so much Christian Bloud. If
God had pleas'd that these two Monarchs might have understood one another, the
whole Earth had trembled under their Arms; and <hi>Solyman</hi> who was contemporary
with them, and who during their Contests enlarg'd his Empire on every side, would
have had enough to do to defend his own. The Emperour was, 'tis true, a great and
a magnanimous Prince, yet in nothing superiour to our Master, during his Life, saving
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105656:15"/>
in a little better Success, and in that God gave him the Grace to bewail his Sins in a
Convent, into which he retir'd himself two or three years before his Death. During
the space of two and twenty months that this War continued, I had the good fortune
to be an Eye-witness of several very brave Actions, which were very fit to season a
raw Soldier; neither did I fail continually to present my self in all places and upon all
occasions, where I thought Honour was to be purchas d at what price soever; and it
is to be imagin'd I had my share of fighting, when I had no less than five horses
kill d under me in the short continuance of that Service, and of those two in two days,
which Monsieur <hi>de Roquelaure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Five horses kill'd under Monsieur <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> who was Cosen Germain to my Mother, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to give me. For in this beginning of my armes I had the good fortune to gain
so far upon the affections of the whole Company, that my horses being lost, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one was willing to help to remount me, and being moreover taken prisoner in
Battel, I was soon after delivered by the procurement of my friends.</p>
            <p>Let such therefore as intend to acquire honour by feats of Arms, resolve to shut
their eyes to all hazards, and dangers whatever, in the first encounter where they
shall happen to be present; for that's the time when every one has his eyes fix'd upon
them, to observe their behaviour, and thence to form a judgment of their future
hopes. If in the beginning they shall, by any handsom action, signalize their courage,
and boldness, it sets a good mark upon them for ever, and not only makes them
noted, and regarded by all: but moreover inspires them themselves with mettle, and
vigour to perform more,<note place="margin">The loss of the Dutchy of <hi>Millan.</hi>
               </note> and greater things. Now you must know that in this War
we lost the Dutchy of <hi>Millan.</hi> Of which (though I do not pretend to be any great
Clerk) I could write the true History, and should his Majesty command me, I would
deliver the truth, and I am able to give as good an account (though I was my self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
young at that time) as any man whatever in <hi>France,</hi> I mean of those passages where
I had the fortune to be present, and no other; for I will write nothing by hearsay.
But I intend not to busie my self with a Relation of other mens actions, and less of
the faults, and oversights by them committed, though they are yet as fresh in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
as at that moment; and seeing that what I my self perform'd in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, at that time, was in the quality of a private Souldier only, I being not as yet
step'd into Command: I shall no longer insist upon this melancholy Subject, which
has also been writ before by others: only this I shall make bold to affirm, that
Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> was by no means to be blam'd, he having there performed all
the parts of a good, and prudent General; and, who indeed was in himself one of
the greatest men I ever knew. Neither shall I trouble my self to give a narration of
the Battel of the <hi>Bicoque,</hi> in which I fought on foot, as also did Monsieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy,</hi>
since Constable of <hi>France;</hi> A Battel that Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to consent unto, through the obstinacy of the <hi>Swisse,</hi> quite contrary to his own
judgment. A Nation whose wilfulness I have seen occasion the loss of several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; cause great inconveniences in his Majesties affairs.<note place="margin">A Character of the <hi>Swisse.</hi>

then they must never want, either money, or victuals; for they are not to be paid with
words.</p>
            <p>After the unfortunate loss of this fair Dutchy of <hi>Millan,</hi> all the forces returned
back into <hi>France,</hi> and with them the Company of the said Mareschal <hi>de Foix,</hi> wherein
I then had not only the place of a Man at armes; but moreover an Assignation of an
Archers pay. Sometime after the Emperour set another Army on foot to recover
<hi>Fontarabie;</hi> whereupon our Company, and several others were ordered to repair to
<hi>Bayonne</hi> to Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> who was his Majesties Lieutenant in <hi>Guienne.</hi> The
said Sieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> that he might the better make head against the enemy, (who
made a shew of attempting something upon the Frontier) made a suddain leavy of
fourteen or fifteen Ensigns of Foot; which was the occasion that I (who ever had an
inclination for foot service) entreated leave of Captain <hi>Sayas</hi> (who carryed the Cornette
in the absence of Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> his brother) for three months only; that I might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of an Ensign offer'd to me by Captain <hi>Clotte;</hi> who at last very unwillingly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my suite, although he himself had first sent to Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> to sollicite it in
my behalf Suddainly after this (the Enemy being dayly reinforced with fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies)
<hi>la Clotte</hi> was commanded away to <hi>Bayonne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Montluc</hi> made Ensign of foot.</note> &amp; a few days after that, Captain <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
took the Companies of Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> and the Mareschal his brother, with
two Companies of Foot, to wit, that of <hi>Megrin Comenge,</hi> and <hi>la Clotte</hi> to conduct us
thorough the Woods straight to St. <hi>Iean de Luz,</hi> where the enemies Camp at that
time lay. So soon as we were arrived at the top of a little Hill about half a quarter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105656:16"/>
of a League distant from <hi>Luz</hi> (having already pass'd a little River by a wooden bridge,

               </gap>oot whereof, and before
us, there ran a rivolet of fifteen, or twenty paces broad, and deep to a mans girdle,
joyning to which there is also a plain which extends it self in an easie descent,
down to the said Rivolet; from whence one may easily discover St. <hi>Iean de Luz,</hi> one
of the finest Bourgs in all <hi>France,</hi> and seated upon the Margent of the Ocean Sea)
Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> who commanded the Party, leaving two Cornets upon this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hill, the one whereof was carried by Captain <hi>Sayas,</hi> which was ours, and
the other by Captain <hi>d' Andouins,</hi> which was that of Monsicur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> (but both
of them onely in the absence, the one of Captain <hi>Carbon,</hi> the other of Captain <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquiloube,)</hi>
and only twenty horse with each, together with our two Companies of foot,
took the rest of the <hi>Gens-d' armes,</hi> and with them Monsieur <hi>Gramont,</hi> the same who
afterwards dyed in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and who was at this time Lieutenant to
the Company belonging to Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this Party Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> pass'd over the little River, and having divided his
men into three squadrons (as one might easily discern from the Hill where we
stood) trotted along the plain directly towards St. <hi>Iean de Luz.</hi> Being come to the
middle of the plain, he there made a halt for an hour, or more, whilst a Trumpet
went twice, and sounded the <hi>Fanfare</hi> to the Enemy, after which being about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
as not believing any one would stir out of the Enemies Camp, the forlorn which
he had sent out towards the utmost skirts of the plain, return'd back upon the spur,
to acquaint him that all the Enemies Camp began to move; and suddenly after we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to discover three of their Squadrons of Horse, appearing upon their march, one
upon the heels of another,<note place="margin">The Action at St. <hi>Iean de Luz.</hi>
               </note> and making directly towards Monsieur <hi>de Carbon.</hi> Of
these the first that came up, presently, and smartly charg'd the foremost of ours, where
there were many Launces broken on both sides; but more of ours, than theirs, for
as much as in those times the Spaniards carried but few Launces, and those very slender,
long, and pointed at both ends. During this charge Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> was leisurely
drawing off the other two Squadrons towards the place where we were, when the
second of the Enemies squadrons coming up, and uniting with the first, beat up our
first to our second squadron, commanded by Monsieur <hi>Gramont,</hi> where the skirmish
was very hot, and a great many men thrown to ground both on the one side, and
other, amongst whom were the Seigneurs <hi>de Gramont,</hi> who had his horse kill'd under
him, <hi>de Luppe</hi> Standard-bearer to Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec, de Poigreffi,</hi> who is since turn'd
Hugonot, <hi>de la Fay de Xaintonge,</hi> who is yet living, and divers others. At the same
instant we discover'd another great Party of Horse advancing towards us a little on
our left hand, at the sight of which the Captains who carried our Colours came both
of them running to me, and saying we are all lost, whereupon I told them, that it
were better, than so to conclude, to hazard fourscore, or an hundred Foot, to bring off
our Horse who were engag'd. To which <hi>la Clotte,</hi> and <hi>Megrin</hi> made answer, that that
venture would only occasion a greater loss, and that moreover they very much doubted
the Souldiers would hardly be perswaded to go down, seeing death so manifest before
their eyes. Now you must understand there was no one present at this discourse, sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the two forementioned Captains, and my self, our Foot standing drawn up four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
or fifteen paces behind; and it was not amiss; for I make a great question had they
heard what we said, and seeing the <hi>Gens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> d' armes</hi> in manifest danger to be lost, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I should have been so chearfully followed, as I was. And it is a good rule, as much
as a man can to conceal from the Souldier the danger of any enterprize, if you intend
to have them go briskly to their work. To this last objection of the two Captains, I
made answer that I would run the hazard to lead them on, and that lost, or lost not, it
was better to hazard, and to lose fourscore, or an hundred Foot, than all our <hi>Geus-d'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armes.</hi>
And thereupon without further deliberation (for long consultations are often
the ruine of brave attempts) I return'd back to the Souldiers, and the Captains with
me (for the business requir'd hast) saying to them only these few words, Come
on, come on Comrades, let us go, and relieve our <hi>Gens-d' armes,</hi> and was thereupon
follow'd by an hundred Foot of our own Company, who with very great resolution
descended with me to the foot of the Hill, where at the head of my men I passed over
the brook, and there deliver'd twenty of my men to be led by the Bastard of <hi>Auzan,</hi>
a Gentleman who has nothing blemish'd the legitimate Sons of his race; though all of
them men of singular bravery, and remarkeable valour.</p>

fellows, and the greatest Cowards; Poltrons that had not dar'd to look those men
in the face at hand, which at distance they laid dead with their confounded bullets:
but it was the Devil's invention to make us murther one another. Being thus past
the River, I order'd the Bastard <hi>d' Auz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

present as if they intended to do it, to the end that he might favour mine, and give
them time to discharge and retire again into their order, Now when I was under
the foot of the Hill, I could not possibly see what our men did; but being advanc'd
a little further into the plain, I saw all the Enemies three Squadrons drawn up into
one body, and the great party on the left hand, marching upon a good round trot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards ours, who were rallyed, and stood firm, without being able either
to advance forwards, or to retire back, by reason of some great stones that lay
scatter'd in their Rear. Here it was that Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> (who had no Arms on,
having before been wounded in his left arm by an Arquebuze shot) seeing me so n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will never forsake thee: Captain, said I, take you only care to save your self, and your
<hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> at the same instant crying out, shoot, Comrades, at the head of these
Horse. I was not above a dozen paces distant from the Enemy when I gave them this
Volley, by which (as it appear'd by the testimony of the Prisoners, who were taken a
few days after) above fifty Horses were kill'd, and wounded, and two Troopers
slain, an execution that a little cool'd their courage, and caus'd their Troops to make
a halt. In the mean time Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> had leisure with his party to retire full
gallop towards the brook I had pass'd over to relieve him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where such as had their
horses lost, taking hold of the others horse tayls sav'd themselves also, and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> had passed the River with his Horse, remounted Monsieur <hi>de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>

Marish, and of which I might be within some twelve, or fourteen paces, which not
only hindred him from getting up to me, but moreover gave him enough to do to

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time made a shew, as if they meant to charge, but they

               </gap>s of the ditch, I caused them all in an instant to throw themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and under favour of <hi>d' Auzan,</hi> almost as suddainly to mount the ditch bank
on the other side, over which we all got safe and sound, saving three Soldiers, who
were slain with Harquebuze shot, for not having been so nimble as the rest; and here
it was that, as in a little sort, I made head against the Enemy. Now you must know,
that that party of the Enemy which came up on the left hand, made a halt at the
bank of the River, when they saw our Horse were already got half way up the hill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and those who had fought, and to whom I had given a stop at the ditch bank,
were now upon their retreat home, when seeing three Squadrons of Harquebusiers
coming along the plain, and making towards them with all the speed they could,
it reviv'd their spirits, and inspir'd them with new courage to face about again. I,
in the mean time (having also discover'd these fresh succours) began to shift along
by the ditch, till being by the return of a corner of it, slipt out of their sight, I
drew my men into a very narrow meadow, from whence at full speed I gain'd the

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oot of the hill I had descended before, and having repass'd the River, soon recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the top of the mountain. The danger wherein I saw my self to be, as well of
the Horse I had pressing upon my Rear, as of the Battaillon of In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>antry which I
saw fast advancing towards me, did not however make me loose my Judgment in
a time of so great need; nor hinder me from discerning and taking this opportunity
for my retreat, during which I made the little handful of men I had march very close
together; and by turnes encouraging, and speaking to them, made them often face
about and salute the Cavalry, who pursued me both with Cross-bow, and Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze
shot; when having gain'd the top of the hill, I drew into an Orchard, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fast the Gate on the inside, that the Horse might not so suddainly enter, and
by the favour of that, and several others planted with Apples, still made on towards
the Bridge, till I came to a little Church call'd <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itée,</hi> from whence I perceived the
great road to be all covered over with the Enemies Horse, there being nevertheless
a great ditch betwixt them and me, from whence I bestow'd upon them some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze,
and Cross-bow shot, which also very seldom fail'd of their effect, and
compell'd them (seeing they could not come up to me) some to advance forwards,
and others to retire. I then put some of my men into the Church yard, thinking
there again to make head; the greatest folly I committed throughout the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for in the mean time a good number of their Horse gliding along by the
meadow straight towards the Bridge, were already advanc'd so far, that I saw
my self totally enclos'd, without all manner of hope to escape, and to save my self.</p>
            <p>Now so soon as Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> had recover'd the Bridg, and that the Horse, and
Foot were all pass'd over, he commanded Monsieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Gramont</hi> to hast away, not only
a trot, but a full gallop; for he already discover'd the Enemies Infantry in the
Orchards, which I could not do; neither did I ever perceive them, till they began
to shoot at me; and then I made a sign to my Soldiers in the Churh yard to come,
and draw up to me in the great high way. Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> in the interim, being
he saw nothing of me, half concluded us all for kill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, or taken, and yet seeing all
the Enemies Troops of horse both on the right hand, and on the left, making
directly towards the Bridg, would leave Captain <hi>Campai</hi> (an admirable good
Soldier) at the end of the Bridg with five and twenty horse, and thirty Cross-bows
of Captain <hi>Megrin</hi>'s Company, to try if there were any possible means to
relieve me, were I yet alive, causing the Bridg in the mean time to be broken
down. Now because that Troop of the Enemies horse which march'd on the
right hand, made a great deal more hast towards the Bridge, than that of the left,
I quitted the great high way, and under favour of a hedg made straight towards
the River, where I was again to encounter the Horse, which notwithstanding I
made my way thorow, chopt into the River, and in despite of them all, passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the other side: wherein, the banks of the River being high, favour'd me very
much, they being too steep for the horse to get down, neither was our shot of both
sorts idle in the mean time. At last I recover'd the end of the Bridg, where I found
Captain <hi>Campai</hi> very busie at work to break it, and who so soon as he saw me, was
very importunate with me to save my self, at the same time presenting me the Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of his horse to that end:<note place="margin">A brave reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in a Captain.</note> but he had no other answer from me, but this, that
God had hitherto preserved me, and my Soldiers also, whom I was likewise resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
never to abandon, till I had first brought them into a place of safety. Whilst
we were in this dispute we were aware of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infantry coming directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Bridg, when finding our selves too weak to stand the shock, <hi>Campai</hi>
with the Cross-bows of Captain <hi>Megrin</hi> took the Van in order to a retreat,
and I remain'd in the Rear, having gain'd a ditch that enclos'd a little meadow,
which was sufficient to defend me from the horse, it being so high, that they could
not come to charge.</p>
            <p>I had now nothing left me but my six Harquebusiers, my Cross-bows having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spent all their Arrows; nevertheless to shew that their hearts were not down,
I caus'd them to hold their Swords ready drawn in the one hand, and their Bows in the
other to serve instead of a Buckler. Now Captain <hi>Campai</hi>'s men had broken down
the greatest part of the Bridg before they went away, by reason of which impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Cavalry could not so soon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that usually attend the fleshing and giving an Enemy blood in the beginning of
a War. However he drew out presently into the field, and was advanc'd but a
very little way, when he discover'd our Ensigns of Foot conducted by the Sicur <hi>de

that I was the cause of their preservation: but that withall I was lost in the service.
Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> was not yet arriv'd, forasmuch as he had made a halt to stay for
Captain <hi>Campai,</hi> from him to learn the issue of the business: but in the end he came
up also, to whom Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> spake these words. <hi>Well,</hi> Carbon, <hi>

<hi>which you know to be a place of so great importance.</hi> To which <hi>Carbon</hi> made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
<hi>Sir, I have committed a very great fault, and the greatest folly that ever I was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

has pleased God to preserve us from being defeated, I shall be wiser for the time to come.</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> then demanded of him, if there was any news of me, to which
he made answer, that he thought I was lost: but as they were returning softly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City in expectation of further news, Captain <hi>Campai</hi> also arriv'd, who
assured them that I was come safely off, relating withal the handsom retreat I had
made, in despite, and in the very teeth of the Enemy, with the loss of four men only,
and that it was not possible, but that the Enemy must have lost a great number of
men. I was no sooner come to my Quarters, but that a Gentleman was sent from

there is in good fighting, and this was a Lord who was not wont to caress many

an extraordinary favour to me all the time we sate at supper, which he also
continued to me ever after, insomuch that calling me to mind four or five years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he dispatch'd an express Courrier to me from <hi>Paris</hi> into <hi>Gascony</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to raise a Company of Foot, entreating me to bear him company in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to <hi>Naples,</hi> and has ever since put a greater value upon me, than I deserved. This
was the first action I was ever in the quality of a Commander, and from whence I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to derive my reputation.</p>
            <p>You Captains (my Camrades) who shall do me the honor to read my Life, take
notice, that the thing in the world, which you ought most to desire, is to meet
with a fair occasion wherein to manifest your courage in the first Sally of your Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for if in the beginning you shall prove successful, you do (amongst others) two
things. First you cause your selves to be praised, and esteemed by the great ones,
by whose report you shall be recommended to the knowledg of the King himself,
from whom we are to expect the recompence of all our Services, and Labours: And
in the next place, when the Soldier shall see a Captain who has behav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d himself
well, and performed any notable thing at his first trial; all the valiant men will
strive to be under his command, believing that so auspicious a beginning, cannot fail
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105656:18"/>
of a prosperous issue; but that all things will succeed well with him, and that
under such a man they shall never fail to be employ'd; for nothing can more spite
a man of courage, than to be left at home to burn his shins by the fire, whilst other
men are employ'd abroad in honorable action. So that by this means you shall be
sure always to be follow'd by brave men, with which you shall continue to get
more honor, and proceed to greater reputation; and on the contrary, if you chance
to be baffled in the beginning, whether through your Cowardise, or want of
Conduct, all the good men will avoid you, and you will have none to lead, but
the Lees, and Canaille of the Army, with whom (though you were the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eroe of the
world) there will be no good to be done; nor other, than an ill repute to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. My Exemple upon this occasion, may serve for something, wherein though
perhaps there were no great matters perform'd, yet so it is, that of little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xploits
of War, great uses are sometimes to be made. And remember, whenever you
find your selves overmatch'd with an Enemy, that you can bridle, and hold at
bay with the loss of a few men, not to fear to hazard them. Fortune may be
favourable to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as she was to me; for I dare confidently say, that had
not I presented my self to lead on these hundred Foot (which all play'd their
parts admirably well) we had certainly had all the Enemies Caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y upon our
hands, which had been a power too great, for so few as we were to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Camp soon after retir'd into <hi>Navarre,</hi> whereupon Monsieur <hi>de
Lautrec</hi> disbanded the one half of his Companies, reserving only the two Ensigns of
Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>de Cauna,</hi> and that of the Baron <hi>Iean de Cauna,</hi> consisting each of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
three hundred men (the first time they had ever been reduc'd to that number)
they having formerly consisted of five hundred, or a thousand; a device whereby
the King's Treasury was very much relieved, as it sav'd the pay of so many Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
Ensigns, Serjeants, and other Officers: but withall the command of a
good number of men
, usually invited men of Condition, and Estates into the Service,
who at present disdain to accept of Commissions, where they see so many pitiful
Captainetts, who are admitted into Command, without ever having strook a
stroke.</p>
            <p>At this time you must know Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> bestow'd my Captains Company up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, though I was then but twenty years of age, and leaving four Companies in <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi>
took Post, and went away to Court: which departure of his encouraged the
Enemy to renew his Camp, and to lay Siege to <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> which they also took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his return. The loss of this place was occasioned, either through the indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the treachery of a Nephew to the Constable of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and Son to the late
Mareschal <hi>de Navarre,</hi> who having been banish'd from <hi>Spain,</hi> for siding with <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was, together with a Garrison of four hundred men (Exiles like
himself) put into this City, where he was at this time so well solicited by his Uncle,
that he revolted to his side, by which means this place was lost, which otherwise
had been impregnable, though the Enemy had made two great breaches in it: but
being I was not there present, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will deliver nothing upon report, I shall
say no more but this, that Captain <hi>Frangett</hi> who surrendred it up to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
and who for so doing laid the blame to the said Don <hi>Pedro,</hi> was afterwards for his
pains degraded at <hi>Lyons.</hi> The loss of this place depriv'd us of very good footing we
had in <hi>Spain.</hi> It was here that some years before, Monsieur <hi>de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de</hi> won immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
glory, by enduring a whole years Siege in all the extremities that mankind can
undergo, and he for so doing carried away honor, and reward, but <hi>Frangett</hi> infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and ruine; thus goes the world, and fortune. In the mean time, if any of the
Princes, or the Kings Lieutenants shall vouchsafe to peruse this Book of mine (and
perhaps they may read worse) let them take notice by this exemple, and others that
I have seen, and that I may perchance make mention of hereafter, that it is very
dangerous to make use of a man, that has once abandon'd his own Prince, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Soveraign; not that he is to be rejected, when he flies into a mans arms for refuge,
and protection; but he ought not by any means to have a place entrusted to him,
with which he may at any time make his own peace, and restore himself to his Princes
favour. Or if they shall think fit to trust him, it ought not to be however till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by a long tryal, he shall have so manifested his fidelity, that there is no more
question to be made of his Faith; and then in such a process of time, the Country,
into which he shall come at first a stranger, or f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sufficient distance from such as he may have had any private correspondencies, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

would never have committed so great an error, as to have entrusted them in his
hands, though he had faithfully promis'd so to do. But let us proceed.</p>
            <p>All these Foot Companies being disbanded, excepting those which were left in
Garrison, I who had no mind to be immur'd within the walls of a City, again put my
self into the Company of Monsieur <hi>Le Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for an affront that had been offer'd to him, was revolted to the Emperor
(there is nothing a great heart will not do in order to revenge) where seeing the
King would permit the Mareschal <hi>de Foix</hi> to carry no more, than twenty men at
arms of his own Company along with him, and finding my self at my arrival to
be excluded that election, and none of the number, I took such snuff at it, that I
went with five or six Gentlemen, who did me the honor to bear me company, to
be present at the Battel, with a resolution to fight volunteer amongst the Foot.

without his Host. The <hi>French</hi> did not as yet know what it was to rebell against
their Prince; for so soon as he had notice of the Kings approach, he retir'd himself

and <hi>Pig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> were constrain'd to abandon, and to fly out at one gate,
whilst we entred in at another.</p>
            <p>Signior Don <hi>Antonio de Leva</hi> (who was one of the greatest Captains the Emperor
had, and who I do believe had he not been hindred by the Gout (with which he
was infinitely tormented) would have surpass'd all others of his time) was chosen

supposing that the King would infallibly fall upon that place, as in effect he did.
The Siege continued for the space of eight months, in which time Monsieur <hi>de Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
went into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he so bestirr'd himself with the money he had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he thence brought along with him ten thousand
<hi>German</hi> foot, together with four or five hundred men at armes from the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> with which Forces encamping himself at <hi>Lode,</hi> he came to offer the King
Battail upon a St. <hi>Matthias</hi> day, our army being very much weakened as well by the
length of the Siege, as by Sickness, with which it had been miserably infected. To
which disadvantages the King had moreover unluckily disbanded three thousand
<hi>Grisons</hi> commanded by a Collonel of their own called <hi>le grand Diart,</hi> I suppose, to
contract the charges of the War. Oh that these little pieces of good Husbandry do
very often occasion notable losses! Also a few days before Monsieur <hi>d' Albaine</hi> was, by
the King's command, departed with great Forces towards <hi>Rome,</hi> from thence to
fall into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> but in the end all vanish'd away in smoke;
for, to our great misfortune, we lost the Battail, and all these enterprizes came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The Description of this Battail is already publish'd in so many places, that it
would be labour lost therein to wast my paper; I shall therefore only say, that the
business was not well carried in several places on our side, which occasioned their
ruine, who behav'd themselves best upon that occasion. The King was taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

shot in his thigh, which moreover enter'd into his belly, Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Pol</hi> taken,
and wounded with thirteen wounds, with which he had been left for dead upon the
place, and was stript to his shirt: but a Spaniard coming to cut off his Finger, for a Ring
he could not otherwise pull off, he cried out, and being known, was carried with
the said Mareschal into <hi>Pavie,</hi> to the lodging of the Marquess <hi>de Scadalfol;</hi> several

themselves ill enough, even in the presence of their King. During all the time
of my abode in the Army, I was continually with a Captain call'd <hi>Castille de Navarre,</hi>
without any pay, which Captain having the fortune to command the forlorn hope in
the day of Battel, intreated me to bear him Company, which accordingly I did, as
also the five Gentlemen who came in company with me. I was taken prisoner by

return home to their own houses. Of which number I was one; for I had no great
treasure: he gave us indeed a Troop of horses, and a Company of Foot for our safe
conduct: but the Devil a penny of money, or a bit of bread: insomuch that not one

up the whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> gain'd not so much as one inch of earth by
his victory, and the King had the good fortune in his affliction to derive assistance even
from those who at other times were his Enemies, yet to whom the Emperors greatness
stood highly suspected. His Majesty being at last returned home, and mindful of the
injuries, and indignities, had been offer'd to him during his captivity, having in vain
tryed all other ways to recover his two Sons out of the Emperors hands, was in the
end constrain'd to have recourse to Arms, and to recommence the War. And then it
was that the expedition of <hi>Naples</hi> was set on foot under the command of Monsieur <hi>de
Lautrec,</hi> who (as I have already said) dispatch'd a Courrier to me into <hi>Gascony</hi> to

            <p>Now near unto <hi>Ascoly,</hi> there is a little town called <hi>Capistrano,</hi> seated upon the top

enter at that place. The Enemy on the other side had in the mean time pull'd up
the planks, and removed the boards, and tables from the roof of a Parlour into

desir'd, which was to be present at an assault, there to enter the first man, or to lose
my life: I therefore threw my self headlong into the Parlour, having on a Coat of
Mail, such as the Germans used in those days, a Sword in my hand, a Targuette upon
my arm, and a Morrion upon my head; but as those who were at my heels were

bottom of the Graffe, wherein rowling over the ruines of the Stones, I again broke
my already wounded arm in two places. So soon as my men had gathered me up,
I told them, that I thought I had left my arm behind me in the Town, when one of my
Soldiers lifting it up from whence it hung, as in a Scarf, dangling upon my buttocks,
and laying it over the other, put me into a little heart; after which; seeing the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers

Now you must understand that my Soldiers had, a few days before, taken prisoner
a young man, a Chirurgion, who had formerly belong'd to Monsieur <hi>de Bourbon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
This young fellow having understood the determination to cut off my arm (for I had

it; representing to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I was not, as yet, arrived to the one half of my age, and
that I would wish my self dead an hundred times a day, when I should come to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the want of an arm. The morning being come, the forementioned Lords,
and the two Chirurgions, and Physicians, came into my chamber with all their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

that I should not consider the loss of an Arm, to save my life; nor despair of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
for although his Majesty should not regard my service, nor take it into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to settle a subsistence for me, yet that nevertheless his wife, and himself, had
forty thousand Livers a year revenue, wherewith to recompence my valour, and to
provide that I should never want; only he wished me to have patience, and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
my courage upon this occasion. Every thing being now ready, and my arm
going to be opened to be cut off; the young Chirurgeon standing behind my bed's head,
never desisted preaching to me by no means to suffer it, insomuch that (as God would
have it) though I was prepared, and resolved to let them do what they would with me,
he made me to alter my determination; whereupon, without doing any thing more,
both the Lords, and the Chirurgeons return'd back to Monsieur <hi>de Lautre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an account of the business, who (as they have all of them several times since assured
me) said these words. <hi>I am glad to hear he is so resolved, and should also my self have
repented the causing of it to be done; for had he dyed, I should ever have suspected myself to
have been the occasion of his death; and had he lived without an arm, I should never have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

or no he was sufficient to undertake the cure; for otherwise it was order'd, that one
of them should remain with me; but they found him capable enough, to which they
also added some instructions, what was to be done upon such accidents as might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.

of my person, carryed Hostages with him, two of the most considerable men of the

if any the least foul play was offer'd to me, those two men should infallibly be hang'd.

God being still pleased to curb my pride, that I might know my self, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

scurvy, four, morose, and cholerick nature of my own (which favours a little, and
too much of my native Soil) has evermore made me play one trick, or another of a

to a perfect suppuration, they began to raise me out of Bed, having a little cushion

of <hi>Naples</hi> was lost, after it was almost wholly conquer'd; a story that has been writ
by many: but it is great pity they would not, or durst not relate the truth, being that
Kings and Princes might have been taught to be so wary by this Exemple, as not to suffer
themselves to be imposed upon, and abused, as they very often are: but no body would
have the great ones learn to be too wise, for then they could not play their own Games
with them so well, as they commonly do. I shall therefore let it alone, both for that I do
not pretend to record the faults of other men, as also because I had no hand in these
transactions, and shall only write my own Fortunes to serve for instruction to such as
shall follow after, that the little <hi>Montlucs</hi> my sons have left me, may look with some

would never seek to him, whereof he repented at leisure: for he has since been
the cause of many losses that have befall'n the King, and particularly of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

Foot under his command, the best that ever were in <hi>Italy,</hi> with three Cornets of horse,
and I do verily believe (and there are several others of the same opinion) that, had
he been well at the Battel, matters had not gone so ill as they did. Signior <hi>Horatio</hi>
afterwards encreas'd the number a thousand men, which made up four thousand foot,

            </p>
            <p>But to return to the landing of the Prince of <hi>Navarre,</hi> because there was something
of Action there performed wherein I had a share, I shall give an account of that business.
Captain <hi>Artiguelaube</hi> (who was Colonel of five <hi>Gascon</hi> Ensigns which were wont to
be under Monsieur <hi>de Luppée,</hi> and of five others commanded by the Baron <hi>de Bearn</hi>)
was commanded, as also was <hi>Capta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> de Buch,</hi> eldest son of the Family of <hi>Candale,</hi> to
draw down to that place, and I also (poor wretch as I was) was one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
So soon as we were got down to the shore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Marquess left all our Pikes
behind a great Rampire, which the Count <hi>Pedro de Navarre</hi> had caused to be cast up,
and that extended on the right hand, and on the left, for about half a mile in length.
Close adjoyning to this was a great Portal of Stone, through which ten, or twelvemen
might march a breast, and that I do believe had been a Gate in former times, for the
Arch, and other marks thereof were still remaining; to the checks of which Portal, our
Rampire was brought up, both on the one side, and the other. Our Battaillon was
drawn up about an hundred paces distant from this Portal, the Black Regiments some
three hundred paces behind ours, and the greatest part of the Horse yet further behind
them. Monsieur <hi>le Marquis,</hi> Monsieur <hi>le Captau,</hi> the Count <hi>Hugues,</hi> Captain <hi>Artigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laube,</hi>
and almost all the Captains as well <hi>Italians</hi> as <hi>Gascons</hi> along with them, went

down as well to facilitate, as to be present at the Princes Landing; which said Seigneur

               </hi> had six Ensigns, three of <hi>Piedmontoise,</hi> and three of <hi>Gascons.</hi> They were so
long about their landing, that they there staid three long hours; for they made the
Prince to stay and dine abroad, before he came out of the Galley: a little delay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
occasions a great mischief, and it had been better, that both he, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with him had made a good sober fast; but the vanity of the world is such, that
they think themselves undervalued if they do not move in all the formalities of State,
and in so doing commit very often very great errors. It were more convenient to move
in the Equipage of a simple Gentleman only, and not to Prince it at that rate, but to do
well, than to stand upon such frivolous punctillios, and be the cause of any misadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or disorder.</p>

               </gap>busiers of the black Regiments, with

the Company of Seign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng of two or three hundred Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers,
about two hundred paces distant from, and just over against the place where
I stood. Being thus upon my Guard I saw both horse and foot issuing out of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and coming full drive to gain the <hi>Magdaleine;</hi> whereupon mounting a little Mule that
I had, I gallop'd straight down to the water side. All the Lords and Gentlemen were
as yet on board, caressing, and complementing one another, to whom by certain Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that were plying too and again betwixt the Gallies, and the Shoar, I caus'd it to
be cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d out, that the Enemy was sallying out of the Town by whole Troops to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
them, and to recover the blind of the <hi>Magdaleine,</hi> and that they should think
of fighting, if they so pleased; an intelligence at which some were basely down in the
mouth, for every one that sets a good face on the matter has no great stomach to
fight. I presently return'd back to my men, and went up straight to the <hi>Magdaleine,</hi>
from whence I discover'd the Enemies Horse sallying out dismounted, with the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
in the one hand, and their Launces in the other, stooping as much as they could,
to avoid being seen, as also did the Foot, who crept on all four behind the walls
that enclosed the backside of the Church: I then presently gave my Mule to a Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
bidding him ride in all hast to acquaint Monsieur <hi>de Candale,</hi> and Captain <hi>Artigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laube</hi>
therewith, whom he found already got on shore, and who upon my first adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
had caus'd a Galley to put out to Sea, from whence they discover'd all that
I had told them, which being in the Port they could not possibly do. This Galley up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sight presently began to let fly whole broad-sides of Canon at us, one whereof
kill'd two men of my Company close by me, and so near that the brains both of the one,
and the other flew into my face. There was very great danger in that place, for all the
bullets, as well of this Galley, as of the others, which did the same, play'd directly
into the place where I was, insomuch that seeing them still to continue their shot (for
those of the Gallies took us for the Enemy) I was constrain'd to draw off my men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ditches to secure them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they mounted the Prince in all hast on horseback, and made him to
save himself full speed towards the Camp, all his Gentlemen running after on foot.
They had no great leisure to stay with us, for I believe being so lately come, they had
no mind to dye. Their hast was so great that they had no time to land, either the Princes
Baggage, or his Bed, and there were some, who were wise enough to keep themselves
aboard the Gallies. But the Seigneur <hi>de Candale,</hi> and Count <hi>Hugues</hi> were men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort of mettle, and staid upon the cross high way where their men had been
plac'd before; and Captain <hi>Artiguelaube</hi> went to the Battaillon, that was drawn up
behind the Rampire. The Game began with me, and I do not know whether it be my
good or my evil fortune;<note place="margin">The Fight.</note> but so it is that in all places where I have been, that I
have evermore found my self in the thickest of the blows, and there where the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
ever first began. Now a Band of Harquebusiers came directly towards me, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and that because I had plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d one part of my Harquebusiers behind a ditch bank
that borders all along upon the high way, and the rest on the right and left hand in
the ditches in file (which I did more for fear of the Artillery, that plaid from our own
Gallies, than for any apprehension of the Enemy) and came within twenty paces of
us, where we entertein'd them with a smart volly of all our shot, by which five or six
of their men fell dead upon the ground, and the rest took their heels, and fled, we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105656:22"/>
following after as far as the <hi>Magdaleine.</hi> There they rally<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and withdrew from the
high way on their right hand, and on that side where Monsieur <hi>de Lavall</hi> of <hi>Dauphiné</hi>
stood with his Company of <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> he was Nephew to Monsieur <hi>de Bayard,</hi> and
Father to Madame <hi>de Gordes,</hi> who is at this time living, and a very valiant Gentleman.
Monsieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi> who had seen my Charge, and saw that the Enemy now all
discover d themselves, and that both Horse and Foot drew into a great Meadow,
where Monsieur <hi>de Lavall</hi> stood; fearing they might charge me again, he sent me a
supply of fifty Harquebusiers, just at the time when a Battaillon of <hi>German</hi> Foot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
themselves within twenty paces on my right hand. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Harquebusiers
in the mean time fir'd with great fury upon our <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> who began to draw
off at a good round trot towards the high way possessed by Monsieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi>
where there was a great oversight committed, which I will also give an account of,
that such as shall read it, may make use of the exemple, when the chance of War
(as at one time or another it may) shall perhaps reduce them to the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Hugues,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Candalle</hi> had drawn up their Pikes upon the great
Road, without leaving room for the Cavalry to retire, and there was a necessity
that Monsieur <hi>de Lavall</hi> must, in spite of his heart, pass that way; for betwixt
Monsieur <hi>de Candalle</hi> and me there was a great ditch, that Horse could not possibly
get over. Had they left the Road open, and drawn themselves up in Battalia behind
the ditch, they might have given a stop to the Enemies fury; and by that means Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Lavall,</hi> might at great ease have got off along by the high way, and have
made an honorable retreat. So soon as the Enemy saw that Monsieur <hi>de Lavall</hi> was
forced to his Trot they presently charg'd him both in flank, and rear, with both
Horse and Foot at once, when having thrown himself into the Road to get clear of
this storm, he encountred these Pikes upon his way, where he was constrained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will to force his way thorough, and in so doing bore down, and trampled
under foot all that stood before him; for our Pikes were drawn up so close that they
had no room to open. This put all into confusion, and I was ready to run mad to
see so great an absurdity committed; yet is not the blame justly to be laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Candalle,</hi> he being very young, and having never been upon such a service
before: but Count <hi>Hugues</hi> is highly to be cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

understood the discipline of War; yet I will not say but that he behaved himself with
very great bravery in his own person: but it is not enough to be bold, and hardy,
a man must also be wise, and foresee all that can happen, forasmuch as oversights are
irreparable in matters of Arms, and smal faults are oftentimes the occasion of very
great losses, as it happened here to him, who had not provided against all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
For he was himself taken prisoner, as also Monsieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi> being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in his arm with a Harquebuze shot.<note place="margin">Captain <hi>de Buch,</hi> Count <hi>de Candalle</hi> slain.</note> Three days after, the Enemy seeing he was
not likely to live, sent him back to Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> who was his Kinsman, and the
next day he died, and was buried at <hi>Bresse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a brave, and a worthy young man as ever came out of the house of <hi>Foix,</hi>
and would in time doubtless have been a great Soldier, had he lived to hold on as he
had begun. I never knew man so industrious, and desirous to learn the practice of
arms of the old Captains, as this Lord was. To which effect he rendred himself as
obsequious to the Count <hi>Pedro de Navarre,</hi> as the meanest of his Servants. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
into the reasons of things, and informed himself of all, without fooling away
his time about trifles, that other young men covet and love: and was more frequent at
the Quarters of the Count <hi>Pedro de Navarre,</hi> than at those of Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that the Count would always say, he was there training up a great Captain.
And in truth when he was brought back into the Camp, the said Count kiss'd him
with tears in his eyes. It was a very great loss of him. All who were at the same post
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ither kill'd, or taken, some excepted, who saved themsesves by the ditches,
leaping from ditch to ditch, but those were very few, for the Enemy pursued
their victory on that side very well.</p>
            <p>I on my side began to march along by the side of a hedg, with my face still towards
the <hi>German</hi> Foot, the lesser evil of the two, and by good fortune both for me, and
my Company the Enemy in my rear pursued us coldly enough. At my coming to the
Portal I spoke of before, I there found a great Troop of the Enemies Horse, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Don Ferdinando de Gonzaga</hi> (for it was he who gave the charge) so that to
recover the Portal I must of necessity fight with a resolution either to pass thorough,
or die. I made my men therefore to give them a volly of Harquebuze shot, for I for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105656:22"/>
my part had nothing wherewith to fight, but my voice; upon which volly they made
me way, so that having pass'd the portal, I fac'd about, and stood firm. At which
time their Harquebusiers also came up, who at once altogether charged upon us, with
all their united power both of Horse and Foot; when seeing this torrent coming upon
me, I recover'd the back side of the Trench, with my Harqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great a perplexity, that he gave us all over for lost. I there disputed the portal a long
half hour from the back side of the Trench, for it remained free, as well on their side,
as on ours; they durst not attempt to pass, neither did we dare to approach it. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Soldiers plaid the men, these did it at this time; for all that I had with me could
not arise to above an hundred and fifty men. The Marquess then came up to Captain
<hi>Arteguelaube,</hi> to make him rise, they being all couched upon one knee, for had they
stood upright, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot had had them in their aim, and cryed to him, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Arteguelaube,</hi> I beseech you rise, and charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we must of necessity pass the
Portal: But he returned him answer, that he could not do it without losing the best
of our men, as it was very true, for all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot were then come up. I was
close by the Portal, and heard all; but the Marquess not satisfied with this answer,
spurred up to the black Regiments, commanding them to march up towards the Portal,
which they accordingly did. I knew by the manner of their motion, what command
they had received, which was the reason that I stept out, and cried to Captain <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guelaube,</hi> Camrade, you are about to be disgraced for ever, for here are the Black Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
that, upon my life, are making towards the Portal, to carry away the honor
of the service; at which words he started up (for the man wanted no courage) and ran
full drive towards the Portal, when seeing him come, I suddenly threw my self before
the Portal, and passed with all those who followed me, marching straight towards
the Enemy, who were not above a hundred paces distant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom us; we were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
followed by the Foot, sent by the Marquess: but as we were half passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
the Marquess gave the word from hand to hand, to make a hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and to advance
no further. The Enemy seeing us come on with such resolution, and the Cavalry
following in our Rear, thought it the wisest course to retire. I was by this time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
where we were plying one another, with good round vollies of shot, at fifty
paces distance, and we had a good mind to fall on to the Sword, when the Marquess,
and another Gentleman with him, came himself on horseback to stay me. I think he
did ill in it; for had we all passed thorough, we had certainly pursued them fighting
up to the very Gates of <hi>Naples.</hi> There was in this place very many on both sides bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the ground, that never rose again, and I admire how I escaped, but my hour was
not come.</p>
            <p>That which occasioned the Marquess to retire, was the fear he had of tempting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
a second time; he was contented with what he had already lost, without being
willing to hazard any more; so that tired out, and over spent, we return'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
the Portal, that had been so long disputed, where a great many good men lay
dead upon the place. There it was that the Gentleman who was with the Marquess,
when he came to command me to retire, I have forgot his name, said to him (for I
heard him very well) <hi>Monsieur, I now see that the antient proverb is true, which says,
that one man is worth an hundred, and an hundred are not so good as one: I speak it by this
Captain who has his arm in a scarf, and leans to the Rampire</hi> (for in truth I was quite
spent) <hi>for it must needs be acknowledged, that he is the only cause of our preservation.</hi> I
heard likewise well enough, though I took no notice of it, the Marquess make him
this answer. <hi>That man will always do well wherever he is.</hi> A passage, that although it be
to my honor, and my own commendation, I would however insert it here, without
bragging nevertheless, or vain glory. I have acquir'd honor enough besides: but this
may perhaps serve to excite the other Captains, who shall read my Life, to do the
same upon the like occasion. And I must needs confess that I was then better pleased
with this Character, that this Gentleman, and the said Marquess were pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ased to give
of me, than if he had given me the best Mannor in his possession; though I was at
that time very poor. This commendation made my heart to swell with courage, and
yet more when I was told, that some one had entertained Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> and
the Prince with the same discourse, all the time they sate at Supper. These little points of
honor serve very much in matters of War, and are the cause that when a man shall again
happen to be in the like service, he fears nothing: it is very true that men are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mistaken, and gain nothing but blows: but there is no remedy for that, we must
give and take.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105656:23"/>You Captains, and Lords who lead men on to death (for War is nothing else) when

man be performed, and look upon all things with an eye of disdain, you will find that
you must recompence them by effects, since you would not vouchsafe to do it by
word of mouth. I have ever treated the Captains so, who have been under my
command, and even the meanest of my Soldiers; by which they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so obliged, that I could have made them run their heads against a wall, and
have stood firm in the most dangerous post in the world, as (for ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was the first misfortune, and the first disgrace, that had yet befallen us in
all this Expedition. It seemed to all the world that the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> brought
us all misadventure and mishap: would to God he had staid in <hi>Gascony;</hi> neither had
it been the worse for him, who came only to end his days a great way from home,

               </note> or there
abouts, after his arrival, and was the occasion of the death of this brave young Lord
(which I shall ever lament) who also had the honor to be his Kinsman. Yet was not
this all, for so soon as it was known that such a Prince was arrived, every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
concluded that he had brought some considerable succours, and relief, at least money
for the pay of the Army: but there was nothing of all this; for neither he, nor the
Gallies brought us one man of recruit; nor any other thing, but his own retinue, and
some few Gentlemen Voluntiers; which was a great discouragement to our distressed
Army, and the Enemy, who were very well informed of all, took new heart at it,
knowing very well by that, that the Waters of <hi>France</hi> were very low, when a Prince of
his condition, came to such a Siege as this, in an equipage, as if he had only come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to see the world: but the fault ought not to lie at his door, they were too blame
that sent him.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great fault in Kings and Princes, who put men upon great attempts, to take

the State of <hi>France,</hi> which by that means would have had its arms at liberty
for many years, and we should have disputed it long, had it once been ours, for we
should have been made wise by our precedent losses. The King committed yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oversight in not sending some handsom Troop of Gentlemen, and some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Body of Foot with this young Prince, the neglect of which (as I have already
said) made our people believe, either that he did not much regard us; or that his
hands were full, and that he had elsewhere enough to do. Wherein Monsieur <hi>de Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trec</hi>
was by no means to be blam'd, who never ceased to send dispatch after dispatch,
and post after post, to give his Majestie an account of all; but I return to my self; for
(as I have always declar'd) I will by no means play the Historian: if I should, I should
have enough to do, and scarce know at which end to begin.</p>
            <p>This was the last engagement where I had any thing to do, wherein though I did
not command in chief, yet had I notwithstanding the command of a very good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

for all; which I have set down to acquit my self of my promise, to wit, that I would
give a particular account of all those passages, wherein I had the honor to command:

            <p>In this handsom equipage, I came home to my Fathers house, where, poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I found him engag'd in too many necessities of his own, to be in any capacity of
much assisting me; forasmuch as his Father had sold three parts of four of the Estate of
the Family, and had left the remainder charg'd with five children, by a second venture,
besides us of my Fathers, who were no less than ten. By which any on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it had near upon five thousand Livers yearly revenue belonging to it, before it was
sold. To fit my self in all points I was constrained to stay three years at home, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being able to get any cure for my arm, and after I was cur'd I was to begin the

seek my fortune in all sorts of necessiities, and with extream peril of my

            <p>Upon the first motions of War King <hi>Francis</hi> instituted his Legionaires,<note place="margin">The Legion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aires institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> which
was a very fine invention, had it been well pursued (for a start all our Laws, and

it is the true and only way to have always a good Army on Foot (as the <hi>Romans</hi> did)
and to train up the people to War,<note place="margin">1534.</note> though I know not whether that be good or evil. It
has been much controverted, though I for my part had rather trust to my own people,
than to strangers.</p>
            <p>Of these the King gave one thousand to the Seneschal of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> Seigneur <hi>de Faudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi>
who made me his Lieutenant Colonel, and although it was the <hi>Languedoc</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and that he was Colonel, I nevertheless raised him all his Regiment in <hi>Guienne,</hi>
and appointed him all his Captains, Lieutenants, Ensigns, Serjeants, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
A great rumor was at that time spread over all <hi>France,</hi> that the Emperor through
the great intelligences he had within, was, for the conquest of such, and so great a
Kingdom, coming up with vast, and invincible Forces; thinking at unawares to surprize
the King; and in effect he did advance as far as <hi>Provence.</hi> The King to oppose so
mighty, and so powerful an Enemy, summon'd in all his Forces from all parts: in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to which summons, we used so extraordinary diligence (neither was I ever slothful)
that our Regiment was the first that arrived at <hi>Marselles,</hi> where we found Monsieur
<hi>de Barbezieux</hi> (which was <hi>de la Rochefoucant</hi>) and Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat,</hi> whom the
King had made his joynt Lieutenants there (the one having as much authority as the

               <note place="margin">1537.</note> where nothing however of Action past, but what I am now going
to relate.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Emperor lay very long at <hi>Aix,</hi> in expectation of his great Canon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to come, and batter the walls of <hi>Marselles,</hi> his provisions did every day more, and
more wast, and diminish. In which point of time the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> arriv'd at <hi>Avignon,</hi> where His

had seiz'd into his hands towards <hi>Arles,</hi> and especially one within four Leagues of
<hi>Aix,</hi> called the Mill of <hi>Auriolle,</hi> the Enemies Camp would soon suffer for want of bread.
Upon which advice the King commited the execution of the burning of those Mills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

               </note> and some others, who accordingly executed

<hi>de Barbezieux,</hi> and <hi>de Montpezat</hi> to hazard a Regiment of men, to go, and burn the
said Mills of <hi>Auriolle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first to whom they recommended the execution thereof, was to the foresaid
<hi>Christophle le Goast,</hi> who positively refused to undertake it, alledging that it was five
Leagues to the aforesaid Mills,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Goast</hi> refuses to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Enterprize,</note> where they were to fight threescore Guards, that were
within it,, and an entire Company that were quartered in the Town, so that he should
have five Leagues to go, and as many to return, by means whereof he should going or
coming be infallibly defeated upon the way, for the Emperor could not fail of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
it being no more than four leagues only from the said <hi>Auriolle</hi> to <hi>Aix;</hi> and on the
other side the Soldiers would never be able to travel ten long leagues without baiting by
the way. This answer was sent back to the King, who notwithstanding would not take
it for currant pay; but on the contrary sent another more positive order, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that it should be proposed to some others, and that though a thousand men should
be lost in the Enterprize,<note place="margin">and</note> yet let them not concern themselves, for the benefit that would
accrue burning the Mills, would countervail the loss (such easie Markets Princes make
of the lives of men.)</p>
            <p>Whereupon it was offer'd to Monsieur <hi>de Fonterailles,</hi> who was once in mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it: but some of his friends representing to him his certain ruine in the attempt,
he piss'd backwards,<note place="margin">Also Monsieur <hi>de Fonterailles.</hi>
               </note> and would by no means touch. All which being sent word of to
His Majesty (who continually had the manifest advantage the destroying of the other
Mills had brought to His Majesties affaires, reminded to him) he still persisted to press
the aforesaid Lords, to send some one, or another to demolish these. Now one day, after
I had heard how discontented the King was, and the excuses that had been alledg'd by
those to whom it had hitherto been recommended (which in truth were very rational,
and just) I began to meditate with my self, which way I might execute this design,
and to consider, that if God would give me the grace to bring it about, it would be a
means to bring me to the knowledg of the King,<note place="margin">It is underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>
               </note> and to restore me to the same reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and acquaintance, I had formerly acquir'd; and that now by three years idleness,
and the length of my cure, was as good as vanish'd and lost: for it is nothing to get a good
repute, if a man do not uphold, and improve it. Having therefore taken with my self a
resolution to execute this design; or to die in the attempt: I enform'd my self at full
of my Landlord of the scituation, and condition of the place where these Mills were:
who told me that <hi>Auriolle</hi> was a little Town enclos'd with high walls, where there was
a Castle well fortified, and a Bourg composed of many houses, with a fair street tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the middle of it, and at the end of the said Bourg, which led from the Town
towards the Mill, was a little on the left hand the Mill it self. That at the Gate of the
said Town there was a Tower, which look'd directly down the great street towards the
Mill, before which no man could stand, without running great hazard of being either
slain, or wounded; and that beyond the Mill was a little Church at the distance
of about thirty, or forty paces. He told me moreover, that I was to go to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baigne,</hi>
two Leagues from <hi>Marselles,</hi> and that from thence to <hi>Auriolle,</hi> it was
three more, if we went by by the Mountains which the Horse could not possibly do;
but must be constrained to go near upon a League about, where they were moreover to
pass a River that was deep to the Saddle skirts, by reason that the Bridges had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down.</p>
            <p>My Landlord having told me all this, I consider'd, that if I should undertake this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
with a great party, I should be defeated; for the place being only four Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Emperor's Camp, he would have present intelligence, and would send
out his Horse to intercept me in my return, as it also fell out; for immediately upon
our coming to the Mill, the Captain of the Castle dispatch'd away in all hast to the
Emperor. So that I conceiv'd it much better for me to undertake it with a small number
of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and those light and active fellows; to the end that if I did the work I went for,
I might either have means to retire by one way or another; or at the worst if I should
throw my self away, and those who were with me, yet they being but a few, the City
of <hi>Marselles</hi> would by that miscarriage be in no manner of danger to be lost, which
was the thing most disputed in the Council; whereas by losing a thousand or twelve
hundred men, which were thought a necessary proportion for such an Enterprize, the
said City might be expos'd to some danger, especially in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time when they expected
a Siege.</p>
            <p>I then desir'd my Landlord to provide me three f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llows, who were expert in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105656:24"/>
ways, to guide me by night to the said <hi>Auriolle,</hi> and so that, as near as could be guess'd,
they should bring me to the Mills two hours before day; which he accordingly did,
when after having some time consulted with them, I found the men were fearful, and
loth to go: but at last mine Host so encourag'd them, that they were all resolved;
whereupon I gave to each of them a brace of Crowns, and caused them to be kept up in
my lodging, which was about Noon; and having comput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with my Landlord how
many hours the nights were then long, we found, that provided I should set out about
the twilight, I should have time enough to do my business.</p>
            <p>All this being done, that my design might not be known, I went my self first
to Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat,</hi> to acquaint him with what I intended to do; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
that I was resolved to take with me no more, than six score men only, which
I would choose out of the Seneschall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Regiment, to which I was Lieutenant Colonel.
In all places wherever I have been, I have still made it my study to discern betwixt
the good men, and the bad, and to judg what they were able to do, for all men are not
proper for all uses.</p>
            <p>The said Sieur <hi>de Montpezat</hi> thought my resolution very strange, and out of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
advis'd me not to do so ridiculous a thing, as to hazard my self with so few men;
telling me, that I might as well have five hundred if I would. To which I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that I would never demand five hundred men for the execution of an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that I could better perform with six score, and tormented him so, that in the
end he was constrained to go along with me to Monsieur <hi>de Barbezieux,</hi> who yet
thought it more strange, than the other, and would needs know of me my reasons and
by what means I would execute this design with so few people. To whom I made
answer, that I would not declare to any one living, which way I intended to proceed:
but that nevertheless (if they so pleased) I would undertake it. Whereupon Monsieur
<hi>de Montpez at</hi> said to him, let him go; for though he should be lost, and all those with
him, the City will not for that be in the more danger to be lost, and it will give His
Majesty content. Monsieur <hi>de Villebon</hi> who was present at the deliberation, laugh'd, and
jeer'd at me, saying to Monsieur <hi>de Barbezieux,</hi> let him go, he will infallibly take the
Emperor, and we shall all be ashamed, when we see him bring him into the City to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
morning. Now this man did not love me, for some words that had passed betwixt us
at the Port Royal; neither could I forbear to tell him, that he was like a dog in a manger,
that would neither eat himself nor suffer others. All was pass'd over in jest though in
plain truth, I was half angry, for a little spurring would serve to make me start. The
Seneschall <hi>de Tholouse,</hi> my Colonel, adhear'd to my opinion, whereupon I had immediate
leave granted me to go choose out my six score men, and no more, which I did, taking
only one<note n="*" place="margin">Or Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, a term u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as suiting that of Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Centenier, and a Corporal, the rest were all Gentlemen, and so brave a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that they were better than five hundred others. It is not all to have a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, they somtimes do more hurt than good, which made me entreat Monsieur
<hi>de Barbezieux</hi> to cause the Gate of the City to be shut, being well assur'd that otherwise
I should have had more company than I desir'd; which he also did, and it hapned well
for another reason, for in less than an hour my design was spread all over the whole City.</p>
            <p>Just at Sun-set, I, with my six score men, repair'd to the Gate, the wicket whereof
was only open: but the street was so full of Soldiers, ready to go out with me, that
I had much ado to distinguish my own, and was therefore constrained to make them all
take hands, for I very well knew them every one. As I was going out of the Gate,

fail'd in the attempt, it would beget matter of sport for the <hi>French,</hi> and they would
laugh us to scorn. Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat</hi> was at first unwilling to it, but seeing
him begin to grow into a little heat, at last consented, whereupon he presently ran to
mount to horse, and there might be nineteen or twenty of the party.</p>
            <p>Now to give a full account of this Enterprize, (which although it was not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of <hi>Millan,</hi> may nevertheless be of some use to such as will make their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

deliver'd a good Guide, telling him withal, that he was not to come near me by a

order being given, and Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> and I beginning to set forward, up com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers,</hi> of whose deliberation we till then knew nothing, forasmuch
as it had been resolved upon at the very moment of our going out at the wicket, which
hindred us another long half hour: but in the end we agreed, that he should go the
Horse way, and gave him another of my Guides, which he mounted behind one of
his men; so that we had three parties, and to every party a Guide. At our parting
I gave him instructions, that so soon as he should arrive at the end of the Bourg, he
should draw up behind the Church, for should they enter into the street, the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
quarter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d in the Town, would either kill them, or their horses; and that therefore
he was not to appear, till first he heard us engag'd.</p>
            <p>We now began to set forward, and marched all night, where as far as <hi>Aubaigne,</hi> we
found the way to be exceeding good: but from thence to <hi>Auriolle</hi> we were fain to
crawl over the sides of Mountains, where, I believe, never any thing but Goats had
gone before: by which abominable way, having got within half a quarter of a league
of <hi>Auriolle,</hi> I made a halt, bidding Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> to stay there for me, for I
must go speak with <hi>Belsoleil.</hi> I therefore went back, and met him within a hundred
paces of us, or less; where speaking to him, and his Guide, I told him, that when he
should arrive at the Bourg, he was by no means to follow me: but to march directly
to the Gate of the Town, betwixt the Bourg and the said Town, and there make a
stand at the Gate, it being necessary that he should gain two houses next adjoyning to
the said Gate, which he must suddainly break into, to keep the Enemy from fallying
out to disturb us; and that there he was to stay, and fight, without taking any care
to relieve us at all; after which order given to him, I moreover past the word from
hand to hand, to all the Soldiers, that no one was to abandon the fight at the Gate, to
come to us to the Mill; but that they were punctually to observe whatever Captain
<hi>Belsoleil</hi> should command them.</p>
            <p>Returning then back to Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> we again began to march, when
being come near to the Castle, under which and close by the walls of the Town, we
were of necessity to pass, their Centinels twice call'd out to us, Who goes there? to
which we made no answer at all, but still went on our way, till coming close to the
Bourg, we left the way that Captain <hi>Belsoleil</hi> was to take, and slipt behind the houses
of the said Bourg, when being come to the further end where the Mill stood, we were
to descend two or three stone steps to enter into the street, where we found a Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l,
that never discover'd us, till we were within a Pikes length of him, and then he
cry'd <hi>Quivive?</hi> to which I made answer in <hi>Spanish, Espagne,</hi> (wherein I was mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for the word was not then <hi>Espagne,</hi> but <hi>Impery</hi>) whereupon, without more cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
he gave fire; but hit nothing.</p>
            <p>The alarm being by this means given, Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> and I threw our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
into the street, and were bravely follow'd; where we found three or four of the
Enemy without the door of the Mill: but they immediately ran in. The door of this Mill
was ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with two folding leaves, both which were to be bolted fast with a great Iron
Bar on the inside; one of these had a great Chest behind it, and the other the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Bar h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld more than half shut, and had these fellows behind it. The Mill was full
of men, bod above stairs and below (for there was threescore men in it, with
the Captain, who had no dependence upon the Governor of the Town, each of them
having his command apart) and we were one by one to enter this place.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes</hi> would very fain first have entred and press'd forward with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105656:25"/>that intent; but I pulling him back by the arm, withheld him, and push'd in a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
that was behind me: the Enemy made but two Harquebuze shot, having leisure
to do no more, being all fast asleep, excepting these three, or four, who had been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
as Centinels before the Mill door in the street. So soon as the Soldier was got in,
I said to Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> now enter if you will; which he presently did, and
I after him, where we began to lay about us to some purpose, there being no more
but one light only to fight by within.<note place="margin">The Mill of <hi>Auriolle</hi> to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> In this bustle the Enemy by a pair of stone
stairs of indifferent wideness, recover'd the upper Room, where they stoutly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the said stairs from the floor above, whilst I in the mean time sent a Soldier to
tell the rest, that were without, that they should get up upon the outside of the
Mill, and uncovering the roof, shoot down upon their heads, which was immediately
perform'd; so that the Enemy perceiving our men to be got upon the roof, and that
they already let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly amongst them, they began to throw themselves into the water out of
a window on the backside of the Mill: but we nevertheless mounted the stairs, and kill'd
all those that remain'd, the Captain excepted, who with two wounds, and seven others
all wounded, were taken prisoners. Hereupon I presently sent one away to Captain <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soleil,</hi>
to bid him take courage, and stoutly to dispute the Gate of the Town, for the Mill
was our own.</p>
            <p>The Alarm in the mean time, in the Town was very great, and those within
three times attempted to Sally: but our men held them so short, that they durst never
open their Gates. I sent Captain <hi>Belsoleil</hi> moreover most of my men to assist him, and
in the mean time, with the rest, fell to burning the Mill, taking away all the Iron
work, especially the Spindles, and Rinds, that it might not be repair'd again, never
leaving it till it was entirely burnt down to the ground, and the Mill-stones rowl'd
into the River. Now you must know that Captain <hi>Tavannes</hi> took it a little to
heart, that I had pull'd him back by the arm, and ask'd me afterwards upon our
returne, why I would not permit him to enter the first, suspecting I had more
mind to give the honor of it to the Soldiers: to whom I made answer, that I
knew he was not yet so crafty to save himself, as those old Soldiers were; and that
moreover, that was not a place considerable enough for a man of his worth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to dye in; but that he was to reserve himself for a noble breach, and not to loose
his life in a paltry Mill.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were in doing, Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers</hi> arriv'd, and leaving his
party behind the Church, came up to us on foot, and upon this the day began to
appear: wherefore I entreated Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> and <hi>de Castelpers</hi> to retire behind
the Church (for the shot flew very thick in the street, where they could see any one
pass) telling them, that I would go draw off <hi>Belsoleil;</hi> whereupon they both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
retir'd, and as I was drawing off our men one after another running down
on both sides the street, Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers</hi> presented himself with his twenty
Horse at the end of the street by the Church, wherein he did us very great service,
for the Enemy might otherwise have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or eight men hurt, who nevertheless were all able to march, one Gentleman only
excepted, called <hi>Vigaux,</hi> whom we set upon an Ass of those we had found in the
Mill, and presently began to retire towards the top of a mountain, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the same way by which Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers</hi> had come, when the Enemy

gain'd the top of the Hill, when they arriv'd but at the foot of it, and before
they recovered the heighth, we were got into the valley on the other side, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to climb another (there being many little hills in that place) and yet we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </gap>aster than a foot pace; and so went straight on to <hi>Aubaigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had given order to the Soldiers that went along with us, that every one should take
with him a loaf of Bread, which they eat by the way, and I also had caus'd some few to
be brought, which I divided amongst the <hi>Gens-d' Armes</hi> of Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi>
and we our selves eat as we went; which I here set down, to the end, that when any
Captain shall go upon an Enterprize, where he is to have a long march, he may
take exemple to cause something to be brought along to eat, wherewith to refresh
the Soldiers, that they may be the better able to hold out; for men are not made of
Iron.</p>
            <p>So soon as we were come to <hi>Aubaigne,</hi> two leagues from <hi>Marselles,</hi> where we had
thought to have halted, and to have taken some refreshment, we heard the Artillery
of the Gallies, and of the Town, which at that distance seem'd to be volleys of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze

he would certainly sit down before it;<note place="margin">The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> before <hi>Marselles.</hi>

get in again, which made us often repent, and curse the enterprize that had shut us
out, the misfortune whereof was wholly laid to my charge, as the Author of all. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this uncertainty what course to steer, Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers</hi> was once resolved to go
charge desperately thorough the Enemy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

came to acquaint us with his determination, we remonstrated to him, that that would
be to throw himself away out of an humor, and that since we had together perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
so brave a service, and with which the King would be so highly pleased, we
ought likewise together either to perish, or to save our selves. Captain <hi>Trebous</hi> Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to the Company of Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat,</hi> told him the same, so that we conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the end to leave the great high way, and crossing the Mountains on the left
hand, to fall down behind <hi>Nostre Dame de la Garde,</hi> making account, that in case we
could not enter into the City, the Captain of the said Cittadel would receive us in
there. So we turn'd out of the way, and it was well for us that we did so, for <hi>Vignaux,</hi>
and <hi>les Bleres</hi> keeping on the great Road straight to <hi>Marselles,</hi> had not gone on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hundred paces, but they met with four or five hundred Horse, which the Emperor
(having had intelligence from those of <hi>Auriolle</hi> of what had been done) had sent
out to meet, and fight us upon the way; and had not the Emperor parted from
<hi>Aix</hi> by night to go before <hi>Marselles,</hi> so that the Messengers of a long time could meet
with no body to whom to deliver their errand, I do believe we had certainly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated:
but the Emperor knew nothing of it, till break of day, whereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sent out those four or five hundred Horse upon the Road to <hi>Aubaigne,</hi> who did
no other harm to <hi>Vignaux,</hi> and those who were with him, but only took away their Arms.</p>
            <p>In this manner we travail'd all day from mountain to mountain in the excessive heat,
without finding one drop of water,<note place="margin">Retreat.</note> insfomuch that we were all ready to dye for thirst; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

               </gap>s Camp, and ever within hearing of the Skirmishes that
were made before the Town, Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers,</hi> and his <hi>Gens-d' Armes</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the way on foot, as we did, and leading their horses in their hands, till com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near to <hi>Nostre Dame de la Garde,</hi> the Captain of the Castle taking us for the Enemy,
let fly three or four pieces of Canon at us, which forc'd us to shift behind the Rocks.
From thence we made signs with our hats; but for all that he ceas'd not to shoot, till in
the end, having sent out a Soldier to make a sign, so soon as he understood who
we were, he gave over shooting; and as we came before <hi>Nostre Dame de la Garde,</hi> we
saw the Emperor, who was retiring by the way he came, and <hi>Christophle Goast,</hi> who
had all day maintain'd the Skirmish, beginning also to retreat towards the City. We
then began to descend the Mountain, when so soon as Monsieur <hi>de Barbezieux,</hi> and
Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat</hi> (who, with some other Captains, were standing without the
Gates of the City) had discover'd us, they would have gone in again, taking us for
the Enemy; but some body saying, that then those of the Castle would have shot
at us, the said Sieur <hi>Montpezat</hi> presently knew Monsieur <hi>de Castelpers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
arriv'd at the Gate of the City, where we were mightily caressed, especially
when they heard of the good success of our enterprize, and they talk'd with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Mill, who was wounded in the arm, and in the head, and after every one
retir'd to his own Quarters.</p>
            <p>I made no manner of question, but that Monsieur <hi>de Barbezieux,</hi> so soon as the

him, that I was the man who had perform'd this exploit, that His Majesty might
have taken notice of me: but he was so far from doing me that friendship, that
on the contrary he attributed all the honor to himself, saying that it was he, who
had laid the design of this Enterprize, and had only deliver'd it to us to execute;
and Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat</hi> was by ill fortune at that time very sick, and could say
nothing in my behalf, so that I remain'd as much a stranger to the King, as ever. I
came to know all this by the means of <hi>Henry</hi> king of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who told me that
he himself had seen the Letters which the said Sieur <hi>de Barbezieux</hi> had writ to the
King to that effect,<note place="margin">Injustice of Monsieur <hi>de Barbezieux</hi> towards the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> would not have serv'd me so; neither is it handsom to
rob another man of his honor; and there is nothing that does more discourage a
brave heart: but Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> who is now living, can testifie the truth.
So it is, that the destroying of these Mills, both the one, and the other, especially
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105656:26"/>
those of <hi>Auriolle,</hi> reduced the Emperors Camp to so great necessity, that they were

Grapes they are put their Camp into so great a disorder, and brought so great a
Mortality amongst them, especially the <hi>Germans,</hi> that I verily believe there never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
a thousand of them into their own Country, and this was the issue of this mighty
preparation.</p>
            <p>The Captains who shall read this relation, may perhaps observe, that in this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
there was more of Fortune, than of Reason, and that I went upon it as it
were in the dark, though it was happily brought about: but I do not suspect how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that any one will conclude it to be wholly an effect of my good fortune, but
will also take notice, that I forgot nothing of what was necessary to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
succeed; and on the other side they may observe, that my principal security was,
that the Enemy within the Town by the Rule of War, ought not to sally out of their
Garrison, till they should first discover what our Forces were, a thing in the obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the night, which they could very hardly do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which notwithstanding, I did
not yet so much rely upon their discretion, but that I moreover put a bridle in their
mouths, which was <hi>Belsoleil,</hi> and his Company. A man must often hazzard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for no one can be certain of the event. I concluded the conquest of the Mill
for certain: but I ever thought it would be a matter of great difficulty, and danger
to retreat.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> both with shame and loss, retire, where that great
Leader <hi>Anne de Montmorency</hi> (all that time Grand Maistre, and since Connestable of
<hi>France</hi>) obtein'd renown.<note place="margin">The death of Antonio de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</note> It was one of the greatest baffles the Emperor ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and for grief whereof his great Captain <hi>Antonio de Leva</hi> (as was reported)
afterwards dyed. I have sometimes heard the Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> say, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
was the sole contrivance of the sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Antonio de Leva,</hi> and yet both he and
his Master very well knew, what it was to attaque a king of <hi>France</hi> in his own
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Emperor being with his Forces retir'd, I would no longer continue Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Seneschal's Regiment; who, had it lain in his power, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
it wholly into my hands. Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> then did me the honor to
make me an offer of his Guidon, which I likewise refus'd to accept, having set my
heart more upon the Foot, than upon Horse service. I had moreover an opinion,
that I should sooner rise to advancement by the Infantry, which was the reason that
I again return'd home, where having made some little stay, I would go into <hi>Piedmont</hi>
there to serve under Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> who was the kings Lieutenant in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and in order thereunto went first to <hi>Marselles,</hi> where I was six or seven months
detain'd by Monsieur <hi>de Taude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some time after the Emperor rais'd an Army therewith to go and lay siege to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the King, at the same time, rais'd another to relieve it: whereupon I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
took post, and went to Court, where Monsieur <hi>Le Grand Maistre</hi> gave me
a Foot Company, and another to Captain <hi>Guerre,</hi> which we presently rais'd in, and
about <hi>Paris,</hi> and were both of us receiv'd into the Guards of Monsieur <hi>le Dauphin,</hi>
who was afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France.</hi> The Army march'd presently away
to <hi>Hesdin,</hi> and to <hi>Anchi le Chastea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Maistre,</hi> as also Saint <hi>Venant;</hi> neither could the Imperialists do any good upon <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roane,</hi>
which Monsieur <hi>de Annebaut</hi> reliev'd in the very face of the Enemy, though
there was a disaster happened upon that occasion, thorough the heat, and vanity of
some young Gentlemen, who because they had a mind to break their Launces, would
needs indiscreetly seek the Enemy, by whom they were defeated, and all taken, both
Monsieur <hi>d' Annebaut,</hi> and all the rest.</p>
            <p>Soon after which the Imperialists retir'd and the King's Army also: As for me,
seeing there was no great matters to be done thereabouts, I return'd presently after
into <hi>Provence,</hi> where I had left my great Horses, and my Armes: and where about ten
or fifteen days after, I received a Packet from the said Monsieur <hi>le Grand Maistre,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there was a Commission to raise two Ensigns of Foot, and to march them away
into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whither the King himself was also going in person to relieve <hi>Turin,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into <hi>Gascony,</hi> and made so good hast, that in eight days I had rais'd the two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
of which I made Captain <hi>Merens</hi> my Lieutenant; when, being about <hi>Tholouse,</hi>
I left the men with him, and went away Post, having heard that Monsieur <hi>le Grand
Maistre</hi> was already arriv'd at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and that he march'd in great diligence to gain
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105656:27"/>
the <hi>Pas de Suze,</hi> wherein he shew'd himself to be no novice in War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that seeing
I could not bring up my Companies time enough to be with him at that Engagement,
I was resolved to be there alone: I could not however make so great hast, but that
I found the King got before me to <hi>Sorges,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>le Grand Maistre</hi> two days
march further advanc'd: where His Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty commanded me to return to my command,
and to come up with <hi>Ambres</hi> and <hi>Dampons,</hi> who had each of them two Companies
more, telling me moreover, that we were to be commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Chavigni,</hi>
and giving me further instructions that we were to sit down before <hi>Barsellonette,</hi> and
to seize all the Towns thereabout into our hands.</p>
            <p>So soon as I came to <hi>Marselles,</hi> I had news brought me, that my two Companies
had disbanded themselves; for (as the ambition of the world is great) Monsieur <hi>de
Lieux</hi> my Brother had sent to my Lieutenant to desire him, that he would loyter a
while in expectation of him up and down the Country thereabouts, forasmuch as he
was raising a Foot Company,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lieux,</hi> brother to Mr. <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> which he intended speedily to march away under the
shadow of my Commission; to which my Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>utenant very indiscreetly consented, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the promise he had made me to march five leagues a day. But as my
Lieutenant had quitted the great Road, and turn'd aside towards <hi>Albigeois</hi> to spin out
the time, he came at last to a Town call'd <hi>l'Isle,</hi> where the Inhabitants shut their
Gates against him, which forc'd him to give an assault, as he did, and carried the place,
with so suddain an execution, that although my said Brother was then within a days
march of him with his Company, yet would he not come up, till the business was
done, where his Soldiers having sack'd the Town, and being by that means loaden
with booty, they were afterwards in so great fear to march, that they all disbanded,
and every one run home with his spoil to his own house. By which you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<note place="margin">A Captain ought as sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as he can to leave his men.</note> that an officer ought very seldom to leave his command, if not upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

mine, which was the cause of this disorder. I was therefore constrain'd to raise
two other Companies in <hi>Provence,</hi> wherein the Count <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour'd me very much, so
that I had soon dispatch'd, muster'd at <hi>Villeueufve d' Avignon,</hi> and made so great hast,
that (notwithstanding this accident) I yet arriv'd at the Valleys two days sooner than
<hi>Ambres,</hi> and <hi>Dampons,</hi> and took the Castle, and the Town of <hi>Mieulan,</hi> where I made
a halt in expectation of Monsieur <hi>de Chavigni,</hi> and the Companies of the said <hi>Ambres,</hi>
and <hi>Dampons,</hi> who disputed the passage of <hi>Lauzet,</hi> which they could never have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
for all the people of the Country were there gather'd together to defend it: but
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were at <hi>Barselonette,</hi> and those who were gone to defend the
passage, hearing that I had taken <hi>Mieulan,</hi> retir'd by the Mountains (for I was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the great Road towards <hi>Barselonette</hi>) and the common people seeing the said
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to retire, quitted the passe by night, by means whereof they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it.</p>
            <p>We then went to besiege <hi>Barselonette,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> shot.</note> before which place we lay three weeks, where
I receiv'd a Harquebuze shot through my left arm, but it never touch'd the bone, so
that I was presently cured, after which the King having relieved <hi>Turin,</hi> His Majesty
return'd, and we for not having been present at the service, were all three commanded
back; upon which order Monsieur <hi>d' Ambres</hi> went away Post to his said Majesty, with
whom he prevailed so far, that he was pleased to leave him one of his Companies:
which when I understood with what difficulty he had obtain'd, I carried mine back
into <hi>Provence,</hi> where having dismissed them, I retir'd my self to my own house. At
which time there was also a cessation (seeing no peace was to be made) concluded for
ten years.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to commit this to writing (though there be no great matter in it) to
let the world see, that I never rested long in a place; but was always ready at the
first beat of Drum; for the days of Peace were whole years to me, so impatient I
was of lying idle. At the end of this War, the King was pleased to honor Monsieur
<hi>le Grand Maistre</hi> with the Office of Connestable of <hi>France;</hi> an employment that has
ever been vacant (as it is at this day) after the death of Monsieur <hi>de Montmorency.</hi> A

for which he could obtain no manner of satisfaction; he resolv'd to break the Truce,

Orleans,</hi> which was design'd for <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and the other to Monsieur <hi>le Dauphin,</hi>
who came into the County of <hi>Roussillon</hi> to reduce it to his Fathers obedience, having
Monsieur d' <hi>Annebaut</hi> (who since was Admiral) in company with him. I therefore
hearing that the said Mareschal was to take with him the Companies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
which were commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Brissac,</hi> and also an Engineer called <hi>Hieroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
Marini,</hi> reputed the greatest man of <hi>Italy,</hi> for the besieging of places, I had a
great desire to go to the Camp, to learn something of this famous Engineer. Where
being accordingly come, I put my self under Monsieur <hi>d Assier,</hi> who commanded the
Artillery in the absence of his Father, and who never stirr'd from the said <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo
Marini;</hi> by which means I happened to be at the approaches that were made
before the City of <hi>Perpignan</hi> to which we had laid siege: but in two nights I perceiv'd
that all he did signified nothing; for he begun the Trenches so far off, that in eight
days the Canon could not be mounted, as he himself declared; to which I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that in that time the Enemy would have fortified their City, four times as strong
as it was on that side.</p>
            <p>The King had for this Enterprize rais'd the bravest Army that ever my eyes beheld: it
consisted of forty thousand Foot, two thousand men at Armes, and two thousand Light
horse, with all necessary equipage for so considerabe a Body. Monsieur <hi>Montpezat</hi> had
been the Author of the design: though not so secretly, but that <hi>Spain</hi> was before
hand wholly possessed with the expectation of it: which notwithstanding, and that the
Town was excellently well fortified; yet I dare boldly a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>firm that if the Mareschal <hi>d'
Annebaut</hi> would have given credit to my words, he had infallibly done his business.
I had taken a private view of it: for some years before this, Monsieur <hi>le Connestable</hi>
being gone to <hi>Leucate</hi> to treat a Peace with the Emperor's Deputy <hi>Granvelle,</hi> had sent
me with General <hi>Bayard,</hi> and President <hi>Poyet</hi> (who was since Chancellor) to whom
the Emperor's Deputy (at the instance of Monsieur <hi>de Veli</hi> Embassador for the King)
gave permission to go, and recreate themselves three or four days at the said <hi>Perpignan.</hi>

               </note> to the end, that under that disguise I might discover

by the means of a <hi>Fleming</hi> servant to the said <hi>de Veli,</hi> which he had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, to take an exact view of the place; for he had led me quite round the Town
both without, and within, so that I was able to make a report to the Connestable
of all the strength, and defects of the said City; who was pleased to tell me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
that I had made a perfect discovery, as by several others, who had long been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
there, he had been credibly informed.</p>
            <p>Now you must know this was only a pretended divertisement of <hi>Poyet,</hi> and <hi>Bayard,</hi>
who durst by no means take the Kings Engineer in their company, as the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nestable
would have had them, fearing he might be discovered, and themselves, by that means,
detained Prisoners: neither did they fail to relate to him afterwards the fright they
were in when a <hi>Spanish</hi> Captain challeng'd me by my name: but I faced him out of
the business, counterfeiting both my Country, and Language, and dissembling better
to understand how to handle a larding-pin, than a sword, and saying that I was a
Cook to Monsieur <hi>le</hi> President <hi>Poyet,</hi> who himself had not a word to say, for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fear he was in least I should be discover'd: but General <hi>Bayard</hi> laugh'd the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Captain out of his conceit, in private telling him, that he was not the first who
had been so deceiv'd: but that the man he took me for, was one of the best Captains
the King of <hi>France</hi> had. At all this story the Constable did only laugh; but I very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
told him, that he should never make me play the Spye again so long as he liv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
'Tis an employment of too great danger, and that I have ever abhorred: but so it was,
that at that time I plaid the cook to discover the place; which I did exactly well,
and that is the reason why I have said, that had Monsieur <hi>d' Annebaut</hi> given credit to
me, he had easily taken the Town: but he would rather believe a suborned <hi>Gascon</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(which the Enemy had thrust out of Town on purpose, and had order'd to give

we committed! but it was then too late to repent, for the relief was already entred
in, and the time of the Rains was at hand, which would have damm'd up our retreat;
and yet we had enough to do as it was to draw off our Artillery, so ill a place is that
Country, for an Army to move in.</p>
            <p>During the time of this Siege the Company of Monsieur <hi>Boleves</hi> became vacant,
which Monsieur <hi>le Dauphin</hi> sent to entreat for <hi>Boqual</hi> (who since is turn'd Hugonot) and
I also writ to Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother, who was then at the Court at <hi>Salers;</hi>
where the king was so discontented, by reason of the ill success of this enterprize, both
with the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Annebaut</hi> (who had also sent to sollicite it in the
behalf of another) that His Majesty would neither grant it to the one, nor the other:
but was pleased to confer it upon me. The Camp being raised, Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi>
had <hi>Capestaing assign'</hi> d him for Garrison, and Monsieur <hi>de I' Orge</hi> (Colonel of the
Legionaries)<hi>Tuchant</hi> (the place to which they had drawn off all the ammunitions of
corn that had been left in the Camp) assigned him for his, Where three days after
all the said Legionaries forsook him, nothing but their Captains remaining behind;
who thereupon sent to Monsieur <hi>Brissac,</hi> that if he did not come speedily to his relief,
he should be constrain'd to abandon the said provisions, and to shift for himself: which
made us march with all possible diligence, without being more then half a night only
upon our way, and found him totally left alone, saving for Messieurs <hi>de Denez,</hi> and

            <p>Now there was a Castle upon the Mountain towards <hi>Perpignan,</hi> about a League from
<hi>Tuchant,</hi> and on the left hand of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the said Seigneurs <hi>de Brissac</hi> and <hi>de I Orge</hi>
being gone out of the said <hi>Tuchaut</hi> to hear Mass at a little Chappel about a Cross-bow
shot from thence; at our coming out from Mass we heard very many Harquebuze
shot at the said Castle, and discover'd a great many men about it, with a great smoak
of Powder, whereupon I ask'd Monsieur <hi>de Brissac,</hi> if he were pleas'd that I should
go thither with thirty or forty of my men, to see what the matter was; who
presently gave me leave so to do: wherefore without any more delay, I presently sent

of the said Seigneur, together with fifty or threescore Soldiers of the same. I made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great hast, when so soon as the Enemy had discovered me, as I was beginning to climb
the Mountain, they retreated down the other side into a plain which lies below <hi>Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>
where they clapt themselves down under the Olive trees, to stay for the rest of
their fellows, that they had left behind them at <hi>Mila<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Barennes,</hi> an Archer of the Kings Guard, who had been placed there by Monsieur <hi>de
Montpezat,</hi> and whilst the said <hi>Barennes</hi> was shewing me the Enemy, appear'd
<hi>Peloux</hi> with his Soldiers, and with them a Gentleman called <hi>Chamant,</hi> a very brave
man, so that although we knew the Enemy to be above four hundred men (as
we were also assured by <hi>Berennes</hi>) we nevertheless concluded to go, and fight
them.</p>
            <p>This place was all Rock tufted over with a little Copse, thorough which we were
to pass to get to them; wherefore we agreed, that <hi>Peloux</hi> should take a little path on
the right hand, and I another on the left, and that the first which came up to them,
in the plain, should fall upon them, the one in the Front, and the other in the
Rear; which we had no sooner concluded, but that the Enemy rose up, and we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

Plain, I was as good as my word, for I charg'd the Enemy thorough and thorough;
breaking in after such a manner amongst them, that above twenty of them at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
were left dead upon the place, and we pursued them fighting, as far as the
bank of the River, which might be some four hundred paces or more: But when they
saw us to be so few, they rallied, and as I was about to retire, march'd directly up to
me, whereupon I made a halt, as they did also at the distance of four or five Pikes
length only from one another, a thing that I never saw done before. As for <hi>Peloux,</hi>
when he was got to the middle of the Mountain, he began to think that I had taken
the better way, which made him suddainly to turn off, and to follow my steps: and
fortune also turn'd so well for me, that as we were Pike to Pike, and Harquebuze to

we pursued pricking them forward with our Pikes, and pelting them with our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze
shot in their Rear: but they march'd so very close, that we could no more
break into them as before; and when they came to the bank of the River they made
a halt, facing about and charging their Pikes against us, so that although <hi>Peloux,</hi> and

out as it did, mounted to horse, and came so opportunely to the Castle of <hi>Tantavel,</hi>
that they saw all the fight, and were in so great despair at the Charge I had made,

am apt to believe it might not be altogether his fault (for he was a very brave Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman)
but his Guides that led him the worse way, as <hi>Peloux</hi> himself since told me.
However so it fell out, that the field was mine, with the loss of three men only, and not

have been set on foot by the Command of the Emperor, and the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> with
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> for ten years past, have been kept so secret, that the greatest part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
are not fully enformed thereof. Does not every one know what Truces, and what
treaties of Peace (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

several times made to pay yearly a vast Tribute to the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> for the kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary?</hi>
and yet he makes it a case of Conscience to endure, that a little King should hold that
Kingdom under the favour and protection of the <hi>Turk,</hi> as a thing inconsistent with Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and unbeseeming a Christian Prince? To which I could truly add, that at the time when
the Peace was concluded betwixt your most Serene Republick and the <hi>Turk,</hi> the king of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> by the secr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The same Ministers of the Emperor do think also, that they discharges themselves from all

observations of the long abode that the Naval Army of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> has, for some months,
made in the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> and under that pretence would, by their passionate calumnies,
impose upon the world a new Article of Faith, to wit, that no Prince, for his own defence, either
can or ought to derive succours from such, as are of a Religion contrary to his own; not taking
notice, that in condemning the King, my Lord and Master, they at the same time accuse <hi>David,</hi>
a valiant King, and a holy Prophet, who seeing himself persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> fled away to <hi>Achish,</hi>
who was an Idolater, and a profess'd Enemy to the Law of God; and not only so, but some
time after, moreover rank'd himself in the Squadrons of the Infidels, even then, when they
went to fight with the people of his own Religion. They also condemn <hi>Asa</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> who
called into his aid the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> to deliver him from the oppression of the King of <hi>Israel.</hi>
They moreover reproach <hi>Constantine,</hi> a most Christian Prince, and he, who of all the
Emperors, has best deserved of the Christian Commonweal, who in most of his expeditions,
carried along with him a great number of Idolatrous <hi>Goths</hi> in his Army. They likewise taxe
<hi>Boniface,</hi> so highly commended by St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Epistles, who, for his own defence,
and perhaps to revenge some injury receiv'd, called into <hi>Affrick</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> profess'd enemies to our Religion.</p>
            <p>They calumniate <hi>Narses</hi> (the slave of <hi>Justinian,</hi> a very valiant, but, above all, a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

that might be sufficient to preserve the Dignity and Authority of the Empire, turn'd his thoughts
towards the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> an Idolater, and entreated him in his last Will to accept the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,
and Protection both of his Son, and the Empire. A choice that was singularly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all the Christian Princes of that time, and so much the more, for that the king of <hi>Persia</hi>

that never in times past, did either <hi>Turkish</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi> Army behave themselves so modestly

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105656:30"/>
needful, and necessary for the King, my Master, to serve himself with this Army, therewith to
correct the insolence of the Emperor's people, who had already seized upon four of his Gallies at
<hi>Toulon,</hi> it may moreover be affirmed without reply, that to this private benefit of ours, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the publick utility of all Christendom.</p>
            <p>I flatter myself (most Serene Prince) clearly to have demonstrated to you, and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by evident reasons, and infallible Arguments, these two principal things. First that
the King without prejudice to his title of <hi>most Christian,</hi> has accepted the succours that have been
sent him by the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> and in the second place, that these succours so sent have been
of greater profit, than disadvantage to the Christian Common-weal: to which I shall add a third,
and that with as much brevity, as the importance of the subject will permit; and that is, that the
Kings Majesty has not accepted these forces, either out of any ambition of Rule, or out of revenge
for injuries received; neither to enrich himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the spoils of others; nor to recover what
has been unjustly usurped from himself; but has only entertained them for his own defence,
that is (Illustrious Senators) for the defence of his Kingdom, which the Emperor both by open
violence, and clandestine practice, by all sorts of intelligences, and treacheries, contrary to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and justice, has evermore labour'd to overthrow: and yet his Ministers are not ashamed to
say, that his <hi>Caesarean</hi> Majesty has had no other motive to invade the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> but
only to break the friendship that was said to be contracted betwixt the Kings Majesty, and the
<hi>Grand Signior.</hi> O tender Consciences! O holy pretences! fit indeed to delude the credulous, and
ignorant, but that will hardly pass (Illustrious Senators) with you, who in your admirable and
celebrated wisdom, even before I could open my lips, must needs be satisfied in your own bosoms
of the contrary, and in your prudence easily discern the foundation of this War to have been no
other than a design to ruine that Kingdom, which for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se thousand years past has approved it
self the true and willing refuge of the oppressed, and the only Sanctuary of all sorts of afflicted
persons. I would fain know of these men, who invent these subtil Arguments, what holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Faith spurr'd on the Emperor, combined with the King of <hi>England,</hi> to invade <hi>France</hi> on
the side of <hi>Champagne</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> an expedition that only ended in the burning of some
few inconsiderable Villages, and the Siege of <hi>Mezieres,</hi> very dishonorable for him? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
prick'd him on, at a time when <hi>Italy</hi> liv'd in peace, and assurance, by reason that <hi>Naples,
Millan, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> were possessed by several Princes, to come and shuffle all things
into discord and confusion? What Religion (I say) moved him to league and combine himself
with Pope Leo, to ravish away the state of <hi>Millan,</hi> which in a direct line of succession appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to to the Children of my King and Master? What mighty zeal for Religion prompted him
to cause our King to be murthered by means of a Prince of <hi>France,</hi> whom, to that end, he had
suborned with prayers and tears? when seeing his execrable practice, (before it came to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
to be wholly detected, he sent the Seigneur <hi>de Bourbon,</hi> with an infinite number of people
into <hi>France,</hi> in hope to effect that by open force, which (the bounty and providence of God not
permitting him) by secret treacheries he could not bring to pass? What inspiration of the holy
Ghost might it be, that seven years since conducted the Emperor, with seventeen thousand Foot, and
ten thousand Horse, to invade the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> then, when he entred by <hi>Picardy,</hi> and
<hi>Provence?</hi> What command of the Gospel can ever be found out, such as these men have found,
who make a shew of so great devotion to the Christian Name, that can justifie to the world the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
betwixt the Emperor and the King of <hi>England,</hi> especially the said King by the proper
solicitations, and pursuit of his Caesarean Majesty being at that time by the Pope declared a
Schismatick, a Heretick, and a Rebel? A conspiracy that cannot be baptiz'd by the name of a
necessary succour: but an unjust, wicked, and detestable confederacy complotted betwixt them
two, to the end that they might divide betwixt them a Christian, and a Chatholick Kingdom;
which in all times, when any occasion has presented it self for the propagation of our Faith, has
ever shew'd it self prodigal, both of its Blood, and Treasure.</p>
            <p>But the whole world (most Serene Princes) were too little to satisfie his appetite of
Rule;<note place="margin">He means when Henry the eighth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated Queen Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</note> so precipitously is he hurried on by his Ambition and Revenge. Would he not have been
sensible of the shameful affront put upon him by the <hi>English</hi> King in the person of his Aunt, had
not the design to subjugate all Christendom transported him to forget that outrage? How often,
to frustrate the <hi>Turkish</hi> attempts, and to prevent the manifest ruine of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
have means been tryed, and endeavours used, to procure a peace and union amongst those
Princes, and still in vain? Whereas now all particular animosities, and private interests, the
respect to Religion, the common desire of liberty, the obligation of so many benefits <unclear>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</unclear>
received from our Forefathers, and of late from us, laid aside, and forgot; they are, to
our great prejudice, confederated, and united like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> who from mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that they were, became friends, and Associates only in order to the persecution of Iesus

the Emperor go about to ruine, burn, and put to spoil this Kingdom, in his passage thorough

of this Kingdom wherein for fifty days together, by the courtesie, and bounty of the
King my Lord and Master, he saw himself more highly honoured, and respected, then their own
natural Prince, with a power to command all things more absolute, than if he had been in
his own Palace? Shall the <hi>Almans</hi> go about to make Hinds, and Slaves of those, who for the
conservation of the <hi>German</hi> liberty, have so liberally exposed themselves, at the vast expence,
and loss of their substance, and the effusion of their own blood? Shall the <hi>Germans</hi> and the
<hi>English</hi> go about to ruine the Religion, that we with our valiant Armies, and by the Doctrine
of an infinite number of men, eminent for piety and learning, have esserted and publish'd to all
the world? Shall the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a people whom so often, and by di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Christian Faith, go about in revenge to compel us to forsake that Religion, which so
long, and with so great honor to the name of Christ, we have maintained and upheld? If it
must be so that (contrary to all duty and right) we must be abandoned by the rest of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world (which God avert) we who are the Subjects of the King, my Lord and Master, may
with great reason and justice, cry unto God for vengeance against them all, for so foul an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</p>
            <p>These are returns, by no means suitable to the merits of our Forefathers, for (having by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
assistance) gain'd so many signal victories for Christendom under the conduct of <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi>
in those times when they fought with, and cut pieces fifty thousand <hi>Saracens,</hi> that were
come into <hi>Spain.</hi> These are by no means fit rewards for the desert of our Ancestors, who (by
the favour of the Almighty) acquir'd great advantages for Christendom, at the time, when by
their Forces under the conduct of <hi>Charlemain</hi> the Infidels and <hi>Saracens</hi> were driven both out
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Asia.</hi> These are by no means acknowledgments proportionable to
the reputation our people (by the Grace of God) acquir'd in the time of <hi>Urban</hi> the second, who
without any difficulty, or the least contradiction, dispased our King, his Princes, Nobility, Gentry,
and generally the whole body of the Kingdom, against the adversaries of our Faith; insomuch
that altogether, and through our assistance, they coquer'd the Kingdom of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
the Holy Land. These are by no means fit recompences for the desert of so many expeditions
against the enemies of our Faith, fortunately undertaken by our Progenitors, under the
Reigns of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> And when his Holiness shall see so many Nations
confederated, with a mischievous intent to ruine the rest of Christendom, and resolved to oppress
this Kingdom, which of all other has best merited of the Christian Common-weal, I cannot
doubt, but that he will lend us such succours, and assistance as he shall judge necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and defence. And should his Holiness do otherwise, he would do very much against
himself, and contrary to the duty of an <hi>Italian,</hi> a Christian, and a Prelate. Of an <hi>Italian,</hi>
forasmuch as our Holy father does very well understand, that the servitude, and calamity of
<hi>Italy,</hi> can proceed from no other accident, than from the ruine and desolation of the Kingdom of
<hi>France:</hi> Of a Christian forasmuch as the name of Christ having in all Ages been defended and
propagated by this Kingdom, and it being at this time invaded by the means and ambition of
the Emperor, and so many Nations strangers to our Religion, it cannot in this exigency be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by any but such, as are no very good friends to the Christian Faith: Of a Prelate for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it were contrary to the duty of his Holiness, being, as he is, thoroughly informed, and
very well in his own knowledg assured, that the Emperor, obstinate in his own will, and resolute to
subjugate both the <hi>French, Italians,</hi> and all other Christians, would never hearken to any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of accommodation, that has by his Holiness been propounded to him. Whereas on the contrary
the King my Master (equally desirous of his own, and the publick quiet) has often offered to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
all his interests, and differences to the judgment of our Holy Father. To discharge then
the office of a true Prelate, and a true Iudg, may he not take arms against him, who has not the
confidence to deny, but that he is the sole perturbator of the publick peace, and the universal
good? Which though his Holiness should forbear to do, yet to reprove his ingratitude in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

have so loved, honored, and esteemed, should be weakened by the means of your Enemies; a
people with whom (neither you, nor we being degenerated from the vertue of our Predecessors)
you may yet expect to perform more exploits; and such as may be for the enlargement of your
own Dominions, and the universal benefit of all Christendom. I hope you consider (Illustrious

               </gap>se of the Imperial party your Lordships
may have been prepossessed, and as a most humble servant to you all, do beseech, and conjure you
(most illustrious Senators) to consider the miserable estate of <hi>Italy,</hi> and generally of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and before you resolve or declare for either party, not only to bear the most Reverend, and
Illustrious Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> but also thoroughly to weigh, and examine what be shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to you in the behalf of the King my Master. And once more most humbly beseech your
Serene Highness with your accustomed Prudence to consider the Emperor, not only as the cause
of the ruine, and misery of <hi>Italy:</hi> but moreover to look upon him as the Insidiator of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of this most Serene Republick. Acknowledg, acknowledg, I beseech you, the house of <hi>Aus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
for your Capital Enemy, and such a one, as has at all times used all sorts of endeavour to
encroach upon, and to usurp the Territories and Dominions of others, and especially those of your
most Screne Republick. And on the contrary that most Christian King, my Lord and Master,
for your ancient, faithful, and affectionate friend, and remember with what promptitude, and
alacrity, he has ever divided his Forces with you, for the recovery of your places unjustly possessed
by those of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> of which the recovery of <hi>Brescia,</hi> and <hi>Verona</hi> may serve for a
sufficient proof. Neither is there any cause to fear, that such a friendship can by any means
suffer it self to be violated, or dissolved; forasmuch as there having been betwixt that Crown
of <hi>France,</hi> and this Illustrious Seigneury no kind of difference, either ancient, or of later date,
and the one holding nothing of the other, the occasions must consequently be wanting upon which
the amities of Princes de ordinarily dissolve: but on the other side, their Vnity, Allyance, and

            <p>What opinion the Senate might retain of so nice an affair, I am not able to say,
neither do I know whether my Brothers eloquence made them approve of a thing,
at which they had before been so highly scandalized: but this I know, that I have ever
heard that action highly censured both then and since: and in plain truth, I do believe
our affairs were not much better'd by it, but it is not for me to meddle with so great
affairs. So soon as these mighty succours of the <hi>Turk</hi> arrived, every one thought the
whole Earth had not been capable to receive them, such judgments men make of things
before they come to be tryed.</p>

In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> solicited the Marquis <hi>de Gnast</hi> for relief, who
accordingly with a good Army put himself into the Field. The <hi>Turks</hi> very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
our people, yet I do not believe they could beat us number for number: they are,
'tis true, stronger men, more obedient and more patient of any hardship, than we are;
but I cannot allow them to be more valiant; they have indeed one advantage over us:
which is, that they study nothing but War. <hi>Barbarossa</hi> at this Siege was very much
displeased, and cast out very tart and passionate language, especially when we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to borrow of him powder, and bullet, insomuch that he reimbarked himself,

            <p>I had forgot to tell you, that after the ill success at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the King sent us or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

who was almost wounded to death. The said Admiral having taken some few little

               </note> that the Marquess <hi>de Guast</hi> (who was one of the most cautelous and

            </p>
            <p>The same day that <hi>Montdevi</hi> was surrendred, I had departed from <hi>Savillan</hi> (to the
great regret of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi>) with five and twenty Foot, to try if I could find
means to put my self into it; for with a great party it would be a matter of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
difficulty; and took with me a Guide, who would undertake to conduct me
by the deep vallies, and by a River that runs by <hi>Montdevi,</hi> in which we were to march
a great way together, the water being but knee deep, and I do believe by that way I
might have got in, though it would have signified nothing if I had, forasmuch as I must
have done as the rest did, considering that the strangers by their number gave the Law:
but they dearly paid for't, many of them being massacred at their marching out of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105656:32"/>
the Town. I had moreover drawn out ten Soldiers, over and above my five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to convoy me over the <hi>Maupas,</hi> a place so call'd, and within half a mile of <hi>Marennes,</hi>
where a man should hardly ever fail of meeting some of the Garrison of <hi>Fossan.</hi> And
above, and on the right hand of <hi>Maupas,</hi> there stood an empty Inn, from whence one
might discover all that came from <hi>Savillan</hi> straight to <hi>Cairas,</hi> and from <hi>Cairas,</hi> to the
said <hi>Savillan.</hi> As I descended therefore into the plain that leads directly to <hi>Maupas,</hi>
I was there aware of threescfore <hi>Italian</hi> Soldiers of <hi>Fossan,</hi> that were scouting towards
that Inn, which stands upon an eminence, and presently saw the Party move, who made
hast to gain the <hi>Maupas</hi> on that side towards <hi>Cairas,</hi> to sight me in that straight, which
made me turn off on the right hand with intent to fall upon their R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar, so soon as I
should arrive at the Inn; when they perceiving my design, endeavour'd to recover the
road of <hi>Fossan</hi> to retire: but I pursued them so close, that I con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rain'd them to take a
house, which had a stable directly opposite to it, to which I set fire; who thereupon
seeing themselves lost, they began to cry out for Quarter, casting themselves headlong,
some out of the Windows, and some by the door, of which my Soldiers dispatch'd some
in revenge of one of their companions,<note place="margin">A combat near Maupas.</note> very much beloved by them, who was kill'd,
and two more wounded, the rest I sent back to <hi>Savillan</hi> bound together with match, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as they were more in number, than we that took them. I went thence
staight to <hi>Cairas,</hi> and at the Mill below <hi>Cairas</hi> found Monsieur <hi>de Cental,</hi> Governor of
the said <hi>Cairas,</hi> who told me that <hi>Montdevi</hi> was surrendred, having yet the Letters in his
hand, that had been sent him to that effect. I then presently turned about to recover
<hi>Savillan,</hi> and to carry the news to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> that he might send it to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Boitieres:</hi> but as I was on this side <hi>Cairas,</hi> and upon the skirts of the plain near
unto some houses there called <hi>les Rodies,</hi> looking behind me I saw a Troop of Horse,
that came fromwards <hi>Fossan,</hi> along by the meadow leading towards <hi>Albe</hi> which they then
held: which made me to halt at those houses, to see what they would do; in which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, they drawing nearer, discover'd me; and attempted to come up to me by a little
ascent there was, enclosed with hedges on either side: but when I saw them advanced
half up the Ascent, I sent out four or five Harquebusiers, who, firing upon them, shot one
of their Horses, whereupon they very fairly saced about. Which I seeing, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it was for fear, advanced boldly into the plain, where I had not march'd five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces, but I discovered them again in the said plain (for they had passed a little
lower out of sight) being fourteen Launcers, and eight Harquebusiers on horseback,
with another who came after leading the wounded horse. I had in all but five and
twenty Soldiers, of which seven were Pikes, and Captain <hi>Favas</hi> and my self each of us
a Halbert on our necks: Their Harquebusiers came up at a good round trot to charge
us, firing all the way as they came, as some of ours also did at them, and their Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
made a shew as if they would charge in amongst us; but it was very faintly; for
upon the firing of our Harquebusiers they made a halt, and gave way, at which we took
heart, and march'd boldly up to them with good smart claps of Harquebuze shot, upon
which one of their men falling dead to the ground, they very fairly left him behind them,
and descending once more into the plain retreated directly towards <hi>Albe.</hi> And thus I
retir'd to <hi>Savillan,</hi> it being two hours within night before I got thither, which I thought
sit to commit to writing, to the end, that other Captains may take exemple whenever
Horse comes to charge the Foot, never to spend more than half of their shot, and reserve
the other half for the last extream, which being observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, they can very hardly be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without killing a great number of the Enemy, who will never venture to break in
whilst they see the Harquebusiers ready presented to fire upon them; who being
resolute men, by the favour of any little bush, or brake, will hold the Cavalry long in
play, the one still firing whilst the other is charging again. For our parts we were all
resolv'd never to yield; but rather to fight it out with the sword, fearing they would
revenge what we had done in the morning, for the four horse that escap'd to <hi>Fossan</hi>
had carried back the news of their defeat.</p>
            <p>So soon as Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> understood that <hi>Montdevi</hi> was taken, he resolved in the
morning to put himself into <hi>Beme,</hi> which he accordingly did, where being arriv'd he there
found two compani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of <hi>Swisse,</hi> which were there in Garrison (having receiv'd also the
others of <hi>Montdevi)</hi> who immediately abandoned <hi>Beme,</hi> and went to <hi>Cairas,</hi> leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Count's own Company, another of <hi>Italians,</hi> and that of Captain <hi>Renovare.</hi> From

               </gap>ssenger to me on horseback, writing me
word, that if ever I would do the King a timely service, I should immediately come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and this was the next day after the said Seigneur arrived at <hi>Beme,</hi> which was <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
and we were but just come from Mass.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:105656:32"/>After therefore having eaten a snap or two, I immediately put my self into the field
to go thither; yet could I not make so much hast, but that it was above three hours
within night before I got thither: it being necessary for me to pass thorough uneasie val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
forasmuch as we believ'd the Town already to be besieged, all the Enemies Camp
being at <hi>Carru,</hi> but three little miles from <hi>Beme,</hi> and they having skirmish'd all the
day before the Town. By good fortune Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Iulian</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Swisse,</hi>
was at the said <hi>Beme,</hi> it being his Garrison, and Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> also, who was come to
give him a visit, and to see what would be the issue of the Siege of <hi>Montdevi:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> puts himself into <hi>Beme.</hi>
               </note> but it was
impossible for the said St. <hi>Iulian</hi> to detain the <hi>Swisse,</hi> for I met all the four Companies
already within half a mile of <hi>Cairas.</hi> I had so much honor done me, that both the
Count, and the Countess his Mother, together with several other great persons, came to meet
me at the Gates of the City, who were very glad of my coming, expecting in the morning
to be besieged; but two days after my arrival their Camp march'd away toward <hi>Trinitat,</hi>
having cast a Bridge over the River, near to <hi>Fossan;</hi> and the morning that the Camp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
five or six light horse of Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and four or five Gentlemen belonging
to the Count <hi>de Beme</hi> (who serv'd for Guides) with five or six Harquebusiers on horseback
of mine, went in pursuit of their Camp. It was so great a mist that they could scarce
see one another, which was the reason that they went to the very head of their Artillery,
and took the Commissary (whom they call the Captain of the Artillery;) and the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Messieurs <hi>de Termes, d' Aussun,</hi> and <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Iulian</hi> were gone away, having had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that the Enemy were making this Bridge; whereof Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Iulian</hi> went
straight to <hi>Cairas,</hi> where the <hi>Swisse</hi> likewise would not abide, but went thence to <hi>Carig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan;</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> who doubted also they might go to <hi>Savillan,</hi> of which he was
Governor, went thither; and Messieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> went in great hast directly to <hi>Turin;</hi> In
short every one was in fear of his own charge.</p>
            <p>The said Bridge was further advanc'd than was imagin'd, for those of <hi>Fossan</hi> made it in
three or four days, that their Camp lay at <hi>Carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was taken, the greatest part of the Army was already pass'd over, and was encamp'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Marennes:</hi> particularly the Battaillon of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were quarter'd in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
and the out-houses of the Palace of Messire <hi>Phillibert Canebons,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Savillan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had brought with him to <hi>Beme</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Caillac,</hi> the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
of the Artillery, who would needs stay with me out of respect to the great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
betwixt us (which does yet continue) and we were in despair of ever getting any
thing out of the said Commissary prisoner, till it grew to be very late, and then he told,
and assured us, that the Army was gone to besiege <hi>Savillan:</hi> At which Monsieur <hi>de
Caillac</hi> and I were almost at our wits end; for the said Sieur <hi>de Caillac</hi> had his residence
more at the said <hi>Savillan,</hi> than at any other place, and I also, being it was my Garrison,
and where I had continued for seven or eight months before. In the end we both of us
resolv'd to go put our selves into it at all hazards and adventures that might befall. I
had five and twenty Soldiers of mine own on horseback, which I took together with
four of five more of Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> which he had left at <hi>Beme</hi> (to the great
grief of the Count, who would never be persuaded to permit Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> and
the rest of the Company to depart) and about two hours within night, we arriv'd at
<hi>Cairas,</hi> where we spoke with Monsieur <hi>Cental,</hi> whom we found in a very great chase, for
that the <hi>Swisse</hi> had that day forsook him, and he told us that it was very great odds we
should find the Camp lodg'd in the Countrey houses belonging to <hi>Savillan,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi>
excepted, who were quarter'd as I have said, and took up all the space betwixt that and
<hi>Marennes,</hi> thorough which we were to pass; for my other way it was all ditches and
Rivolets very troublesom to pass, especially having no Guide with us, which we had not
provided our selves of, by reason we all of us very well know the ordinary way. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we pass'd thorough the middle of the Village of <hi>Marennes,</hi> without any encounter
at all (forasmuch as the Enemies Cavalry was yet about <hi>Fossan)</hi> and so came to <hi>Savillan,</hi>
about two hours after midnight, where at the Gate of the Town we found Captain <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reze,</hi>
Brother to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him to assure him, that we were all resolv'd to dye, or to preserve the place.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Caillac,</hi> and I then went to find out Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> at his Quarters, where
stealing upon him before he heard any thing of us, we found him writing down the order
of the Siege, with his back towards the door, which being open, he never heard nor saw
us, 'till I coming behind him, and taking him in my arms said to him, <hi>Did you think
to play this Farce without us?</hi> at which he suddainly start up, and leap'd about my neck,
being scarce able to utter a word for joy, and likewise embrac'd Monsieur <hi>de Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

telling me, that he wish'd he had given half his estate, my Company was there also with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105656:33"/>
me; to which I made answer, that I would make them to fly, provided he would sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
find a messenger to carry a Letter to my Lieutenant Captain <hi>Favas;</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hereupon we dispatch'd thither a Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>man of his, who before noon got to <hi>Beme,</hi>
where so soon as the said Captain <hi>Favas</hi> had read my Letter, he presently went to acquaint
the Count, that he must of necessity depart. The Count was again very importunate with
him to stay; but nevertheless he march'd out about three of the Clock in the afternoon,
and left the Flag of my Ensign as he pass'd by <hi>Cairas</hi> with Monsieur <hi>Cental,</hi> who plainly
told him that he must not expect to pass without fighting, to which he made answer, that
it was also all he did desire. We had given instructionsv to the Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>man, that so soon as he
should come to the end of the plain, he should lead him straight towards the Mill of the
said Messer <hi>Philibert,</hi> which was about a Harquebuze shot distant from his Palace, and
that then he should follow on along the side of the River, preparing himself to sight at the
said Mill, not doubting but that he would there certainly meet with the <hi>Germans:</hi> but
that nevertheless if he would avoid fighting, he should by all means do it, and make it
his only business to get into the Town. A caution that was very much in season, for the
<hi>Germans</hi> had dislodg'd the very morning that we pass'd by, and were encamp'd at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes:</hi>
but about two hours after midnight he safely arriv'd, which redoubled the joy,
not of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> only; but moreover of all the other Captains and Soldiers,
and the Inhabitants of the Town; for to say the truth, I had one of the best, and the
fullest Companies in all <hi>Piedmont.</hi> And indeed I would never have other than the best
men I could choose, for when once I perceiv'd any one not to be right, I ever found one
pretence or another to be rid of him.</p>
            <p>Two hours before day, Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had news brought him that the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> were come that very night to <hi>Cavillimor,</hi> two miles from
<hi>Savillan;</hi> which made us still more confident that the Camp was advancing with a
resolution to besiege us, because they planted themselves upon the way by which we were
to receive our relief; and so soon as the day began to appear there came some from <hi>Marennes</hi>
to give us notice, that all the Infantry was upon the Road towards <hi>Montiron,</hi> and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the plain of St. <hi>Fré,</hi> taking the way rather towards <hi>Carignan,</hi> than <hi>Savillan,</hi> of
which we had still more and more intelligence.</p>
            <p>I then begg'd of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> to give me leave to go out towards <hi>Cavillemor,</hi> to
follow in the Rear of their Horse, which he presently granted, causing Captain <hi>Mons</hi>
his Ensig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with fifty Launces to mount to horse. Now in the time that I was gone to
<hi>Beme,</hi> our Colonel Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had sent the Companies of <hi>Bog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>edemar</hi> and the
Baron <hi>de Nicolas</hi> in great diligence to <hi>Savillan,</hi> and my own men being weary, I took
only Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> and those who had come in with me, who were pretty well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd,
and some forty of the others, that were come overnight. Captain <hi>Lienard</hi> at
that time Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>utenant to <hi>Gabarret</hi> with thirty or forty of his Company, and Captain <hi>Breü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il</hi>
the Baron's Ensign, who (as I was very lately assur'd) is yet living, and has since
been shot in the leg of which he is lame (as I am told) with as many of the Company of
the said Baron, and went straight to <hi>Cavillemor,</hi> along the banks of a great Rivolet, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the said <hi>Cavillemor,</hi> and on the left hand the great high way, when being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
within half a mile of the Town, I was overtaken by one of Captain <hi>Gabarret</hi>'s
men, whom he had sent to me, to desire I would stay a little for him, he being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to horse to come after me with all possible speed. I therefore made a halt, but
(as he was ever very tedious and slow) he made us there to tarry for him above a long
quarter of an hour, and so unhappily for me, that had I held on my way without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him, I had met with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> at a little Chappel without <hi>Cavillemor,</hi>
towards <hi>Savillan,</hi> where he was at Mass, with only five and twenty Horse for his Guard,
the Marquis being gone away with all the Cavalry towards <hi>Rouy,</hi> and already advanc'd
above a long mile from thence upon his way. Thus a little delay oftentimes causes a
great inconvenience, otherwise we had at this time perhaps light of a good booty:
but so soon as the said <hi>Gabarret</hi> came up to us, I went on, and came presently to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villemor,</hi>
where the people of the Town enform'd me, that the said Duke could not
yet be above half a mile from thence, which made both Captain <hi>Mons,</hi> me and
all the Soldiers ready to eat our own flesh, to think what a prize we had lost
through the negligence of <hi>Gabarret,</hi> whom to his face we curs'd to all the Devils of
Hell.</p>
            <p>After we had here staid a pretty space, not knowing what we should resolve to do,
we at last began to put our selves upon our return home, when the intelligence we
had from <hi>Marennes</hi> coming into my head, I presently alter'd that resolution, and took
the way thorough the Meadows that leads towards that plain, still hearing the Drums
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105656:33"/>
of the Enemies Camp both before and behind us at the same time; for it is not above
half a mile from <hi>Cavillemor</hi> to the sight of the plain, and so soon as we came
within sight of it, we discover'd three or four Lacquais that follow'd the Camp. Two
or three of our light horse spurr'd out to take them, and accordingly brought them
in, by whom we learn'd that after them follow'd two Ensigns of Foot, and a Troop
of Horse commanded by Monsieur <hi>de la Trinitat:</hi> the said two Companies of Foot were
those of the Count <hi>Pedro d' Apporta</hi> Governor of <hi>Fossan,</hi> which were conducted by a
Lieutenant of his call'd Captain <hi>Ascanio,</hi> and the Horse were commanded by the said
Seigneur <hi>de Trinitat,</hi> together with the ammunition, bread, and a good part of the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of the Camp, whereof a great deal belong'd to the <hi>Gormans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
was guarded by fifty Soldiers of the one nation, and as many of the other; so that
they might be some four hundred horses of carriage, or more, and fourscore and ten wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
laden with Provision, and the equipage belonging to the Artillery.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Mons</hi> thereupon went out to discover Monsieur <hi>de la Trinitat,</hi> and went so
near,
that he had his horse shot under him, who presently returning back said these
words to me; <hi>Captain</hi> Montluc, <hi>yonder is enough for us both to give, and to take.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I suddainly leap'd upon a little Mare of one of my Souldiers, and taking one of
my Serjeants with twenty Harquebusiers along with me, went my self to discover the
Enemy, who making no reckoning of those few Horse they had seen, still with Drums
beating, held on their March; when being come pretty near, I saw a multitude of men
and horses marching along the plain, which was the Baggage, and the Waggons, and
afterwards upon the eminence on that side where I was, perceiv'd the two Ensigns and
the Horse upon their march, and counted the Foot to be betwixt three and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men, and likewise the Horse to be betwixt thirty, and five and thirty Launces;
which having done I presently return'd back to Captain <hi>Mons,</hi> and told him, that
having miss'd one great good fortune, we were now to attempt another, to which he
made answer that he was ready to do whatever I would command him. Whereupon
I desir'd him to stay for me, whilst I went to speak to my Soldiers, which he did,
and I spurr'd away to them. Captain <hi>Gabarret</hi> was with the said Captain <hi>Mons</hi> on
horseback, and Captain <hi>Favas, Lyenard,</hi> and <hi>le Breüil</hi> conducted the Foot, when
coming up to them, I spoke both to them, and to the Soldiers, telling them, that
as God had deprived us of one good fortune, he had put another into our hands, and
that although the Enemy were at this time three times as many as we were, yet if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to fight them upon so fair an occasion, we were unworthy the name of Soldiers,
as well out of respect to the honor we should acquire thereby, as in regard to the Riches
we saw exposed before us, which was no contemptible prize. To which all the three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
made answer, that it was their opinion we ought to fight, whereupon, raising my
voice, I spake to the Soldiers saying, <hi>Well, fellow Soldiers, are not you of the same opinion with
these Captains? I for my part have already told you mine, that we ought to fight, and assure
your selves we shall beat them, for my mind tells me so, which has never fail'd me in any
thing I have ever undertaken, therefore I pray Gentlemen conclude them already as good as
our own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it was a custom I always had, to make the Soldiers believe, that I had a certain
kind of presage, which whenever it came upon me, I was sure to overcome: a thing that I
only pretended to amuse the Soldiers, that they might think themselves secure of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and have ever found an advantage by it; for my confidence often emboldned
the most timorous, and simple fellows, nay sometimes the most crafty knaves amongst
them are easie to be gull'd, as these were, who thereupon with one voice cry'd out, <hi>Let us
fight Captain, let us fight.</hi> I then declar'd to them, that I would place four of my Pikes
in the Rear, to keep every one from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>linching back, which if any one should offer to do,
they should kill him, with which they were very well content: but I had much ado
to make the said Pikes to stay behind, according to that agreement, so ardently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
was every one to be the first to fight, though it was very necessary they should do
so, for that evermore disorders are most likely to happen in the Rear.</p>
            <p>I then began to march, when so soon as the Enemy discover'd the Foot, they made
a halt upon the edg of a great hollow, that had in the process of time been worn by the
land flouds, which stretch'd it self in length till it ended under the Hill where we
were. I saw them in the plain with their Launces all advanc'd, not offering to move,
and saw also Captain <hi>Ascanio</hi> upon a little gray Nag, who plac'd his Pikes all in file
along the hollow, and then spurr'd up to the Waggons to draw them up at the end of the
hollow, and then to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Baggage placing them behind, and afterwards to the Horse, by
which order and diligence, I knew him to be a brave man, and fell to consider with
my self, what would be the issue of the fight, of which I now began to be in some doubt,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105656:34"/>
thorough the good order of this Chief. I nevertheless nothing alter'd my resolution;
but whilst Captain <hi>Ascanio</hi> was busie ordering his Battail, I was as diligent to order mine,
giving the Harquebusiers to Captain <hi>Gabarret,</hi> who was on horseback. And you must
take notice, that the Enemies Foot was upon the top of the hollow directly over against
us. I took then the three Captains with the Pikes, and left order with the Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
by no means to shoot till they came within the distance of four Pikes, and to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Gabarret</hi> by all means to see this order observ'd, which he also did. I then desir'd
Captain <hi>Mons</hi> to lend me five and twenty of his Launceers to help me to kill; for they
were so many that in a whole day, though they had had one hand tyed behind them,
we should have had much ado to dispatch them, and with the rest he was to fight their
Cavalry, though they were a great many more then ours. To which he readily consented,
and gave five and twenty of his Launces to the younger <hi>Tilladet</hi> (the same who is now
call'd Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi>) and moreover to Captain <hi>Ydrou</hi> some light horse of the
said Company, who are both of them yet living, as also several others, who were of the
same Troop.</p>
            <p>These orders being given, all of us both Foot and Horse march'd directly towards the
Enemy, and when I expected their Harquebusiers should have thrown themselves into the
hollow, so soon as they should see our men come full drive upon them, they quite contrary
march'd straight up to our men, and all at a clap gave fire within less than four Pikes
length of one another. Now I had given order to our men, that so soon as they had powr'd
in their shot, without standing to charge again, they should run up to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fall
to the Sword, which they also did, and I with the Pikes ran to the end of the hollow,
and fell in desperately amongst them. In the mean time <hi>Ydrou</hi> and <hi>Tilladet</hi> charg'd
Monsieur <hi>de Trinitat,</hi> and put him to rout, and our Harquebusiers and theirs threw
themselves altogether into the hollow: but ours had the upper hand, and our Pike men
had thrown away their Pikes, and were fallen to't with the Sword, and so couragiously
fighting we came all up to the Wagons,<note place="margin">The Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Captain <hi>Mons,</hi> and all, which were all overturn'd
in a moment, and all their men put to flight towards two houses which stood in the
bottom of the plain, where, still pursuing our Victory, and the Horse still firing amongst
them, very few of them reach'd the houses. At the houses some particular men were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to Quarter: but of the rest very few were sav'd, and those who were left alive
were so grievously wounded, that I do verily believe they had little benefit of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Our <hi>Gens d' Armes</hi> in those days wore great cutting Fauchions, wherewith to lop
off armes of Male, and to cleave Morions, and indeed in my life I never saw such blows
given. As for the Cavalry they were all taken running away towards <hi>Fossan,</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Trinitat</hi> excepted, and five others, who being better mounted than the rest, esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
though young <hi>Tilladet</hi> with two others only pursu'd him within two Harquebuze
shot of <hi>Fossan,</hi> and took one who attended one of the Colours, which the Ensign that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it, had thrown upon the neck of him who carried off his horse. Presently after
we began to march, leading off the Wagons, and Baggage, which were of necessity to
return by the same way they had come from <hi>Marennes,</hi> forasmuch as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
could pass no other way, and there I saw so great a disorder amongst our people,
that had twenty of the Enemies horse turn'd back upon us, we had certainly been defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for all the Soldiers both Foot and Horse were so laden with Baggage, and with
horses they had taken, that it had been impossible for Captain <hi>Mons</hi> to have rallyed so
much as one Launce, or I two Harquebusiers: insomuch that we left all the dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risled
and untouch'd; but the Country people of <hi>Marennes</hi> came thither presently after,
and performed that office for them, and have since several times told us, that they got there
above two thousand Crowns; for not above three or four days before, those two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
had muster'd for three months. The booty is very often the occasion of ruine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Captains ought to be exceeding careful, especially when they know there are enemies
Garrisons near at hand, that may sally out upon them; though it is a very hard thing
to take order in, for the avarice of the Soldier is such, that he oftentimes quails under
his burthen, and no reason will serve his turne.</p>
            <p>After this defeat we return'd to <hi>Savillan,</hi> where we found that two Country fellows
had given an Alarm to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> having brought him news that we were
all defeated, and indeed we found him almost at his wits end, but afterwards he was
the most overjoy'd man, that ever he had been in his life. There a man might have had
flesh enough good cheap; for we took above forty <hi>German</hi> Whores and more than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Spanish,</hi> which kind of Cattel was the greatest cause of our disorder. We had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to have shar'd all the spoil equally amongst us, and found that we were but an
hundred forty and five men, and fifty horse, but every one begg'd that he might keep
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105656:34"/>
what he had gotten, promising upon that condition to make me a present, forasmuch as
I had not made it my business to look after spoyl, which I consented to, seeing every one
was content, and they gave me six hundred Crowns, as also the horse presented Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Mons,</hi> but how much I am not able to say, and this we did that day in the Rear
of their Camp. Of our people there was slain upon the place one Soldier only belonging
to Captain <hi>Baron,</hi> with five or six more hurt, and one Corporal of mine, who all recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
There are a great many both of the Horse and Foot yet living, who were present at
this business, who when they shall read this Book, I am certain will not give me the lye.
I cannot remember (which I wonder at my self for) whether Monsieur <hi>de Caillac</hi> was
with us at the engagement or no, or whether Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> did not detain him at
home, but I am sure that if he was not there, he was in <hi>Savillan,</hi> and may very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
all this to be true.</p>
            <p>Now the design of the Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> soon discovered it self, which was to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into <hi>Carignan,</hi> and there to raise a Fort, and leave in it a strong Garrison of Foot, as
he did, and the very day that I gave them this defeat he encamp'd at a Village near
<hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> on the right hand of the Road from <hi>Recoins</hi> to the said <hi>Carmagnolle</hi> (I have
forgot the name) and at midnight sent the greatest part of his Cavalry to get over the
Bridge at <hi>Lombriasse,</hi> over which an hour or two before there had passed two Light horse
of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> (who had been with us at the fight, and were stollen away with
their booty, fearing they should be made to discount) who gave intelligence to Monsieur
<hi>d' Aussun,</hi> and Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin,</hi> who were both at <hi>Carignan,</hi> sent thither by
Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> on purpose to dismantle that place, calling to mind that Monsieur
<hi>de Termes,</hi> and the said Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> had told him four months before, that the
Marquis would do so, and possess himself of it in order to the raising of some Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
there, which would be very prejudicial to the Kings Service.</p>
            <p>I had nothing to do to write this, if it were not for a caution to the young Captains,
who shall read this Book, that they must never attempt to retreat at the head of an Army,
to which they are not strong enough to give Battel. But (as I was saying) so soon as these
Light horse had spoke with Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> and told him of the defeat we had
given them, he had a great mind (as his heart was in a right place) to do something also before
he retir'd: but the said Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> understanding by these Light horse where the
Enemy was, presently concluded, that by break of day they would certainly be upon them,
which made him very importunate with Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> to retire: but he would by
no means hearken to him, and so soon as day appear'd, they saw the Marquis <hi>de Guast,</hi>
all the Infantry, and part of the Horse marching all along the side of the River, when the
Marquis advancing he caus'd Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> to be talk'd withal, only to hold him in
play, which Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> perceiving, call'd out to him, that the Marquis did only this to
amuse him; but he was deaf as before, and would believe nothing (a man cannot avoid
his Destiny) till two Light horse he had sent out upon the Road towards <hi>Lombriasse,</hi>
came and brought him an account of the truth: but it was too late, for already the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of their Cavalry was got over. There was but two Boats there, but they were very
large, and they had begun to pass an hour after midnight.</p>
            <p>Upon this Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> commanded Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> to retire as far as the
Bridge of <hi>Loges,</hi> and there to make a halt, which he did. Foot he had none, but
the Chevalier <hi>Absal,</hi> with his single Company, to whom he gave order to march softly,
after the said Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> and halt very often to relieve him, if occasion were,
which he accordingly obeyed, when on a suddain came up fifty or threescore of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horse to begin the skirmish. It is very true, that besides his own Troop, and that
of Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> he had thirty Launces of the Company of Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the elder <hi>Tilladet,</hi> which had parted from Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> seven or eight
days before, by the command of Monsieur <hi>de Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tieres,</hi> and at his entreaty to send them,
which the said Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> very much repented after, wanting them himself, at
the time when he expected a Siege. The said Seigneur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> then began himself also
to retire, dividing his men into three Squadrons, whom the Enemy follow'd very
close: his Lieutenant, call'd <hi>Hieronymo Magrin,</hi> commanded the first Squadron, whom
the Enemy sometimes beat up to the second, commanded by Monsieur <hi>de Aussun,</hi>
and otherwhiles the said <hi>Hierenimo</hi> recharg'd the Enemy, who were continually supplyed
by a great number of fresh men, and who, as they found themselves the stronger, charg'd
Captain <hi>Hieronimo</hi> with might and main, driving him back into the Squadron of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Aussun,</hi> who thereupon gave a charge, and repell'd the said Enemies up to their
main body, which again charg'd the said Seigneur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> and beat him back to the
forenam'd Captain <hi>Tilladet,</hi> and at the same time another Troop of the Enemy, besides
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105656:35"/>
those, who came up upon the Gallop, charg'd the said <hi>Tilladet,</hi> who was advanc'd to
relieve Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun;</hi> so that the Enemy was four times stronger in Horse,
than we were, and fresh supplies, as they landed, still came up to them, insomuch that
all was put to rout and confusion,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and taken prisoner.</note> Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> beaten down to ground his
Lieutenant, and above fifty more taken prisoners, Captain <hi>Tilladet</hi> twice taken, and
rescued by his men, who closing together, and often facing about, made good their
retreat in spite of the Enemy even to the Bridge of <hi>Loges.</hi> Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin,</hi>
who stood drawn up close by the Bridge, seeing this torrent coming upon him, and
knowing that he with his Troop was not sufficient to remedy the disorder, took it into
consideration, and passed over the Bridge, where he again made head, by which means a
great many more of our People sav'd themselves, who under his protection fac'd about at
the end of the said Bridge. In the mean time the Chevalier <hi>Absal,</hi> who had taken his
way a little on the left hand, was still retreating a foot pace, and often made a halt,
which was the reason that he could never recover the Bridge; for one part of the Enemy
seeing the victory already secure, ran up to him, who having seen all our Cavalry rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and defeated, any man may judge what courage he, or his men, could have, who
were all cut to pieces, their Colours taken, and himself upon a little horse very hardly
escap'd.</p>
            <p>After this manner was Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> defeated, more out of vanity to do some notable
feat, than out of any default of courage or conduct; for in the first place he order'd his
Troops so well, that thay all fought, and secondly himself was taken, overthrown to ground,
with his Sword bloody in his hand, for his horse was killed under him, and would he
have been satisfied with reason, he had never enter'd into dispute with Signior <hi>Francisco
Bernardin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Mr. <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> and Signior <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>
               </note> who had perform'd all, both in his person, and conduct, that a brave Leader
ought to do. But the King, after the said Seigneur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> was set at liberty, made
them friends; for Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> had sent him a Challenge for the wrong he had done
him, in reporting to the Marquis <hi>de Guast,</hi> and elsewhere, that he had abandon'd him
in time of need: but Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> made him an honorable satisfaction, and indeed
both the one and the other had very well perform'd their duty, though had Monsieur <hi>d'
Aussun</hi> taken the advice of Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> he had not been defeated; neither was
it reasonable, that he should throw himself away to no purpose, when he saw it was too
late to repair the fault committed in deferring the time of their retreat so long, as at last to
be forc'd to do it in the face of an Army. I could give several exemples of it, if it were
convenient so to do, where the advice of retreating at the head of an Army, has been as
fatal, as it was here, witness <hi>Monchaut,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>le</hi> Mareschal <hi>de Strozzy</hi> lost
the Battail, not for want of courage, for he was there desperately wounded; nor
through default of conduct, for he had order'd his men for his retreat to <hi>Lusignan,</hi> as
well as any man upon earth could have done. I could also instance <hi>le</hi> Seigneur <hi>Marion
de Santa Fiore,</hi> who lost me almost all my Cavalry near unto <hi>Piance,</hi> in attempting the
same at the head of an Army.<note place="margin">The danger of retreating at the head of of an Army.</note> Many others out of inconsideration have committed the
same error, as I have already instanc'd, and I could name several others, which would
be too tedious to recount. But, I beseech you, fellow Captains, despise not my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
for many brave and prudent Leaders having lost themselves after this manner, no
good is to be expected. A man is only to attempt what he can, and ought to do,
and not attaque his Enemy, and offer to retreat in the face of an Army stronger than
himself.</p>

though he was our Colonel; and it was thus. There was a Merchant of <hi>Barges,</hi> a great

friend, and servant to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and good <hi>French</hi> man, call'd <hi>Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chin,</hi>
who, coming from <hi>Barges</hi> to <hi>Savillan,</hi> was taken by some Light horse belonging to
Count <hi>Pedro d' Apporte,</hi> Governor of <hi>Fossan,</hi> and being a prisoner was sometimes threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be hang'd; and sometimes promised to be put to ransom, with so great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that the poor man for seven or eight days together was in despair of his life:
but in the end he bethought himself to send word to the Count, that if he would be
pleased to give him leave to talk with him, he would propound things that should be
both for his advantage and his honor. The Count thereupon sent for him, where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, <hi>Granuchin</hi> told him, that it should only stick at himself if he were not Lord
of <hi>Barges,</hi> for that it was in his power to deliver up the Castle into his hands, the City
not being strong at all. The Count greedy to listen to this enterprize, presently clos'd
with him about it, agreeing and concluding, that <hi>Granuchin</hi> should deliver up his wife and
his son in Hostage; and the said <hi>Granuchin</hi> proposed the manner of it to be thus; saying,
that he was very intimate with the Captain of the Castle, and that the provisions that
were put into it ever passed thorough his hands, and that moreover he had a share in
some little Traffick they had betwixt them, to wit, betwixt the said Captain of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
call'd <hi>la Mothe,</hi> and himself; and that the <hi>Scotch</hi> man, who kept the Keys of the
Castle was his very intimate friend, whom he also evermore had caused to get something
amongst them, and whom he was certain he could make firm to his purpose; not the
Captain <hi>de la Mothe</hi> nevertheless; but that he was sick of a Quartan Ague, that held
him fifteen or twenty hours together; so that he almost continually kept his bed; and
that so soon as he should be at liberty, he would go and complain to Monsieur <hi>de
Termes</hi> of two men that were reputed Imperialists, who had told him, and given the
Enemy intelligence of his Journey, and that after having left his wife and his son in
hostage, he would go and demand justice of Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> by the mediation of
Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and then would go to <hi>Barges</hi> to the Castle, and that upon a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning he would cause fifteen or twenty Soldiers that <hi>la Mothe</hi> had there, to go
out (leaving only the <hi>Scotch</hi> man, the Butler, and the Cook within) to take those who
had told him, as they should be at the first Mass in the morning, and in the mean time
the Count should cause forty Soldiers to march, who before day should place themselves
in ambush in a little Copse about an Harquebuze shot distant from the Postern Gate, and
that so soon as it should be time for them to come, he would set a white Flag over the said
Postern. Now there was a Priest of <hi>Barges,</hi> who being banish'd thence, lived at <hi>Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san,</hi>
that was a great friend to <hi>Granuchin,</hi> and had labour'd very much for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and he also was call'd into the Council, where amongst them it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the said Priest on a night appointed, should come to a little wood the half
way betwixt <hi>Barges</hi> and <hi>Fossan,</hi> where he was to whistle, to give notice that he
was there, and that if he had corrupted the <hi>Scot,</hi> he should bring him along with
him, to resolve amongst themselves how the business should be further carried
on.</p>
            <p>Things being thus concluded, <hi>Granuchin</hi> writ a Letter to Monsieur <hi>de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
wherein he intreated him to procure for him a safe-conduct from Monsieur
<hi>de Boitieres,</hi> that his Wife and his Son might come to <hi>Fossan,</hi> there to remain pledges
for him, for he had prevail'd so far by the intercession of certain of his friends, that
the Count was at last content to dismiss him upon a ransom of six hundred Crowns; but
that if he was not abroad, and at liberty, no man would buy his goods, out of which he
was to raise that sum; which safe-conduct if he should obtain in his behalf, he desir'd
he would please to deliver it to a friend of his he nam'd in <hi>Savillan,</hi> to whom he also had
writ to desire him to make what hast he could to send his Wife and Son to the said
<hi>Fossan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this being accordingly procur'd, and done, and the said <hi>Granuchin</hi> set at liberty,
he forthwith came to <hi>Savillan</hi> to find out Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> to whom he gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the whole business. Whereupon Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> (who already began to
feel himself falling sick of a dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase that commonly held him fourteen or fifteen days at a
time) sent for me, to whom he communicated the enterprize, where it was by us all
three concluded, that <hi>Granuchin</hi> should go talk with Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him at large of the whole design. To which purpose Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> gave him
a Letter to Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> who, having received and read it, made no great
matter of the business, only writing back to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> that if he knew <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchin</hi>
to be a man fit to be trusted, he might do as he thought fit: by which slight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> enter'd into an opinion, that Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> would be
glad he should receive some bassle, or affront, (and indeed he did not much love him)
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105656:36"/>
which made him once in mind to break off the design, and to meddle no more in it: but
seeing the said <hi>Granuchin</hi> almost in despair to think, that the business should not go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and I being more concern'd than he, that such an opportunity of trapping the Enemy
should be lost, earnestly entreated Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> to leave the whole business to
my care; which he made great difficulty to grant, ever fearing, that should any thing
happen amiss, Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> would do him a courtesie to the King, as the custom
is: for when any one bears a man a grudge, he is glad when he commits any oversight,
that the Master may have occasion to be offended, and to remove him from his command;
condemning him for that he would not be govern'd by the <unclear>wise</unclear>: but in the end with
much importunity, he was content to refer the management of the business wholly to my
discretion.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>Granuchin</hi> departed then to go to <hi>Barges,</hi> where he made discovery of all to
Captain <hi>la Mothe</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> man, to whom Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> writ also, and the
night appointed being come, they both went out, and alone (for <hi>Granuchin</hi> was very well
acquainted with the way) and came to the wood, where they found the Priest; with
whom they agreed, first that that the said Count should acquit <hi>Granuchin</hi> of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
giving him as much as the Soldiers, that took him, had taken from him, and
moreover appoint him an Apartment in the Castle with the Captain he should put into
it, with a certain Pension for his support; and secondly that he should marry the <hi>Scotch</hi>
man to an Inheretrix there was in <hi>Barges,</hi> and also find out some handsom employment
for him, forasmuch as he was never after to return either into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or into
<hi>France.</hi> All which was agreed and concluded betwixt them, and moreover that the Priest
should bring all these Articles sign'd and seal'd with the Arms of the said Count to a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
house in the fields belonging to the Brother of the said Priest, to which he sometimes
repair'd a nights; and that the Sunday following the business should be put in execution.</p>
            <p>Having accordingly received all these obligations, <hi>Granuchin</hi> returned again to <hi>Savillan,</hi>
where he gave us an account of all, and shew'd us the Bond. Now there was only
three days to Sunday, wherefore we made him presently to return, having first agreed
that he should bring along with him two Guides of the very best he could find out;
not that he should however discover any thing to them of the business, but only shew
them some counterfeit Letters, wherein mention should be made of some Wine he had
bought for me.</p>
            <p>The Guides came accordingly by Saturday noon to <hi>Savillan,</hi> when, seeing them come,
I took Captain <hi>Favas</hi> my Lieutenant apart, and privately in my chamber commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to him the whole design, telling him withal, that I had made choice of him for
the execution of it; which he made no scruple to undertake (for he had mettle enough)
and it was agreed that he should tye the Guides together, and that they were by no means
to enter into any high way, or Road: but to march cross the fields. We had much
ado to persuade the Guides to this, forasmuch as they were to pass three or four Rivers,
and there was Snow and Ice all along, so that we were above three hours disputing this
way: but in the end the two Guides were content, to each of which I gave ten Crowns,
and moreover a very good Supper.</p>
            <p>We were of advice, that we should not take many men, that less notice might be taken;
and at that time we were making a Rampire at that Gate towards <hi>Fossan,</hi> where, in
order to that work, we had broken down a little part of the wall, and made a Bridge
over the Graffe, over which to bring in earth from without. By this breach I put out
Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> and with him four and thirty more only, and so soon as we were without,
we tyed the Guides for being lost, and so he set forwards. Now the Enemies assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ours was at the same hour; so that <hi>Granuchin</hi> had directed them the way on
the right hand to come to this Copse, and ours he had ordered to march on the left hand,
near to the walls of the City; who, so soon as they were come to the Postern, there found
<hi>Granuchin</hi> and the <hi>Scot</hi> ready to receive them, it being the hour that the <hi>Scotch</hi> man us'd
to stand Centinel over the said Postern, so that they were never discover'd, and he
disposed them into a Cellar of the Castle, where he had prepar'd a Charcoal fire, with
some Bread and Wine. In the mean time the day began to break, and as the Bell rung
to low Mass in the Town, the <hi>Scot,</hi> and <hi>Granuchin</hi> commanded all the Soldiers in the
Castle to go take these two men (that <hi>Granuchin</hi> had accused to have betrayed him) at
Mass, so that there remain'd no more in the Castle, but only <hi>la Mothe</hi> himself, his <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
de Chambre,</hi> who also trayl'd a Pike, the Butler, the Cook, the <hi>Scotch</hi> man and <hi>Granu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scot</hi> then pull'd up the Bridge, and call'd out Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> making him to
skulk behind certain Bavins in the base Court, kneeling upon one knee, which being done,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105656:36"/>
they went to set up the white Flag upon the Postern; soon after the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iest arriv'd, and
with him about forty Soldiers, who were no sooner entred in, but the <hi>Scotch</hi> man
shut the Gate, and at the same instant Captain <hi>Favas</hi> and his Company slew upon them,
who made some little resistance, insomuch that seven or eight of them were slain; but
<hi>Granuchin</hi> sav'd the Priest, and would not endure he should have the least injury offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him. In the mean time a Country fellow, as he was coming from a little house
below the Castle, saw the <hi>Spanish</hi> Soldiers with their red crosses enter in at the Postern
Gate, and thereupon ran down into the Town to give the Alarm, and to tell them that
the Castle was betray'd; at which news, the Soldiers who had been sent out to take the
two men at Mass, would have return'd into the Castle: but ours shot at them, though
so high as not to hit them, taking upon them to be enemies, and crying out <hi>Imperi,
Imperi, Savoy, Savoy,</hi> which was the reason that the Soldiers sled away to <hi>Pignerol</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
news to Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> that <hi>Granuchin</hi> had betrayed the Castle, and that
the Enemy was within it. Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> thereupon in a very g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat fury, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away a Courrier to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> who lay sick in his bed, and almost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
at the disaster, often crying out, Ah Monsieur <hi>Montlu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> you have ruin'd me,
would to God I had never hearkened to you: and in this error we continued till the
Wednesday following. In the mean time the Soldiers who had enter'd were clap'd
up in the Cellar, my Soldiers taking the Red Crosses, and moreover setting up a white
Flag with a Red Cross upon a Tower of the Castle, and crying out nothing but <hi>Imperi,
Imperi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things being in this posture, <hi>Granuchin</hi> immediately made the Priest to subscribe a
Letter, wherein he had writ to the Count, that he should come, and take possession
of the Town and Castle, for that <hi>Granuchin</hi> had kept his word with him, and then
sent for a Labourer, who was tenant to the Brother of the said Priest, to whom he
caused the Letter to be given by the Priest himself, saying, and swearing to him, that if
he made any kind of Sign, either in giving the Letter, or otherwise, that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
kill him; making him moreover deliver several things to the messenger by word
of mouth; The fellow went away, and upon a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of his own made all the hast he
could to <hi>Fossan,</hi> it being but twelve miles only, immediately upon whose coming the
Count resolv'd that night to send away a Corporal of his call'd <hi>Ianin,</hi> with five and
twenty of the bravest men of all his Company, who about break of day arriv'd at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
So soon as he came to the Castle, <hi>Granuchin,</hi> the Priest, and the <hi>Scot</hi> were ready
to let him in at the foresaid Postern, whilst Captain <hi>Favas</hi> went to plant himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Bavins as before, although <hi>Granuchin</hi> was something long in opening the Gate,
both because he would clearly see, and observe whether the Priest made any sign, and
also for that he had a mind those of the City should see them enter; when so soon as
it was broad day, he opened the Postern, telling them that the Soldiers who came in
with the Priest were laid to sleep, being tir'd out with the long labour they had sustein'd
the day before, and so soon as they were all in, the <hi>Scot</hi> suddainly clap'd to the Gate,
and as suddainly Captain <hi>Favas</hi> start up, and fell upon them, without giving them
time, saving a very few, to give fire to their Harquebuzes, as ours did, who had
them all ready; nevertheless they defended themselves with their Swords, so
that six of mine were hurt, and fifteen or sixteen of this Company were slain upon
the place, of which Corporal <hi>Ianin</hi> was one (which was a very great misfortune to
us) together with a Brother of his, the rest were led into the Cellar ty'd two and
two together, for there were already more prisoners in the Castle, than Soldiers of our
own.</p>
            <p>Now this fight continuing longer than the former, the Enemy in fighting st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll cry'd
out <hi>Imperi,</hi> and ours <hi>France;</hi> insomuch that their cries reach'd down into the City,
and especially the rattle of the Harquebuze shot, so that to avoid being so soon discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
their design being to Train the Count thither (for to that end tended all the Farce)
they all got upon the walls of the Castle, and from thence cryed out <hi>Imperi</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi>
having on their red crosses, as I said before. Now the Country fellow that had been sent
with the Letter to the Count, did not return with those men up to the Castle, but
staid at his Master's Country house by the way, wherefore he was again suddainly sent
for, and another Letter deliver'd to him by the hands of the Priest to carry to the said
Count to <hi>Fossan,</hi> wherein he gave him to understand, that Corporal <hi>Ianin</hi> was so wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he could not write, but that he had given him in charge to render him an account of
all, and that he was laid down to sleep. So soon as the Count had read this Letter, he
put on a resolution to go, not the next day which was Tuesday, but the Wednesday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
(when God intends to punish us, he deprives us of our understandings, as it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105656:37"/>
happened here in the case of this Gentleman.) The Count in the first place was reputed
one of the most circumspect (and as wise as valiant) Leaders they had in their whole
Army, which notwithstanding he suffered himself to be gull'd by two Letters from this
Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, especially the last, which he ought by no means to have relyed upon; nor to have
given credit to any thing, without having first seen something under his Corporal's own
hand, and should have consider'd whether or no it were a plausible excuse, to say, that
the said Corporal was laid down to sleep. But we are all blind when we have once set
our hearts upon any thing of moment. Believe me, Gentlemen, you that are great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers
of Enterprizes, you ought maturely to consider all things, and weigh every the
least circumstance, for if you be subtle, your Enemy may be as crafty as you. <hi>A Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peur
trompeur et demy,</hi> says the Proverb, <hi>Harm watch harm catch,</hi> And <hi>The cunning' stsnap
may meet with his match.</hi> But that which most of all deceived the Count was,
that the Tuesday those of the Town, who thought themselves to be become Imperialists,
and yet in some doubt by reason of the various cries they had heard during the fight, had
sent five or six women to the Castle under colour of selling Cakes, Apples, and Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,
to see if they could discover any thing of Treason (for all those that remain'd in
the Town had already taken the Red Cross;) whom so soon as our people saw coming up
the Hill, they presently suspected their business, and resolving to set a good face on the
matter, went to let down the little draw bridge to let them in. My Soldiers then fell
to walking up and down the base Court with their red crosses, all saving three or
four that spake very good <hi>Spanish,</hi> who fell to talk with the Women, and bought some
of their Wares, taking upon them to be <hi>Spaniards,</hi> insomuch that they afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the Town, assur'd the Inhabitants that there was no deceit in the business:
and moreover brought a Letter which <hi>la Mothe</hi> writ to a friend in the Town, wherein
he entreated him to go to Monsieur <hi>de Botieres,</hi> and to tell him, that he had never
consented to <hi>Granuchin</hi>'s treachery; which Letter he delivered to one of the Women,
knowing very well, that the party to whom it was directed, was not there to be found;
but would be one of the first to run away, as being a very good <hi>French</hi> man: but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was, that the Letter should fall into the hands of those of the Imperial party, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
it did.</p>
            <p>As the Count was coming on Wednesday morning, our people in the Castle disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
him marching along the plain, and the people of the Town went to meet him
without the Gate, where being come, he ask'd them if it were certainly true, that the
Castle was in his hands, to which they made answer, that they believed it so to be:
but that at the entrance of his men the first time, there were a great many Harquebuzes
shot off within, and a very great noise was made: and that on the Munday morning,
when the others entred, they likewise heard a very great noise, that continued longer
than the former, and that they once thought they heard them cry one while <hi>France,</hi> and
another <hi>Imperi</hi> and <hi>Duco:</hi> but that notwithstanding they had yesterday sent their
Wives into the Castle with Fruit, Bunns and Chesnuts, whom they had permitted to
enter, where they saw all the Soldiers with red crosses. The Count hearing this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Liesutenant to alight, and to refresh his horses and men, bidding those of
the Town speedily get something ready for him to eat; for so soon as he had taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Castle, he would come down to dinner, after which he would take their Oath
of Fidelity, and so return back again to <hi>Fossan.</hi> Now you must know it is a very steep
and uneasie ascent from the Town to the Castle, by reason whereof the Count alighted, and
walk'd it up on foot, accompanied with a Nephew of his, another Gentleman and his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.
So soon as he came to the end of the Bridge, which was let down, and the Gate shut;
but the Wicket left open, so that a man might easily pass, and lead his horse after him;
<hi>Granuchin</hi> and the Priest being above in the window, saluting him, desir'd him to enter;
to which nevertheless he made answer, that he would advance no further, till he had
first spoken with Corporal <hi>Ianin;</hi> seeing then that he refused to enter, <hi>Granuchin</hi> in
his hearing said to the Priest (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o get him from thence) <hi>Pray Father go down, and tell Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Janin</hi> that my Lord is at the Gate, where he stays to speak with him,</hi> and at the
same time himself also departed from the window, pretending to go down; whereupon
Captain <hi>Favas</hi> and his Soldiers ran to open the Gate, which was only bolted, and all on
a suddain leap'd upon the Bridge. Seeing this, the Count who was one of the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
men of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and who held his horse by the bridle (the best one of them, that
ever that Country bred, and which I afterwards gave to Monsieur <hi>de Tais)</hi> vaulted over
a little wall which was near to the Bridge, drawing his horse after him, with intent
to have leap'd into the Saddle (for there was no horse so tall (provided he could lay his
hand upon the Pummel) but he could a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105656:37"/>
he was prevented by the Bastard of <hi>Bazordan,</hi> call'd <hi>Ianot</hi> (yet living, and then of
my Company) who by misfortune being he either could not, or would not, get over
the wall to lay hands upon him, let fly at him an Harquebuze, which taking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
of his Arms, went into his belly,<note place="margin">Count <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

side, of which shot he sunk down to the ground. Captain <hi>Favas</hi> took his Nephew, and
another the Trumpet, but the other Gentleman escap'd down the Hill, crying out that the
Count was either kill'd or taken; whereupon the Lieutenant, and all his Company
skutled to horse in so great a fright, that they never look'd behind them till they came
to <hi>Fossan.</hi> Had it so fallen out that <hi>Ianin</hi> at the second entry had not been slain,
they had not only snap'd the Count, and by degrees all his whole Troop (for they
might have compell'd him to have spoke to them, with a dagger at his reins ready
to stab him should he make a sign) but moreover might perhaps from hence have spun
out some contrivance against <hi>Fossan</hi> it self; for one Enterprize draws on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>These things being done, they in the evening dispatch'd away Captain <hi>Milhas</hi> (a
Gentleman of my Company) to bring me the news, and to relate to me from point
to point how all things had passed; together with a Letter from the said Count,
wherein he entreated me, seeing he was my prisoner, and that greater advantage was to
be made of his life than of his death, to do him the courtesie, as to send him with
all speed a Physician, a Chirurgeon, and an Apothecany. Captain <hi>Milhas</hi> arriv'd just
at the time that they open'd the Gates of the City, so that he found me putting on
my cloaths, and there related to me the whole business, thereby delivering me from the
great anxiety, and trouble wherein from Sunday till Wednesday I had continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd;
for though I was really concerned for the place, yet was I much more afflicted
for the loss of my Lieutenant, and my Soldiers, who were most of them Gentlemen,
and all very brave men. Immediately upon the news, I ran to Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi>
his Lodgings, whom I found sick a bed: but I dare say, that neither he nor I were
ever so overjoy'd; for we both very well knew, that had it fallen out otherwise,
there were Rods in piss. So soon as I departed from him, I presently sent away a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
a Chirurgeon, and an Apothecary, whom I mounted upon three horses of my
own for the more speed; neither did they either stop or stay until they came thither:
but it was impossible to save him, for he died about midnight,<note place="margin">His death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and was brought to
<hi>Savillan,</hi> whom every one had a desire to see, even Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> himself, as sick
as he was, and he was very much lamented by all. The next day I sent the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to <hi>Fossan,</hi> but detein'd the Nephew, and Trumpet with the rest that were
taken prisoners at <hi>Barges,</hi> until they should send me back the Wife, and Son of
the said <hi>Granuchin,</hi> which the next day they did, and I also deliver'd up all the
Prisoners.</p>
            <p>I beseech you, Captains, you who shall see and hear this Relation, to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no this was a stratag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m for a Merchant; believe me, the oldest Captain would
have been puzled, and have had enough to carry it on with so much dexterity, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
as he did; wherein although Captain <hi>Favas</hi> was the performer of it, when it came to
execution; nevertheless the Merchant was not only the original contriver, but also a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Actor throughout the whole business, having the heart in order to his revenge,
to expose his Wife and Son to the extreamest danger. In reading of which (fellows
in Arms) you may learn diligence with temper, and take notice what sleights, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices
were used, and continued for the space of four days together, such as no man
either of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (or which is more, of our own) could possibly discover, both parties
being held equally suspended. The Count for a prudent Cavalier, behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
herein with very great levity, especially upon the second Letter; but he repair'd
his fault when he refused to enter the Castle, without first seeing his man; though that
caution signified nothing as it fell out. Whenever therefore you design an enterprize,
weigh every thing, and never go hand over head; and without precipitating your
selves, or being too easie of beliefe upon light foundations, judge and consider whether
there be any appearance, or likelyhood in the thing; for I have seen more deceived than
otherwise, and whatever assurance is given you, or whatever promises may be made, be sure
to raise your Counter-battery, and never rely so wholly upon him, who is to carry on the
work, but that you have still a reserve to secure your venture, should his faith, or conduct

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l. Its not, I confess, well done to condemn him who has the management of
an affair, if it do not succeed; for men should always be attempting how ever they speed,
and hit or miss 'tis all one, provided there be neither treason nor absurdity in the case.
Men must try, and fail; for being we are to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hearts: but however go warily to work. I have ever been of opinion (and do think that
every good Captain ought to have the same) that it is better to assault a place upon a
surprize, where no one is privy to the design, than to have perhaps some Traytor for
your Guide; for as much as you are certain there can be no counter-treason against you;
and though you fail, you retire with the less danger, for your enemy can have laid no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscados
to entrap you.</p>

                  </gap>conis</hi> to the four <hi>Spanish</hi> Companies which
were in Garrison there; that is to say, that of Don <hi>Iuan de Guebara</hi> Camp-Master, of <hi>Louys de
Quichado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Aquilbert,</hi> and <hi>Mendoza,</hi> which made it two days before they durst
set out to march. In the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> was advertised by his spy,
that the said <hi>Italian</hi> Companies were to set forth the next morning, to go put themselves
into <hi>Fossan,</hi> and that they were to have two Troops of Horse to conduct them: but he had
heard nothing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were to go.</p>
            <p>The said Seigneur was at this time but newly recovered of his sickness, who the same
morning communicated the affair to me, and at the very instant we concluded to draw
four hundred Foot out of all our Companies, all pick'd and choice men, to wit, two
hundred Harquebusiers, and as many Pikes wearing Corslets. Captain <hi>Tilladet</hi> (who
had lost but two or three of all his Launces) was not yet return'd to <hi>Savillan,</hi> which was
the reason that Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> his Company was not so strong; and on the other
side Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> his Lieutenant was gone to his own house, and had taken
some few with him, by which means Captain <hi>Mons</hi> could make but fourscore Horse
in all;<note place="margin">A design to cut off the succours of <hi>Fossan.</hi>
               </note> and the Spy told us, that the <hi>Italian</hi> Companies were to take the same way by
which their Army had march'd when they went to <hi>Carignan,</hi> which was by the Plain,
where we before had fought the <hi>Italians.</hi> We therefore concluded to take the way of
<hi>Marennes,</hi> and to be there before them; when as we were going out of the Town Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Cental</hi> arriv'd, who came from <hi>Cental,</hi> having with him fifteen Launces of
Seigneur <hi>MaurYé,</hi> and twenty Harquebusiers on horseback, which hindred us a little,
forasmuch as he entreated Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> to give him a little time to bait his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for he was also of necessity to pass the same way we were design'd to march, to go
to his Government of <hi>Cairas.</hi> To whom we made answer, that we would go but very
softly before, and stay for him at <hi>Marennes:</hi> but that he should make hast; for in
case we should hear the Enemy was passing by, we could not stay for him. Monsieur
<hi>de Termes</hi> had once a great mind to have gone along with us himself; but we entreated
him not to do it, both because he had been so lately sick, and also that the Town being
left in a manner naked, should any misfortune happen to us, it would be in great danger
to be lost.</p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>Marennes,</hi> we there made a halt, staying for Monsieur <hi>Cental,</hi> where
we orderder'd our Battail in this manner, to wit, that the Captains <hi>Gabarret</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
should lead the two hundred Corslets, and I the two hundred Harquebusiers, with
whom I presently took the Vanne, the Corslets following after me, and so march'd
out of the Village. Captain <hi>Mons</hi> also divided his Horse into Troops: but to whom
he gave the first I am not able to say, they being all Camrades, but I do believe it was
either to <hi>Masses, Mousserie, Ydrou,</hi> or the younger <hi>Tilladet;</hi> and when we had march'd
a little way, before we would discover our selves to the valley, thorough which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was to pass, we made a stand. I then took a Gentleman along with me call'd <hi>la
Garde</hi> (he being on horseback) and advanc'd a little forward to discover the valley,
where presently on the other side in the plain of <hi>Babe,</hi> (a Castle belonging to the
<hi>Castellano of Savoy</hi>) I discover'd the three <hi>Italian</hi> Companies, and the Cavalry march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly towards <hi>Fossan.</hi> At which I was ready to run mad, cursing Monsieur
<hi>de Cental,</hi> and the hour that ever he came, thinking there had been no more than those
I saw on the other side, who were already got a great way before us; when being
about to return to tell the rest, that they were already pass'd, and looking down into the
valley (for before I had only look'd into the plain on the other side) I discover'd the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Foot shewing them to <hi>la Garde</hi> (who before saw them no more than I) having
almost all of them yellow breeches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moreover saw their Arms glitter against the Sun,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105656:38"/>
by which we knew they were Corslets. We never dream'd of meeting any more than the
three <hi>Italian</hi> Copanies only, so that had we not by accident made some stay in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Monsieur <hi>Cental,</hi> we had met the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> together, and do

               </gap>feated, considering what defence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made alone. I
presently then went and gave the rest of the Captains an account of what I had seen,
advising them withal, by no means as yet to discover themselves; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made
a halt, and stood still. I also began to lose sight of the <hi>Italians,</hi> who march'd directly to
<hi>Fossan:</hi> it was a very great oversight in them to separate themselves as so great a distance
from one another; <hi>la Garde</hi> then return'd, and told me, that Monsieur <hi>Cental</hi> was
coming hard by, bringing a Trooper along with him, whom I made to stay above, keeping
always his eye on the <hi>Italians,</hi> whilst I, with <hi>la Garde,</hi> went down to number their
men, who let fly some Harquebuze shot at me: but I notwithstanding went so near, that
I made shift to count them, to betwixt four and five hundred men at the most, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

return'd to the top of the Hill, where I saw their Cavalry returning towards them,
having left the <hi>Italians,</hi> who were already a great way off, and clean out of sight. I then
sent the Soldier to my Companions to bid them presently march, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> began
to beat their Drums to return. The Troops of Horse they had were those of the Count
<hi>de Saint Martin d' Est,</hi> Kinsman to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> who himself was not there,
but his Lieutenant only, and of <hi>Rozalles a Spaniard.</hi> Their Companies of Foot were those
of Don <hi>Iuan de Guibara, Aguillere,</hi> and <hi>Mendoza,</hi> with one half of that of <hi>Louys de Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadou,</hi>
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with the other half having put himself into the Castle of <hi>Reconis.</hi> Here Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

                  </gap>ns</hi> came up to me, they two only, and saw as well as I, that
the said <hi>Spauiards</hi> pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le, and in the mean time their Cavalry came up to them.</p>
            <p>Now they had already discover'd us, although they had hitherto seen no more than five,
and I for my part was particularly known, when I went down to discover, by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
of <hi>Mendoza,</hi> who had been taken at the defeat of the <hi>Italians,</hi> and deliver'd three
days after; whereupon they plac'd all their Cavalry before, and only twenty or five and
twenty Harquebusiers at the head of them, a great Company at the head of their Pikes,
and the remainder in the Rear; in which order with Drums beating they began to march.
I took my Harbuebusiers which I divided into three Squadrons, the first whereof I gave
to Captain <hi>Lienard,</hi> the second to <hi>le Pallu</hi> Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de Carces,</hi> who had
his two Companies at <hi>Savillan,</hi> and I my self led the third in the Rear of them, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slets
following after; where, at the first coming up, I had <hi>la Garde</hi> killed by my side.
The Enemy still held on their march, without making any shew of breaking, firing
upon us all the way with very great fury, and we also upon them, so that I was constrain'd
to call Captain <hi>Lienard</hi> to come and join with me, forasmuch as a Squadron of Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers
was drawn off from their Front,<note place="margin">Encounter betwixt the Imperialists and the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> to reinforce their Rear. I likewise call'd up
<hi>le Pallu,</hi> and after this manner they march'd on till they came within sight of the Castle of
St. <hi>Fré,</hi> which was three miles, or more, continually plying us with their Harquebuze
shot. I had once almost put them to rout, at the passing over a great ditch, near to a
house where was a base Court, where we pursued them so close, that we came to the
Sword, whereupon twenty of five and twenty of them leap'd into the base Court, and
there some of curs falling in pell-mell amongst them, they were all cut to pieces, whilst
in the interim of that execution, the rest got over the ditch: Our Cavalry had thought to
have charg'd them, but did not, being kept off by the Harquebuze shot, by which many of
their horses were slain, and as for Captain <hi>Gabarret</hi> and <hi>Baron,</hi> they committed an error,
who, seeing us in the ditch, all shuffled pell-mell together, forsook their horses, and took
their Pikes, yet could they not come up in time, which if they had, and that the Corslets
could have march'd at the rate the Harquebusiers did, they had there been infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated:
but it was not possible, being hindred by the weight of their Arms, so that the
Enemy march'd on, still ridding ground, till being come near to a little Bridge of Brick,
I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> left our Harquebusiers still fighting, and gallop'd to our Cavalry, that was in three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Monsieur <hi>de Cental</hi> leading his own, which still keeping at distance out of the reach of

cannot come up to the fight, would you have us fight alone?</hi> To which I made answer,
swearing for rage, that I had no need of Corslets, wishing they were all at <hi>Savillan,</hi>
since they could not come up to fight; he then said to me, go speak to the foremost Troop,
and in the mean time I will advance; I then spurr'd to them, where I began to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> his Gentlemen, that it was not above nine or ten days since
we had fought with the <hi>Italians,</hi> and beaten them, and now that we should fight with the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to obtain greater honor, must they escape from us? Who thereupon with one voice
all cryed out, It does not stick at us, It does not stick at us. I then ask'd them if they would
promise me to charge so soon as I should have made the Harquebusiers betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their Swords, to run in upon them, which they did assure me they would upon
pain of their lives. There was at that time amongst them a Nephew of mine call'd <hi>Serillac</hi>
(who after was Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de Cyplerre</hi> at <hi>Parma,</hi> and there taken prisoner
with him, and since slain at <hi>Montepullsianne,</hi> and, in truth, amongst these thirty
Launces there were the best men that Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had in all his Troop) to whom I
said; Serillac, <hi>thou art my Nephew, but if thou dbst not charge in the first man amongst them,
I benceforth disclaim thee, and thou shalt no more be any Kinsman of mine;</hi> who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
return'd me answer, <hi>You shall presently see, Uncle, whether I will or no.</hi> Which said
he clap'd down his Beaver, as also did all the rest, to charge. I then cryed out to them to
stay a little, till I first got up to my men, and thereupon ran to my Harquebusiers, where
being come, I told them, that it was now no longer time to shoot, but that we must fall on
to the Sword. Captains, my Camrades, whenever you shall happen to be at such a feast as
this, press your followers, speak first to one, and then to another, bestir your selves, and
doubt not but by this means you will render them valiant throughout, if they but half so
before. They all on a suddain clap'd hands to their Swords, when so soon as Captain
<hi>Mons,</hi> who was a little before, and Monsieur <hi>de Cental,</hi> who was on one side, saw the first
Troop shut down their Beavers, and saw me run to the Harquebusiers, and in an instant
their Swords in their hands, they knew very well that I had met with Lads of mettle,
and began to draw near. I for my part lighted from my horse, taking a Halbert in my
hand (which was my usual weapon in fight) and all of us ran headlong to throw our
selves in amongst the Enemy. <hi>Serillac</hi> was as good as his word, for he charg'd in the first,
as they all confess'd, where his horse was kill'd at the head of the Enemies Harquebusiers,
and our own Horse, with seven Harquebuze shot. <hi>Tilladet, Lavit, Ydrou, Montselier, les Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
and <hi>les Masses,</hi> all <hi>Gascon</hi> Gentlemen of the same Troop, and companions of the said
<hi>Serillac,</hi> charg'd the Horse thorough and thorough, whom they overturn'd upon the head of
their own Foot. Monsieur <hi>de Cental</hi> also charg'd in the Flank, quite thorough both Horse
and Foot,<note place="margin">The Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> Captain <hi>Mons</hi> charg'd likewise on the other side, so that they were all overth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own,
and routed both Horse and Foot. And there we began to lay about us, above fourscore or
an hundred men being left dead upon the place. <hi>Rozalles,</hi> Captain to one of the two
Troops of Light horse, with four others got away, as also did Don <hi>Iuan de Guibara</hi>
upon a Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k with his Page only, who happened to be on horseback, being shot thorough
the hand, of which he ever after remain'd lame, and I do believe is yet living.</p>
            <p>This is the true relation of this fight, as it pass'd, there being several at this day alive, who
were present at it, and I desire no other testimony to prove whether I have fail'd in one
tittle of the truth. Monsieur <hi>de Cental</hi> carried away prisoner with him the Lieutenant of
the Count St. <hi>Martin,</hi> he having been taken by some of his people, together with some
others both of Horse and Foot, and with us went Captain <hi>Aguillere,</hi> and <hi>Mendoza</hi> the
Lieutenant of <hi>Rozalles,</hi> he that carried the Cornette, and he that carried that of the Count
Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> (though they had not their Colours with them) and all the rest both of
Horse and Foot to <hi>Savillan.</hi> In ten days were all these three Actions performed, to wit, the
rout of the <hi>Italians,</hi> the death of Count <hi>Pedro d' Apporte</hi> at <hi>Barges,</hi> and this defeat of the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> I must needs therefore say, for what concerns my self, that if ever God accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
the fortune of a man,<note place="margin">The good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Mr. <hi>de Monluc.</hi>
               </note> he went along with mine; and do stedfastly believe, that had
he not put to his Almighty Arm, we had been overcome. But he sent us <hi>Cental,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

combat had never been heard of then that had been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if they were brave and hardy, we
were nothing indebted to them. Ours was a marvellous spritely little <unclear>Body</unclear>, and (that I
may leave nothing imperfect) I would not that any one should imagine, that the Corslets
came not up to the fight for want of courage, nothing hindering them from advancing so fast
as need requir'd, but the weight of their Arms: for we had scarce made an end, when
they arriv'd upon the place of Battel, cursing their arms, that had hindred them from having
part of the feast.</p>

(having Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> and <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Iulien</hi> with him) to draw all his Forces in the several
Garrisons together, to make a slying Army. To this end he sent me order, with my own
Company, the two Companies of Monsieur <hi>de Carces,</hi> and that of Count <hi>Landriano</hi> an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
to meet him at <hi>Pignerol.</hi> He also sent to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> that he should only
keep two Companies with him at <hi>Savillan,</hi> namely those of <hi>Gabarret,</hi> and <hi>Baron;</hi> where
also the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arters were so good, that the forenamed Gentlemen were very glad, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Termes</hi> invited them to stay with him. I will write a word or two to serve for a
caution to my fellow Captains, and to shew them, that they ought to consider all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that may happen to them, and to provide remedies against every accident that may befall.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had a mind to perform an exploit at <hi>Castillholle</hi> in the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
of <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zzo,</hi> upon three Ensigns of the Enemies, that had put themselves into three
Palaces, one close by another, having Bastion'd the Streets in such manner, that they
could go from one Palace to another, within their own lines, and his design was to kill
two Birds with one stone; that is, to accompany me as far as <hi>Castillholle,</hi> and with two
field pieces he intended to carry along with him to force the Palaces, and that from thence
I should go on to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and he (taking the two Companies of <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Nicholas</hi> to
guard the Artillery) would return to <hi>Savillan.</hi> Now all the Enemies Forces were quater'd
at <hi>Pinguons, Vimus,</hi> and <hi>Vigon,</hi> and in two or three adjacent places; so that I had no great
stomach to this enterprize, forasmuch as the Enemies strength lying so near to the said <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillholle,</hi>
they might in seven or eight hours time have intelligence of any thing should
there be attempted, and consequently in as much more be upon us: But Monsieur <hi>de
Term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> who had set his heart upon this design, would hear no argument of mine to the
contrary, especially being that not four months before Monsieur <hi>de Aussun</hi> and St. <hi>Iulian</hi>
had at the same place defeated two Companies, and taken their Captains, where I was
present with them, they having borrowed me of Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> and my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
also: but I represented to him, that these were the same Captains, that having paid their
ransoms, were newly come out of prison, and who having seen the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rror whereby they
had lost themselves before, had doubtless now provided against such surprizes. For after
a man has once been trapp'd in a place, he must have a damnable thick skull, if, when he
shall be again expos'd to the same danger, he look not better about him than before, and
become wise at his own cost. And I have heard great Captains say, that it is convenient to be
beaten sometimes, because a man becomes more circumspect by his disasters: but I am very
glad that I never was, and had rather learn to be wise at another man expence than my own.</p>
            <p>All my remonstrances could do no good, so that in the beginning of the night we began
to march, and an hour before day arrived at the place. Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> then planted
his Canon within an hundred paces of one of the Palaces, which <hi>le Baron</hi> and <hi>Nicolas</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
undertook to guard, and Captain <hi>Pallu,</hi> the Count <hi>de Landriano</hi> and my self were to
fight. I won one of the Palaces, not that which was batter'd by the Artillery, but by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

thorough which nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

made me set fire to a little house adjoyning to the said Palace. They then retir'd into
one of the others, the fight having continued until two of the clock in the afternoon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other laying to a helping hand, save our four Companies only. I there lost fifteen
or sixteen of my men, Monsieur <hi>de Carces</hi> as many of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Count <hi>de Landriano</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

Artillery had batter'd, and to retreat to the third; where, being we were to unwall two
Gates, som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should return with all speed to <hi>Savillan,</hi> and I, with my four Companies to take my
way directly to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which (to my great grief) was concluded; for I would either
have made an end, or, with the remainder of my men, have perish'd in the attempt. And it
is a vice that has ever been observ'd in me, that I have always been too obstinate in fight: but
let them all say what they will, I have ever done better than worse. But Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi>
consented to give over, fearing he might lose some Captain, for which he might afterwards
receive a rebuke, the King's Lieutenant having no knowledge of the enterprize; and I
march'd on straight to <hi>Barges.</hi> When I came to <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what kind of way it was to <hi>Cabours</hi> (for I had never been in that Country before) who
brought me word that it was all plain. I then made a halt, and fell to discourse with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Lienard,</hi> that we had set out from <hi>Savillan</hi> the night before, that in seven or eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> might have intelligence of our motion, and that two days before it had
been known all over <hi>Savillan,</hi> that I was to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </hi> of which <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi>
might have notice, and it was not above six or seven miles to <hi>Vigon,</hi> where the greatest part
of their Cavalry lay, wherefore we could not possibily pass over this plain without running
a manifest danger, which (especially in the night, where there is no shame) we might
without any dishonor avoid. Captain <hi>Lienard</hi> confess'd that all this might be, but that
nevertheless I had no other way to go, unless I would go three or four miles about, and
pass the streight near to the source, where he thought we should however meet with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Upon this my Guides overhearing our discourse, told me that there was water up to the
middle of the thigh, and there was not a man amongst them, but was of a contrary opinion
to mine: but I, contrary to the opinion of all, turn'd on the left hand, and took the way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards the Mountain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>une, but knee deep, so that
we recover'd the side of the Mountain leading straight to <hi>Barges,</hi> whither we did not
however expect to come till break of day; which we did without sleeping from the day we
set out: For the evening we slept not, at night we began to march, all day long w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fought
at the Palaces, and the night after we march'd to <hi>Barges,</hi> which was eight and forty hours.
I have done the like without sleeping five or six times in my life, and six and thir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and travel with patience.</p>
            <p>Now you must know, that my suspition was not vain, for <hi>Caesar de N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

horseback, drawing out of <hi>Vinus</hi> and <hi>Vigon</hi> five hundred Horse, with which he came, and
laid an Ambuscado in the middle of the plain, about a Cross-bow shot on the one side of
my way, where he lay all night; so that when I came to <hi>Barges,</hi> a little after Sun-rise,
as I was just laid down to sleep, I heard the Arrillery of <hi>Cabours,</hi> which shot at them as
they went off; for they were of nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

place totally empty. The same also did those of <hi>Vinus, Pingues,</hi> and the other places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing

men in order to quit <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> and began to march, retiring towards a River there to
retreat to <hi>Quiers.</hi> Where had it not been that our Cavalry fetch'd a great compass to get
clear of the ditches, we had certainly fault, and perhaps defeated them, as (to say the

               </gap>. I'm sure it stuck not at
our Companies; nor at Monsieur <hi>de Tais:</hi> But Monsieur <hi>le</hi> President <hi>Birague,</hi> if he will
speak the truth, knows very well where the fought lay, for he was then in the Army with
Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> and both heard and saw all they said and did, and knows very well
that I with two hundred Harquebusiers pursued them upon their retreat, fiting all the
way for above a mile and a half together, and ready to tear my flesh to see how faintly
they advanc'd, which shew'd they had no great stomach to fight.</p>
            <p>'Tis an ill thing when a Generall is in fear of being beaten, and whoever goes timerously

on all sides, why we did not fight, and not only there, but also throughout all <hi>Piedmont,</hi>

upon some other Subject; only this I must say, that the world had after, no great opinion
of him; he was ill obey'd, and worse respected: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de Boitieres</hi> was upon the design of breaking the Bridge at <hi>Carignan,</hi> he made very great
difficulty to consent unto, until the said Bridge should first be broken down: but Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Termes,</hi> being come with his own Company, and the two Companies of the Baron
<hi>de Nicolas,</hi> it was concluded amongst them, that Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> might be spar'd to go
with Signior <hi>Londiné,</hi> with seven Ensigns, being that still there would remain five or six;
the three Companies of Monsieur <hi>de Dros,</hi> which he had again recruited, and seven or eight
others of <hi>Italians.</hi> I do not well remember whether Monsieur <hi>de Strozzi</hi> was himself yet
arriv'd or no, for the last nam'd were his men: but it may suffice, that we made up, what
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> eighteen Ensigns besides the <hi>Swisse.</hi> It was therefore concluded in the
Council, that before they should take in hand the breaking of the Bridge, they should
first see how the enterprize of the said Signior <hi>Ludovico</hi> should succeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which should it
miscarry, and that they were defeated, all <hi>Piedmont</hi> would be in very great danger. But
in a few days after news was brought to Monsieur <hi>Boitieres,</hi> that they had taken St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and St. <hi>Iago,</hi> with four or five other little enclos'd Towns. Neither must I forget
that Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> stiffly insisted to have had me along with him, insomuch that there
arose some dispute about it: But Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> protested he would not undertake
to break the Bridge unless I was there: Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> the
President <hi>Birague,</hi> and Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin</hi> stood very high on Monsieur <hi>Boitieres</hi>
his side, so that I was constrained to stay, very much against my will, I having a very gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Corslets, to be equal to the Enemy; not doubting, but, before the Game was done, to
make it appear, that our Nation were as good, as either <hi>German</hi> or <hi>Spaniard:</hi> but withal
that <hi>Boguede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all the rest of the men after, at the distance of three hundred paces, to assist me in case the
Enemy should sally out of <hi>Carignan,</hi> to relieve their own people. Which accordingly was
left to my discretion.</p>
            <p>There was a house on the left hand the Bridge, which it was order'd the <hi>Italians</hi> (who
might be between twelve and fourteen Ensigns) should possess themselves of, to favour me,

supported the Bridge above, which dividing from one another the Pillars would totter and
break of themselves; they had moreover certain fire works deliver'd to them, which they
were made to believe, being applyed to the Pillars, would in a short time burn them down
to the water. Every one then going to execute the orders they had received; I with my two
hundred men, chosen out of all the Companies, went full drive directly towards the Bridge,
where I could not however so soon arrive, but that the Canon had already made one shot
at the little house, had broken into it, and kill'd a <hi>German,</hi> whom at my coming I found
there not quite dead. And although it was night, yet the Moon shone out so clear that
we might easily see from the one end to the other, saving that by in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ervals there fell a mist,
which continued sometimes half an hour, and sometimes less, during which we could not
see a yards distance from us.</p>
            <p>Now either frighted at the report of the Canon, or at the noise I made at the house (it
being not above an hundred paces distant from the Bridge) the Enemy took their heels, and
fled away towards <hi>Carignan,</hi> after whom I sent some Harquebuze shot: but follow'd no
further than the end of the Bridge. At the same time also Monsieur <hi>de Salcede,</hi> with his
Boors and his Boats, arriv'd underneath, who at his first coming presently fastned his artificial
fires to the Pillars: but it was only so much time thrown away, and he must of force make
the fellows fall to't with their Axes, who having ty'd their Boats fast to the said Pillars,
began to lay on at that end where the <hi>Swisse</hi> were, cutting on straight towards me, who
kept the other end of the Bridge towards the Enemy.</p>
            <p>This fury of the Clowns lasted for four long hours, continually laying on upon the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
insomuch that though they were rank'd four and four together, and of a very great
thickness, yet before we had any disturbance, they were all cut to the very place where I
was. Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi> ever caused one Company to rest themselves upon the Bank of
the River, where he had caus'd a little fire to be made, and from hour to hour made them
to relieve one another; during which employment, the Enemy sent out thirty or forty Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebusiers
to discover what we were doing, just at a time when the Fog fell, whom I
could neither see nor hear for the noise of the axes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till they were got within four Pikes
length of me, and let fly amongst us, which having done they immediately retir'd: yet could
they not see us by reason of the mist. Messieurs <hi>de Termes</hi> then and <hi>de Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins</hi> with three
or four horse came up to us to know the meaning of those Harquebuze shots; and sent
back to Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> to tell him that it was nothing, and that for them we nothing
desisted from the work, themselves alone still remaining with me. They had not staid an
hour but that the mist again began to fall, and the Enemy as soon return'd upon us, that
is to say, six hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> chosen men, and six hundred <hi>German</hi> Pikes, <hi>Pedro de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi>
(as I have since understood) having order'd the business thus. That two hundred
Harquebusiers again chosen out of the six hundred should charge full drive directly upon
us, the other four hundred to march at an hundred paces distance, in the Rear of them,
and the six hundred <hi>Germans</hi> two hundred paces after all. Now I had plac'd the Captains
who led the Ensigns after me, against a great ditch bank some two hundred paces behind
me, and sometimes Captain <hi>Favas</hi> my Lieutenant, and sometimes <hi>Bogutdemar</hi> came to
me to see what we did, and again return'd back to their place. On that side of the Bridge
towards the <hi>Swisse</hi> we p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to cut the beams above, and found that as the Bridge divided it fell down for fifteen or

the mean time Monsieur <hi>de S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lcede</hi> still made the Pillars to be cut over again, yet not quite
thorough; but only a little more then before, which was the reason that he had divided
his workmen into three parts, wherof one was in the Boats, the other upon the Bridge
cutting the Traverse beams, and ten or twelve by the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be assisting to men, he this night wrought a real miracle; for in the first place, the two
hundred Harquebusiers came up to me, finding me in such a posture, that scarce one Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
had his match cock'd, for they went by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ire to warm their hands, having two Centinels out a hundred paces from me,
upon the way towards the City and not doubting but the <hi>Italians</hi> on their side would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
have the same, for they were a little nearer than I; but it was a little on one side. How
they order'd their business I cannot tell, for I had no more than my two Centinels, who
came running in to me, and as they came in with the Alarm, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> also arriv'd
crying out <hi>Spain, Spain,</hi> all the two hundred Harquebusiers firing upon us together.
Whereupon <hi>Messieur, de Termes</hi> and <hi>de Moneins</hi> being on horseback, and alone, ran unto
Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> who had already seen the beginning of the disorder; and note that
almost all the the two hundred men I had at the end of the Bridge ran away straight to
the Ensig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time
the <hi>Italians</hi> who were on our left hand did the same, neither once looking behind them
till they came to the head of the Cavalry, where Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> himself stood. Our
word was St. <hi>Pierre,</hi> but that did me no good; seeing which, I began to cry out <hi>Montluc,
Montluc,</hi> you cursed cowardly whelps will you forsake me thus? By good fortune I had
with me thirty or forty young Gentlemen, who had never a hair on their faces, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest
and the bravest youth that ever was seen in one little Company, who thought I
had run away with the rest: but hearing my voice, returned immediately towards me;
with whom, without staying for any more, I charg'd straight to the place, from whence
the shot came whizzing by our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ars: but to see one another was impossible for the mist that
fell, together with the thick smoak that was mixt with it, and in running up to them my
men discharg'd all together, crying our <hi>France,</hi> as they cry'd out <hi>Spain;</hi> and I dare affirm
that we fir'd at less than three Pikes distance,<note place="margin">Disorder in the night.</note> by which charge their two hundred Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busiers
were overturn'd upon the four hundred, and all of them upon the six hundred <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
so that all in a rout, and confusion, they fled full speed towards the City, for they
could not discover what we were. I pursu'd them about two hundred paces: but my
pursuit was interrupted, by the great noise in our Camp (I never heard the like) you would
have sworn they had been all stark string mad, calling and bawling upon one another:
yet these great bawlers are none of the greatest fighters. There are a sort of men who
bustle up and down, call, command, and keep a great clutter, and in the mean
time for one step advance, retire two paces backward: but this hideous noise
was the reason, that I could never discover the enemies disorder; neither could
they discover ours, by reason of the great outcry they made, at their entrance into
the City, which was no other than a Postern near to the Castle, into which three or four
men only could march a-breast. Thus then I return'd to the end of the Bridge, where I
found Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi> all alone, with ten or a dozen of the Country fellows whose
turn it was to rest; for the others that were in the Boats, cut the Ropes, and fled away
with the current of the River straight to <hi>Montcallier,</hi> those on the top that were cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bridge, cast themselves into the water, which was there no more than wast deep, they being
not yet come to the depth of the River. The <hi>Swisse,</hi> likewise, who heard this dismal noise, fell
to running towards <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> having an opinion that both we and all our Camp were
in a rout, and taking the two Cannons along with them made all the hast they possibly
could to recover <hi>Carmagnolle.</hi> I sent one of my Soldiers after the run-aways, to enquire
news of my Lieutenant Captain <hi>Favas,</hi> whom he met (having rallyed thirty or forty of
his men) returing towards the Bridge, to see what was become of me, believing me to be
slain; who presently dispatch'd away to <hi>Boguedemar, la Pallu</hi> and some other Captains,
who had made a halt, rallying some part of their men, whom he caused in all hast to march
directly towards the Bridge, telling them, that I had beaten back the Enemy, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
came at a good rate, to seek me. Captain <hi>Favas</hi> was the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st that came, all torn and
tatter'd like a skare-crow; forasmuch as the Soldiers in a crowd all run over his belly as
he thought to have rallyed who found Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi> and me at the end of the
Bridge consulting what we were best to do. So soon as he came he gave us an account of
his fortune, and that of the rest of his companions, when seeing him so accoutred, we

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:105656:42"/>The other Captains being come up to us, we concluded to make an end of breaking

and to set out Centinels almost as far as the Gates of the City. I believ'd that the <hi>Italians</hi>
notwithstanding the hurly-bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly in our Camp, were yet at their post, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Captain <hi>Favas</hi> himself to go and see if they were there or no; who at his return
found, that I had caused fifteen or twenty Soldiers to take up the axes the Peasants had
left upon the Bridge, who, together with the ten or twelve Country fellows, were cutting
the cross beams above; where he told us, that he had been at the house, but that he had found
no body there. This news put us a little to a stand, what we were best to do: but nevertheless
we stopt not to execute our former resolution; and so soon as the tumult was a little over,
came Messieurs <hi>de Termes</hi> and <hi>de Moneins,</hi> who brought me a Command from Mr. <hi>de Boitie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
immediately to retire. The said Sieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> alighted from his horse, for Monsieur
<hi>de Termes</hi> could not for his Gout, and came to me on foot, where he found that since the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
we had at two cuttings made above thirty paces of the Bridge to fall, and were falling
upon the third, each of them being fifteen, or twenty paces long; who thereupon return'd
to Monsieur <hi>de Boiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res</hi> to acquaint him how all things had pass'd, Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi>
having lost almost all his Peasants: but that our Soldiers had taken their axes, with which
they did wonders in cutting, and that all the Captains and Soldiers, Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi> and
I were resolved to die rather than depart from thence, till first the Bridge was totally bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down. Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> thereupon sent him back to protest against me for any
loss, that might happen contrary to his command, which the said Sieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> did,
telling us moreover, that the said Sieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> was already upon his march to return,
though he halted within a mile of us; which I conceive he did to the end, that by that
means he might draw me off; for he wanted no courage, but he was always in fear
to lose. Whoever is of that humor, may perhaps make a shift to save himself, but shall
never atchieve any great conquests. Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had made a stop at the end of the
Bridge, so soon as he had heard Monsieur <hi>de Boitiere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to be upon his march, and return'd
no more back with Monsieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> to carry my answer; but presently sent orders
to his Company not to stir from the place where he had left them, and so we cut on all the
remainder of the night,<note place="margin">The Bridge broken down.</note> 'till within an hour of day, that we march'd towards the little
house upon the Hill. Monsieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> return'd again to us, just at the instant
when the last blow was given, and Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> ran to his Company, to cause them
to advance a little towards us, that they might favour our retreat, and Monsieur <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neins</hi>
ran towards Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> whom he found expecting his return; so that
having deprived the Enemy of a great convenience, we retir'd without any manner of
impediment at all. I was willing to commit this to writing, not to magnifie my self for
any great valour in this Action; but to manifest to all the world, how God has ever been
pleased to conduct my fortune. I was neither so great a Fop, nor so fool hardy, but that
could I have seen the Enemy, I should have retir'd, and perhaps have run away as fast
as the rest, and it had been madness, and not valour to have staid. Neither is there any
shame attends a rational fear, when there is great occasion; and I should never have been
so senseless, as with thirty or forty Foot only to have stood the fight.</p>
            <p>Captains by this may take exemple, never to run away, or (to put it into a better phrase) to
make a hasty retreat, without first discovering who there is to pursue them, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
having seen them, to attempt all ways of opposition till they shall see there is no good
to be done. For after all the means that God has given to men have been employed, and
to no purpose; then flight is neither shameful nor unworthy: but believe me (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen)
if you do not employ it all, every one will be ready to say (nay, even those who
have run away with you) if he had done this, or if he had done that, the mischief had been
prevented, and things had fallen out better than they did; and such a one vapours most
and speaks highest, who perhaps was himself the first that ran away. Thus shall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a man of honor (let him be as brave as he will) be brought into dispute with all
the world. When there is no more to be done, a man ought not to be obstinate, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
to give way to fortune, which does not always smile. A man is no less worthy of blame for
wilfully losing himself, when he may retire, and sees himself at the last extremity, than he
who shamefully runs away at the first encounter: Yet the one is more dirty than the other;
and this difference there is betwixt them, that the one will make you reputed rash and hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd,
and the other a Poltron and a Coward. Both extreams are to be avoided. You are
never to enter into these ridiculous and senseless resolutions, but when you see your selves
fallen into the hands of a barbarous and merciless Enemy; and there indeed you are to fight
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105656:42"/>
it to the last gasp, and sell your skin as dear as you can. One desperate man is worth ten
others. But to fly, as they did here, without seeing who pursues you, is infamous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the courage of a man. It's true that the <hi>French</hi> man is accus'd for one thing, that
is, that he runs and fights for company: and so do others as well as they. There are ill work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of all Trades. Now after the place was surrendred, I will tell you how I cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
know the Enemies disorder. It was by the people of <hi>Carignan</hi> themselves, and from Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<hi>Pedro de Colonna</hi>'s own mouth, who related it to <hi>Snsanne,</hi> in the presence of Captain
<hi>Renovard,</hi> who conducted him to the King by the command of Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his capitulation after the Battel of <hi>Serizolles,</hi> which you shall have an account of in its proper place.</p>
            <p>The breaking of this Bridge was not undertaken but upon very mature consideration,
and the Enemy soon after began to be very much distress'd, being no relief was to be had
from <hi>Quiers,</hi> as before they had every night duly received. So soon as Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi>
and Signior <hi>Ludovlco de Birago</hi> had heard the success of this enterprize of the Bridge, they
sent word to Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres,</hi> that if he would come into those parts where they were,
they believ'd they might carry <hi>Ivreé.</hi> Whereupon both Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> and his Council were of opinion, that he ought to go, leaving Garrisons at <hi>Pingues, Vinus, Vigon</hi>
and other places, nearest to <hi>Carignan.</hi> And as I remember Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> with twelve
or fourteen <hi>Italian</hi> Ensigns, and three or four of ours, his own and some other Troops of
Horse (which I have forgot) remain'd behind to command in chief. The Enemy had no
Horse at all at <hi>Carignan,</hi> which was the reason they were kept to short on every side.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> then departed, with Messieurs <hi>de Termes, de</hi> St. <hi>Iulien,</hi> President
<hi>Birague,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Mauré,</hi> and went to joyn Forces at St. <hi>Iago</hi> and St. <hi>Germaine,</hi>
and afterwards sate down before <hi>Ivreé,</hi> where we did just nothing, because it was not
possible to break the Causey that damm'd up the water; which thing could it have been
done, we had infallibly taken the place, forasmuch as there was no other defence but the
River on that side: but we were constrain'd to let it alone, and to go to besiege St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
which also we took upon composition, after it had stood out two or three hundred
Canon shot; and some other places thereabouts. And as we were returning towards <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,</hi>
in the interim of the Siege of <hi>Ivreé,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> had notice given him, that
Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> was coming to command in his stead.</p>
            <p>The King, in truth, was highly dissatisfied with him; both for that he had suffer'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignan</hi>
at so much leisure to be fortified, and also upon other particular accounts. A man
must walk very upright to satisfie all the world. The said Sieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> was however
very angry at it; and 'twas said thereupon withdrew from before <hi>Ivreé</hi> in despite, which
otherwise in the end 'twas thought he might have taken: but I am not of that opinion. So
it was that Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> arrived, bringing with him for supplies seven Companies of
<hi>Swiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Monsieur <hi>de Dros</hi> with seven or eight Ensigns, what of <hi>Provençals</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> came
up also, and Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> retir'd to his own house in <hi>Dauphiné.</hi> There is much
to do in this world, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if they be two adventurous, and come by the worst, they are look'd upon as fools and mad
men; if tedious and slow, they are despised, nay reputed Cowards; the wife therefore
are to observe a mean betwixt both. Our Masters in the mean time will not be paid with
these discourses, they expect to have their business done, but we must ever be prating, and
censuring others, when were we in the same condition we should find we had enough to

weeks for my dispatch,<note place="margin">1544.</note> having already acquitted my self of my Commission, which was
in sum only to demand some succours of the King, and to obtain leave to fight a Battel.
And about the end of the said Month came Letters also to the King from Monsieur <hi>d'

the seven Colonels to choose each a thousand out of their respective Regiments,
ordering them to leave their Lieutenants to get their Regiments ready, and so sent them
into <hi>Italy</hi> to joyn with the Marquis <hi>de Guast.</hi> Wherefore the said Monsieur <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:105656:43"/>So soon as I came into the Chamber, the King said to me, Montluc, <hi>I would have you

The said Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Pol</hi> then began to lay open the enterprize of the Emperor, and the
King of <hi>England,</hi> who within six or seven weeks were determin'd to enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the one on the one side and the other on the other; so that should Monsieur <hi>d'

as all the Kings hopes (for what concerned his Foot) resided in the Regiments he had in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> for that in <hi>France</hi> there were no other but what were now Legionary Soldiers,
and that therefore it was much better, and more safe to preserve the Kingdom than <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
concerning which they were to be on the defensive part, and by no means to

                  </gap>;</hi> but moreover give the
Enemy footing on that side of the Kingdom. The Admiral said the same, and all the
rest, every one arguing according to his own fancy. I twitter'd to speak, and offering
to interrupt Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur <hi>de Galliot</hi> as he was delivering his opinion, Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Pol</hi>
made a sign to me with his hand, saying <hi>not too fast, not too fast,</hi> which made me hold
my peace, and I saw the King laugh. Monsieur <hi>le Dauphin</hi> said nothing, I believe it is
not the custom, though the King would have him present, that he might learn; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Princes there are evermore very eloquent debates, but not always the soundest determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
for they never speak but by halves, and always sooth their Masters humor, for
which reason I should make a very scurvy Courtier; for I must ever speak as I think. The
King then said these words to me, Montluc, <hi>have you heard the Reasons for which I cannot
give Monsieur</hi> d' Anguien <hi>leave to fight?</hi> to which I made answer, <hi>that I had both heard
and weigh'd them very well; but that if his Majesty would please to give me leave to deliver
my opinion, I would very gladly do it: not that nevertheless for that his Majesty should any

would permit me so to do, and that I might freely say whatsoever I would. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I began after this manner. I remember it as well as it had been but three days ago;
God has given me a very great memory in these kind of things, for which I render him
hearty thanks; for it is a great contentment to me now that I have nothing else to do, to
recollect my former fortunes, and to call to mind the former passages of my life, to set
them truly down without any manner of addition; for be they good or bad you shall
have them as they are.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I <hi>Think my self exceedingly happy, as well that you are pleased I shall deliver my poor
opinion upon a subject that has already been debated in your Majesties Council,</hi>

stood behind the Kings Chair, and just over against me, gave me a nod with his head, by
which I guess'd he would have me to speak boldly, and that gave me the greater assurance,

                  </gap>rse, all which are ambitions to manifest the zeal they have to your
Service. I know what they are, and what they will do very well.</hi> The King then began
to be a little angry to hear that the Companies of the <hi>Gens-d' Armes</hi> were not all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat:
but I told him that it was impossible; forasmuch as some of them had obtained
leave of their Captains to go home to their own houses to refresh themselves, and others
were sick: but that if his Majesty would please to give leave to those Gentlemen who
would beg it of of him, to be present at the Battel, they would very well supply that
default. <hi>Since then, Sir,</hi> said I, (continuing my discourse) <hi>that I am so happy as to speak
before a Soldier King, who would you have to kill ten thousand Foot, and a thousand or twelve
hundred Horse, all resolute to overcome or dye? Such men as these, and so resolv'd, are not
so easily defeated; neither are they Novices in War. We have have sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ral times attaqu'd
the Enemy upon equal terms, and for the most part beaten them. And I dare boldly say
that had we all of us one arm ty'd behind us, it would not be in the power of the Enemy to kill
us all in a whole days time, without losing the greatest part of their Army, and the choicest
of their men. Imagine then when we have both our arms at liberty, and our weapons in our
hands, how easie it will be to beat us. Truly, Sir, I have heard great Captains discourse,
and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y that an Army of twelve or fifteen thousand men is sufficient to confront an Army
of thirty thousand; for 'tis not the crowd but the courage that overcomes, and in a Battel
the one half of them never comes to fight. We desire no more than we have, let us deal it
out.</hi> (The <hi>Dauphin</hi> all this while stood laughing behind the King's Chair, and still
made signs to me, for by my behaviour I seem'd already to be in Battel.) <hi>No, no, Sir, these are not men to be beaten, and if these Lords who have spoken, had once seen them
at their work, they would alter their opinion, and so would your Majesty too. These are
not men to lye dozing in a Garrison, they require an Enemy, and have a mind to shew their
valour; they beg leave of you to fight, and if you deny them, you take away their spirits,
and give it to your Enemies, who will be puffed with vanity to see thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lves fear'd, whilst
your own Army shall moulder away to nothing. By what I have heard, Sir, all that
these Lords stumble at, who have deliver'd their opinions before you, is the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of losing the Battel, and that makes them always cry, if we lose, if we lose; but
I have not heard one of them tell you, if we win it, what great advant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

For Gods sake, Sir, fear not to grant our request, and let me not return with such a shame
upon me, that men shall say you durst not trust the hazard of a Battel in our hands, who
so voluntarily and chearfully make a tender of our lives to do you service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King who had very attentively hearkened to me, and that was delighted at my
gestures and impatience, turn'd his eyes towards Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Pol,</hi> who thereupon said to him, <hi>Sir, will you alter your determination at the importunity of this Coxcomb, that
cares for nothing but fighting, and has no sence of the misfortune; nor the inconveniences that the loss of a Battel would bring upon you? Believe me, Sir, 'tis a thing of too great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance

told me, that it was very necessary I should speak to all the Captains and Soldiers, and tell
them that the confidence his Majesty repos'd in our worth and valour had made him conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend

tell them that the great confidence I have in their fidelity and valour has made me condescend

<hi>d' Anguien,</hi> and presented him my Letters from the King, who was infinitely
overjoy'd, and embracing me in his arms, said these very words: <hi>I knew very well that thou

said he, <hi>the King is pleased to gratifie our desire, we must go to't.</hi> I then gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the difficulty I had met witht in obtaining that leave, and that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was the only cause of it, which ought the more to encourage us to behave our selves
bravely in the Battel. He was moreover very glad when I told him, that the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lords were coming after me, being certain that several others would also follow
after them, as they did. Bidding me by all means go discharge my self of his Majesties
commands to all the Colonels, Captains of the <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> Light horse and Foot; which
I did, not observing one that did not mightily rejoyce, when I gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what assurance I had given the King of the victory. Neither did I satisfie my
self with speaking to the Officers only; but moreover went amongst the Soldiers,
assuring them that we should all be highly recompenc'd by the King, making the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
something better than it was; for a man must now and then lye a little for his Master.</p>
            <p>During the time of my absence Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> had block'd up <hi>Carignan,</hi> being
he could not carry it by fine force without infinite loss,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carignan</hi> blocked up.</note> quartering in the mean time at
<hi>Vimeus</hi> and <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> and soon after the arrival of these Gentlemen, the Marquis <hi>de

Mountain near <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> and upon <hi>Easter</hi> day remov'd his Camp to <hi>Cerizolles.</hi> The
Company of the Count <hi>de Tande,</hi> was this day upon the Guard, to which Captain <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi>
was Lieutenant, who sent word to Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> that the Camp was upon
their march, and that their drums were plainly heard. Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
commanded me presently to mount to horse, and to go in all hast to discover them,
and to bring him certain intelligence of their motion,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> sent to discover the Enemy.</note> which I also did, Captain <hi>Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

giving me twenty Launciers for my Guard. I went so far that I discover'd the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
who march'd thorough the Woods belonging to the Abby of <hi>Desteffarde,</hi> and heard
the Drums, some marching before and some following after, which put me to a stand
to guess what the meaning of this order might be. At my return I found Monsieur <hi>d'
Anguien,</hi> Messieurs <hi>de Chatillon, de Dampierre, de</hi> St. <hi>André, Descars,</hi> (the Father of
these now living) <hi>d' Assier</hi> and <hi>de Iarnac,</hi> in the Chamber of the said Seigneur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi>
talking with him, having caused their Arms to be brought and laid upon the Beds in the
said Chamber, where I made a report to him of what I had seen, whereupon all the
Gentlemen cryed out to him, <hi>Let us go, Sir, let us go to fight to day, for it is a good day, and
God will assist us.</hi> Upon which the said Seigneur commanded me to go bid Messieurs
<hi>de Tais</hi> and <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Iulien</hi> to draw out their Regiments into the field, at the same time
sending another Gentleman to the <hi>Gens-d' Armes</hi> and the Light horse to do the same,
which was perform'd in an instant, and we drew out of <hi>Carm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lles,</hi> where we were all drawn up into Battalia. Monsieur <hi>de Mailly</hi>
Master of the Ordinance was there ready with his Artillery, as soon as any of us all, and
we heard the Enemies Drums almost as plainly as we heard our own. In my life did I
never see so chearful an Army, nor Soldiers so well disposed to fight, as this of ours was,
excepting some of the great ones of the Army, who were evermore persecuting Monsieur <hi>d'
Anguien,</hi> not to put it to the hazard of a day, representing to him what a blow it would
be to the King should he lose the Battel, which might perhaps occasion the loss of the
Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and others were still perswading him that he ought to fight, the
King having granted leave, and expecting he should now so do; so that amongst them
they put this poor Prince, being yet very young, into so great a perplexity, that he scarce
knew which way to turn him,<note place="margin">Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> in suspence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Battel.</note> nor what to do. You may imagine whether I was not
mightily pleased with these doings, and whether I would not have spoke at mouth,
had I had to do with my match; neither as it was could I altogether forbear. The
Lords who were lately come from Court, were all for fighting, and I could very
well name both the one and the other, if I so pleased; but I shall forbear to do it;
for I have not taken my Pen in hand to blemish any one: but the Admiral <hi>Chatillon</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>de Iarnac,</hi> who are both living, know it as well as I. Both the one
and the other had reason for what they said, and were not prompted by any fear of their
own persons; but only the apprehension of losing all witheld them; and some perhaps
(as I have often seen) argue against their own inclinations, and the plurality of voices, to
the end that if any thing fall amiss,<note place="margin">Dissimulatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> amongst Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> they may afterwards say, <hi>I was of a contrary opinion,
I told him as much, but I was not to be believed.</hi> Oh there is great cunning in dawbing,
and in our trade especially of all others.</p>
            <p>Just as we should have march'd to go to fight, four or five drew Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi>
aside, alighting from their horses, where they entertained him walking up and
down for above half an hour, whilst every one gnash'd their teeth for rage that they did
not march: in the end the result of all was, that all the Regiments of Foot should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their Quarters, and also the Artillery and the <hi>Gens-d' Armes,</hi> and that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Anguien</hi> with four or five hundred Horse, and some of the Captains of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
should go to the plain of <hi>Cerizolles</hi> to discover the Enemies Camp; that I should
bring after him four hundred Harquebusiers, and all the rest to retire to their Quarters.
I then saw a world of people ready to run mad for veaxtion, and do verily believe that
if God had so pleas'd that Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> had march'd according to his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
he had won the Battel with very little difficulty; for the Drums that I had heard
return into the Enemies Rear, were all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, who went back to draw off
two pieces of Canon, which were set fast in such manner that they could not be stirr'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
backward or forward; so that we had had nothing to fight with but the <hi>Germans,</hi>
the <hi>Italians</hi> and the Horse, none of which, nor even the Marquis himself, could have escap'd
us. But after we had stood above three hours facing the Enemy, which were in a plain
betwixt <hi>Sommerive</hi> and <hi>Cerizolles,</hi> who expected no other but to fight; (and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
told Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> since (being a prisoner) as he has assured mee,<note place="margin">The Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> in fear.</note> that he was
never in his life in so great fear of being lost as that day, for his chiefest hopes was in the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Harquebusiers) Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> return'd back to <hi>Carmagnolle</hi> as disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as ever Prince was, and at the descent of a Wood, as we were upon our return to the

being by,<note place="margin">A saying of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> to Mr. <hi>d' Angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</hi>
               </note> these words; <hi>Sir, Sir, this morning what you arose what could you have desir'd
of God Almighty more than what he has this day given you; which is to find the Enemy you

you? but I perceeve you are more enclined to believe those who counsel you not to fight than
those who advise you to it.</hi> At which he fell to swear and curse, saying, that hereafter
he would belive no one but himself, by which I well perceiv'd him to be nettled, so
that still going on to appease him, I said, <hi>No Sir, no, in Gods name believe no body but
your self; for we all know very well that you desire nothing more then to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what I had so largely promised to the King in his Council.</p>
            <p>So soon as the said Seigneur came to <hi>Carmagno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and I at my arrival found our whole Regiment both Officers and Soldiers up to the ears
in mutiny, demanding their pay: but they held them in hand with the coming of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Langey,</hi> who brought some money along with him. I was then entreated by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de la Molle</hi> the elder, who commanded two Ensigns, and the next day was slain,
to speak to Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> in the behalf of all, and that he would bear the blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as we were all waiting in the Hall, by fortune Messieurs <hi>de Dampierre</hi> and <hi>de</hi> St.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105656:46"/>
               <hi>André</hi> came in, and finding all in mutiny said to us these words; <hi>Have a little patience
I beseech you, till Monsieur</hi> d' Anguien <hi>rise from the Council</hi> (and I do believe they had
been talking to him by the way, for I found him riding betwixt them) and so they
entred into the Chamber, where they staid not long, but came out again. Monsieur
<hi>de Dampierre</hi> came out first, who, because Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> immediately followed
him, looking at me, he laid his finger upon his mouth, for a sign that I should say
nothing, and Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> all in rage went straight to his Chamber, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Colonels and Captains every one to his own quarters; but we stirr'd not from thence.
Presently after Messieurs <hi>de Dampierre</hi> and <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>André</hi> came out into the Hall, and said
to us these words:<note place="margin">Resolution to fight.</note> 
               <hi>Get you home to your Quarters, and prepare your selves, for to morrow
we must fight;</hi> as they came out we take notice of those who were for fighting, all of them
smiling upon us, by which also we guess'd before hand how the matter went. In the
evening when I accompanied Monsieur <hi>de Dampierre</hi> to his lodging, he told me the
whole story, and what Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> had propounded to the Council, insisting
upon the Error he saw he had committed in not fighting, by which he had lost an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that he could not again recover, entreating them all to consider of it, and to resolve
upon a Battel. Whereupon some fell again to discourse the same thing they had said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
of what a loss it would be to the King, with many other reasons to divert him from
that resolution; and others maintain'd the same opinion they had over done, that he
ought to put it to a Battel: But Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> who saw himself fallen into the same
dispute that before, broke out in a violent passion, saying, <hi>that he was resolved to fight at what
price soever, and that if any one should any more dispute the contrary, he should never think so
well of that man again, so long as he liv'd.</hi> Whereupon one in the Company, who before
had so highly argued against it, made answer: <hi>O Sir, is it then a resolution you have taken
that you will fight? yes</hi> replyed Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> then says the other <hi>there is no
more to be said;</hi> and thereupon it was concluded, that every one should repair to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and that an hour before day, we should be all in the same Plain where we had
been the day before, to march directly towards the Enemy, wherever he was to be found;
which was accordingly perform'd, some remonstrating in the mean time to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Soldiers, that it would be out of season to sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d upon telling them out their
pay in the face of the Enemy, and that they were to stay till the Battel was over,
which was only a device to amuze those who were so importunate for their Pay.</p>
            <p>Now being we had the day before left the Enemy in the Plain betwixt <hi>Sommeriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and
<hi>Cerizolles,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> did not very well know whether they might be at
<hi>Sommerive</hi> or at <hi>Cerizolles,</hi> notwithstanding that the Governor of <hi>Sommerive</hi> had sent
him word, that the Camp intended to quarter there. Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin</hi>
therefore sent out three or four of his Light horse towards the said <hi>Cerizolles,</hi> who went
so near that they discover'd their Camp, which was already in arms, and the Drums
beginning to bear. That which had made them return to <hi>Cerizoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, who were gone for the two pieces of Canon, as has been said before.
Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> likewise sent out again three or four of his people also, and in the
mean time we march'd underneath toward <hi>Sommerive;</hi> but so soon as the Light horse
return'd with the same intelligence, we turn'd on the left hand, and come up into the
Plain, where the whole Army was, and there made a halt. And there Monsieur <hi>d'
Anguien</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> gave me all the Harquebusiers to lead, for which honor
I returned him my most humble thanks,<note place="margin">The Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I my self stood for a reserve. Being at the foresaid little house, I discover'd three or four
Companies of <hi>Spanish</hi> Harquebusiers, who came full drive to possess themselves of the
house, and in the mean time <hi>Favas</hi> and <hi>Lienard</hi> fought the <hi>Italians</hi> in the valley on
the right hand. The skirmish grew hot on both sides, the Enemy one while beating
me up to the house, and I again other whiles driving them back to their own party;
for they had another that was come up to second the first, and it seem'd as if we had
been playing at Base: but in the end I was constrain'd to call Captain <hi>Brueille</hi> up to
me, for I saw all their Foot embody t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ank them.
Now had I not so much as one horse with me, notwithstanding that I had advertised
Monsieur'd <hi>Anguien</hi> that their Cavalry was also with the Harquebusiers that came up
to me. Let it suffice, that of a long time no body came, insomuch that I was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to quit the house; but not without a great dispute, which continued for a very
great space. I then sent back Captain <hi>Brueille</hi> to his place, the skirmish continued for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
four fours without intermission, and never did men acquit themselves better.
Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> then sent Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> unto me, commanding me to repos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
my self of the house,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Montlucs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test about the fight.</note> which was neither of advantage nor disadvantage to me; to
whom I made answer, <hi>Go and tell Monsieur</hi> d' Anguien <hi>that he must then send me some
Horse, to fight these Horse that slank their Harquebusiers</hi> (which he also saw as well as
I) <hi>for I am not to fight Horse and Foot together in the open field.</hi> He then said to me,
<hi>It is enough for me that I have told you,</hi> and so return'd to carry back my answer to
Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien;</hi> who thereupon sent Monsieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> to tell me, that one
way or another he would that I should regain it, with whom also came the Seigneur <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bry,</hi>
Brother to Seigneur <hi>Mauré,</hi> bringing with him threescore Horse, all Launciers,
and Monsieur <hi>de Moneins</hi> might have about some five and twenty, he being then but
beginning to raise his Troop. To whom I return'd the same answer I had given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> and that I would not be cause of the loss of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel:
but that if they would go charge those Horse that slank'd the Harquebusiers, I
would quickly regain the house. They then answer'd, that I had reason, and that
they were ready to do it. Whereupon I presently sent to Captain <hi>Brueil</hi> to come
up to me, and to Captain <hi>Gasquet</hi> to advance to his place, and immediately Captain
<hi>Brueil</hi> coming up on the right hand, and the Horse in the middle, we march'd at a
good round <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rot directly up to them; for we were not above three hundred paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from one another. All this while the skirmish never ceased, and as we drew
within a hundred or six score paces off them, we began to fire, upon which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
fac'd about, and their Foot also, and I saw their Launciers turn their backs,
retreating to their Troops. Monsieur <hi>de Moneins,</hi> and Seigneur <hi>Cabry</hi> went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
hereupon to Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> to tell him what they had seen
their Cavalry do, and that if he did not send me up Horse to second me, I
could not choose but be routed. I sent back Captain <hi>Brueil</hi> and <hi>Gasquet</hi> into their
places.</p>
            <p>Now there was a little Marish near unto <hi>Cerizolles,</hi> and a great hollow way, which
hindred the Enemy that they could not come up to us drawn up in Battalia: and the
Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> had caused six pieces of Artillery to pass over this marish, and they
were already advanc'd a good way on this side, when seeing their people driven
back, they were afraid that the whole Army followed the pursuit, and that they
should lose their Canon. Wherefore they presently made the <hi>Germans</hi> to passover this
marish, and thorough the said hollow way, who, so soon as they came into the plain, drew
up again into Battalia; for it was not possible for them to pass, but in great disorder, and
in the mean time the Cavalry and <hi>Spanish</hi> Harquebusiers came up to me as before; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that having no Horse with me, I was necessitated to quit them the place, and to
retire to the place from whence I came.</p>
            <p>Now I had discover'd their <hi>German</hi> Foot and their Artillery, and as I was retiring
Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> and Signior <hi>Francisco <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105656:47"/>
the right hand of our Battaillon, and upon the skirt of the Hill (which was very
straight) and over against the Battaillon of the <hi>Italians;</hi> for their Launciers were exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to our Pikes. Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> with his Company, and that of the
Count <hi>de Tande</hi> advanc'd on the left hand of our Battail, and the <hi>Swisse</hi> were three or
four score paces behind us, and a little on the one side: In the mean time our Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
that were conducted by <hi>Lienard</hi> and Captain <hi>Favas</hi> sometimes beat back the Enemy
as far as their main Battalia, and sometimes the Enemy repell'd them up to ours. I
saw then that I must of necessity disarm our Battaillon of the Harquebusiers that made
our slank on that side where Monsieur <hi>de Boitieres</hi> stood, and give them to them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to make a Charge, which they did, and with great fury beat them up to their
Battail; and it was high time; for their Harquebusiers had almost gain'd the flank of our
Horse.<note place="margin">A furious skirmish.</note> I therefore ran up to them, and we began a furious skirmish, which was great,
and obstinately fought, for all our Squadrons were closed up together, and it continued
a long hour or more.</p>
            <p>Now the Enemey had placed their Canon by the side of the little house, which play'd
directly into our Battaillon; Monsieur <hi>de Mailly</hi> then advanc'd with ours and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
himself close by us, began to shoot at those of the Enemy by the little house; for
there where we maintain'd the skirmish he could not do it, without killing our own
men: when, looking towards our own Battail, I saw Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> who began to
march with his Pikes, charg'd directly towards the <hi>Italians;</hi> whereupon I ran up to him,
saying, <hi>Whither do you go, Sir, whither do you go, you will lose the Battel; for here are
all the</hi> Germans <hi>coming to fight you, and will charge into your flank.</hi> The Captains were
the occasion of this, who ceased not to cry out to him, <hi>Sir, lead us on to fight; for it is
better for us to dye hand to hand, than stand still here to be killed with the Canon.</hi> 'Tis that
which terrifies the most of any thing,<note place="margin">The Canon frights more than it hurts.</note> and oftentimes begets more fear than it does harm;
but however so it was, that he was pleased to be rul'd by me, and I entreated him to make
his men kneel on one knee, with their Pikes down; for I saw the <hi>Swisse</hi> behind laid at
their full length squatt to to the ground, so as hardly to be seen; and from him I ran to
the Harquebusiers. The Enemies Harquebusiers by this time were beginning to retire behind
the house, when, as I was going up to charge straight up to them, I discover'd the Front of
the <hi>Germans</hi> Battaillon, and suddainly commanded the Captains <hi>Brueile</hi> and <hi>Gasquet</hi> to
retire by degrees towards the Artillery, for we were to make room for the Pikes to come up
to the fight, and I went to our Battel, where being come, I said to my men these words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh my fellow Soldiers let us now fight bravely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Th Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s Speech to his Soldiers.</note> and if we win the Battel we get a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
renown, than any of our Nation ever did; It was never yet read in History, that
ever the <hi>Gauls</hi> fought the <hi>Germans</hi> Pike to Pike, but that the <hi>Germans</hi> defeated them,
and to set this honorable mark upon our selves, that we are better men than our Ancestors,
this glory ought to inspire us with a double courage to fight so as to overcome, or dye, and
make our Enemies know what kind of men we are.<note place="margin">A pardonable mistake in a Soldier not well read in History.</note> Remember, Camerades, the message the

               </gap>ur selves before him after the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Now, Sir, <hi>said I to Monsieur</hi> de Tais, it is time to rise, <hi>which he suddenly did,
and I began to cry out aloud,</hi> Gentlemen, it may be there are not many here who have
ever been in a Battel before, and therefore let me tell you, that if we take our Pikes by the
hinder end, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight at the length of the Pike, we shall be defeated; for the <hi>Germans</hi> are
more dextrous at this kind of fight than we are: but you must take your Pikes by the middle
as the <hi>Swis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall see how confounded they will be. <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Tais <hi>then cryed out to me to go along
the Battail, and make them all handle their Pikes after this manner, which I accordingly
did, and now we were all ready for the Encounter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> march'd at a great rate directly towards us, and I ran to put my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Battail, where I alighted from my horse; for I ever had a Lacquey at the head
of the Battaillon ready with my Pike; and as Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> and the rest of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
saw me on foot, they all cry'd out at once, <hi>Get up, Captain</hi> Montl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>c, <hi>get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and you shall lead us on to the fight.</hi> To whom I made answer, <hi>that if it was my
fate to dye that day, I could not dye in a more honorable place than in their Company, with
my Pike in my hand.</hi> I then call'd to Captain <hi>la Burre,</hi> who was Serjeant Major, that
he should always be stirring about the Battaillon, when we came to grapple, and
that he and the Serjeants behind and on the sides should never cease crying, put
home, Soldiers, put home, to the end that they might push on one another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> came up to us at a very round rate, insomuch that their Battail being
very great, they could not possibly follow; so that we saw great windows in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and several Ensigns a good way behind, and all on a suddain rush'd in among
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105656:47"/>
them, a good many of us at least, for as well on their side, as ours, all the first

               </gap>
is it possible amongst Foot to see a greater fury; the second Rank and the third
were the cause of our victory; for the last so pushed them on, that they fell in upon
the heels of one another, and as ours press'd in, the Enemy was still driven back: I
was never in my life so active and light as that day, and it stood me upon so to be;
for above three times I was beaten down to my knees. The <hi>Swisse</hi> were very sly and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
for till they saw us within ten or a dozen Pikes length of one another, they never
rose; but then like savage Boars they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ush'd into their slank, and Monsieur <hi>de Boitie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>

time charg'd <hi>Rodolpho Baglione,</hi> whom they overthrew, and put his Cavalry to rout.
The <hi>Italians,</hi> who saw their Cavalry broken, and the <hi>Lansquenets</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
and routed, began to take the descent of the valley, and as fast as they could to
make directly towards the Wood. Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> had his horse killed under
him at the first encounter,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Termes</hi> taken prisoner.</note> and by ill fortune his leg was so far engaged under him
in the fall, that it was not possible for him to rise, so that he was there by the <hi>Italians</hi>
taken, and carried away Prisoner, and, to say the truth, his legs were none of
the best.</p>
            <p>Now you are to take notice, that the Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> had composed a Battaillon
of five thousand Pikes, namely two thousand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and three thousand <hi>Germans,</hi>
out of the number of six thousand, being the same tha Count <hi>Laudron</hi> had brought
into <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had remain'd ten years, or more, and who all spoke as good <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
as natural <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He had formed this Battaillon only to claw away the <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;</hi>
for he said that he feared our Battaillon mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e than any of the other, and had an
opinion that his <hi>Germans</hi> (being all chosen men) would beat our <hi>Swisse.</hi> He had
placed three hundred Harquebusiers only in the nature of a forlorn hope, at the head
of this Battaillon,<note place="margin">A mistake of the Marquis <hi>de Guast.</hi>
               </note> which he reserved to the forenamed effect, and all the rest maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the skirmish. Now as he was by the little house on the same side with the <hi>Germans,</hi>
he saw the <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> who were all arm'd in white, and took them for the <hi>Gascons,</hi>
and thereupon said to his men, <hi>Hermanos, hermanos, a qui estant todos Gascones, sarrais á
ellos.</hi> They were not gone two hundred paces from him, but that he perceived our
Battail, which start up, and saw his error when it was too late to help it, for we all wore
black arms.</p>
            <p>This Battaillon of five thousand Pikes march'd then at a good round rate directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> and they were of necessity to pass hard by Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi>
who by some body or other was very ill advised; for as they pass'd by he charg'd
with his <hi>Gens d' Armes</hi> quite thorough their Battaillon in the Flank,<note place="margin">The errot of Monsieur <hi>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anguien.</hi>
               </note> and there were
slain and wounded a great many brave and worthy men, and some of very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quality, as Monsieur <hi>d' Assier, le</hi> Sieur <hi>de la R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more at the second charge; there were some who pass'd and repass'd quite thorough and
thorough; but still they clos'd up again, and in that manner came up to the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia,
who were soon overthrown without so much as standing one Push of Pike, and there
died all their Captains and Lieutenants who were in the first rank and the rest fled straight
to Messieur <hi>des Cros:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Assier</hi> and Mr. <hi>de la Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chovart slain,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>des Cros.</hi>
               </note> but this Battaillon of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> still at a very great
rate pursued their victory, and overthrew the said Sieur <hi>des Cros,</hi> who there dyed and
all his Captains with him; neither could Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> any way relieve him,
forasmuch as all the horses almost of his Cavalry, in these two furious, but inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
charges were wounded and walk'd fair and softly over the field towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
He was then in the height of despair, and curst the hour that ever he was born,
seeing the overthrow of his Foot, and that he himself had scarce an hundred Horse left
to sustein the shock,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.</hi>
               </note> insomuch that Monsieur <hi>de Pignan of Montpellier</hi> (a Gentleman
of his) assured me, that he twice turn'd the point of his Sword into his Gorget, to have
offered violence to himself, and himself told me at his return, that he was then in such a
condition, he should have been glad any one would have run him thorough. The
<hi>Romans</hi> might have done so; but I do not think it becomes a Christian. Every one at
that time passed his censure upon it according to his own fancy. For our parts we were
as well as heart could wish, and as much pleased as the Enemy was afflicted; but let us
return to the blows,<note place="margin">The Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of the <hi>Fribourgers.</hi>
               </note> for there were yet both to give and to take. The cowardise of the
<hi>Fribourgers</hi> occasioned a great loss on that side of the field; in my life I never saw such
great lubbers as those were, unworthy ever to bear Arms, if they have not learnt more
courage since. They are indeed neighbours to the <hi>Swisse,</hi> but there is no more comparison
betwixt them than betwixt a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse and an Asse. It is not all to have a great
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105656:48"/>
number of men upon the list; but to have those that are true bred; for a hundred of
them are worth a thousand of the other. And a brave and valiant Captain with a
thousand men, that he knows he may trust to, will pass over the bellies of four
thousand.</p>

Wood that leads towards <hi>Carmagnoll,</hi> but very poorly accompanied, and cried out to him,
<hi>Sir, Sir, face about, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>and</hi> Germans <hi>out to pieces.</hi> Now this Battaillon of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> had
already made a halt, giving themselves for lost, when they saw neither Horse nor Foot
of their own come up to them; by which they very well knew that they had lost the
Battel, and began to take on the right hand straight towards the mountain from whence
they had departed the day before. I thought I had been the cunningst snap in all the
whole Army, having contriv'd to place a row of Harquebusiers betwixt the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
rank, to kill all the Captains fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Harquebusiers, and then he called to him <hi>Burre</hi> the Serjeant Major, bidding him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
make choice of the Harquebusiers, and to place them after that manner. Upon
my faith I had never seen nor heard of the like before, and thought my self to be the first
Inventor of it; but we found that they were as crafty as we, for they had also done
the same thing, who never shot no more than ours, till they came within a Pikes
length, and there was a very great slaughter, not a shot being fir'd but it wrought
its effect.</p>
            <p>So soon as Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> understood the Battel to be won, which before (by
the defeat of those on his side of the field, and those cowardly <hi>Fribourgers,</hi> to encourage

in the Rear of those <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which as he was doing, several of those
who had taken fright, and were shifting for themselves, rallyed up to him, some of
which now appeared wonderful eager of the pursuit, who had run away but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and others had broke their bridles on purpose to lay the fault of their own fear

were slam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:105656:48"/>We had no sooner received the command from Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> but that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the Battaillon of the <hi>Swisse</hi> and ours turn'd towards him: I never saw two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taillons so soon reunited as these were; for of our selves we rallyed, and drew up into
Battalia as we went, marching all the way, side by side. In this posture the Enemy,
who went off at a great rate, firing all the way, and by that means keeping the horse
at distance, discovered us coming up to them, who so soon as they saw us advanc'd
within five or six paces, and the Cavalry in their Front ready to charge in amongst
them, they threw down their Pikes, surrendring themselves to the horse: but here
the Game began, some killing and others endeavoring to save, there being some
who had fifteen or twenty men about him,<note place="margin">Another body of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> still getting as far as they could from the
crowd, for fear of us Foot, who had a mind to have cut all their throats; neither
could the Cavalry so well defend them, but that above half of them were slain; for
as many as we could lay our hands on were dispatch'd. Now you shall know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of me.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Valence,</hi> my Brother, had sent me a <hi>Turkish</hi> horse from <hi>Venice,</hi> one
of the fleerest Coursers that ever I yet saw; and I had an opinion which all the world
could not dispossess me of, that we should win the Battel, wherefore I gave my said horse
to a servant I had, an old Soldier, in whom I reposed a very great confidence; bidding
him be sure always to keep behind our Battaillon of Pikes, and telling him that if it
pleased God I did escape from the skirmish, I would then alight, and engage with
the Pikes, and that when we came to close, if he should see our Battaillon overthrown,
that then he might conclude me to be slain, and should save himself upon the horse;
and on the contrary, if he should see us prevail over the Enemies Battaillon, that then
he should still follow, (without offering to break in) in the Rear of our Battaillon.
when so soon as I should be certain of the victory, I would leave the execution, and
come to take my horse to pursue the Cavalry, and try to take some prisoner of Condition.</p>
            <p>I had a whimsy came into my head that I should take the Marquis <hi>de Guast,</hi> or dye
in the attempt,<note place="margin">A conceit of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc,</hi>
               </note> trusting to the swiftness of my horse; for which I had already in my
imagination swallow'd a mighty ransom, or at least some remarkable recompence
form the King. Having then a while follow'd the victory, I staid behind, thinking
to find my man; and indeed I was so weary with fighting, running, and moreover so
spent with straining my voice to encourage the Soldiers, that I was able to do no more,
when I was assaulted by two great mastiff <hi>Germans,</hi> who had thought presently to have
done my business; but having rid my self of one of them, the other betook him to his
heels, but he went not very far; in truth I there saw very brave blows given. I then
went to seek out that Son of a whore my man; but the Devil a man that I could find,
for as the Enemies Artillery plaid upon our Battaillon, and very often shot over,
the shot falling behind it, had remov'd my Gentleman from the place where I
thought to find him; who very discreetly went, and put himself behind the <hi>Swisse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
when seeing the disorder of the <hi>Fribourgers</hi> and <hi>Provençals,</hi> he very learnedly concluded
us to be in the same condition, and thereupon fled back as far as <hi>Carmagnolle.</hi> Thus
are men oftentimes deceived in their choice; for I should never have suspected that this
fellow would so soon have had his heart in his breeches, and have run away with so
little ado. I then found Captain <hi>Mons,</hi> having no more than one servant only with
him, who had done a great deal better than mine; for he had kept a little pad Nag rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for him, upon which he took me up behind him, for I was extremely weary, and
so we pass'd on, still seeing the <hi>Germans</hi> knock'd down all the way as we went, till being
sent for by Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> we both alighted and went on foot, till the entire defeat
of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> when presently I saw my man come back, calling him
a hundred Rogues and Cowards, for so basely running away; who replyed <hi>that he had not
done it alone, but in company with better men and better clad than himself, and that he had
only run away to bear them company;</hi> by which pleasant answer my anger was appeased,
and upon my word he hit upon it in a lucky hour; for I was very near showing him a
trick of a <hi>Gascon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We then rallyed together some twenty or five and twenty Horse, what of those of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Termes,</hi> of Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Mauré,</hi> and rid a round
gallop after the Marquis <hi>de Guast,</hi> and with us moreover a Gentleman whose name
I have forgot, but he was one of those who came post from Court to be at the Battel,
and as we went we met by the way two light horse leading prisoner Signior <hi>Carlo de
Gonzaga,</hi> whom they had taken in the rear of the Enemies party, which still
more encourag'd us to spur forward. So soon as we came so near to the Enemy as to
discover what posture they were in, we perceived that they were rallyed and closed up
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105656:49"/>
to the Crupper, still marching on in very good order, at a good round trot, and
their Launces ready in the Rest. Which made me say to those of our Company,
these people are ready for us, and therefore I do not think it convenient to charge
in amongst them, lest instead of taking some of the chief of them, it fare with us as with
the <hi>Scotch</hi> man who took a <hi>Tartar.</hi> So that we return'd without attempting any thing
more upon them; but I am yet of opinion, that had not that rascally man of mine
play'd me that dog-trick I had taken some man or other of Command amongst them.<note place="margin">The Enemy rallios upon their retreat.</note>
As we were upon our return, the Gentleman I spoke of before accosting me, said these
words, Jesu! Captain <hi>Montluc,</hi> what danger was this Battel in once to day of being
lost? To which I (who had neither seen nor heard of any disorder, and thought that the
last we had defeated had been those of <hi>Carignan,</hi> who were drawn out of their Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be present at the Battel) made answer, why, which way were we in any danger,
seeing that all day we have had the victory in our hands? I perceive then, said he, that
you know nothing of the disorder has happened, and thereupon told me all that had
befallen in the Battel. As God shall help me, I do believe, that had he given me two
stabs with a dagger, I should not have bled, for my heart was shrunk up, and I was
sick at the news, in which fright I continued for three nights after, starting up in my sleep,
and dreaming continually of a defeat.</p>
            <p>Thus then we arriv'd at the Camp, where Monsieur <hi>d' Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and making my horse curver, said to him sportingly these words; <hi>What think you, Sir,
am I not as pretty a fellow on horseback as I am on foot?</hi> to which he made answer (though
yet very melancholy) <hi>you will always behave your self very well, both in the one posture
and in the other,</hi> and bowing his body was pleased to embrace me in his arms, and
knighted me upon the place;<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> Knighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place of Battail by Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien.</hi>
               </note> an honor I shall be proud of so long as I live, both for
being perform'd upon the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld of Battel, and by the hand of so generous and so great a
Prince. Accursed be he that so basely deprived us of him. But no more of that; I then said
to him, <hi>Sir, have I served you to day to your satisfaction?</hi> (for Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had
already told him, that I had fought with them on foot) to which he replyed, <hi>Yes, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Montluc, <hi>and so well that I will never forget how bravely you have behaved your self;
neither, do I assure you, will I conceal it from the King. Why then, Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>it lies in
your power to do me the greatest kindness that ever you can do a poor Gentleman so long as you
live:</hi> At which words, drawing me a part, that no body might hear, he asked me what
it was that I would have him do for me, to which I made answer, that it was to dispatch
me suddenly away with news of the success of the Battel to the King; telling him
withal, that it was an office more properly belonging to me than any other, considering
what I had said to his Majesty and his Council, to obtain leave to fight; and that the last
words I had said to the King were, that he was only to expect news of the victory. To
which, turning towards me, he made answer, that it was all the reason in the world,
and that I should be sent before any other. And so all the Army returned victorious to
<hi>Carmagnolle:</hi> but as I expected to have been sent away post in the night, I was told that
Monsieur <hi>Descars</hi> had gained every one to speak for him, that he might go. Monsieur <hi>de
Tais</hi> had also passed his word to me; but in the end he suffered himself to be overcome, as
also did Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> which was the greatest misfortune that possibly could have
befallen me: for having overcome the King's Council and their deliberation, and that
his Majesty had done me the honor to condescend to my opinion; here to have carried
him the certain news of what I had promised and assured him so few days before, I leave
every one to judge whether I should have been welcom or no; and what wrong I had
done me, especially having been that day in a great and honorable command, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
my self of it to my Generals content. It had been a great good fortune for me,
and also a great honor, to have carried to the King what I had before promised,
and assured him of; there was however no remedy, and I was forced to submit, though
they had much ado to appease me: but it was to no purpose to be angry or to complain of
the injury was done me. I have since repented me a thousand times that I did not steal
away the same night, which if I had done, I would have broke my neck or have been
the first that should have brought the news to the King,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented.</note> and, I am confident, he would
not only himself have taken it in good part, but moreover have made my peace with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But I, from that time forward, gave over all thoughts of advancement, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after expected to come to any thing, which made me beg leave of Monsieur <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>
to be dismiss'd, that I might return into my own Country. Which said
Seigneur promised me great matters (knowing me to be discontented) and Monsieur
<hi>de Tais</hi> did the same, using all the perswasions he could to make me stay: but I press'd
my departure so much that at last I obtain'd leave, upon my promise to return; and for

the surrender. Had they known how to make their advantage of this Battel, <hi>Millan</hi>
had been in a tottering condition: but we never knew how to improve our victories to the
best. It is also very true that the King had at this time enough to do to defend his
Kingdom from two such powerful enemies.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having intelligence of the great preparation that was made both by the
one and the other, withdrew the greatest part of his Forces out of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where I
arriv'd at the time when Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had received a command to bring away all
the men he could; for I never could stay long at home, and never hated any thing
so much as my own house, so that although I had once put on a resolution (for the
wrong that had been done me) never to go any more into that Country, yet when
it came too't I could not forbear to go. Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had made choice of two
and twenty Ensigns, the Companies whereof were now very well recruited, to which
he moreover raised a new Company, which, at my request, he was pleased to give to
Captain <hi>Ceste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>geloux,</hi> who had been assisting to me in the raising, and conducting of
my men, and had formerly carryed my Ensign in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> And so we
began to set forwards towards <hi>France,</hi> dividing cur Companies into five and five. Of
these I had the first Division, and went before to <hi>Suzanne,</hi> to prevent the Soldiers
from getting thither before us, and to take order for the provisions, much of which I
found upon the way going thither, which made me redouble my diligence. I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the night two hours before day, at <hi>Villaume,</hi> and at the Inn where I alighted,
found Signior <hi>Pedro de Colonna,</hi> whom Captain <hi>Renovard</hi> carried prisoner to the King,
according to the capitulation at <hi>Carignan.</hi> They were already got up and the said
Captain <hi>Renovard</hi> carried me into the Chamber of the said Signior, who at my coming
told me, that he understood it was I who had broken the Bridge at <hi>Carignan,</hi> and
that had commanded the Harquebusiers at the Battel. After which, falling into discourse
concerning the said Bridge, I told him, that had his people follow'd their fortune,
they had found no body to fight with, but my self and some forty men at most; and
that our whole Camp was in so great disorder, that had he pursued them, we had all
been defeated; and Captain <hi>Renovard</hi> also assured him, that what I said was true.
At which, after a little pause turning towards me he said: <hi>E v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

me that if our people had followed their fortune, they had had to deal with no more of yours
than forty Soldiers only, and had put your whole Camp to flight. And I tell you, that had
you pursued your fortune, you had driven me out of</hi> Carignan, <hi>forasmuch as my people
had taken so terrible a fright, that the strength of the City had not been sufficient to reassure
them:</hi> And thereupon told us the great disorder his people were in, saying, that he
had once thought the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been men without fear, but that he was now satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
they had as much of that passion about them as other men; and that he was then in
so great extremity that he was constrained to throw himself before the Gare, to try to stop
them: but that in so doing he was like to have been born down by the torrent, and that
they entred in such a crowd, that they had like to have lifted the Gate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

And so soon, said he, as they were all entred in this disorder. I step'd to the Gate to clap it
to, and knowing all the Captains call'd them name by name to come to help me; but not a
man would come, inso much that had it not been for a servant of my own, that heard
me call out, and came to my assistance, I could never have shut it. Nay the disorder in
the Town was moreover so great, that above four hundred threw themselves over the
Curtines, who in the morning returning back were ready to dye for shame, and this is
the reason why I have told you, that if you had followed your fortune, you had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Town with forty men. By which account of his I knew the Proverb to
be true, that says,<note n="*" place="margin">If one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my knew what the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army did, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would soon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nhabitants of the
City assured us of this disorder, yet could we not by any means believe it, especially at
the first; or at least that it could be so great; it seem'd so unlikely and so exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strange: but after it had been confess'd by their Governor himself, we were bound
to believe it to be true: and that they were pursued by some Phantome, or possessed
by some evil spirit; for we did them no harm, being as much frighted as they, and
and it may be more: But the night is terrible when a man cannot see by whom he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanlted.
However this make me conclude, that all befel me through good fortune;
for it cannot be called valour, but rather the greatest folly that any man could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
and I do believe, that of all the good fortune God has pleased to bestow upon
me, this was the most remarkable and the most stange: but let us proceed to our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>The thirst of Revenge had prompted the Emperor (contrary to the faith he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to the Pope) to league and confederate himself with the King of <hi>England,</hi> who
was fallen off from his obedience to the holy Chair, out of despite; which two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(as it was said) had divided the Kingdom (for so both the Marquis <hi>de Guast</hi> told
Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and I have since heard the same from an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman at
<hi>Boulogne</hi>) but however it was but disputing the bears skin.<note place="margin">The strength of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>France</hi> well united within it
self can never be conquer'd till after the loss of a dozen Battels; considering the brave
Gentry whereof it is fruitful, and the strong places wherewith it abounds. And I
conceive they are deceiv'd who say, that <hi>Paris</hi> being taken, <hi>France</hi> is lost. It is indeed
the Treasury of the Kingdom, and an unexhausted Magazine, where all the richest of the
whole Nation unlade their Treasure, and I do believe in the whole world there is not
such a City, for 'tis an old saying, that there is not a Crown in <hi>Paris</hi> but yields ten
Sols revenue once a year; but there are so many other Cities, and strong places in the
Kingdom, as are sufficient to destroy thirty Armies. So that it would be easie to rally
together, and to recover that from them again, before they could conquer the rest; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Conqueror would depopulate his own Kingdom, to repeople his new Conquest.
I say this because the design of the King of <hi>England</hi> was to run directly up to <hi>Paris,</hi>
whilst the Emperor should enter into <hi>Champagne.</hi> The Forces of these two Princes being
join'd together consisted of fourscore thousand Foot and twenty thousand Horse, with
a prodigious train of Artillery, by which any man may judge whether our King had
not enough to do, and whether it was not high time to look about him. Without all
doubt these poor Princes have greater care and trouble upon them than the inferior forts
of men; and I am of opinion the King did very well to call back his Forces out of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> though some are pleased to say, that the State of <hi>Millan</hi> might otherwise have
been won, and that the Emperor would have been necessitated to have called back his
Forces out of <hi>France</hi> to defend that <hi>Dutey:</hi> but all this depended upon event. So it
was that God would not suffer these Princes to agree betwixt themselves, each of them
being bent upon his own particular advantage; and I have often heard, and sometimes
seen, that when two Princes jointly undertake the Conquest of a Kingdom, they never
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105656:50"/>
agree; for each of them is always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of being over reach'd by his companion,
and evermore jealous of one another. I have not, I confess, much conversed with
Books; but I have heard say, that after this manner we first lost the Kingdom of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and were cheated by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> This suspition and jealousie at this time
preserved us, as it has at other times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

living (as I am told he is) the Father of this who is a Huguenot, and who treated the

there was not in the higher Town provision to serve four days, for himself told it

               </note> A Son in law of the Mareschal <hi>de Bies</hi>
(not this fine Monsieur <hi>de Vervin,</hi> but another whose name I have forgot) came to
Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> and told him that a Spy of his, who came from <hi>Boulogne,</hi> had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, that as yet nothing had been remov'd to the higher Town; but that all
still remained below, and that if they would speedily attempt to take the lower
Town (which might easily be done) they would in eight days time have the upper
come out to them with ropes about their necks: and that if Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he would in the morning lead him, where he might himself discover all: the Spy
morcover affirming, that as yet not one breach in the wall was repaired; but that all lay
open as if it were a village.</p>
            <p>Upon this information Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> was impatient to go to take a view of all,
and took me along with him, together with this Son in law of the Mareschal. We might
be about a hundred Horse drawn out of the several Troops, and just at the break of day
we arrived before the Town, leaving the Tower of <hi>Ordre</hi> some two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
paces on the right hand, and saw five or six Pavillions upon the descent in the
great high way leading to the Gate of the City. We were no more than five or six Horse
only, Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> having left the rest behind a little Hill. This Son in law of
the Mareschal, and I therefore went down to the first Pavillion, and passed close by
it into the Camp on the left hand, till we came to the second, from whence we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
all their Artillery,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> discover the Town.</note> at no further distance than fourfcore paces only; nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her
did we see any more than three or four <hi>English</hi> Soldiers that were walking up and
down by the Canon, and in the foresaid second Pavillion we heard them jabber <hi>English.</hi>
The Mareschals Son in law then made me return back to Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon my telling him what we had seen, went down with me to the place from
whence I came, and there with the foresaid Gentleman stood still. In the mean time
it grew to be fair broad day, so that the Centinels very well perceived us to be none
of their own people, and thereupon presently gave the alarm: but for all that we saw
not a man offer to sally out of the Tower (I have indeed since been told that <hi>Dondellat,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:105656:51"/>
whom Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Pol</hi> had bred up of a Page, had the Guard at the Tower) and so
we return'd.</p>

and Monsieur <hi>d' Orleans,</hi> where it was concluded, that the next inorning at break
of day a Camisado should be given,<note place="margin">A Camisado concluded on.</note> and that Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> with our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
should give the first onset by three Breaches that were in the wall, on that
side where we had been to discover; which were Breaches that had only been made
for pleasure. The Rheingrave then entreated the <hi>Dauphin</hi> that he and his <hi>Germans</hi>
might go on with us to the Assault: but Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had already promised
Count <hi>Pedemarie,</hi> that he would speak to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to give him leave to go on with
us, which was a very great misfortune: for had the <hi>Germans</hi> gone on with us to the
Breach, the Enemy had never fir'd one shot, which would have invited a great many
more to come in to our relief much sooner than they did.</p>
            <p>We set out in the night with shirts over our Arms, and met the Rheingrave with his
<hi>Germans</hi> ready and resolved to pass over a Bridge of Brick there was near unto <hi>la Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quise,</hi>
which resolution he was not to be perswaded from; but would pass over after us,
what promise soever he had made to the Count. Of which Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
word to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> and whilst they were in dispute about it, came the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Annebaut,</hi> who so far prevailed with the Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ingrave, that at last he was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to retire behind, giving us leave to pass, and the <hi>Italians</hi> after us; but for his
own part he would not stir from the Battail of the <hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> that was drawn up
near to <hi>la Marquise</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Dampierre</hi> also, who was Colonel of the <hi>Grisons,</hi>
came up as far as the Tower of <hi>Ordre,</hi> where he drew up his men into Battalia. Now Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Tais</hi> had given me one part of his men with them to fall on by the high way on
his right hand, being the same he had discover'd the day before. I then charg'd up
straight to the Artillery, and those who remain'd with Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
fell on by the three br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aches, which they bravely carried; and being there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gate not breach on that side where the Artillery was, I was fain to go all along
by the wall on that side towards the River, where I at last found a breach of some ten
or twelve paces wide, which I entred without any manner of opposition, and went on
straight to the Church: where I saw no Captain of ours, save one only, who was running
along by the River directly to the forementioned breaches, and him I call'd to, but he heard
me not.</p>
            <p>Now you must know that Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> was wounded,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> wounded.</note> and enforc'd to retire;
what became of Count <hi>Pedemarie</hi> I know not: but I was afterwards told that all the
Captains, both <hi>Gascons</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> were gone out of the Town, and had made no
stay there, by reason of an Alarm, that the <hi>English</hi> had recovered the breaches by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Town, as it was true: but there were of them not above two hundred men,
that were sallied out on the outside from the higher Town: and I was moreover told
that it was <hi>Dondellet,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led from the Tower of <hi>Ordre</hi> straight to the Town. All
our Ensigns were left in the Town, but I never perceived any thing of all this: for had
I seen the disorder, I do believe, I should have done as the rest did; I will not pretend
to be braver than I am. Before the Church I found two <hi>Italian</hi> Captains only with
their Companies and Colours, where so soon as I arrived, I fell to assanlting three or
four houses, and forced them, wherein were a great number of <hi>English,</hi> and most of
them without arms; some of which were clad in white and red, others in black and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and a great many Soldiers also without those colours; but I soon understood
that all those in Liveries were Pioneers; because they had no Arms, as the other had, who
defended themselves, and so, that above two hundred of them were slain in the houses.
I then march'd straight to the Church, where I found the said <hi>Italian</hi> Captains (the one
call'd <hi>Caesar Porto,</hi> and the other <hi>Hieronimo Megrin,</hi> and with these <hi>Italians</hi> Messieurs
<hi>D' Andelot</hi> and <hi>de Novailles,</hi> who was Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de Nemsurs)</hi> asking them
where all our Captains were; who returned me answer, that they knew not what was
become of them. I then began to perceive there was some disorder in the case, not see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one man of all our Companies; excepting those who were entred with me, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifty or threescore others, who had staid behind to plunder, and were rallyed to
me at the assault of the houses: whilst I was considering with my self what the matter
should be, all on a suddain there came a great number of <hi>English</hi> full drive directly
upon us, as we stood before the Church, and in the street adjoining, crying out, <hi>Who
goes there?</hi> to which I made answer in <hi>English, A friend, a friend,</hi> (for of all the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

upon them, who immediately fac'd about, and pursued them, laying on in their rear,
to the end of the Street, where they turned off on the right hand along by the wall of
the upper Town; from whence they discharged at us some small pieces, and a whole
Cloud of of Arrows. I then retir'd back to the <hi>Italians,</hi> where I was no sooner come
and settled in my former order, but that they return'd to charge me again: but I had taken
a little heart, having found them so easily to run away, and therefore gave them leave
to come up close to us, where I then charg'd them, and we thought they ran away
with greater facility than before; I therefore retir'd once more before the Church: but
then there fell such a furious storm of Rain, that it seem'd as if God Almighty had
been disposed to drown us all; during which shower there came up ten or twelve Ensigns
of ours from one of the breaches, at which they had entred, not having above six Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
with them; and I might have about as many Ensigns with me. One of the
Ensigns then told me that the Breaches were all taken, and that the Captains were fled
away: Which having heard, I desir'd the two <hi>Italian</hi> Captains that they should a while
make good that Canton,<note place="margin">The <hi>English</hi> put to flight,</note> where the Church stood (for there was a wall before the door
of it) and I would go dispute the Breach by which I had entred, which so soon as I
should recover, I would send them word, that they might draw off and come to
me, and if peradventure the Enemy in the mean time, should come up to them,
that then they should remember what they had seen me do, and boldly charge
them.</p>
            <p>I then went to the breach, where I saw already ten or twelve <hi>English</hi> got thither, two
of which stood upon their defence; but of the rest, some leap'd over the Breach, and
others slipt on the right hand along the inside of the wall, and so soon as we were got
out, we saw moreover fifteen or twenty that came running towards us, along on the
outside the wall, and seeing us turn'd on the right hand towards the other breaches,
by which our people before had entred. I then entreated a Gentleman of <hi>Burgundy</hi>
(whose name I have forgot) who was mounted upon a horse he had taken, that he would
go to <hi>Caesar Porto</hi> and <hi>Hieronimo Megrin</hi> to call them away, which he was very willing
to do, provided I would promise to stay for him, which I assured him upon my
life I would do, and that dead or alive he should find me at this Breach. The
Rain still continued more and more violent, when the said Gentleman returning, told
me that he could not possibly get to them; and that they were either retreated
into the Church, or all dead. when behold on a suddain three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>English</hi> came at a good round trot directly upon us all along by the wall,
just as we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were upon the point to enter again to go relieve the <hi>Italians:</hi> but
seeing them come full drive upon us, we were constrained to alter that resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Messieurs <hi>d' Andelot, de Novailles,</hi> this <hi>Burgundian</hi> Gentleman and three or four
others had never stirred from my side, from the time they had first met me before the
Church (and it was well for them, for if they had they had gone to pot with the
rest) and as the <hi>English</hi> came on in this fury, there arose a hubub amongst us, some
crying out to me to fly towards the River,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> in fear.</note> and others towards the Mountain: but
upon the instant I resolv'd ro remonstrate to them, <hi>What have you to do to go to the
Mountain? in our way thither we must of necessity pass close by the higher Town; for
to go directly to the River, do you not see that it is rising, and got so high already that we
shall be all drown'd? let no one therefore think any more of that; but let us make our selves

he was one of the bravest Gentlemen in the Kingdom. We therefore march'd
directly up to them, when so soon as we came within four or five Pikes length of
them, they let fly a great shower of Arrows upon us, and we ran up to them to
push a Pike; for there were but two Harquebuze shot fired, and immediately they
faced about, and fled the same way they came. We follow'd after, and very close,
and when they came to the Canton of the Town towards their own people, who
kept almost all our Ensigns enclosed, they seeing them come, and we pursuing in the
rear of them, quitted the Breaches to relieve their own men, and rallying all together
came running directly upon us, who were all at the foot of the Mountain of the Tower
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105656:52"/>
of <hi>Ordre.</hi> I then cryed to Monsieur <hi>d' Andelot,</hi> and to all the Ensigns and Sold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers,
<hi>Get away as fast as you can and climb the Mountain;</hi> for I, for my own part, with four
or five Pikes, would stay to see the event of all, retiring towards a Rivolet which was
by the Artillery. So soon as the <hi>English</hi> had quitted the breach, to come to us, our
Ensigns leap'd out of the Town towards the valley, by which they had come, and
being got to the foot of the Mountain, where Monsieur <hi>d' Andelot</hi> and the Ensigns were
marching up, the Enemy saw that our Ensigns were again pass'd over the Breaches,
and that the said <hi>Andelot</hi> with the other Ensigns were got half way up the Hill; they
then thought to turn after the others, as they did, but could never overtake above eight
or ten Soldiers at the most, whom they cut all to pieces. Five or six <hi>English</hi> then came
up to me, and I pass'd the Rivolet, where the Water was more than knee deep above
the Banks. They bestow'd some Arrows upon me, and shot them into the Targuet,
and another thorough a sleeve of Mail I wore upon my right arm; which for my part of
the Booty I carried home to my Quarters,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> came the last man out of <hi>Bullen.</hi>
               </note> and having received them, went to mount
the Hill on the backside of the Tower of <hi>Ordre.</hi> Monsieur <hi>le Dauphin,</hi> having with
him Monsieur <hi>d' Orleans</hi> and the Admiral, made his Lansquenets to march to relieve us
within the Town; but before they could come near the disorder was already hapned,
and they found Messieurs <hi>d' Andelot</hi> and <hi>de Novailles</hi> with the Ensigns, who were got up
to the top of the Mountain.</p>
            <p>In the interim of this confusion the Vidame of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and my Brother Monsieur
<hi>de Lieux,</hi> advanc'd as far as the bottom of the Hill, to see if they could learn any news
of me; but they were sent back with a vengeance, and told the <hi>Dauphin</hi> that they did
certainly believe I was slain within the Town: forasmuch as they had seen all the
Captains, me only excepted; and whilst they were in this discourse Monsieur <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot</hi>
arrived, of whom the <hi>Dauphin</hi> demanded if he knew what was become of me, to
whom he made answer, that I had been the preservation of him and all those that were
with him: but that (it seem'd) I had not known how to save my self, which I might
have done, if I had so pleased, as well as the rest. The said Sieur <hi>d' Andelot</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me for dead, believing that I had suffered my self to be snap'd about their Artillery, or
by a Ship that lay upon the Rivolet I passed over; but I was no such fool: for I call
God to witness, and let him punish me according to my perjury, if of all that day I ever
lost my understanding, and it was a great blessing that God was pleased to preserve it
to me entire; for had I lost my judgment, we had received a very great disgrace,
which we could neither have concealed nor excused, and I had been in great danger
never to have been a Mareschal of <hi>France.</hi> We had lost all our Ensigns, and those
that carried them withall, which nevertheless God gave me the grace to save. When
a man is once possessed with fear, and that he loses his judgment, as all men in a
fright do, he knows not what he does, and it is the principal thing you are to beg
at the hands of Almighty God, to preserve your unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

soever there may be, there is still one way or other to get off, and perhaps to your
honor: But when fear has once possessed your judgment, God ye good even! you
think you are flying towards the poop, when you are running towards the prow, and
for one Enemy you think you have ten before your eyes, as drunkards do, who see a
thousand candles at once. Oh 'tis a wonderful advantage to a man of our Trade, when
his danger does not deprive him of his sence, he may then take his opportunity, and avoid

            <p>In the evening I went to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> for the Word, because Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi>
himself was wounded and could not go; when, so soon as I came into his presence, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Orleans,</hi> who always delighted to jest with me (as the <hi>Dauphin</hi> also himself
sometimes would do) began to sing the Camisado of <hi>Bullen,</hi> and the assault of <hi>Cony,</hi>
for the old Soldiers of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> jeering and pointing at me with his finger: at which I
began to be angry, and fell to cursing those who had been the cause; at which the
<hi>Dauphin</hi> laugh'd, and at last said to me; Montluc, Montluc, <hi>in plain truth, you Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
can by no means excuse it, that you have not carried your selves very ill. Which
way, Sir, (said I) can you conceive me to be any way in fault? if I knew my self to be
guilty I would at this instant go, and cause my self to be killed in the Town: but in truth
we were a company of Coxcombs, to venture our lives in your service.</hi> Whereupon
he said <hi>No, No, I do not mean you, for you were the last Captain that came out of the
Town, and above an hour after all the rest.</hi> He gave me very well to understand, when
he came to be King, that I had not fail'd of my duty, by the value he was ever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to put upon me; for when he went his expedition into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he sent an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

Pioniers had forsook him, and were stoln away, as is usual with those rascally people,
if they be not narrowly look't unto: and yet had he all the Courtine leading towards

            <p>The Mareschal being frequently solicited by the King to put this fort into a posture of

work, since the Pioneers were wanting; of which I accordingly carried word to the

<hi>They were Soldiers,</hi>

               <hi>and not Pioneers.</hi> With this answer the Mareschal was highly
offended, and in great anxicty what to do, forasmuch as the Courtine remained open,
and that the King of <hi>England</hi> had sent fresh supplies of men into <hi>Bullen.</hi> Wherefore
the Mareschal having sent throughtout all the Country for Pioneers, and none being to
be got, I contriv'd a way to make the Soldiers work, which was by giving them five
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105656:53"/>
pence a day, the ordinary pay given to the Pioneers. The Mareschal very readily consented
to the motion, but notwithstanding I could not find one who would once put his hand
to the work. Seeing therefore their refusal, to invite them by my example, I took my
own Company, that of <hi>Monsieur de Lieux</hi> my Brother, with those of Captain <hi>Leberon</hi>
my Brother-in-law, and Captain <hi>Labit</hi> my Cousin German; for those I knew durst
not refuse me. We wanted no tools, for the Mareschal had made provision of very
great store, and moreover the Pioneers who were run away, had left all theirs in a great
Tent, which the Mareschal had caused to be set up to that purpose. So soon as I came
to the Courtin I began my self first to break ground, and after me all the Captains. I
had cansed a Barrel of wine to be brought to the place, and with it my dinner, which
I had order'd to be much greater than ordinary, and the Captains also had brought
theirs along with them, together with a Sack full of pence which I shew'd to the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and after having wrought a start every Captain din'd with his own Company, and
to every Soldier we gave half a loaf, some wine and a little slesh; of which also we were
more liberal to some than to others, pretending they had taken more pains than their
fellows, on purpose to encourage them; and so soon as we had din'd we again fell to
our work, singing and plying our business until late in the evening, insomuch that one
would have thought we had never follow'd any other Trade. So soon as we gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
three Treasurers of the Army paid to every man five sols, and at our return to our
Tents, the other Soldiers by way of dirision call'd ours Pioneers and Delvers. The next
morning Captain <hi>Forcez</hi> came to tell me, that all his men also wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld come to the work,
and those of his Brother likewise (who is also yet living) all which I receiv'd, and we
did as the day before; the third day they would all come, so that in eight dayes time
we had finisht the whole Courtin; and all the Engeneers told <hi>Monsieur de St. Germ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(who himself had never stirr'd from the work) that my Soldiers had done more in eight
dayes, than four times so many Pioneers would have done in five weeks. And observe
that Captains, Lieutenants, and Ensigns stuck all the while as close to the work, as the
meanest Soldier did, and serv'd as inciters to the rest.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to commit this Exemple to writing, to let the Captains see, that it is not
the Soldiers fault, if they do not perform whatsoever you would have them do: but
then you must get the knack to make them do it chearfully, and with a good will, and
not by force; put your hands first to the work your selves, and your Soldiers will for
shame follow your exemple, and do more than you would have them do. But if you

O Camrades, how often have I, seeing the Soldier weary, and ready to faint,
alighted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rom my horse to walk with them on foot, to encourage them to make a long

my exemple.</p>
            <p>Believe me, Gentlemen, that all depends upon your selves, and that your Soldiers
will conform themselves to your humour, as it is ordinarily seen. There is a mean in all
things, sometimes a little roughness is very requisite, but then it must not be against a
whole Company, but some particular person, who would grumble, and hinder the rest
that are well disposed. I have ere now made some surly stubborn rascalls feel my anger
of which I now repent me.</p>
            <p>Sometime after the Mareschal <hi>de Biez</hi> would attempt to seize upon, and lay waste the

Companies therefore march't, for the old stirr'd not out of the Fort, but were kept there
to guard it, and the Marescal took six or seven pieces of great Artillery along with him;
so that we set out secretly in the beginning of the night, and went to some little Villages
that had formerly been burnt. This Enterprise was taken in hand contrary to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the Captains in the Army, out of the hope the said Mareschal had to bring it

Where after there was no more hopes of drawing the <hi>English</hi> into the field, the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
deliberated to take some Forts from them in the County of <hi>Oye.</hi> Now so soon as
they drew very near to one of these Forts, the Mareschal, Messieurs <hi>de Brisac,</hi> and <hi>de Tais,</hi>
drew themselves apart (I think Monsieur <hi>de Estre</hi> was with them, being then newly
come out of prison) Monsieur <hi>de Bordillon,</hi> and three or four others (whose names I have
forgot) and got up to a little eminence under the shadow of a Tree, from thence peeping
and considering which of the said Bastions, that were opposite to us, they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault;
and in the mean time I caus'd all our Ensigns to make a halt for the last, which
were yet a league behind. Now you must know I had never been there till this time;

(which Courtine was only of earth, and about two fathoms high) there was also two
great Ditches with water middle deep, and betwixt the two Ditches there was a Terrace
of earth. Whilst they were in cosultation under this Tree on my left hand, I took Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Favas,</hi> and <hi>la Moyenne,</hi> having both been my Lieutenants, and about 300 Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeers,
to whom I gave the leading of the sust Division, and I stood behind in the Rear
of them.<note place="margin">attempt upon the English Forts.</note> There presently sallyed out of the Fort an hundred or sixscore <hi>English,</hi> who
came into the Meadow, having planted five or six Muskeieers upon their Terrcss, betwixt
two Ditches, and ply'd us smartly with their shot, having left betwixt the said Bassions
and Ditches a little path, by which one man only could march a breast, to enter in, and
fally out of their Fort, confident, it seems, that under favour of their Muskers, those of
ours on the outside would not dare to charge them. Our men began then to Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buz
it at a good smart rate, and they to let sly their arrows: but me-thought they had
still an eye towards their retreat; wherefore being mounted on a little pad Nag, I came
up to the Captains, and said these words to them. Camrades, these people are mainly
enclin'd to retreat, and I see it is out of a confidence they have in their Muskets,
charge then briskly through and through, and I will second you. I needed not to bid
them twice, for before I could return to the head of my men, I saw them together
by the ears, and in a moment the <hi>English</hi> put to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> my men from
falling on, to make sirm in case any more should sally out. This little path was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
narrow, and adjoyning to the Bastion, under which the one part of them stood
sirm, the rest cast themselves into the Ditches in so great hast, that they had not leisure
to carry off all their Muskets, for our Soldiers leapt into the water as soon as they, and
brought away sour of them; and there were four or five of the said Soldiers that pass't
over the said Terrace, and the other Ditch, to the very foot of the Courtine, who brought
me word that the greatest depth of water was in the first Ditch; for the other next the
Courtine was not above knee deep. I then presently spoke to the Captains, <hi>Favas</hi> and
<hi>la Moyenne,</hi> that they should draw up my Division and theirs together, and finding
Captain <hi>Aurioqui,</hi> and almost all the other Captains entreated them them to make two
Divisions of theirs; for that so soon as I had spoken with Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> I would go
on to an Assault. They then told me, that they wanted near half of their Soldiers, who
were not yet come up, to which I made answer, that it was no matter, seeing that with
those we had we could do our business, who thereupon without further reply began to
divide themselves into two Bodies, and I ran to speak with Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> whom I
found with the Mareschal and the rest, and said to him; <hi>Let us go, Sir, let us go to the
Assault, for we shall carry the Courtine; I have tasted them, and find, that they have more
mind to run than fight.</hi> The Mareschal then said to me, <hi>What is it you say Captain</hi> Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc,
<hi>would to God we were certain presently to carry it with all the Artillery we have.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I answered him aloud; <hi>Sir, we shall have strangled them all before your Artillery
can come up to us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieurs <hi>de Tais</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc,</hi> go on to the Assault.</note> and taking Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> by the arm, said to him; <hi>Let us go, Sir,
you have believ'd me at other times, and have not repented; neither shall you repent you of
this. I have discover'd by these approaches, that these people are little worth. Let us go
then,</hi> answered he, and as we were entring into the Meadow, we already found our
two Divisions of Pikes and Harquebuzeers separated apart. <hi>Look you, Sir,</hi> then said I,
<hi>take your choice on which hand you will fight,</hi> whether on that of this Ensign over against
the Bastion below, or on that of the Engsin opposite to those I have fought with: who
thereupon said to me, <hi>Fight you that Body you have already attaqu't, and I will go fight
the other,</hi> and so we parted.</p>
            <p>So soon as the Mareschal <hi>de Biez</hi> saw us begin to march, he (as Monsieur <hi>de Bord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of my Division, saying to them aloud
at the head of our Battail; <hi>You Sergeants have ever been accustomed, when we go to fight,
to be in the Flanks behind, but I will have you now fight in the first Rink. Do you see that
Ensign there? if you do not win it, as many as I shall meet slinking off in my way as I
go, I shall make bold to cut his hamstrings; you know I am pretty dextrous that way:</hi> then
turning towards the Captains, I said, <hi>and you, Camrades, if I am not there as soon as they,
do you cut mine.</hi> I then ran to Captain <hi>Favas</hi> and <hi>la Moyenne</hi> (who might be at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of some thirty paces) and said to them, <hi>March, and throw your selves headlong into the

straight up to the Ditches, making the Sergeants still to march before, and passing over
the first and the second, came up to the foot of the Courtin. I then said to the Sergeants,
<hi>Help one another, help one another with your Halberts to get up,</hi> which they speedily did,
and others pasht them on behind, throwing them headlong into the Fort: I had also
a Halbert in my hand. In the mean time arriv'd all the Captains and Pikes, who found
me making a great shew of endeavouring to get up with my Halbert, holding with my
left hand by the wood;<note place="margin">An Assault gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Fort.</note> when some of them, not knowing who I was, took me by the
breech, and pusht me quite over on the other side, making me by that means more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
than I intended to be; for what I did was only to encourage the rest to get over:
but that follow, whoever he was, made me forget my policy, and take a leap that I had
no intent to have taken; and indeed in my whole life I did never see people so soon
get over a C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urtine. After I had taken this leap, Captain <hi>Favas</hi> and <hi>la Moyenne,</hi>
who were in the Ditch of the Bastion, put themselves into the little pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h, and past on
the other side into the Bastion, where all they found within it they put to the sword.
Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> who went on to his encounter, seeing us scrambling, up the Courtine,
threw h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mself into the Ditches of the other Fort,<note place="margin">The English put to flight.</note> when the <hi>English</hi> seeing their people
put to <unclear>flight</unclear>, and we entring into it, quitted the Fort, and ran away as fast as they could
towards <hi>Calice.</hi> The Mareschal this while seeing us run on so bravely upon the Enemy,
cried out (as I was told after) Oh heavens! they are already got in; whereupon the
Seigneurs <hi>de Brissac</hi> and <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> came full speed upon the spur, and the said Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneur
<hi>de Brissac</hi> General of the Horse, put his horse into the little path, where one man
could not very easily pass, stretching out his legs at full length upon the horse neck, at
whose mercy he past over, Monsieur <hi>de Bordillon</hi> after him, and after them follow'd some
fourty or fifty horse, all leading their horses in their hands. Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> then
presently came up to me, whom he found drawing up all the men into Battalion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that we should be fought with, and that those of <hi>Calice</hi> would certainly issue out
to relieve their men. I had got an Ensign we had won upon my shoulder, which in his
presence I restor'd to the Sergeant who had taken it, bidding him go and carry it to
Monsieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> which he did, and the said Sieur <hi>de Tais</hi> so soon as he had receiv'd it,
sent it by the same Sergeant to the Mareschal, who was very busie with his Pioneers,
breaking down the Courtine (which was only of earth) to make way for the <hi>Gens-d'|
Armes</hi> to pass over; and now we were all within, Artillery and all; where so soon as
we were all arriv'd, Messieurs <hi>de Brissac</hi> and <hi>de Bordillon,</hi> with the forty or fifty horse
that had entred with them, took the right hand toward the Sluces which separate the
Coun<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of <hi>Artois</hi> from the County of <hi>Oye,</hi> where they met with forty or fifty of the
<hi>English,</hi> bearing Launces, who presently began to retire full gallop towards <hi>Calice.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> was jealous, that these had only run away to draw him into some Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado,
and therefore made a halt, sending out <hi>Castegeac</hi> to discover a little valley that
was on his left hand; which said <hi>Castegeac</hi> presently brought him word that he had seen
above 400 horse, but it was no such thing, those he saw being no other than Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and women of the neighbouring Villages, who were flying towards <hi>Calice,</hi> which
was a great misfortune; for otherwise Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> had pursued them, and they
were all the Cavalry that the Enemy had in <hi>Calice,</hi> which had been no inconsiderable
defeart. A General of all things ought always to send out an old Soldier, or some
one whose intelligence he may absolutely rely upon, to discover; for men of little
experience soon take the alarm, and fancy Bushes to be Battaillons. I will not say
that <hi>Castegeac</hi>
               <note place="margin">The mistake of <hi>Castegeac.</hi>
               </note> was no Soldier, but upon my word he here committed a very great
error.</p>
            <p>Our Cavalry being got over the Breach, the Mareschal had caused to be made, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Tais</hi> would himself lead the Harquebuzeers, ordering me to remain with the
Battail of Pikes. There were ten or twelve Ensigns which retir'd towards <hi>Calice,</hi> and had
been coming to have disputed our entry, which, could they have come up in time, had
found us enough to do, with our Artillery and all, as the Mareschal had told me when
I went to call Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> to go on to the Assault: and although I know very well
at whom it stuck, that we did not fight them ten or twelve Ensigns, I will however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
committing it to writing,<note place="margin">Fault of the French</note> forasmuch as in delivering the truth, I should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to speak ill of some particular persons, and those none of the least, which I will
by no means do: But if Monsieur <hi>de St. Cire</hi> (who was Lieutenant to fifty men at arms
belonging to Monsieur <hi>Boissy,</hi> who died Grand Escuyer) were alive, he could tell
where the fault lay, for he was there grievously wounded, had his horse kill'd under
him, and above forty horses more of the same Troop kill'd and wounded. There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105656:54"/>
a great quarrel upon it, which proceeded so far as almost to bring two men to fight in
Lists. It was indeed a most infamous cowardise, and of great prejudice to his Majesties
service; for had those been defeated, there had no body been left in <hi>Calice</hi> but old men
and women, and I have since heard the Mareschal <hi>de Biez</hi> say, that had those Ensigns
been cut off, with his Artillery he had taken the Town in two days. But seeing those
people to be retreated safe into the City, they concluded to retire, which two days after
we did; as also the season of the year began to settle into very great rain.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you Captains you ought not disdain to learn something of me, who
am the oldest Captain in <hi>France,</hi> and who have been in as many Battails, or more, as
any Captain of <hi>Europe,</hi> as you will judge at the end of my Book. Know therefore that
the reasons which induc't me to attempt this affault, were these. First, because I had felt
the pulse of the <hi>English</hi> at my first arrival, and found them a very easie Enemy. Secondly,
because they had abandon'd their Fortifications, which we gain'd, having the Bastion
that serv'd them for a Flanker. Thirdly, because from the little eminence where I had
made a halt before I went down into the Meadow, I had seen coming along the Plain
on the inside toward <hi>Calice</hi> a great number of people coming from thence, and observ'd
all the Courtine to be full of men, by which I saw it was high time to fall on; and for
a fourth reason, because that in the Ditch next to the Courtine there was very little
water, and from the said Ditch to the said Courtine it was but two good steps, where the
Soldiers might stand well enough, and with a little help of their Pikes or Halberts, and
the assistance of one another (the Courtine being no more than two fadoms high) we
should carry the place. When (Captains) therefore your eye shall have discharg'd its
office in discovering the number of your Enemy, and the strength of the place where he
is, and that you have tasted, and found him apt to fly, charge him whilst he is in the
fear you have possest him withal, for if you give him time to recover his senses, and to
forget his fright, you will be more often in danger of being beaten, than likely to beat.
Wherefore you ought evermore to pursue him in his fear, without giving him leisure to
re-assume his courage, and carry always about you the Motto of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
which is: <hi>Deferr not that till to morrow thou canst do to day; for many things fall out
betwixt the lip and the cup,</hi> especially in war, and then it will be too late to say, <hi>I should
never have thought it.</hi> You shall execute many things in your heat, which, if you give
your selves leisure to consider of, you will think of it thrice before you once attempt it.
Push home then, venture, and do not give your Enemies leisure to consult together, for
one will encourage another.</p>
            <p>Being return'd to the Fort of <hi>Outrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> there was hardly a day past that the <hi>English</hi>
did not come to tickle us upon the descent towards the Sea, and would commonly brave
our people up to our very Canon, which was within ten or twelve paces of the Fort:
and we were all abus'd by what we had heard our Predecessors say, that one English
man would always beat two French men, and that the <hi>English</hi> would never run away,
nor never yield. I had retain'd something of the Camisado of <hi>Bullen,</hi> and of the business
of <hi>Oye;</hi> and therefore said one day to Mousieur <hi>de Tais,</hi> that I would discover to him
the mystery of the <hi>English,</hi> and wherefore they were reputed so hardy: which was,
that they all carried arms of little reach, and therefore were necessitated to come up close to
us to loose their arrows,<note place="margin">A discourse concerning the valour of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </note> which otherwise would do no execution; whereas we who were
accustomed to fire our Harquebuzes at a great distance, seeing the Enemy use another
manner of sight, thought these near approaches of theirs very strange, imputing their
running on at this confident rate to absolute bravery: but I will lay them an Ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado,
and then you shall see if I am in the right or no, and whether a Gascon be not as
good as an English-man. In antient time their Fathers and ours were neighbours.</p>
            <p>I then chose out sixscore men, Harquebuzeers and Pikes, with some Halberts amongst
them, and lodg'd them in a hollow which the water had made, lying below on the
right hand of the Fort, and sent Captain <hi>Chaux</hi> at the time when it was low water,
straight to some little houses which were upon the Banks of the River almost over against
the Town to skirmish with them, with instructions that so soon as he should see them
pass the River, he should begin to retire, and give them leave to make a charge. Which
he accordingly did: but it fortun'd so, that he was wounded in one of his arms with a
Hurquebuz shot, and the Soldiers took him and carried him back to the Fort, so that
the skirmish remained without a head.<note place="margin">Encountet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>English</hi> were soon aware of it, and gave
them a very brisk charge, driving them on fighting up to the very Canon. Seeing then
our men so ill handled, I start up out of my Ambuscado sooner then I should have
done, running on full drive directly up to them, commanding the Soldiers not to shoot,
till they came within the distance of their arrows. They were two or three hundred men,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105656:55"/>
having some <hi>Italian</hi> Harquebuzeers amongst them, which made me heartily repent that
I had made my Ambuscado no stronger: but it was now past remedy, and so soon as
they saw me coming towards them, they left the pursuit of the others, and came to
charge upon me. We marcht straight up to them, and so soon as they were come up
within arrow shot, our Harquebuzeers gave their volley all at once, and then clapt their
hands to their swords, as I had commanded, and we ran on to come to blows; but so
soon as we came within two or three pikes length, they turn'd their backs with as great
facility as any Nation that ever I saw, and we pursued them as far as the River, close by
the Town, and there were four or five of our Soldiers who followed them to the other
side. I then made a halt at the ruins of the little houses, where I rally'd my people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again, some of whom were left by the way behind, who were not able to run so
fast as the rest. Monsieur <hi>de Tais</hi> had seen all, and was sally'd out of the Fort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Artillery,<note place="margin">A pleasant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of their valour, they ever go on to fight in fear of being defeated. You are neither to

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>aque the <hi>English,</hi> and came still up closer to them; and let any one remember when
the Mareschal <hi>de Biez</hi>
               <note place="margin">The remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valour of the Mareschal <hi>de Biez.</hi>
               </note> fought them betwixt the Fort of <hi>Andelot,</hi> and the Town, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our people needed to be intreated to fall on. The said Sieur <hi>de Biez</hi> there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the part of a very valiant Gentleman, for when his Cavalry were all run off the
Field, he came alone to put himself in the head of our Battallion, and alighted, taking
a Pike in his hand to go on to the fight, from whence he came off with very great honor.
I my self was not there, and therefore shall say nothing of it; for two or three months
after our return out of the County of <hi>Oye,</hi> I had askt leave of <hi>Monsieur do Tais</hi> to go
to Court: but the Historians in the mean time are very unjust to conceal such brave acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that was a very remarkable one in this old Cavalier. Being at Court I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
so far with the Admiral, that he procur'd me a dismission from the King, for as
much as I had reassum'd the office of Camp-Master upon no other terms, but only to
command in the first Expedition that the Admiral should go upon; and having remain'd
a month at Court, attending the King in the quality of one of his Gentlemen Waiters
(who was now grown old, and melancholic, and did not caress men, as he had wont to
do, only once he talkt with me about the Battail of <hi>Serisoles,</hi> being at <hi>Fountain-Bleau</hi>)
I took my leave of his Majesty, and never saw him after. I then return'd into <hi>Gascony,</hi>
from whence I never stirr'd till King <hi>Henry</hi> by the death of his Father was become King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bullen</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the <hi>French</hi> the 25. day of <hi>April,</hi> 1991.</note>
having all that while been opprest with troubles and sickness. And that is the reason why
I can give you no account of the surrender of <hi>Bullen,</hi> which the King of <hi>England</hi> by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
of <hi>Francis</hi> the first,<note place="margin">The death of <hi>Francis</hi> the first.</note> was constrain'd to quit for some consideration in mony. A
little after he died, and our King stay'd but a very little behind him. We must all die;
but this Surrender of <hi>Bullen</hi> hapened in the reign of King <hi>Henry,</hi> my good Master, who
succeeded his Father.</p>
            <p>Our new King having peace with the Emperor, and after the redelivery of <hi>Bullen,</hi>
being also friends with the King of <hi>England,</hi> it seem'd that our arms were likely long to
rust by the walls; and indeed, if these two Princes sit still, <hi>France</hi> may be at rest. After
having continued some time at home, the King was pleas'd to call me away, and to
give me the command of Camp-master, and the government of <hi>Montcallier</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Montcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>

Prince of <hi>Malphé</hi> his Lieutenant-General in <hi>Piedmont, Monsieur de Bonnevet</hi> being our
Colonel: he remembers me very well, and if those who have govern'd since had lov'd me
as well as he, I had had as much riches and honour as any Gentleman that has come out of
<hi>Gascony</hi> these many years. I there remain'd eighteen moneths, without doing any thing
all the while worthy to be remembred; for I will write nothing, but that wherein I had
some command. Having obtain'd leave to retire my self to my own house, I return'd
into <hi>Gascony,</hi> where I heard a little while after, that by reason of the age and infirmness
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105656:55"/>
of the Prince of <hi>Malphé,</hi> the King was about to send thither <hi>Monsieur de Brissac</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> Lieure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General in <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </note> in the
quality of his Lieutenant General there, which was the occasion that Captain <hi>Tilladet</hi>
(who had also been dismist) and my self went together to Court, where at our coming, we
found that the said Seigneur had taken his leave of the King in order to his Journey. We
then presented our selves before his Majesty, who very graciously received us; and to the
Constable, who was return'd to Court, and in greater favour than ever in the time of
King <hi>Francis,</hi> which many did hardly believe he would have been: but the Ladies had
now lost their credit, and others were entred in. Immediately upon our comming his
said Majesty, who was all this time in a little Town betwixt <hi>Melun</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> called
<hi>Ville-neufve Saint George,</hi> commanded us to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and repair to <hi>Monsieur Brissac.</hi>
The next day after our arrival, the said <hi>Sieur de Brissac</hi> departed, being very glad that
we were come to him, and so we went as far as <hi>Suze,</hi> where we found the Prince of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phé,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The death of the Prince of <hi>Malphé.</hi>
               </note>
who had put himself upon his way, to come to end his life in <hi>France,</hi> as also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an hour after our arrival he died. Which, though I serv'd some time under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
is all I shall say of him, having very little opportunity to know more of him,
than what I have taken upon trust; and it is a great misfortune to a Captain, so often to
change his General; for before you can come to be throughly acquainted with him, you
are old; and new friendships, and new acquaintance are troublesome. <hi>Monsieur de Brissac</hi>
presently hereupon dispatcht away <hi>Monsieur de Forquevaux</hi> to the King with an account
of all, whom his Majesty sent speedily back again with the Patent of Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> made Mareschal of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note>
which he was pleased to conferr upon him.</p>
            <p>We lay idle five or six moneths without any war; but it is hard for two so great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and so near neighbours, to continue long without coming to arms, and indeed soon
after an occasion presented it self: the King having taken upon him the protection of Duke
<hi>Octavia,</hi> whom the Pope, and the Emperor his Father in Law, would deprive of his Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
In order whereunto <hi>Don Ferrand de Gonzaga</hi> had laid siege to <hi>Parma,</hi> wherein was
<hi>Monsieur de Termes,</hi> and to <hi>Miranda</hi> where <hi>Monsieur de Sansac</hi> commanded, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere
acquir'd very great reputation, for having worthily acquitted and approved himself a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

he has been.<note place="margin">The war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>France and Spain</hi> renewed.</note> He was one of the best Horse-men that ever was in <hi>France:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I can give no account of these affairs, but by report only; nor of what passed at these
two Sieges, I shall let them alone.</p>
            <p>The King having intelligence that the Emperors forces were wholly taken up in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesan,</hi>
sent to the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the year 1550.</note> that he should break the Peace, and upon the
rupture to attempt to surprize some Town or other upon the Frontier, which he did. For
he took <hi>Quiers,</hi> and <hi>St. Damian:</hi> but the attempt upon <hi>Cairas</hi> did not succeed, as did
the other two. <hi>Monsieur de Bassé</hi> went to execute that of <hi>St. Damian,</hi> which he surpriz'd
betwixt break of day and Sun rise, and the Mareschal himself executed that of <hi>Quiers</hi>
after the manner I am going to relate, and I think <hi>Monsieur le President de Birague,</hi> who
was there present, will in this Book find that I have not much missed it in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monsieur d' Ausun</hi> was chosen to goe execute the design upon <hi>Cairas,</hi> who took with him
the Baron <hi>de Cypi,</hi> and two or three other <hi>French</hi> Companies, together with <hi>Monsieur de
Gental,</hi> and some Italians. The Scalado was given with great fury; but they were as well
receiv'd.<note place="margin">The Enterprize of <hi>Cairas.</hi>
               </note> There died one of the Brothers of <hi>Monsieur de Charry,</hi> who was gone as far as
<hi>Savillan,</hi> and being in their way as they marcht in the night, went along with them,
and mounted a ladder the first man, from which he was beaten down. He was ill enough
followed, as it was said. In the mean time <hi>Monsieur de Bassé</hi> took some Companies with
him, with which by break of day he arrived within half a mile of <hi>St. Damian;</hi> they were
once upon the point to return, seeing they should be discover'd before they could come to
the place, but in the end marcht on to try their fortune. The custom of <hi>St. Damian</hi> was,
that the Soldiers constantly opened the Gates every morning at break of day, to let all the
people out to work, and afterwards placed some Centinels upon the wall; so that the Sieur
<hi>de Bassé</hi> entered with his ladders into the Graff, and had rear'd them to the wall before he
was discover'd. The Captains mounted first, and before they were espy'd by any, the
one half of our people were got into the Town,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St. Damian</hi> taken.</note> where there was only one foot Company,
which retired into the Castle, where there was not provision for one day, and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
yielded up themselves. By which, Captains, you may see of how great importance it
is to be careful never to leave a wall naked of Centinels, or at least to have them upon
some Tower or Gate, especially about break of day, for that is the time of greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. People are weary of watching their walls, but your Enemy is not weary of watching
his opportunity. All these three enterprizes of <hi>Cairas, St. Damian</hi> and <hi>Quiers</hi> should have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105656:56"/>
been executed in one night; and indeed whoever will break a Peace, or a Truce, let him
do all the execution he can, and make all the noise at one clap; for if he go piece by piece,
he is certain to lose either a leg or a wing.</p>
            <p>Three dayes before the Mareschal had been in consultation about the manner how to
execute this enterpize upon <hi>Quiers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Enterprise of <hi>Quiers.</hi>
               </note> at which Council were assisting Messieurs <hi>de Bonivet,</hi>
President <hi>Birague, Francisco Bernardin, de Bassé, and d' Aussun;</hi> and I cannot certainly
say whether Sieur <hi>Ludovico de Biraga</hi> was present or no; but I am almost confident he
was, forasmuch as the Mareschal resolved upon nothing without his advice, he being a
man of a most approved judgment. It was there concluded that we should give a <hi>Scalado</hi>
on the upper side by the Vinyards upon the way from <hi>Agnasse</hi> to <hi>Quiers.</hi> I had no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to this Scalado, neither did I think it likely to take effect, which made me entreat the
Mareschal, that seeing he was himself resolv'd to go in person upon this design, and that
it was the first place he had undertaken since his Lieutenancy, it might be ordered so, as
to succeed, and redound to his honour: for if in his first tryal he should fail of success,
men commonly judging of things by the event, would look upon it as an ill omen, and be
apt to suspect his fortune, which is a very great prejudice to a man in supreme command.
That therefore he should with great secrecy cause four or five pieces of Canon to march all
night,<note place="margin">The opinion of Monsieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> that they might arrive at the same time that the Scalado should be given at the
Port <hi>Iaune,</hi> and so by one way or the other he would not fail to carry the place; for since
he was resolved to attempt it, he was to try all ways conducing to the end proposed. Now
the Artillery was already mounted on carriages, and fit for present service, before the
Castle of <hi>Turin;</hi> for so soon as the Mareschal understood that his Majesty had taken upon
him the protection of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and that the war was already broke out in
those parts, he made no question but the rempest would soon fall upon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had wisely made his preparations before hand, that he might not be to seek in time
of need, being indeed one of the most prudent and circumspect Commanders that I
ever knew.</p>
            <p>This advice of mine suffered a great dispute; for it was objected that in one night the
Artillery could not be drawn to <hi>Quiers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His opinlon disputed.</note> and that all the three enterprizes would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by the rattle of the Carriages, and the voice of the drivers of the Artillery: but
in the end it was concluded that at Vespers the Gates of <hi>Turin</hi> should be shut, and that
Oxen should be taken about <hi>Rivolle</hi> and <hi>Veillamie,</hi> and should be all brought in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the City, and great Guards kept at the Gates, to the end that no one living should
stir our. It was moreover concluded, that I at the same hour should draw some Canon,
and the great Culverine out of the Castle of <hi>Montcallier,</hi> and should take the Oxen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Gentlemen and Citizens of <hi>Montcallier,</hi> which graz'd on the further side
of the Bridge towards the Lodges. They made account that by one of the clock at night
the Artillery would be at <hi>Montcallier,</hi> by the way beyond the Bridge, and <hi>Monsieur de
Caillac</hi> and I were to stay together to convoy the Artillery with my Company, and the
Mareschal, Messieurs <hi>de Bonnivet,</hi> and <hi>Francisco Bernardin</hi> would go the other way
with all the rest of the Foor. The said Mareschal also left me Monsieur <hi>de Piquigni</hi> with
his Company, and another, who were to go before us with the Pioneers, and ten Gabions
that we took with us from the Castle of <hi>Montcallier,</hi> in which order we arriv'd both the
one and the other at the time appointed before <hi>Quiers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Ecalado fails.</note> But the Camisado vanisht into
smoak; for as much as all the ladders prov'd too short, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Graffe was much dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than had been reported to the Mareschal: which was the reason that we all turn'd
to the Port <hi>Iaune,</hi> where we found that they had already filled the Gabions, and were
ready to lodge the Canon for Battery. The Mareschal's good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune began here to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it self;<note place="margin">The good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac.</hi>
               </note> for had the ladders been of a sufficient length, and that we had gone on to
the Afsault, all the Citizens as well as the Soldiers were resolute to defend their walls
to the last man; so that in my opinion we should have been very well swing'd, and beaten
off: for as much as they would neither suffer themselves to be surpriz'd by night, nor
taken by force: and we could not carry our design so close, but that they had had notice of
it the day before; so that it had been no hard matter for them to give us a repulse, which
perhaps might have discourag'd them to do, as they afterward did. <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> at his
departure from thence had there left an <hi>Italian</hi> Governor with three Companies, and had
drawn out all the Spanish foot, to take them along with him to <hi>Parma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Battery having for some space play'd against the Town,<note place="margin">Quiers batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> wrought its effect, and
made a breach on the left hand of the Port <hi>Iaune:</hi> but there fell thereupon so violent a
storm of rain as almost spoild all our work; yet notwithstanding by eleven of the clock
the breach was eight or ten paces wide. Hereupon the Inhabitants of the Town, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
nothing more than a fair opportunity of putting themselves into the Kings obedience,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105656:56"/>
by reason of the ill usage they had received from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> began to ask the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
if he thought himself sufficient with his Soldiers to withstand the Assault; to whom
he made answer, that he was, provided the Towns-men also would take arms to assist
him. Whereupon they plainly told him, that they would not do it, and moreover
that they had not been so well entreated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that they should take arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>French.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Division in <hi>Quiers.</hi>
               </note> By which answer the Governor, who was an understanding man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
himself to be lodg'd <hi>betwixt my Lord and my Lady,</hi> and doubted that those of the
Town were more likely to assault him behind than otherwise, which made him say to
them, Have a little patience friends, and I will make such a Capitulation with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal,
as shall preserve you from any injury, and be honourable for our selves; and
thereupon caused a Trumpet to sound a parly, sending out a man to desire the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,
that he would send him Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin,</hi> and the Signieur <hi>de Monbasin,</hi>
and in the mean time cause his Battery to cease. The Mareschal immediately then sent
to us to give over shooting, which we accordingly did; and it was thereupon agreed,
that the Governor should send out two or three in Hostage, and that then the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
should enter in to Capitulate,<note place="margin">The Capitulation of Quiers,</note> and I think President <hi>Birague</hi> went in with them,
by reason he would not the Town should be sackt, his Wife being a Daughter of <hi>Quiers,</hi>
and the most part of the Gentry in the Town being by that means ally'd to him: but
that I may not li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, I am not certain whether he went a third or no. Neither would
the Mareschal himself by any means, that any violence should be offer'd to them, being
this would be an exemple to the other places that were in the Enemies possession, to draw
them on, that when they should happen to be in the like condition, out of consideration
of the Civility he should shew to those of <hi>Quiers,</hi> they might be the more enclin'd to
take part with the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatest difficulty that hapned betwixt our Deputies and the Governor, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
was, that the said Governor, it being already almost night, said he could not possibly
retreat to <hi>Ast,</hi> and consequently should be in danger of being defeared by the way;
wherefore he desired that the Surrender might be deferred till the next day: The Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
who stood upon thorns, fearing lest this night they might be reliev'd from <hi>Ast,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
then to have <hi>la Roquette</hi> deliver'd up to him, to put into it threescore men, and
that they should choose out of our Captains any one whom they would, to enter in with
them; in the mean time making our Companies still advance nearer to the Breach, which
the Governor having notice of, he himself came upon the wall of the <hi>Roquette,</hi> where he
call'd to me, entreating me to make the Soldiers retire, and telling me that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the Mareschal. The conclusion of which agreement was, that they were to
march away with Bag and Baggage, their Colours furl'd up, without beat of Drum the
next morning; and for further assurance it was agreed, that <hi>la Roquette</hi> should be put
into our hands.<note place="margin">La Roquette surrendred.</note> The Town then sent to the Mareschal to entreat, that I, with the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
men might be put into it; for I had in <hi>Piedmont</hi> acquir'd the reputation of a man of
good discipline, to prevent all sorts of disorder in the Soldier: and I order'd it so well
here, that not any one of the Citizens lost the worth of a straw. The avarice of a little
plunder does oftentimes turn the hearts of such as otherwise are enclin'd to favour
ones party. This business was very well consider'd by the Mareschal; for that very night
400 Harquebuzeers set out from <hi>Ast</hi> to try if they could get into the Town; but they
met intelligence by the way, that we were possest of <hi>la Roquette,</hi> which made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
There was one error committed in this business; for it was propounded in the
Council, that without doubt the Enemy would come to us at the report of this Siege,
and that therefore at the same time the <hi>Roquette</hi> should be deliver'd up to us, we should
send out a good strong party to go the <hi>patrouille</hi> on the high way towards <hi>Ast,</hi> which
had it been done as it ought to have been, we had certainly cut off this Relief.</p>
            <p>The next morning Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> who was encampt upon the road of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with fifteen or twenty Gentlemen in company with him came to <hi>Quiers,</hi> just at the time
when the <hi>Italians</hi> were marching out of the Town, who being entred in, stayd at the
Gate to sec them march away, when so soon as they were gone, Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi>
being under the second Gate to enter into the City, and the Mareschal having command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me not to suffer any person whatsoever to enter till he himself was first come in, I
heard my Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>utenant very loud and angry at the <hi>Breach,</hi> where I had placed him to
watch, that none should pass in that way; at which Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> said to me,
<hi>there is some disorder,</hi> whereupon I presently ran to the place, and found that they were
Thieves of the very Town of <hi>Quiers</hi> it self, who would have entred in to pillage the City:
at which going hastily down the Breach to fall upon them, the ruines of the wall made
my feet shp from under me, so that I sell upon my left side amongst the stones, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105656:57"/>
so great violence, that I put my hip out of joynt. I do think that all the tortures in the
world are not comparable to this, by reason of a little nerve we have in that joynt, where
the bones are all enchac'c into one another, which was extended, in so much that I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
walkt upright since;<note place="margin">Monsieur Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc hurt with a tall.</note> but have ever had pain more or less, notwithstanding all the Baths
and other remedies I could use to remove it. Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> caused me to be carried
by the Soldiers into a Lodging, and I before had brought in the Quartermasters, who
were ordering the Quarters. About an hour after I was hurt the Mareschal entred the
City, and did me the honour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light at my lodging to see me, expressing as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for my mischance as if I had been his own Brother; and indeed he heartily lov'd,
and had a very esteem for me. During our abode there he came three times to keep
his Council at my Beds head, as President <hi>Birague,</hi> who is yet living can witness. He
took great delight to hear men discourse in his presence, but in few words; and if any
one said any thing, he would presently demand his reason. At the said <hi>Quiers,</hi> and at
<hi>Montcallier</hi> I kept my bed two moneths and a half of this unlucky fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> leaving the war of <hi>Parma,</hi> came to <hi>Ast</hi> to draw his Forces together,

the Constable Monsieur <hi>le Compte de Charmy,</hi> and his Brother Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault,</hi>
having a great number of Gentlemen of very good quality in their Train, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that three Companies of foot being quarter'd in <hi>Quiers,</hi> the Mareschal was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to dislodge them to accommodate the Princes, and the Lords of their Train.
Certainly there is not a braver Nobility in the world than the French,<note place="margin">The Praise of the French No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</note> nor more ready
to put foot in the stirrup for the service of their Prince; but then you must take them
in the heat. Certain days after their arrival the Mareschal laid a design to go and take
the Castle of <hi>Lans,</hi> which Garrison very much infested the Road betwixt <hi>Suze</hi> and
<hi>Turin,</hi> by reason of a valley that extends it self from <hi>Lans</hi> to the high way, so that the
Soldiers of the said <hi>Lans</hi> were almost continually there, having a little Castle in the mid
way, that serv'd them for a retreat. The Marescal then sent for me to <hi>Montcallier,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
six weeks after my fall I had caused my self to be conveyed in a litter: upon
whose summons I made my self to be set upon a little Mule, and with extreme pain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Quiers,</hi> every day striving by little and little to walk. Behold these were the
successes of the taking of <hi>Quiers</hi> and <hi>St. Damian,</hi> and I will now give an account of the
taking of <hi>Lans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mareschal then,<note place="margin">The Enterprise of <hi>Lans.</hi>
               </note> and all the Camp (wherein were all the above-named Princes and
Lords) march't directly to <hi>Lans,</hi> and because there are some of them yet living, who love
me, and others that have an unkindness for me, I will come as near to truth as my
memory will give me leave, to the end that those who hate me, may have no occasion to
reprehend me, speaking the truth; and that the rest who love me, may take delight in
reading what I have done, and call me to their remembrance, for the Historians I see
mince the matter.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal with all the Camp went before, leaving me with five Ensigns of foot,
and the Masters of the Ordnace, Messieurs <hi>de Caillac</hi> and <hi>du Noguy,</hi> who were also at the
taking of <hi>Quiers,</hi> to conduct the Artillery. The day after he departed from <hi>Quiers</hi> he
arriv'd at <hi>Lans</hi> about noon, and we with the Artillery came up in the beginnging of the
night. The Bourg of <hi>Lans</hi> is large, and enclosed with scurvey wall; the Mareschal took
up his quarter in another Bourge, about a mile distant from the said <hi>Lans,</hi> and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> and all the Cavalry. All the Princes and Lords would be
quarter'd in the Bourg of <hi>Lans,</hi> with some <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Companies of foot, and
particularly Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet,</hi> with his Colonel Company. At their arrival they
went to the foot of the Mountain,<note place="margin">Description of Lans.</note> on the right hand as you come out of the Bourg. The
Sergeant Major had already got to the top of the said Mountain behind the Castle round
about which were very great precipices, and especially behind it, where the Mareschal
was of necessity to go to take a view of the Place. There is nothing but precipice, saving
in the front of the Castle, which looks towards the Town, and there were two great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks,
and the Gate of the Castle between them. To plant the Artillery there, was only
to lose so much time, and to place it on that side by which we came, we should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc't
to point the Mussel of the Canon upward, so that it could batter but one half of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105656:57"/>
wall, and besides we were to climb above a thousand paces, with the greatest difficulty
imaginable; before we could come to the foot of the said wall. On the right hand it
was the same, and behind the worst of all: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alling thence, a man should tumble
headlong a quarter of a mile down into the River. By reason of which great difficulty
of bringing up Canon behind the said Castle, where there was a little even plot of some
twenty or five and twenty paces broad, the Enemy had made no other fortification on
that side, saving that they had cut a paltry Ditch of about half a pikes depth in the
Rock, with two Ravelins on either side, that slanckt the Ditch; and it had not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
three moneths before,<note place="margin">The opinion of the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers.</note> that two of the Emperors Engineers had been there, and had
declar'd, that it was not possible for all mankind to bring up Artillery, either by this
side, or any of the others, if they did not plant it on the Town side, before the Gate of
the Castle, which also would be so much labour lost.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal at his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st arrival with all the Prince and Lords, and the Engineers he
had with him, went to take a view of the backside of the Castle, up an ascent of above 300
paces, and as uneasie ones as ever they went in their lives, where after they had discover'd,
and remain'd above two hours upon the place, they all concluded it impossible to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
At night I came with the Artillery, when it was presently told me, that the next day
we were to return back again; at which I was very much dasht; but was so intolerably
tormented with my hip, that I presently threw my self upon a Matrice, and saw not the
Mareschal that night; for he was gone back to his Quarters, very much displeased with
some who before had represented the Enterprise so easie to him, and would undertake to
bring it about, and yet when it came to the push concluded it impossible. In the morning
he came again, and again went to view the place; but the more they lookt, the worse
they like't, and still discovered greater difficulties than before. Just as I had din'd Messieurs
<hi>de Piquigny, de</hi> Touchepeid, and <hi>de Vinu,</hi> came to seek me out, and told me, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
was concluded to return, and that I would not be unwilling to it, if I had seen
the place, putting so many whimsies into my head, that they got me upon my little Mule,
and carried me behind the ridge of the Mountain,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </note> where Harquebuz shots were very good
cheap, unless a man took on the right hand towards the River, and there it was hard to
pass, and more hard to discover any thing; and both the Mareschal and all the Princes
had gone up, and come down at the mercy of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emies shot. Whom God defends
is well defended. I have seen the time when a thousand Harquebuz shot have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
within an hundred paces of me, and done me no harm: but we all four made
such shift, that at last we got up to the top, and they led me the same way by which the
Mareschal and all his Company had ascended and descended before.</p>
            <p>I will here set down for an exemple to those that shall follow after us, how I found
the thing feasible, and which way Canon was to be got up to this level; not however
without very great difficulty: but how hard soever it appear'd to be, we concluded to
bring up the Artillery to the top of the Mountain, and there to plant it in Battery. In
the first place to look up from the foot of the Mountain to the height of it, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
the Angels themselves would have enough to do to climb; but I began to
take notice, that making one advance of about an hundred paces, to a little place which
might be some ten paces in circumference, that there we might have conveniency to rest
the Piece, for the little place was almost even. I then conceived that we might make
another Stage, crossing over on the left hand towards the Castle, to another little even
spot, that was sufficient to repose the Canon, and afterwards that we were to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Stage, crossing again to the right hand to another level spot; and from thence
indeed we had the ascent something steep to the backside of the Castle; but we should
before have got past all the Rocks and Precipices.</p>
            <p>By all these three resting-places we descended the Mountain in great danger of our
necks, where I shewed them that each of them, was to undertake to advance the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
from one reposing place to another, all which they took especial notice of, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
remounted me upon my Mule; for before they had led me all the way under
the Arms like a Bride, and so we went directly to the Mareschal's Quarters, where I
found them all set in Council, to take order for our return. So soon as I came into the
room, the Mareschal said to me, <hi>How now Monsieur</hi> de Montlu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>where have you been?
I have sent for you twice to come to the Council, that you might hear the determination we
have made to return. You must carry back the Artillery by the same way you came.</hi> To
which I made answer, <hi>what Sir, will you return without taking this place, that is a</hi> reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<hi>unworthy Monsieur</hi> de Brissac? <hi>I have been to view the place, and by the same way
that you have view'd it your self, and do assure you that we will bring up the Artillery to
the top of the Mountain.</hi> He then told me, that it must be God alone that must work
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105656:58"/>
such a miracle, for that it was not in the power of man to do it; to which I made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>that I was not God, and yet that I would undertake to bring them up.</hi> He then
said to me, <hi>yes in eight or ten days time perhaps with the help of Engines, and in the
mean time</hi> Don Ferrand, <hi>who is at</hi> Verseil, <hi>shall gather together all the Forces he can
make, both in the field, and out of the Garrisons, and come to give us Battail, who has
3000 Germains, and I have neither Germans nor Swiss to match him. Sir,</hi> then (said I)
<hi>I will pawn to you my life and my honour, in two mornings to plant you four Pieces of Canon
ready mounted on the back side of the Castle;</hi> notwithstanding which he was still harping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the 3000 <hi>Germains;</hi> at which growing at last a little angry, I said, <hi>Do you make so great
account of</hi> Don Ferrand's <hi>Germans? The Admiral has here six Companies commanded by
Captain</hi> Ynard, <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Bonnivet <hi>shall give him four more of his, with which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs

                  </gap>nd let him take his choice.</hi> To which Captain <hi>Ynard</hi> made
answer, that he was ready to fight either the one or the other, as the Mareschal should
please to appoint; Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> also said, it was all one to him, whereupon I
said, <hi>and must we then make such a piece of matter of the</hi> Germans? <hi>I dare lay a good
wager of <unclear>those</unclear> three thousand, fifteen hundred have nere a tatter to their arses, whereas
our Soldiers have most of them breeches of Velvet and Satin, and think themselves all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Seeing then themselves so well clad as they are, shall they be afraid to fight with the</hi>
Germans? <hi>let them but come to us once, and we shall handle them as we did at</hi> Cerisolles.
Monsieur <hi>de Montmorancy</hi> then stood up,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montlucs</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in the Council.</note> and said, <hi>Sir Monsieur</hi> de Montluc <hi>is an old
Captain, methinks you ought to give credit to what he says;</hi> to which the Mareschal made
answer, <hi>You do not know him so well as I, for he will never think any thing impossible, and
one time or another will make us lose all;</hi> whereupon I made answer again, <hi>that where I
saw a difficulty I fear'd my skin as much as another; but that in this I could discover no
inconvenience at all.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> then spoke, and said, <hi>Sir, let him have his
own way for once,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A dispu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and see what he will do;</hi> Messieurs the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>d' Anguien</hi> laid as much, and Monsieur <hi>d' Aumalle</hi> the same. Monsieur <hi>de Gurnort</hi> who
is now Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefoucaut,</hi> the Count <hi>de Charney,</hi> the
Sieurs <hi>de la Fayette,</hi> and <hi>de Terride,</hi> were all of the same opinion: which the Mareschal
seeing, said, <hi>Well Gentlemen, I perceive you have all a desire that we should play the fools;
let us do so then, for I intend to let you see, that I am as great a one as any of you all.</hi> And
thus I got the victory against the whole Council.</p>
            <p>Things being thus concluded I said to Monsieur <hi>de Nemours, Sir, it will be necessary
that you Princes and Lords put your helping hands to this business, and lead the Soldiers the
way, to the end that if you would shrink away, and avoid the great toyl and labour they are to
undergo for the execution of the thing in question, we may reproach them, that the Princes
and Lords put to their hands before them.</hi> In the mean time I told him, that it would do
well if he so pleas'd, that he with his own Company should take a Canon he himself had
brought thither with him, and conduct it to the foot of the Mountain, who answer'd
me, that he would very willingly do it. Now the Artillery was of necessity to be drawn
thorough the Town, and they were moreover constrain'd to break three or four Corners
of houses, to draw them out, and also to level a little descent at the going out of the
Town, from whence they fell into a plain way to the very foot of the Mountain upon
which the Castle stood, about a thousand paces distant from the City. I said as much
to Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who very readily consented to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the charge of other two, to whom also Monsieur <hi>de Montmorancy</hi> very frankly
offer'd himself. As to the fourth piece of Canon, I cannot remember who it was, that
undertook the care of that,<note place="margin">The order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> for it was not Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> being he was to go back to
his Quarters to the horse with the Mareschal: but however it was they rested not of all
night, all by Torch-light they had brought the Artillery to the foot of the Mountain.
But before they went out of the Council, I said to Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale; Sir, will you go
along,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Princes assist.</note> 
               <hi>and I will shew you which way we will get up the Artillery behind the Castle,</hi> and <hi>Sir</hi>
(speaking to the Mareschal) <hi>I know you will not yet retire to your Quarters.</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi>
then went willingly along with me, having only Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefaucault,</hi> the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
<hi>Piquigny,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> goes again to view the Castle of <hi>Lans.</hi>
               </note> and my self in company with him; who, though I was damnably plagu'd
with my hip, nevertheless forc't my self that they might see with their own eyes which
way it was to be done. So soon then as we had ascended the Mountain, and taken a
view of the place, we returned back to the Mareschal, who stayd expecting the said Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105656:58"/>
               <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> who at his coming told him that my reason was very good, and that no
body had taken notice of what I had perceiv'd; nor observ'd those resting places in the
Rock. All the Princes and Lords were yet in the Hall where the Mareschal had din'd:
where Monsieur <hi>de Bassé</hi> at that time was, I do not certainly remember, for the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
sent for him to come with his Company, and two French Companies more, with
command to Captain <hi>Tilladet,</hi> and <hi>Savallan,</hi> to advance night and day, and come to joyn
with him, which they accordingly did.</p>
            <p>The next morning I went to see which way we were to get up this Mountain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
being gall'd by the shot from the Castle; and here I first discover'd five little loop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes
made for Harquebuzes only, to which we lay open and expos'd all the way we were
to go: To countercheck these I intreated Captain <hi>Ynard</hi> to bring me three hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st marksmen he had in all his Companies; which, so soon as they came
we divided to be set ten to each loop-lole, who shot as they do at a mark one after another,
and all open; and when the last of the ten had made his shot, the first always began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
There was in the Town a house higher than the rest, from the roof of which one
might play into the Castle, and all along the Curtain: but the Enemy, to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from this inconvenience, had nail'd several plancks one above another, in such sort
that those who were upon the top of the house could see nothing within the wall. Now
these plancks were very thin, and before the beginning of the War I had put it into the
Mareschal's head to cause four hundred Harquebuzes to be forg'd at <hi>Pignerol,</hi> of a bore
to carry point blank three or four hundred paces, of which he might distribute twenty
to each Company, with order to the Treasurers to allow twelve<note n="*" place="margin">A Frank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

should carry those arms. These Harquebuzes were already made, and distributed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I intreated Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> (the same who was since Campmaster) to place twenty
of those Haquebuzeers upon the said house, to shoot through the Planks along the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
whose shot broke thorough with as much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase as if they had been paper; insomuch,
that what with the Harquebuzeers, that from the top of the house playd along the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and what with the other who fir'd by tens against the loop-holes, the Enemy were
in such a condition, that not a man durst venture to pass to and fro on the inside of the
Curtain.</p>
            <p>We then deliver'd to every one of the three who had view'd the way up the Rock,
twenty Pioneers and three Masons, with great hammers and picks of iron, wherewith to
break some Rocks that were in the way. And thus about eight a clock in the morning
we began to work upon the way, which by two in the afternoon was brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<note place="margin">The Artillery mounted,</note> and at one of the clock in the night they began to mount the first Piece, with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Soldiers of my company I had there with me (the rest being left behind at <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callier</hi>)
which they also mounted. This Piece gave them more trouble than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three; for they were after so well acquainted with the way, that the rest came up
with much greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nsieur <hi>de Piquigny</hi> all the way carried a little Lanthorn to
light the wheels of the Carriages, by the aim of which the Enemy began to shoot, but no
shot ever toucht us. Messieurs <hi>de Caillac</hi> and <hi>de Duno</hi> were in the mean time busie behind
the Castle above, placing the Gabions, and filling them with earth; and as the Pieces
were hall'd up to the top of the Mountain, they still came to receive, and plant them in
battery: but not a man ever put a hand to the drawing up of the foresaid Canon but
my Soldiers only; for although Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> had brought one Company, and
Captain <hi>Ynard</hi> another to assist them; yet would they not accept of their service, but told
them that they needed no help, and that since they had had the honour to hale up the
first Piece, they would likewise have the advantage to bring up all the rest: Which I
was very glad of, because they were already very perfect in all the turns, and by three
of the clock in the morning all the pieces were planted ready to batter.<note place="margin">and plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Monsieur d' Aumale</hi> were by this time come from their Quarters, where I believe they
had not slept much that night. The Mareschal out of the fear he had that it was not
possible to hale the pieces up, and Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> on the other side was in no less
pain, forasmuch as after he had viewed the place, he had assur'd him that I would infallibly
mount them. The Princes and Lords, who had been at work the night before, took
their rest, till the Mareschal sent to rowse them, which was not until Captain <hi>Martin</hi>
(a Basque, who had a Company in his own Regiment) came and assur'd him that he had
seen the last piece brought up to the top of the Mountain: Which Captain <hi>Martin</hi> I do
verily believe made that night fifty journeys to and fro, for the Mareschal had sent him
almost every moment to see in what forwardness we were.</p>

the place wherewith to refresh my Soldiers: But first the Mareschal, and after him all the
Princes and Lords rob'd me of all my apples, and whilst they staid expecting the break
of day, out of an ugly pot drunk two bottles of my wine. I leave those who shall read

three pieces of Canon to be planted below, on that side by which we came, which batter'd

            <p>This (fellow Captains) ought to teach you never to trust one or two to discover a place,
and without relying on your own judgment, to call those to your assistance, whom you
conceive to be men, not of the greatest experience only, but moreover of the greatest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
for what one cannot see, another may perhaps discern. Neither must you refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to
take pains, where you discover a little difficulty in the thing, in order to the execution of
a brave exploit, and learn to be wise at your enemies expence. When you have taken up a
resolution to defend a place, take notice to smooth and cut off all the resting places that
shall happen to be in any of the avenues, for wherever Canon shall find such places to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

had undertaken to pass. The taking of this place depriv'd the Enemy of a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and vvas very convenient for us in order to the prosecution of this War.</p>

drawn to a Battail, nor hearing of any preparation he made for the assaulting of any
Town) return'd back to Court. And soon after their departure, the Mareschal by the

executing some notable enterprize.</p>
            <p>To the forementioned end we march'd with all the Army directly to <hi>St. Martin,</hi>
wherein was a Company of <hi>Italians,</hi> and where the Castle was batter'd, and taken, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

taken <hi>Sebe,</hi> wherefore so soon as the Fort of <hi>St. Martin</hi> was brought into a pretty good
condition, the Mareschal went to <hi>Quiers,</hi> that he might be nearer to Monsieur <hi>de Bassé,</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
him in time of need; for he had already received intelligence, that <hi>Don A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bro de Cendé</hi>
gathered together the Army in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (and I think <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> was at that time

to retire to <hi>Chevas,</hi> and <hi>Bourlengue,</hi> to have an eye to those places, of which also he was
Governour.</p>
            <p>Eight dayes were not past before the Mareschal sent orders to Monsieur <hi>de B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to me, that we should march in all diligence day and night directly to <hi>Montdevi,</hi> with
five or six French Companies we had at <hi>St. Martin,</hi> leaving Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> to pursue
the Fortification, which accordingly he did, marching night and day, as it was necessary
we should, for the Mareschal was engag'd in <hi>Sebe,</hi> for the relief of Monsieur <hi>de Bassé:</hi>
but when <hi>Don Arbro</hi> heard of our coming, that we had drawn another Company out
of <hi>Savillan</hi> by the way, and that he saw us arriv'd at the corner of the Town, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drew off, and having recover'd a Bridg of brick, began to pass over his Baggage;

whether Signior <hi>Ludovico de Biraga</hi> was with us, or no, I am not able to say, because vve

that had we charg'd him home horse and foot and all, we had put him very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to't, and perhaps given him a shrewd blow; for after he had past the Bridge, he was
to climb a steep mountain, where the way was so narrow, that they could only go one by
one. But he made us know that he was a very able Soldier; for he first past over all
his horse, fearing that ours would charge and overturn them upon his foot, then he past
over his <hi>Germans,</hi> and himself remain'd behind with a thousand or twelve hundred
Harquebuzeers, with which he still made good the Bridge, by the favour of three hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that stood at the end of it, vvhich vve could never gain from him, he having opened
them so, that they flanck't and defended one another.</p>
            <p>On the top of the Mountain there was a Plain that extended it self to a little Town
they held, being about the length of 1000 paces, or thereabouts, vvhere he first caus'd
his people to make a halt, and afterwards retyr'd. But at his departing from the houses,
we had thought to have fallen in amongst them, which we also attempted, and there
were in that place some men slain, both on the one side, and the other, and we continually
followed in their Rear up the forementioned narrow path, still plying them with our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz
shot; for we saw not the preparation he had made for us on the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Messieurs <hi>de Bonivet,</hi> and <hi>de la Moth Gondrin,</hi> and I were all on horse-back, and
amongst the Harquebuzeers to encourage them, when so soon as vve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gave us a charge vvith a 1000 or 1200 Harquebuzeers, vvhich sent us back vvith a rattle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Bridge, and full drive upon the Mareschal; Monsieur <hi>de la Moth's</hi> horse was
kill'd under him, and mine so hurt that he died five or six days after; and God was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
to us, in having put it into our minds, to draw our men into two divisions, on the
right and left hand of the way, though the ascent was very difficult and steep, for by that
means we lost but very few of our men, whereas had we been all clutter'd together in the
narrow path, vve had received a very great defeat, and had our selves remained upon the
place. Take notice of this (young Captains) vvhen you shall happen to be in the like
Ground, upon the like occasion; for the old and circumspect have been often snapt in
such places as these, and know well enough how to avoid them. The Mareschal then
withdrew with all his Army about <hi>Sebe,</hi> and the next day carried away the Canon, that
Messieurs <hi>de Bass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aving there three Companies, two French and one Italian, and so retired by <hi>Montdevi</hi>
towards <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Quiers.</hi> How <hi>Sebe</hi> was after lost I do not remember, but lost it was,
for we return'd a year after to recover it, vvhen it was much better defended, and longer
disputed than before, as hereafter you shall hear.</p>
            <p>Sometime after <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> set an Army on foot, by much exceeding all the forces the
Mareschal could make, he having neither Swiss nor German Foot: wherefore (being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized
by the Signeurs <hi>Ludovico de Birague,</hi> and <hi>Francisco Bernardin,</hi> that this Army
was design'd for the retaking of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> and the other Castles we had taken before;
and also to take <hi>Cassal,</hi> some seven leagues distant from <hi>Turin,</hi> and to fortifie it, to the
end that <hi>Turin</hi> might receive no relief from the mountains and valleys of <hi>Lans,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from <hi>Cassal,</hi> from whence we had most of the fruit and wood that vvas brought to
<hi>Turin</hi>) So soon as <hi>Don Ferrand</hi>'s Army was ready to march directly to <hi>St. Martin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Bris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi> calls a Council at the approach of the Spanish Army.</note> the
Mareschal call'd a Council of his Officers to deliberate vvhat he should do concerning <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,</hi>
seeing it was neither fortified nor tenable: who amongst them concluded to quit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t,
and to dismantle it, though the dismantling could signifie nothing; forasmuch as <hi>Don
Ferrand</hi> would soon have repair'd it again. I was the same night advertized at <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi>
of this determination, which was the reason that I went early the next morning to
the Mareschal to <hi>Turin,</hi> where I made bold to ask him if it were true, that he had taken a
resolution to abandon <hi>Cassal,</hi> vvho told me, that yes, because he could find no one, who
would hazard his life and reputation in putting himself into it, and that therefore they
had concluded in the Council, to put only one Company of Italian Foot into it, which
was to surrender the Town so soon as they should see <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> approach with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to attaque it. I then told him that that would signifie very little, for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himself would however tell the Soldiers as much, to make them willing to stay; but
that he must Garrison it in good earnest, and not after this manner. <hi>And who</hi> (said he)
<hi>would you have so senseless as to undertake the defence of it?</hi> to which I made answer that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105656:60"/>
I would be the man. He then told me that he had rather lose the best part of his estate,
than to suffer me to engage my self in it, considering that the place could not in a years
time be fortified to resist Canon. To which I made answer, <hi>Sir, the King does entertain, and
pay us for three things only: one to win him a Battail, to the end that he may overrun a great
space of ground, and subdue several strong holds to his obedience; another to defend a Town;
for no Town can be lost, but a great deal of ground goes along with it; and the third to take
a Town;<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Cassal.</hi>
                  </note> for the taking of a Town brings a great number of people into subjection; all the
rest are only skirmishes, and rencounters, that signifie nothing to any body but our selves, to
make us known unto, and esteemed of our Superiors, and to acquire honor to our own particular
persons; for the King has by this no advantage at all, nor by any other effect of war, saving by
the three ferementioned services; wherefore before this place shall be so quitted I will lose my
life in its defence.</hi> The Mareschal hereupon disputed it very strongly with me, to divert me
from this intention; but seeing me resolv'd, at last gave me leave to do as I would. He
was a man that would be govern'd by reason, without relying too much upon his own
judgment, as did Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec,</hi> who was ever observed to be guilty of that fault,
as I think I have said elsevvhere.</p>

the four Flankers fill'd at all, so that the Enemy having once batter'd me a Courtain by
the Canton, they might afterwards batter me in the flank. I demanded of the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
500 Pioneers of the Mountain, which he sent presently to raise, so that within
four dayes they were all at <hi>Cassal:</hi> I demanded likewise a great number of Instruments,
and iron Tools, wherewith to furnish my Soldiers also for the work, which he also sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
sent me, together with great store of grain, bacon, lead, powder, and match; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
moreover the Baron <hi>de Chipy la Gard</hi> (Nephew to the Baron <hi>de la Gard) le Mas,
Martin,</hi> and my own Company. All these five Companies were exceeding good, and
their Captains also; who having understood that I had made choice of them of my own
accord, took it for a great reputation, and a high honour to them. I demanded of him
also <hi>le Gritti</hi> a Venetian, who had a Company of Italian foot: all which were granted
to me,</p>
            <p>In the morning then I went to put my self into it, and at night all the Companies
arrived. Monsieur <hi>de Gye,</hi> eldest Son of Monsieur <hi>de Maugiron</hi> was there in Garrison
with the men at arms belonging to his Father, to whom the Mareschal sent order to
march away, and to carry his Company to <hi>Montcallier:</hi> but he writ an answer back,
that he had not continued so long in Garrison at <hi>Cassal,</hi> to abandon it at a time when a
Siege was going to be laid before it, especially when so old a Captain as I had undertaken the
defence thereof, and that therefore he was resolv'd there to live and die with me. The
Mareschal would not take this answer for currant pay; for the next day betimes in the
morning he came himself to <hi>Cassal,</hi> having Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe-Gondrin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> visits <hi>Cassal.</hi>
               </note> and the Vicount <hi>de Gourdon</hi> in company with him. I had there already as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
all the Quarters for the Foot, without dislodging the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> forasmuch
as I saw Monsieur <hi>de Gye,</hi> and all his Company obstinately resolute to stay. And although
the Mareschal himself was come in person, yet could he never prevail with Monsieur <hi>de
Gye</hi> to depart the Town, who plainly told him, that he, if he so pleased, might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his Company away from him, but for what concern'd himself, he was resolv'd
not to stir a foot; which was the reason that the Mareschal returned very much dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with himself, that he had granted me leave to take upon me the defence of that
place, which was conceived to be so desperate an undertaking, that Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe-Gondrin,</hi>
and the Vicount <hi>de Gordon</hi> wept at parting with me, and all of them gave me
over, as also did President <hi>Birague</hi> himself, who is yet living, for lost either in my life

the Mareschal and all my Companions, that they should no more come to see me, for
I would not be hindred so much as a quarter of an hour from intending my fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I moreover desired the Mareschal to send me Colo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

go and dye with him, and never to stir from his side. Whereupon <hi>l' Estanc</hi> entreated the
said Captain <hi>Montfort</hi> to stay, for it might fall out that the Mareschal would let them all
go, when he should see that one part were already gone; and to the end the Mareschal
might not be overmuch offended, that he should keep with him all those who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to stay; which being agreed betwixt them, the said <hi>Estanc</hi> fearing lest the Mareschal
should have any inkling of his design, stole away at midnight, and was followed by the
whole Company; for not a man save only two <hi>Gens d' Armes</hi> and three Archers would stay
behind with the said <hi>Montfort.</hi> They left their great horses and arms, excepting their
Cuirasses and pots, mounted themselves each upon a little Curtal only, and leaving their

by night to their Captain, and therefore begg'd his leave that he might follow after with
two men at arms, and three Archers only that were left behind, which he would by no
means permit him to do, but expresly forbad him, and made him return back to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our order in the Town was thus, that every morning generally all, as well Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Soldiers,<note place="margin">The excellent order in the City of <hi>Cassal,</hi>
               </note> and Pioneers, as men and women of the Town, came every one before
day upon pain of death to their work, which to compel them to I erected a Gallows, that
they might see what they were to trust to; and indeed I had, and have ever had so, a little
scurvey Character of being liberal of the rope, so that there was not a man great nor small
who did not fear my Gascon humour and complexion. It being then winter, and in the
shortest of days, they were to work from break of day till eleven of the clock, and then
every one went to his dinner, and at twelve return'd again to his work, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
never left till it grew to be dark. As for their dinner, every one din'd of himself:
but the supper was alwayes at my Quarters; or at those of Monsieur <hi>de Gye,</hi> or at one or
another of the Captains, every one in his turn. To which place constantly there repair'd
all the Engineers and Commanders of the work, where if any one had not advanc't his
work so much as another, I assign'd him either Soldiers or Pioneers, that by the next
night his work might be as forward as his neighbours. Now my business was to run up
and down every where on horseback, one while to the Fortifications, then to those who
were sawing the plancks at the Mill, of which I made a great many half a foot thick, and
other posts and beams of timber, that were very necessary for us. The water of this Mill
did us great good service, for by means of that the Saw never rested; and the most part
of the night I went by torch-light quite through the Town; one while I went out to the
place where they digg'd the Turf, another while where they made the Gabions, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into the Town, and went the round within: afterwards I went out again to view
all the places, and never rested in a place, excepting at dinner, no more than the meanest
Soldier in the Town, encouraging in the mean time all people to work, and caressing all
both small and great.</p>
            <p>I there learned what it is to take a business in hand where all people generally concur
to the bringing a thing to pass, as also what a mass of people, ambitious to acquire honour
in the place they have undertaken to defend, may do; and moreover that there is great
praise to be obtain'd in so well ordering of things, and disposing of time, that not so much
as a quarter of an hour shall be spent in vain; and indeed a Commander shall never do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing worthy speaking of, if they be not all of one mind, and have not equally a desire
to come off from the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>terprize in hand, with great honour and reputation, as it was in
this place. This (Captains) is a thing that principally depends upon you, if you have
once got the knack to vvin the Soldier by a word, you shall do more than with a thousand
Bastinadoes; it is true, that if there be some mutinous stubborn spirit amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gst them,
vvhich gentle ways cannot reclaim, you are to make others wise at his expence. But I
will return to Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur <hi>de Gye,</hi> who never stirr'd from the Gate with his <hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi>
till it was fully and sufficiently terrassed both within and without, who there all of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105656:61"/>
them wrought as hard as the meanest common Soldier in the Town.</p>
            <p>Oh (Captains) vvhat a beautiful exemple you have here, if you please to observe it,
when an occasion shall present it self, to undertake the defence of a place! I will moreover
say that I had taken such order, that there was not a morsel of bread eaten, nor a glass of
wine drunk, but by weight and measure; and if you will take exemple by <hi>Cassal,</hi> you shall
not only be able to undertake the keeping of a Town, let it be as ill fortified as it will;
but even a Meadow enclos'd vvith no more than a contemptible ditch only, provided
there be unanimity amongst you, as there was here: for we had all one vvill, one desire,
and one courage, and the labour vvas a common delight to us all.</p>
            <p>Now my good fortune was such, that <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> gave to <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> the one half
of his Army, almost all his Infantry, vvith a part of his horse, to lead them to <hi>Riverol</hi>
seven little miles from <hi>Cassal, Vlpian</hi> being between; and the said <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> staid
two and twenty days about the taking of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> and the other Castles. During
this time I had by my great diligence put the Town into a good posture of defence, and
had caused great Trenches and Rampiers to be made behind all our Cantons, vvell ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

vvell resolv'd to cause our selves to be soundly battered, and get a brave share of honour.
At last <hi>Caesar</hi> having taken <hi>St. Martin,</hi> and the other Castles, arriv'd at <hi>Riverol</hi> vvith his

to attaque us, or to let us alone, considering the time I had had vvherein to fortifie my
self, and that I had finisht all the fortification I intended to make for my defence;
vvhere also he forgot not to put them in mind, that vve vvere six Companies vvithin, all
resolute to fight it out to the last; and that he doubted he should lose more valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,

               </note> The Spanish and Italian Captains, vvho

Camp master to be remonstrated, that the Emperor had there the best Officers he had in
all <hi>Italy,</hi> and of vvhom he made greater account than of all the rest, and that therefore
they entreated <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> to reserve them for a Battail, or some Enterprize of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
moment, and not to expose them for the gaining of so trivial a place as that of
<hi>Cassal.</hi> There followed therupon a great dispute, and three days the Council were in
debate about this very business. <hi>Caesar de Naples,</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Vlpian</hi> obstinately
maintain'd, that they ought to assault us; but the Spanish Soldiers who understood what
<hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> had said, plainly told their Captains, that they might then go on to the
assault with the Italians, if they so pleased, for as for them they would have nothing to
do in the business, being resolv'd to stand to what by their Camp-master had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
All these disputes came to the Mareschal's knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> was risen

had notice of the surprize (for our people entred at eleven of the clock in the night) who

a Drum of Captain <hi>Gritti,</hi> to whom having shewed the Mareschals Letter, I gave
him charge to tell the Governor of <hi>Ulpian,</hi> that <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> could not better revenge
himself for the loss of <hi>Alba,</hi> than to come and attaque us at <hi>Cassal.</hi> So soon as the Drum
came to the Gates of <hi>Vlpian</hi> he found that the Governor was gone by break of day to the
Council to <hi>Riverol,</hi> and therefore told the Soldiers at the Gate of the taking of <hi>Alba,</hi> at
which they were so incens'd, that they would thereupon have kill'd him, and in order
thereunto began to pinion and bind him; but the Governor in the interim arrived, to
whom I sent word, that he should restore me my Trumpet, considering that we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made fair war, and that he should take heed of beginning to shew foul play; for
our people also had given good quarter at <hi>Alba.</hi> The said Governor then took the Drum
from the Soldiers, and carried him to his lodging, where he told him, that if what he
had said concerning <hi>Alba</hi> did not prove to be true, he would hang him; to which the
Drum reply'd, that provided he would give him but a Teston, if it was true, he would
be content to be hang'd if it prov'd otherwise. Whereupon the Governor return'd to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105656:61"/>
horse, and went again to <hi>Riverol,</hi> where they continued all night in Council, to consider
whether this news could be true, or no: but the next day arriv'd the Captain of the Castle
of <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> who brought them certain intelligence from the Governor of <hi>Ast,</hi> that <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
was certainly taken; which was the reason that the next morning <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> departed
in all hast, and went to pass the River at the Bridg of <hi>Asture,</hi> to go directly to the said
<hi>Alba</hi> to try if he could not recover it before the Mareschal could have leisure to better
fortifie the place.</p>
            <p>So soon as I saw my self delivered from all apprehension of a Siege, I immediately sent
away my Pioneers to the said <hi>Alba,</hi> who at that time stood the Mareschal in very great
stead. I did not there stay for a Command, and it is often necessary to do before we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
provided there be no hazard in the case. Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet,</hi> and <hi>Santo Pedro
Corzo,</hi> with seven Ensig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es put themselves into it. Now of <hi>Don Ferrand</hi>'s arrival at the
Bridge at <hi>Asture,</hi> and of his passing over the River there, Monsieur <hi>de Salvazon</hi> who was
Governor of <hi>Berüe</hi> gave me speedy notice.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> sends succours to <hi>Alba.</hi>
               </note> I therefore sodainly sent away the Baron of
<hi>Chipy, la Garde,</hi> and <hi>le Mas,</hi> who were the next morning by break of day at <hi>Alba,</hi> of
whose coming the Mareschal was exceeding glad, as also was Monsieur de <hi>Bonnivet,</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they came from a place where they had undergone extraordinary labour in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,
hoping that these would shew others the way, as they also did. Monsieur <hi>de Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giron</hi>
would remain at <hi>Cassal,</hi> because it was a very commodious quarter for horse; I
there left Captain <hi>Martin</hi> with him, and sent <hi>le Gritti</hi> to his Garrison, and Colonel <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond,</hi> and I went to wait upon the Mareschal at <hi>Turin,</hi> who was then but newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from <hi>Alba,</hi> and my Company went back to <hi>Montcallier.</hi> If I was welcome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
no to the Mareschal, or whether caress'd by President <hi>Birague,</hi> and the whole Court of
Parliament after such a service, I leave every one to judge.</p>
            <p>When (Captains) therefore from any undertaking great profit and commodity may
accrue, as there did from this (considering that <hi>Turin,</hi> had <hi>Cassal</hi> been possest by the
Enemy, would have suffer'd a mighty inconvenience) do not stick boldly to hazard your
persons for the defence of any place whatsoever. And when you shall be there, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
after what manner, and with what diligence I carried on my work; for by that
means you shall make your Enemy afraid to attaque you. He is more afraid to affault,
than you are to defend. He meditates and considers who are within, and that he has to
do with men that know how to fortifie themselves, which is no little advantage to a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
It is true that <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> committed a great error in squandring away so much
time about those paltry Forts, and in the mean time giving us so much leisure to fortifie;
for had he come directly to us at first, he would have put us to our Trumps: but I think
he was afraid. My good fortune also would have it, that <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> should divide his
Forces, who had he come to attaque us at the beginning, would have been the death of
a great many good men; but we should have sold our skins very dear.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> was at <hi>Ast,</hi> in his way towards <hi>Alba,</hi> he there met intelligence
that Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> was very strong within it, and that lately three Compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies
were entred into the Town of those that I had at <hi>Cassal,</hi> together with a great number of
Pioneers, which made him enter into a very great debate, whether or no he should go
to <hi>Alba,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Delays and negligence ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial affairs.</note> as he did before at <hi>Riverol</hi> whether or no he should go to <hi>Cassal.</hi> After five
or six days then he departed from <hi>Ast</hi> with all his Cavalry to go take a view of <hi>Alba,</hi>
where, after he had spent a whole day in discovering the place, he went to sit down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>St. Damian,</hi> having been told, that the Mareschal had taken thence almost all the
amunition of powder, bulle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and match, to put into <hi>Alba,</hi> and had given order to some
one to lay in as much more; but oftentimes the sloth and negligence of men intrusted
with the care of affairs occasion very signal disadvantages; I never saw man that was slow
about his business, idle or negligent in war, that ever perform'd any great matters; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed is there any thing in the world, wherein diligence is so much required. A day,
an hour, may a minute is enough to make the bravest enterprizes vanish into air.</p>
            <p>Now the Mareschal conceived that <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> was more likely to put himself into
<hi>Carmagnolle</hi> to fortifie the Town, and to take the Castle, than to make any attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other place, believing <hi>St. Damian</hi> to be replenisht with powder, and therefore
came himself thither to take order for the security of that Fort, where Monsieur <hi>de Bass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

relieve them with powder, bullet, and match for the Harquebuzeers, they having not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that which he had promised, and taken order for; at which the Mareschal was the
most highly concern'd imaginable, and immediately sent thither six loads of powder, and
four of bullet, with a proportionable quantity of match, sending order to the Governor
of <hi>la Cisterne</hi> (a Fort two little miles distant from <hi>St. Damian)</hi> who had three Conpanies
of Italians in Garrison with him, that he should by all means venture that night to put
those ammunitions into the Town. Monsieur <hi>de Bassé,</hi> and I had already heard that the
Camp was set down before <hi>St. Damian</hi> by the same Massenger that carried the news to
the Mareschal, he being of necessity to pass by, <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> as also did this ammunition,
three or four hours after, which was in the close of the Evening. Monsieur <hi>de Bassé</hi> and
I exhorted him who had the conduct of the Ammunition to remonstrate to the Captains,
that the powder must of necessity he put into the Town that very night; for otherwise it
could not be possibly convey'd into it; and that he who undertook the conduct of it, was
likewise to enter in himself: but we found the fellow so cold in the business, that we
very well perceiv'd he would do no good: It is very easie to discover by a mass counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
if he be afraid or no, and whether he have the heart to execute what he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken;<note place="margin">A mans cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is to be known by his countenance.</note> and we saw so much by this fellow, that we were rather afraid he should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
the Captains when he came to <hi>la Cisterne,</hi> than any wayes encourage them to
the Enterprize enjoyn'd; which made me, resolve to go my self, to try by this relief to
save the place, and Monsieur <hi>de Bassé</hi> would that Monsieur <hi>de Classe</hi> his eldest Son, with
ten men at arms, he being Lieutenant of his own Company, should go along with
me,</p>
            <p>At one of the clock at night then we departed, and by eleven the next day came to
<hi>la Cistrene,</hi> where I found the Governor and his Captains in a great perplexity, forming
a great many difficulties about the conduct of the Ammunition, and which way it was
possible to be convey'd into the Town; and in truth they had some reason so to do;
For <hi>St. Damian</hi> is a little place, and <hi>Don Ferrand</hi> had in his Camp 6000 Germans, 6000
Italians,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uc</hi> undertakes to relieve <hi>St. Damian.</hi>
               </note> and 4000 Spaniards, 1200 Light-horse, and 400 men at arms, and all these were
encampt close by the Town, about which the Court of Guards in a manner toucht one
another, so that to carry it into the Town upon the horses that had brought it to <hi>la Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne</hi>
had been impossible, for it was a snow knee deep, and all the wayes were full of
Soldiers Huts. But I presently caused a great many Sacks to be brought me, and made
them to be cut each Sack into three parts, which by certain women, who were ready for
the purpose, were handsomely sowed together again, and into these bags I put the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I then got together thirty Countrey fellows, upon whom I caused the powder and
bullet to be tyed, with the match at their Girdles, and gave to each of them a good
staffe in his hand to support him. Monsieur <hi>de Briquemant,</hi> the Governor of <hi>St. Damian,</hi>
had sent six Swiss of his Guard out of the Town, who could not get in again, and so hapned
to be at <hi>la Cisterne,</hi> who also took their share of the Ammunition.</p>
            <p>Being then ready to set out, there arrived the Seigneurs <hi>de Pied-de-fou,</hi> and <hi>de Bourry</hi>
(who I am told is sinceturn'd Hugonot) <hi>de St. Romain</hi> (Nephew to Monsieur <hi>de Fayette</hi>)
and three or four Gentlemen more, who were going to put themselves into the Town,
and slighting put themselves on foot, and sent back their horses. The Mareschal had
writ to two of the Captains, who were at <hi>la Cisterne,</hi> that they should attempt to put the

I had no great hopes of their doing any thing to purpose; for whoever would execute a
hazardous enterprize, and where there is like to be good store of blows, must of all things
take heed of employing an old Captain and an old Soldier, for as much as they too well
understand the peril, and too much apprehend the danger of death, so that you shall sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
have any good account of their undertaking, as I have found by experience both
in this, and upon other occasions: whereas a young fellow is not so apprehensive of his
danger (it is true that there ought to be conduct in the case) and will easily undertake
any execution where diligence is required; he is prompt and active, and his youthful

               <hi>This valiant young man, full of spirit, and good inclination to the service, needed not
to be intreated twice, but immediately came away with his fifty men, and about an
hour after midnight came to</hi> la Cisterne, <hi>where I had in Cellar prepar'd three or four
good Charcole fires, and a long Table full of meat, having lockt up the Country fellows
on the one side, whom whilst the Soldiers drank and made good cheer, I caused to be
loaden, together with the Swiss; and would no more speak to the Italian Captains to
go with Captain</hi> Charry, <hi>save only that I encreated one of them to lend me his Ensign

I took him then aside, and said to him,</hi> Pedro Antonio, I will do thee more honor than thy
Captain; thou hast seen what a fault thy Countrymen last night committed, in not striving
to enter into the Town, from whence you all return'd with a company of pitiful excuses.
For my part I am a man that take no excuse in payment, where the loss of a Town, and
the men of honour within it, are in concern. I know thou hast courage enough, but thou art
not wise; and if thou wilt now give a testimony of thy discretion, as thou hast at other times
done of thy valour, I do engage to thee my word to make the Mareschal give thee a

<hi>And indeed he kept his promise with me, and carried himself very discreetly
in the action. The Captains gave him whatever he desired, being glad themselves to be
rid of the employment; I also entreated</hi> Pied-de-fou, <hi>and the rest before named, that
since they were resolv'd to put themselves into the Town, they were to do it so as to be
assisting to the conservation of the place, and not to lose themselves together with all
those who were within it; forasmuch as the preservation of the said Town consisted only
in supplying it with ammunition, and that therefore it would be necessary that they
should divide themselves, some into the Flancks, and others into the rear, to the end that
whilst Capta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> Charry <hi>should be fighting, they might encourage</hi> Pedro Antonlo<hi>'s men to
go on; which they accordingly did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All of them therefore having received their instructions from me what every one was
to do, as well Italians and Peasants, as my own Soldiers; they all in the order prescrib'd,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105656:63"/>
marcht out of the Town; when going out at the Gate, I told Captain <hi>Charry</hi> in the
hearing of all my Soldiers, that I would never see him more, it they did not enter, or die
upon the place, as many as were of my Company; to which he made answer, that he
only desir'd me to go to my rest, and that I should presently hear news of him. In truth
he was a Soldier without fear. In his Company there was a Corporal of mine called <hi>le
Turk,</hi> a Picard by birth, who said to me, <hi>What do you make a question of our entring into
the Town? Par la mort <unclear>bien</unclear>, we should have spent our time and our blood very well, having
above an hundred times fought with you, and ever remain'd victorious, if we should now stand
suspected to you;</hi> at which I leapt about his neck, and said to him these words. <hi>My Turk,
I do assure thee upon my faith, I think so worthily of you all, that I am confident if any men
upon earth can enter, you will do it;</hi> and so they departed, and I went to place my self
again upon the Platform, where I had stood the night before, and the Captain of the
Watch kept me company.</p>
            <p>About two hours after I heard a great alarm on that side by which our people were
to enter,<note place="margin">Relief put into <hi>St. Damian.</hi>
               </note> and several volleys of Harquebuzshot: but they continued but a very little
while, which put me into some fear that our men might be repulsed, or at least that
that the Peasants were run away: who so soon as they were come to the enainence where
the Italian Captains had told, them, that a Cat could not get in, they made a halt.
There the Guides shewed them the Courts of Guard, from which, by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
cold and the snow, the Centinels were not twenty paces distant. Capatin <hi>Charry</hi>
then called Messieurs <hi>de Pied de-fou, Bourg, St. Romain,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Antonio,</hi> to whom he
deliver'd two Guides, reserving one for himself, and said to them, this is the last Court
of Guard of foot, for the rest are all horse, which can do no great matters by reason of
the snow; so soon therefore as you shall see me attaque this Court of Guard, run on as fast
as you can, and <unclear>stop</unclear> not for any thing you shall meet in your way, but make directly
to the Gate of the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, who thereupon all of one accord see themselves in a posture to
charge through. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> then drew near to the Court of Guard, which he put
to rout, and overturn'd upon another Court of Guard, and both of them betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to flight; which being done he past on forward straight to the Gate of the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where he found <hi>Pedro <unclear>Antonio</unclear>
               </hi> already arrived, and where they immediately delivered
their Ammunition, without making any longer stay than whilst Messieurs <hi>de Chavigny</hi>

               </gap>mbrac't Captain <hi>Charry</hi> entreating him to tell me, that since I was at
<hi>la Cisterne,</hi> they thought themselves certain to be reliev'd with all things they should
stand in need of, and that it would be very necessary to send them in some more Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition:
but whilst the Enemy busied themselves about taking th<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> hers of the
Guards that were run away (of which a Captain was the next day hang'd) Captain
<hi>Charry</hi> and <hi>Pedro Antonio,</hi> with their Peasants, taking them in this disorder, charg'd them
thorough and thorough, and came clear away. I there lost not so much as one Soldier,
either French or Italian, neither was there any one hurt, not so much as Peasant, but
all arrived safe at <hi>la Cisterne,</hi> it being fair broad day, where they found me still upon
the Platform. I hereupon immediately sent away a dispatch to the Mareschal to entreat
him to send me some more powder, for bullet and match they had enough already,
which he also speedily did from <hi>Quiers:</hi> to which place he was remov'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he might
be nearer to me.</p>
            <p>Behold the age a Captain ought to be of, to whom you should entrust the execution
of a hazardous and sudden enterprize, and I can affirm with truth, that these hundred
years there has not died a braver, nor a more prudent Captain for his years than Captain
<hi>Charry</hi> was, and am assur'd,<note place="margin">The Character of Captain <hi>Charry.</hi>
               </note> that Monsieur <hi>de Briquemaut</hi> will say the same, though he
be of the Religion of those by whom he was since assassinated at <hi>Paris.</hi> The manner of
his death I have nothing to do to meddle withall; for the King, the Queen, and all the
Princes of the Court, knew it well enough, and besides it was so foul an act, that I will
not blot my Paper with the relation, and I am sure very unworthy a Frenchman. When
I lost him, together with Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> my Son, who was slain at the Island of
<hi>Madera,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> it seemed to me that my two arms were
lopt offf from my body, the one being my right, and the other my left. He had ever
bred up Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> from the age of twelve or thirteen years, and vvherever he
vvent had this young boy evermore hung at his Girdle: Neither could I have put him
to a better Tutor,<note place="margin">The Character of Captain <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> to teach him the trade of War: and in truth he had retein'd a great
deal of his precept, insomuch that I may vvithout shame say (although he vvas my Son)
that had he liv'd he vvould have made a great Soldier, daring, and discreet; but God
vvas pleased to dispose otherwise of him. I shall therefore leave this discourse (vvhich
extracts tears from mine eyes) to pursue my former subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:105656:63"/>Monsieur <hi>de Briquemant</hi> sent me word by Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> that they had no Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
within, nor any one that understood where a Gabion was fifty to be placed, with
which he desired me to acquaint the Mareschal, entreating me moreover to send back to
him Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> and my fifty Soldiers, whom he esteemed as much as the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
he had in the Town, in return of which kindness he would be my servant for ever;
which I did. Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> that now is, was at that time one of my Company, and
one of the fifty, though he was then but 17 years of age, it being in the beginning of his
arms. The Mareschal therefore sent away post to <hi>Alba</hi> for the Engineers that were
there, of which the Chevelier <hi>Reloge</hi> was one. So soon as Captain <hi>Charry</hi> returned back
from <hi>St. Damlan,</hi> the Pikes took the Powder, and hung it at their own Girdles, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had done before, and would have no convoy at all, but took their way a little on
the right hand on that side where the horse lay, where they charg'd through, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the loss of one man got safe into the Town; for Captain <hi>Charry</hi> was a man that
understood his business very well. So soon as he was got in, he entreated Messieurs <hi>de
Briquemaut,</hi> and <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> to entrust him with the defence of the Ditch, which they
immediately did, and he there covered himself with loggs of timber, planks, and Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
after the best manner he could, and so soon as ever the Guides returned back to me,
I sent away to the Mareschal to give him an account of all, beseeching him to send me
Captain <hi>Caupenne</hi> my Lieutenant, with another fifty of my Soldiers, which he did,
whom two days after his arrival I made venture to carry some more powder to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.
He went on that side where the <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> lay, where the Enemy had now
placed a Court of Guard of foot, who were aware of him at distance enough,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all they could to stop his way: which notwithstanding he made shift to lay down the
powder upon the edge of the ditch of the Gate, and by him the forenam'd Seigneurs
sent me their service, withall desiring me to assure the Mareschall, that the place was no
more in danger of being lost, forasmuch as they now had every thing they needed or
desired. The Baron <hi>de Chipy</hi> who was with Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> at <hi>Alba,</hi> would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
try to put some powder into the Town, by that side towards the said <hi>Alba,</hi> and
accordingly charg'd after the same manner that mine had done:<note place="margin">The Baron <hi>de Chipy</hi> enter into <hi>S. Damian.</hi>
               </note> but he lost his powder,
and Peasants, and almost all his Soldiers, at least to fourteen or fifteen only who charg'd
thorough with him, and got into the Town. <hi>There is luck in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Camp lay sixteen or seventeen dayes before the Town, and the Battery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for seven dayes, in which time <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> had wrought two Mines which
were carried on under the Ditch towards the Breach, and were already brought up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to the wall. A Pioneer running away from the Enemy was taken by our Italians,
who told me all, and whom so soon as it grew to be dark I deliver'd to Captain <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
(who was at that time my Serjeant,<note place="margin">The Mines at <hi>St. Damian</hi> discover'd.</note> and in this last war Serjeant Major to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Montferrand at Bourdeaux</hi>) who bound him, and would take no more but one
Soldier only to guide him, with which he carried the business so well, that he met but
two Centinels by the way, who also sodainly retyr'd to their Court of Guard, insomuch
that he past without any difficulty at all, and carried the Pioneer into the Town, where
he remained all night, and so soon as it was fair light day, Messieurs <hi>de Cavigny,</hi> and <hi>de
Briquemaut,</hi> carried him upon the wall of the Battery, from whence he might discover
the place where the Mine lay. They then presently descended into the Ditch, and began
to dig and scrape, so that they presently found the holes, and as we after understood,
must but very little of trapping <hi>Caesar de Naples</hi> there, who was come thither to view the
Mine. Now the two last dayes they made a very great Battery, and <hi>Don F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

caused a great number of Bavins to be made, which by the Spaniards, Italians, and
Germans were thrown into the Ditch, having cut the Counterscarp in two or three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but as many as they threw in, Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> who lay in the Ditch, conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town through a hole they had made under the breach, so that thinking the said
Ditch to be fill'd, they sent to discover in open day, being all drawn up in Battalia, ready
to go on to the Assault: but they found all was gone, and not a Fagot left in the Ditch,
which made them ply the Battery for two days with wonderful fury, and moreover part
of the night by the light of the Moon; when after all, seeing the good countenance of our
people within, and that neither their Mines, nor their Bavins had done them any good,
they resolv'd at last not to attempt an assault, but to raise the Siege and depart. The last
night that they gave over the Battery I made Captain <hi>Mauries</hi> again venture into the
Town, who heard the rising of the Camp, and the drawing off the Artiller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

done after. I had seen Messieurs <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> and <hi>de Briquemaut,</hi> I returned back
to <hi>la Cisterne,</hi> and the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Mareschal, and all those who were with him, as any man in the world could be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Which said Mareschal presently dispatcht away Monsieur <hi>de Biron</hi> to the King, to carry
his Majesty news of the issue of this Siege, entreating of him the place of a Bedchamber
man for me; and moreover at my great instance and importunity (and being I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
tormented with my hip) was pleased to discharge me of my Office of Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
though it was a request very unpleasing to him: but to gratifie me in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I would ask of him, he was willing to content me in that particular. And the said
Seigneur <hi>de Biron</hi> being at Court, the King would not transfer to any one the said Office
of Camp-master, till first he should be better enformed whom he ought to give it to: and
therefore ordered that the Mareschal should name one, Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> another, and
I a third: I therefore nominated Monsieur <hi>de Chipy,</hi> which was the reason that the said
Sicur <hi>de Biron</hi> continued very long at Court, because of the dispatches to and again, that
he was enforc't to make, during which I still continued Camp-master, till the return of
the said Seigneur <hi>de Biron</hi> (who at that time carried the Mareschal's Guidon) who
brought me my discharge,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> quits his office of Camp-master.</note> his Majesty having transferred that command to the Baron <hi>de
Chipy,</hi> whom I had nam'd, and also brought me the place of Gentleman of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Bedchamber, for he would not depart till he had first seen me inroll'd in the
room of one of the old ones that was vacant, and moreover brought me a Patent for
the Government of <hi>Alha,</hi> which I never dream't of, and less imagin'd, that the King
should prefer me to three or four others, in whose behalf the Mareschal had written to
him. Behold the services I perform'd for the King, and the Mareschal his Lieutenant,
all within fifteen or twenty dayes of one another.</p>
            <p>Happy (fellows in arms) is he who serves his King under a General who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the merits of such as perform any remarkable exploit, which Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi>
would never do: for never did any man under his command do any handsome thing,
or any the least action which he thought worthy his Majesties knowledge, but he did
forthwith give him notice of it: he was a Gentleman that would not cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the spoils of another man's honor, nor conceal the bravery of any from the
greatest to the least. When therefore it shall please God that you are employ'd under
such a General, fear not to hazard your lives, and employ all your vigilance and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to do them the best service you can, if you have an intention to advance yourselves
by your arms and virtue, if not, get you home, and never meddle with the practice of
Arms. 'Tis an extreme grief and disappointment to a man, when he shall have exposed
his life for the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from whom we are to expect the reward of our fidelity and valour. There is no these

comparable to that of robbing another man of his honor, and yet Generals for the most
part make no conscience of it.</p>
            <p>During the time that Monsieur <hi>de Biron</hi> remained at Court, I still continuing Camp-master,

was at this time with the Army, and they came to set down their Camp within a mile
of <hi>Benne,</hi> upon the Banks of a River that was there, of which they so turned the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that not so much as one drop came into the Town. Now, by ill fortune, the
Mareschal had ordered a Governor (whose name I shall forbear) to cause twelve h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sacks of corn and meal, half of the one, and half of the other, to be brought into
this place from his own Government, as the custom had been. I will no publish the
occasion why the said Governor did not accordingly send in the said provisions, being it
would too nearly reflect upon thin honor, and it is not my purpose to speak ill of any:
But <hi>President Birague</hi> knows the reasons very well, he being present at the Council, when
the Mareschal was pleased to send for me, and where there was a very great clutter, and
high dispute about that affair. The Enemies Camp had already been eight days set
down before <hi>Benne,</hi> and made no shew of any intention to assault it, hoping they should
soon have it for want of victuals, although the Town was of it self sufficiently forti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that the Count and the Countess were very affectionate to the Kings service. There
was in all but three Companies of foot within it, to wit, that of the Count, that of the
younger <hi>la Molle,</hi> and of <hi>Louys</hi> Duke, which was that of <hi>Montdevi,</hi> making in all two
Companies of Italians, and one of French. The said Captain <hi>la Molle</hi> was sick, and by
order of his Physitians for change of ayr, had caused himself to be carried to <hi>Montdevi;</hi>
so that the Count had no man of Command with him, but the said <hi>Louys Duke,</hi> and

their ears, and see a mighty preparation against them, if they have not been at
such work before: and on the other side he saw himself totally without provisions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that he resolved to send the Mareschal word of all, and of the fear he was in,
the place would be lost; as he had just reason, it being that where his chiefest interest lay,
the Town being his own. He therefore presently dispatched away the Lieutenant to the
Company of <hi>Montdevi,</hi> who arriv'd just as the Mareschal rose from dinner, he being
then at <hi>Carmagnolle,</hi> and with him M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssieurs <hi>de Bonivet,</hi> President <hi>Birague, d' Aussun,
Francisco Bernardin, la Moth-Gondrin,</hi> and some other whose names I have forgot. So
soons, and that the Governor (whose name I have omitted) had not sent any in accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his order, though he had still pretended to have done it, both he and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
entred into a very great dispair, and concluded the place for lost, being the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
had no visible way to relieve it, forasmuch as he had not men to resist the third part
of the Enemy's Army. He then demanded of the Lieutenant what Captain he desir'd
to have come to him to assist him, to which he made answer, that the Count lov'd me
exceeding well, and often said, that I had once reliev'd him, and that he would give
the one half of his estate, upon condition that I was with him. I was then but newly
recover'd of a Feaver, with which my mouth and lips were much swell'd and broken out.
The Mareschal then sent for me by his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to come presently to his lodging,<note place="margin">The Count <hi>de Benne</hi> demands the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> to be sent to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</note>
where I found him in this trouble. He there made the Lieutenant to give me an account
of the extremity they were in in <hi>Benne,</hi> as he did, and moreover complaining of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
by whom they had been so deceiv'd, earnestly entreated me to go and put my self
into the Towr. To which I made answer, <hi>What would you have me do, there being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corn nor meal? I can work no miracles;</hi> to which he return'd, that the Count had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> high an opinion of me, as also all those in the Town, that If I could once get in, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105656:65"/>
were very confident the place would not be lost, but that I would find some expedient to
save it.</p>
            <p>Every one knows how these great Lords, when they would make one undertake an impossible thing, can wheedle and flatter a man into a good opinion of himself, and
accordingly they here represented to me the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mples of <hi>Lans, St. Damian,</hi> and other
places where I had had to do, and had ever been so fortunate, as that all things had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to my own desire. The President <hi>Birague</hi> then began to perswade me
on the other side, but Monsieur <hi>de Bonivet</hi> and the rest said nothing, knowing very
well how dangerous an Enterprise it was for the loss of my honor, and that I must in
the end of necessity come to a Capitulation; as the Mareschal himself also told me, that
for the last refuge I must proceed to that; to which I made answer, that I had rather
die, <hi>than that my name should be found upon record subscribed to a Capitulation, or that any
place should be surrendred I had once taken upon me to defend; but that I would do as God
should direct me, in whose assistance I reposed my only confidence and trust.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
Bonivet</hi> then commanded twelve or fifteen Gentlemen of his to go along with me, (of
which number the Governor <hi>de la Moth Rouge,</hi> who is yet living was one, and I took
as many of my own, making up thirty horse, without taking any servant with me, save
only a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> and a Cook) and writ to the Vicount <hi>de Gordon</hi> at Savillan, to
furnish me with a good Guide, and to Captain <hi>Theodore Bedeigne,</hi> that he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy

               </note> and this was upon the Saturday. Upon Sunday morning by
break of day I entred into <hi>Benne,</hi> and the Count, if he be yet living, and will speak his
conscience, will say that it was one of the greatest joys that ever he had in his whole life,
as also the Countess, and the whole Town will witness the same. I presently laid me
down to sleep in the Castle, and two hours after I awak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we went to dinner. The Count
in the mean time had appointed all the head men of the Town, as also all the Masons and Carpenters to repair to the Town-Hall, to which place the Count, the Countess,
and all of us likewise came.</p>
            <p>I there proposed all that was necessary to be done, the Count complain'd of the little
corn he had,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Benne</hi> unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</note> and the Towns-men declar'd, that they had not sufficient for eight days;
so that although the Town was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cituated advantagiously enough, yet were they in a very
great necessity, by reason it was the latter end of the year, and on the other side they had
sold all their corn to the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> and to those about <hi>Savona,</hi> being tempted so to do by
the rates they gave, it being at that time sold for three Crowns a sack: and the Count who was a man that liv'd at a very great expence, had sold all his in expectation, and up|
on the assurance of the 1200 sacks vvhich the Governor, that I forbear to name, ought to
have sent in thither. We then fell to disputing in case we had corn, vvhich way we
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> get it ground: But so soon as the Count had told me whereabouts the Camp

               </gap> presently conceiv'd that I should make a shift to get corn, though I would not say
any thing to any one, till after we were return'd from the Council, then I told it to the
Count and the Countess only. Whilest vve were sitting in Council there was a little
man a Mason of above threescore years of age, who presented himself before us, saying
that he had formerly got several great stones to lay upon the Graves of the dead, from
a Quarry that be nam'd hard by, and that he conceiv'd if those stones were taken off the
Graves, they would some of them at least, if not all, be proper to make Mill-stones:
whereupon we deputed two of the Town, together vvith the Countess, vvho would needs
go along vvith them, to make tryal vvith the Masons, vvhether they could be of any
use or no: and not long after the said Lady return'd with great joy, and offer'd her self
to take the pains to cause the Mill-stones to be made;<note place="margin">The Countess of <hi>Benne</hi> her self takes care to see the work of the Town go forward.</note> vvhich at the first I vvould by no

the Soldiers, provided there might be a vvay found to get corn. We then concluded
vvith those of the Town, that at one of the clock at night they should bring me five or
six hundred men and women, the one carrying little ropes, and the others Scythes and
Sides to cut the corn, and that the Gates of the Town, should in the mean time be kept
shut, to the end that no body might go out to carry intelligence to the Enemy; for
Monsieur <hi>de Trinitat</hi> had several friends in the City, that the Count himself had in some

twenty years old. We then went home expecting the night, when being return'd
back to the Castle, I told the Count, that it would be convenient we should go alone
upon the walls to look out a field of corn that should be neerest to the City, which we
were to cut all that night, whilst I sent out Captain <hi>Theodore</hi> with 200 Soldiers to give
a strong and furious alarm to the Court of Guard, who were set to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inder those of
the Town from cutting any Corn. So soon then as we had made choice of one, we
return'd back to supper, and after we had supp'd, carried out Captain <hi>Theodore</hi> and two
others, Commanders of Companies, that were there present upon the Wall of the Town,
to shew them on which side they were to give the alarm, and the others to fight the
Court of Guard. After which we appointed ten of the Townsmen on horse-back to
overlook the people that cut the corn, to hasten them in their work.</p>
            <p>At one of the clock at night all these people went out, the Soldiers to fight,<note place="margin">Great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the people</note> and the
people to cut; so that nothing was to be heard all night long but alarms, as well in the
Camp, as at the Court of Guard, and as the people cut and bound up the corn, they
still ran back to the Gate of the City, and there threw down their burthens, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
went again for more; for some were appointed to reap, and the rest to bind
and carry. In the mean time the day appear'd, vvhen we caused those to vvhom the

thereupon stronger Guards, and neerer than before; but the people vvho began to taste
the sweetness of their gain, resolv'd to hazard themselves to get their corn off the ground,
rather than the Enemy should have it; insomuch that at the beginning of the night
there sallyed out above two hundred of the Inhabitants of the Town, of vvhich some ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd

and having taken upon him his command of Camp-master, I went to <hi>Alba</hi> to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of my new Government.</p>
            <p>Oh Captains, the great things that a man may do, how little soever his judgment or
experience may be, if he will intend nothing but that wherein he is immediately engag'd
thence to come off to his own honor, and the advantage of his Master! and on the other
side nothing but misfortune can attend him, who minds nothing of business, and only
spends his time in pleasure, play, and feasting; for it is impossible but that the one must
make you forget the other; we cannot serve so many Masters: whenever then you shall
be engag'd upon such an account as this, strip your selves of all your vices, and burn them
all, to the end that you may remain in the white Robe of loyalty and affection that we
all owe to our common Master: for God will never prosper the vitious and voluptuous
man; but on the contrary will ever assist him who is clad in the white Robe of loyalty.
I give you the same advice that I ever gave my self, and it was therefore that God has
ever assisted and been so favourable to me, that I have never been defeated, and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been in any engagement (if I commanded) that I was not alwayes victorious. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could I fail, for God evermore inspir'd me, and prompted my memory with what I
had to do, and that is the reason that I have ever been blest with so good fortune. And
he will also assist y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u, as he hath done me, if you study, nor busie your selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nothing but how to serve your Master with the loyalty and fidelity we all owe him.
Afterwards when we have nothing else to do, we may freely enjoy our pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
for then it will be no prejudice to the King, nor to him we serve under him.
Then you shall enjoy a sweet and pleasing repose, when you shall return home laden
with honor, and shall present your selves before your Prince, to whom it shall be told
what you have done for his service. All the treasure in the world is not comparable to
that. Take then (Camrades) exemple by me, who have never had other thought, nor
design, that how to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> my self worthily of my charge, and doing so it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
but you must acquire great honor and reputation. In the mean time you that
are put in trust to attaque or block up places: whenever you have a design to reduce a
Town by famine, if you find you cannot totally hinder the besieged from fetching in
corn from the fields adjoyning, set them on fire: for taking this commodity from them,
they will be sufficiently distressed; but to say you preserv'd it for your self, it must be
concluded that you were very improvident to offer to attaque a place without having
means and power to carry away all near unto, and in the very face of the Town you
would attaque; in such cases you must have no pity, for this affair requires s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urvy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
            <p>Some time after the Mareschal undertook to go take <hi>Courteville,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Enterprise of <hi>Courteville</hi>
               </note> which is a Castle and
a little City in the <hi>Langues;</hi> the Castle is strong, and the River runs through the midst
of the Town, over which there is a fair Bridge of Brick, and a Bourg adjoyning to it.
The said Mareschal then came to <hi>Alba,</hi> and took me in his way along with him, with
the one half of my Company, which he entertain'd for the Guard of his won person,
leaving the other half in <hi>Alba</hi> and being come to the said <hi>Courteville,</hi> lodg'd in the Bourg
on the further side of the River, on this side of which, and near unto the Castle was a
Monastery wherein he lodg'd three Ensig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, which notwithstanding those of the Castle
commanded us more than we commanded them. Monsieur <hi>de Salcede</hi> had kept this
place all the time when he was with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Courtevilla</hi> batter'd by Monsieur <hi>de Brissac.</hi>
               </note> The Mareschal planted on this side
the Bridge eight or ten pieces of Canon wherewith to batter the Curtain that was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the Monastery, in which during the Battery, Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> lodged himself,
where although I was no longer Camp-master, I nevertheless never left him whilst the
Battery continued day nor night. In two or three days time then we spent 1200 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
shot against this Curtain, and in the end were never the nearer, forasmuch as they
had raised a great and thick rampier behind the wall within; so that when that was
beaten down, the place remained stronger than before, by reason of the said Rampier.
The Mareschal thereupon remained three days in suspence what he were best to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should send for more ammunition, or return without making any further attempt
upon the place. Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> had in the mean time gain'd the Town, and was with
his own and two other Companies lodg'd within it: but so soon as I saw the Mareschal
in this perplexity, I past the River on that side by the Monastery: for although I follow'd
Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet,</hi> I nevertheless now retir'd at night to the Mareschal. There was a
Gate of this Monastery, that went out into a great high way, upon which one might
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch undiscover'd and secure, without being seen by those of the Castle: but betwixt
the Gate and the high-way there were some fifteen or sixteen paces, which were to be
nimbly dispatch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for the whole Curtain playd upon this Gate. Afterwards it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105656:66"/>
to go stooping up to the Bridge at the entry into the Town, and then to run full
speed till you was within it. So soon as I had past this danger, and was got into the
high way, I began to look about me if it was possible to carry Canon into the Town,
which I perceived it a matter of great difficulty to do, and that was the reason that I went
into the Town to take Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> along with me, with whom I went to discover
the backside of the Castle, which lookt into a great space uninhabited, betwixt the Castle
and the Wall of the Town.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> goes to discover the place.</note> There was there a little house close by the wall of the City,
into which we put our selves to observe at our ease, whether or no the Castle were much
fortified on that part, and there I observ'd some cracks and chinks in the wall, through
which one might plainly see the light on the other side, and shew'd Captain <hi>Richelieu,</hi>
that if by any invention we could bring three pieces of Canon to this place we should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
take the Castle, forasmuch as it had not been fortified on that side, by reason of the
impossibility of bringing up Artillery to force it.</p>
            <p>That which appears impossible to one, is feasible enough to another, and many places
are so taken. I then return'd by the way near to the Abby, and Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> with
me, where we fell to discourse about the business, and began to consider if there was any
way to be found to get Canon to the backside of the Castle: whereupon it suddainly
came into my head to cause the River to be sounded, to see if the bottom was firm ground;
to which purpose I caused a Soldier of the Abby to be call'd, to whom so soon as he came
to me I made an offer of ten Crowns, if he would venture to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound the River, telling
him withall that he must creep on his hands and knees, till he came into the water, and
that then he should chop up to the neck. I then call'd another Soldier by whom I
sent vvord to the Captains in the Abby, that they should send out fifteen or twenty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which should go to the very foot of the wall, as if they went to skirmish, which
accordingly was done, and by that means I sav'd the Soldier, insomuch that the Enemy
never perceiv'd him, till he was got into the water. First he went directly to the wall
of the City, where the water dasht against it, and thence waded upwards as far as the
foard, where we used to pass over betwixt the Mareschals Quarters and the Abby,<note place="margin">The River founded to pass over the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Abby he entred into it, whether we ran full drive to avoid the danger of the
shot, and found him already got into the Abby, and the Soldiers that had been sent
out to skirmish returned a pretty while before, where he told me that the bottom of the
River was very good, and the water no deeper than to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave of the wheels. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I presently mounted to horse, and went to acquaint the Mareschal with what I had
seen, the two Masters of the Ordnance <hi>Balazergues</hi> and <hi>Duno</hi> being by, for Monsieur <hi>de
Caillac</hi> was not there.<note place="margin">Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> and the Masters of the Ordnance.</note> There <hi>Duno</hi> disputed it against me, affirming he had discover'd
all, and I affirming the contrary, till at last the Mareschal said it was their trade, and
that to undertake a business, and not to effect it, were only to lose time and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men to no purpose. At which I began to moved, having been netled by <hi>Duno</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and said to the Mareschal. <hi>Sir I have had the honor a great while to know Monsieur</hi> de Brissac, <hi>and never saw him so much afraid of Arquebuz shot, that he would forbear to
discover a place he had a mind to see. I take you to be the same man, and that you are not
become a Coward for being the Kings Lieutenant. Mount to horse, and I will make you
confess, after you have seen it, that you shall take the Castle without the expence of ten Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
shot.</hi> We hereupon all in a fume got to horse, taking <hi>Duno</hi> along, and leaving <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazergues</hi>
behind, and went to pass the River above the Abby, into which we entred, and
I had taken with me the Soldier who had founded the River. Now to get into the
high way it was necessary suddenly to open the Gate, to which the Enemy had ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
an eye, and run fifteen or twenty paces till we got into it, out of the danger of
the Curtain of the Castle. The Gate then was suddenly thrown open, and I pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the Mareschal did the same; but as he was running they fir'd three Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzes,
with some of which I verily thought he had been shot, for I heard the noise of
a Bullet, as when it enters a mans body, and when he came up to me, lookt him in the
face, and saw that he shak't his head, and smil'd, and sitting down by me upon the
ground (for we were to keep very low) <hi>I have scap't a scouring</hi> (said he) <hi>for the bullets</hi>
flew betwixt my legs.<note place="margin">The Mareschal <hi>de Brissac</hi> in great danger.</note> 
               <hi>You are very unwise Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>to follow me, do you not perceive that
I aim at being the Kings Lieutenant if you die? which is the reason that I would be rid of
you, and have brought you hither to that purpose;</hi> at which he laught only, seeing very
well by my countenance, that I was very glad he had escap't the misfortune; for the fault
would have been laid at my door, though God knows I could not have help't it: for
those that go to such Weddings as these often bring away red Liveries.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Duno</hi> and the Soldier arrived, to whom the Mareschal engag'd to pay
the ten Crowns I had promised him; but that he must return and do the same again in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105656:67"/>
his presence, and he would give him ten more, which the Soldier undertoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to do.
<hi>Duno</hi> then caused his Boots to be pull'd off, and went in his doublet only with the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
to enter into the water behind the Abby, for the man had heart enough, and men
of his trade must no more care for a Bullet than a Codling, We saw them the one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the other wade down the River, and afterwards came to the wall of the City,
into which they went, landing hard by the Gate: Which was not perform'd without
infinite danger both for them and us, for it was there very hot; so that I often wisht
Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> at his Quarters, being more afraid of him than of my self. Seeing
then <hi>Duno</hi> and the Soldier past over, we ran at the mercy of the Harquebuz shot, and
recover'd the Town. <hi>Whom God defends are well defended;</hi> for it was a miracle that some
one of us at least was not pepper'd: but either my fear or my affection made me go more
upright and nimbly than I was wont, so that I felt no great pain of my hip. I then

               </gap>ryed the Mareschal, and shewed him all that Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> and I had seen before;
when after he had heard <hi>Duno</hi>'s relation concerning the depth of the River, and found
the truth of what I had told him, he began to break out into some passionate expressions
against <hi>Duno;</hi> but I told him that he ought not to be angry, but intend the taking of
the Castle, for that no one was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e but he might be deceiv'd. Whereupon he gave
order to Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> to get together thirty or fourty great Wine-pipes, which at
the beginning of the night he should cause to be carried to the place where <hi>Duno</hi> should
appoint, and to another Captain to pull down a house, to furnish planks to put upon
the Pipes after they should be filled with earth to raise the defence still higher, because of
the great Tower of the Castle, that lookt into the recoyl of the Canon, commanding the
other Captain also to provide great beams of Timber wherewith to raise the whole so
high, that the Tower might not look into the recoyl of the Canon. And before we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the little house which was behind the Castle, I shew'd the Mareschal; a Rock
where thirty or fourty Harquebuzeers might lye covered to shoot at the Battlements of the
Tower, when the Enemy should present themselves to shoot at the Artillery; for they
must of necessity shew themselves from the Girdle upward.</p>
            <p>We afterwards went up the River to the Wall of the Town to measure what height
the Canon was to mount to get into the City, and found that it was not two foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the way was very low, When a Gentleman belonging to the Mareschal came to
us, the said Mareschal having expresly forbid that any other should advance further than
the Abby, to whom I caused the charge to be committed of breaking the wall, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it fall into the River, which being done we return'd, and <hi>Duno</hi> staid with Captain
<hi>Richelieu.</hi> At the beginning of the night then came the aforesaid Gentleman with thirty
or fourty Pioneers, and after him another Genntleman of the said Mareschal's with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
or an hundred more, where they found that Captain <hi>Richelieu</hi> had already got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half the Pipes upon the place. Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> and I accompanied <hi>Balazergues,</hi>
who drew three pieces of Canon with horses (the Mareschal having provided enow to
draw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix) and went on horseback above twenty paces in the River with the Canon, as
also did <hi>Balazergues</hi> himself, and the Carters up to the Codpiece in water: we then
turn'd to go down behind the Abby, and so went into the Town, vvhere though the
Enemy shot very hard, yet could they see nothing by reason of the extreme darkness of
the night, and therefore shot at random, and the level of fortune, vvhich at this time
smil'd upon us; yet does she not alwayes do so, especially upon me: there are some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
so happy as never to be toucht, as for exemple that brave Cavalier Monsieur <hi>de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi>
(I do believe there are not two Gentlemen alive,<note place="margin">The good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Sansac.</hi>
               </note> who have been in more engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than he and I) and yet he was never hurt that I know of, excepting at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
of St. <hi>Denis:</hi> vvherein I have not been so fortunate as he. Now vvhen vve came
to the place vvhere the Gentleman vvas, vve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound the vvall already broken down, and
tumbled into the River, and thereupon caused the Pioneers to break down two corners of
houses that hindred the passage of the Canon, which presently came to the Wall, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
which the horses entred the Town, and by the help of the Soldiers we thrust the
Canon in after them; which being done <hi>Balazergues</hi> return'd to fetch the other two,
which also we brought after the same manner to the place where <hi>Duno</hi> had fill'd the Pipes;
so that two hours before day they were ready to Batter, and the Soldiers lodg'd behind
the rock to shoot at the Battlements.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal in the interim had intelligence brought him that <hi>Don Arlro de Cende</hi>
was come to <hi>St. Stephe,</hi> within five miles of us, and would march by night to relieve the
Castle, which caused the said Mareschal to send us word that he was going to possess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of a mountain of advantage, and to fight him by the way, and that in the mean
time we should do the best we could with the six Companies we had in the Abby, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105656:67"/>
in the Town. The Mareschal accordingly gain'd the said Mountain by night, and set
his people in order to defend the pass.</p>
            <p>At the break of day when we had thought to have given fire to the Canon, the Drum
of the Castle began to beat a Parley. There was a Spaniard Governor there whose name
was <hi>Don Diego,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Don Diego</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville.</hi>
               </note> as proud a vain-glorious Coxcomb as could walk upon the earth, and so
he was reputed. Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> made the Capitulation, for I was laid to sleep in
the little house upon a Matrice the said Sieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> had caused to be brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for himself, till I was call'd to sign the Capitulation, for <hi>Don Diego</hi> knew me, he
having been Lieutenant to one of the four Spanish Companies the King had when he
took the County of <hi>Oye.</hi> The Mareschal in the mean time sent out a party of Horse to
meet <hi>Don Arbro</hi> whom they found upon his retreat, by reason he had had notice that
the Mareschal had gain'd the pass, so that about an hour after dinner he return'd back to us, where he found that <hi>Don Diego</hi> with his three Companies, one whereof was Spanish,
was marcht away two hours before. There were several who made suit to the Mareschal
for the Government of this place, it being very commodiously situated for the King's
service: But Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet,</hi> and I agreed together to cause it to be given to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Richelieu,</hi> who was Lieutenant to one of his Colonel Companies, and accordingly at
our request the Mareschal was pleased to confer it upon him, and moreover writ to the
King to confirm it, which his Majesty did, and Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> left with him his
Company for some time.</p>
            <p>Are these (Captains) I mean the taking of <hi>Lans,</hi> and that of <hi>Courteville</hi> two things
fit to be omitted, weigh well I beseech you all that we did both at the one place and the
other, and the account I gave of them both, without trusting to the report of others.

I am very sure, that if <hi>Don Diego</hi> had so pleased, he might have found us enough to do:
but to lose a place, and to carry away no honour, either alive or dead, he that put you
into it does you manifest wrong, if he do not cut off your head. Without all doubt he
might have been reliev'd, or at least he ought to have stood an assault, for we could not
have carried it at the first push, but it would have cost us very dear. What pitiful place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you have to defend, if you resolve to stay for the Canon, after it has endured a breach,
it is very necessary, that he who commands it for his own honor, shall also abide an Assault,

            <p>A few days after the Mareschal would go take <hi>Seve,</hi> and writ to me to <hi>Alba,</hi>

given me this notice of his departure, and that I should draw three Ensigns out of <hi>Alba</hi>
to carry them along with me, I presently made them ready, and likewise two Culverines,
which he had writ for also. Waiting then in expectation of his coming, I went in the
mean time to <hi>Sarvenal,</hi> which is a little Town about four miles from <hi>Alba</hi> towards the
<hi>Langues,</hi> and two other little places upon the same Road, where the Enemy had Garrisons,
especially at <hi>Sarvenal,</hi> where there were an hundred men strangers. After I had a while
batter'd it by the Gate, those within began to parly with me; but in the mean while my
people entred by another side through a Window with Ladders; so that whilst their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
was dodging with me about the Capitulation, those within saw themselves taken,
and were therefore enforc'd to render themselves upon discretion.<note place="margin">The hours of a Parly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</note> The moments of a Parly
are always dangerous, and it is then that they ought the best to man their walls, to avoid
surprizes: for <hi>betwixt the Fruit and the Cheese,</hi> as the Proverb says; at such an unexpected
time a great mischief may be done. I have seen many very foolishly surpriz'd; therefore
follow the Italian rule, which is, <hi>No te fidar, &amp; no serai inganato: Do not trust, and thou
shalt not be deceived:</hi> a lesson that ought to be very much studied by you Governors of
places: for when a woman once endures a Parly, and has patience to hear, farewel Gossip,
you have already one foot in the stirrup. In like manner when a Town once begins to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to a composition, you may certainly conclude it for lost. It is true, that you must not
then give them leisure to consider better of it; for there are certain Catch-dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, who
make a shew of parly, but it is only to work their own advantage. If you therefore fear a
relief, or that you find your selves weak, take them at their word, make use of your

time, and get Hostages betimes if you can. And on the other side, you who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a place, of all things take heed you never open your mouths to parly if you have
not an intention to surrender, and are not necessitated so to do: for your Enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gets a marvelous advantage by it. 'Tis better the overture be made by some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person, and it is better becoming the Besiegers than the besieged, though both the
one and the other ought to set a good face upon the matter, it will soon be seen who has
the worst of the Game. At these times however be sure especially to have an eye to the
main chance; for so soon as ever it is rumour'd, that there is a surrender towards, those
within instead of looking after their defence, think, one of saving his money, another his
arms, and so forth; and those without seeing themselves defeated of all hope of Booty,
if the Capitulation take effect, will try to shew you a slippery trick; for then they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
at greater ease to the wall, because of the Truce. Remember then that the hour of
a Parly is dangerous.</p>
            <p>The other two little places surrendred upon summons, and sent me their Keys; and

               </note> who was very well pleased with my exploit, and
so we march't directly to <hi>Seve. Seve</hi> is a little Town very nearly built, and enclosed with
a very good wall. A River runs either thorough it, or close under the walls, I am not
certain which, for I was never there, but when Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> and I came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Mareschal, and at this time when we retook it, and then lay there but one night
only: for the Mareschal sent me back in the morning, because <hi>Don Arbro</hi> with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
was within five miles of us, and in <hi>Alba</hi> there was only left my Lieutenant, and the
half of my Company. Now there is above the Town a Mountain, on the top of which
there stands a Church, and in the Rock an Hermitage, the entry into which was over a
planck from the Church into the said Rock, and within were Altars for Mass, and a
Chamber for the Hermi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, but no light into it, save only by the door where you come
in, which looks towards the Town; and they had so order'd the matter, that by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in to them the planck, that lay over betwixt the Hermitage and the Church, all the
world could not take them. They had also made another Fort on the right hand, at
the distance of some twenty paces from this, which they had contriv'd after the manner
of a pit, and the Counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>carpes very high; so that coming upon the Counterscarp, no
man could shew so much as a fingers length of his head without being discover'd and
kill'd, and they had moreover cast up a Trench that ran along from this Fort to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body of the Church.</p>
            <p>As Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin</hi> and I, who were for that time <hi>Mareschaux de Camp,</hi>
came to encamp near to this place, and being about to lodge the Army, there sallyed out
two or three hundred men, what out of the Fort, the Trench, and the Church, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
charg'd upon us. I had no body with me but Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> with 50 Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers,
and some few horse to Guard us. Wherefore the Baron <hi>de Chipy,</hi> Camp-Master,
sent to re-inforce me with 100 Harquebuzeers: but I was constrain'd to send
him word that he must send me more, for that we were already at it, and very near to
one another: at which instant of time Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> return'd post from Court, who
hearing the skirmish without alighting, said to the Baron <hi>de Chipy, Halt here till the
Mareschal come up, and in the mean time I will go find out Monsieur de Montluc.</hi> The
Captains follow'd him, and some Harquebuzeers on horse-back, when just as we were
embracing, the Enemy camp up and charg'd our men, seeing which I said to Monsieur <hi>de
Bonnivet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Sir for your welcome alight, and let us go charge these people, and beat them back
into the Fort:</hi> whereupon every one immediately alighted, and he said to me, <hi>charge you
directly upon those who would recover the Fort,</hi> which said he clapt a Target upon his arm,
and I catcht up a Halbert, for I ever lov'd to play with that kind of Cudgel, saying to
Signior <hi>Francisco Bernardin, Camrade, whilst we charge do you make the Quarters;</hi> to which
he replyed, <hi>is that all the reckoning you make of the employment the Mareschal has entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
us withal? if it be so, I will be a fool for company, and once play the part of a Gascon;</hi>
and so alighted, and went on with me to the charge. He was arm'd with very heavy
arms, and moreover age rendred him unweildy of himself, which made him that he
could not go so fast as I. At such kind of Banquets my body me thought did not weigh
an ounce, and I fancied that I did not touch the ground, I had quite forgot my hip.
I then charg'd up straight upon those on that side by the Trench, and Monsieur <hi>de Bonni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>
did as much on his side, so that we thundred them back with such a vengeance, that
I past over the Trench pell-mell amongst them, and pursued them, killing all the way as
far as the Church. I never laid so about me, nor did so much execution at one time. Those
within the Church seeing their people in such disorder, and so miserably cut to pieces,
quitted the place, and took a little path that went all along the rock of the Mountain
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105656:68"/>
down into the Town, where one of my men caught hold of him that carried the Ensign;
but he disingaged himself very bravely from him, and leapt into the path, making to the
Town as fast as he could trip. I ran after him, but he was too quick for me, as well he
might, for he had fear in his heels. The Captain was kill'd, whom they very much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd,
and I believe was a man of threescore years old, for he was all over white. They
could not all recover the path, which made part of them return back into the Church,
where they very bravely defended themselves. Thay had made a Raveline before the
Gate, which we gain'd from them, and then they retreated into the Hermitage, and drew
the planck after them like a draw-bridge.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> was very rougly handled, for he lost at least twenty of the best
men he had, and had above thirty more wounded: for as our people would throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at a venture from the Counterscarp into the Fort, before they could discover the
Fort they were knockt 'oth head, and amongst others we lost four of those he had brought
with him out of <hi>France;</hi> who came but too soon for them, as also two Basques, as valiant
young men as the earth ever bore; I had known them before, but those people have such
uncouth names I cannot remember them, which I am very sorry for; but after the loss
of so many men the said Monsieur <hi>de Bonnivet</hi> vvas constrain'd to leave this Fort, and
come to me to the Church.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal in the mean time had caused all the Camp to make a halt about a mile
off, expecting when Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> and I should bring him the Billets for the Armies
Quarters; when hearing no news of the one or the other, he sent a Gentleman to see
what was become of us; who found us at the Church, where he told us, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
was discontented, and very angry, not knowing where to lodge, nor where the
Quarters were made. To whom I then said, <hi>Get you back to him, and tell him that he has
made two wise Quarter-Masters, who have thought of nothing but how to quarter him and his
Army, but it has been by sending p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ople into another world.</hi> The Gentleman perceiving by this
answer that there was nothing done, returned back, it being almost night, so that the
Cavalry was constrain'd to draw into a valley on the left hand, and the Infantry into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the right. The Mareschal himself then came up to us, and could have found in
his heart to have been very angry, but seeing what we had done was well enough satisfied,
and began to laugh at the Mareschaux de Camp he had made. Signior <hi>Francisco Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardin</hi>
laid the fault upon me, and I again upon him; but the Mareschal said, <hi>I know the
white-head was too wise, and therefore it must needs be a Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for him, because there were many Corses amongst them, and the Captain himself who
was kill'd at the Gate was one. The Colonel assur'd them of the death of the said Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and that if one or two of them would come out, he would shew them his body:
Which they did, and the Mareschal was still with us, and staid there all night, for he
knew not where to lye, and a great many were laid down,<note place="margin">The Hermitage surrendred.</note> who gave me many a black

the Colonels word, that they should march away with bag and baggage, whereupon the

the day appear'd they went out, and almost all of them listed themselves under the said

only, that the provision might not be devour'd, and to prevent any disorder in the Town.
Of which he made Captain <hi>Loup</hi> Governor,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Loup.</hi>

of my own Company, forasmuch as I then lay in Garrison at <hi>Savillan,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de

Morrisons with yellow Taffata, out of respect to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> whose that colour
was, who for so few men perform'd so great and almost miraculous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ats of arms, that

will be talkt of in <hi>Piedmont:</hi> In truth these four and thirty were worth five hundred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and I have my self an hundred times wondred at what these people did; I may
therefore very well say, it was a little body, but a very good one. I gave found that it
is of great use to give your Soldiers some particular distinction; for seeing themselves to be
so distinguished and known, it redoubles their courage. I am sure these did very well,
and obtein'd for themselves such a mark of reputation, that every one pointed at them
as they marcht along, shewing for a wonder the yellow Morrions who had perform'd
such noble feats of arms. I have since also been in several other skirmishes, which I
will not trouble my Reader withall, for being too tedious: though I cannot forbear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
mention of one, which the Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> may please to remember, when he
brought the Gallies,<note place="margin">The Skirmish before <hi>Bullen.</hi>
               </note> we being then before <hi>Bullen.</hi> The great skirmish was at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which continued for two hours, where the Canon-shot flew so thick that they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
volleys of Harquebuzeers. I had all the Forces of <hi>Bullen</hi> upon me, notwithstanding
which I made one of the bravest and most honourable retreats that man could possibly
make. The late Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> saw it all, who had no more but five and twenty
horse, and therefore could no wayes relieve me; to do which he must of necessity have
come down into the plain, where he would immediately have been swallowed up by the
Canon, and no man believ'd that I could possibly have made my retreat without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
running away; but I did it alwayes at four Pikes length, often facing about, and
must needs say, that I never perform'd any thing from whence I deriv'd more honor
than from this action. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> did sufficiently magnifie it, and commended
me but two much. But I shall speak no more of these kind of things, and content my
self with writing what I perform'd commanding only, wherein such as will do me the
honor to read my book may learn some thing as to the practice of Arms, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so easie as is believ'd. Great and commendable parts and qualities are required
to the making up of a compleat Captain.<note place="margin">What parts are required to make up a compleat Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer.</note> It is not all to be hardy and brave, we must

of Souldiers; but being the eldest in this Kingdom, my opinion will nevertheless be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
a vote in the Chapter, which may serve to enform such as know less that I, and
as for the rest they need no Tutor.</p>
            <p>I then left <hi>Piedmont</hi> to go home a little to refresh my self, and to take some repose, by
reason of a great distemper I was fallen into: but what just occasion soever I might have
to ask it,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony.</hi>
               </note> I had nevertheless much ado to obtain leave of Monsieur <hi>de Brissac,</hi> though he
at last was pleased to dismiss me, upon my promise speedily to return. At my coming
home I found my self honour'd and esteem'd of all the greatest persons of the Country.
My name was up, and therefore for one thing I had done they would perswade me I had
done four: Report goes evermore encreasing; and also at the time <hi>Piedmont</hi> was the
only Scene in vogue for a Nursery of war. I did not however continue long idle at home,
my Masters neither giving me leisure, nor my own disposition enclining me so to do, I
having ever proposed to my self by the way of Arms to arrive to all the degrees of honour,
to which man can attain; and you who are Gentlemen born ought to consider that God
has sent you into the world to bear arms for the service of your Prince and Country, and
not to hunt the Hare, and follow after Mistresses; when peace comes you may take your

of him took several little Towns belonging to the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the particulars
whereof I shall not meddle withal, forasmuch as I was not there present: but, by what I

to name each of them one for this employment; for all things past through the hands of
these three, and nothing was determin'd without them. All our Kings have ever had
this trick, to suffer themselves to be govern'd by some particular men, and perhaps too
much, so that it looks sometimes as if they stood in awe of their own subjects. Of these
the Constable stood in the highest degree of favour, and was ever more belov'd by the
King than any other; he therefore first nam'd his man, Monsieur <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Mareschal a third. Which having done the King said to them, you have none of you

               </note> to which Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> made answer, that it was out of his head,
and the Mareschal said the same, Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> moreover adding, <hi>if) you name Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc
I have done, and shall speak no more of him I nominated before;</hi> nor I said the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,
who has since related to me the whole debate. The Constable then stood up, and
said, that I was by no means proper for this employment, as being too humorous, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish,
and passionate, to which the King made answer, that he had ever observ'd and
known me to be peevish and passionate, upon the account of his service only, when I saw
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m not serv'd so well as he ought to be, and that he had never heard I ever had a
quarrel with any one upon my own particular account. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
said also the same, adding moreover that I had already been Governor both of
<hi>Montcallier</hi> and <hi>Alba,</hi> without so much as any one man's opening his mouth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of my Administration; and that also had I been a person of that temper, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>de Briss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>c.</hi> would never have lov'd and favour'd me at the rate he did, not have
reposed so great a confidence in me as he had ever done. The Constable hereupon answered
very roundly again, and made good his former objection with great vehemency, and
would by all means that the person he had nominated should stand: for he was impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of being controverted, and more of being over-rul'd; neither indeed did he ever
much love me, nor any of his. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was there present, who may
better remember than I, who it was that the Constable nam'd: but (if I be not deceiv'd)
it was <hi>Boccal,</hi> who is since turn'd Hugonot: however in the end the King would carry it,
having Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de St. André</hi> on his side, and dispatch't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a Courier to the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac</hi> to send me into <hi>Avignon,</hi> where accordingly
I staid expecting a Gentleman his Majesty sent to me, who brought my dispatch to go
presently away to <hi>Sienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Mareschal had some dayes before given me leave to retire to my own house,
by reason of a sickness I was fallen into, as I have said elsewhere; who had no mind to
do it, as he himself confest to me since; and has done me the honor to tell me, that had he
known of what importance the loss of me, would have been to him, he would nat have so
commended me to the King as he had done, and that in his life he never repented any
thing so much as the letting me depart from him, telling me of a great many things
wherein he had not been so well served after my departure out of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Monsieur
<hi>de Cossé,</hi> President <hi>Birague,</hi> and several others can witness how oft they have heard him
lament any abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, especially when matters did not succeed according to his desire. And
if any one will take the pains to consider what I perform'd while I was there under his
Command, he will find that what I say is very true, and that he had some reason to
regret me. I was alwayes at his feet, and at his head. I will not say nevertheless, that
any thing would have been better done for my being there: but however I must needs
speak the truth, and there are who can say more if they please.</p>
            <p>He then writ a Letter to the King,<note place="margin">Advice of the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac</hi> to the King concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> and another to the Constable, wherein he sent his
Majesty word, that he had made a very ill choice of me to command in <hi>Sienna,</hi> for that
I was one of the most cross-grain'd chollerick f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one as that for half the time I had been with him, he had been necessitated to suffer

of discipline and justice in an Army, to command in the field, and to make the
Soldiers to fight: but that the humour of the <hi>Siennois</hi> consider'd, it would be fire to fire,
which would be the only means to lose that State, which was to be preserv'd by gentleness
and moderation. He moreover entreated the Constable to remonstrate as much to the
King, and in the mean time dispatcht a Courier to me, who found me very sick, by whom
he sent me word, that the King would send me to <hi>Sienna;</hi> but, that as a friend of mine,
he advised me not to accept of that employment,<note place="margin">The Mareschal <hi>de Brissac's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it; which were all artifices to detein me.</p>
            <p>O that a wise Lieutenant of a Province ought to have an eye, and to take heed of losing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105656:70"/>
a man in whom he may absolutely confide, and whom he knows to be a man of valour,
and ought to spare nothing that he may keep him; for oftentimes one man alone can do
much. You must eat a great deal of Salt with a man before you can rightly known him;
and in the mean time you are depriv'd of him with whom you were throughly acquainted,
in whom you reposed your trust, and of whose fidelity you have already had sufficient
proof. The said Mareschal had moreover sent word to the King, that I was in <hi>Gascony</hi>
very sick, and in the morning as the Letters were read, the Constable, who was mighty
well pleased with the contents, said to the King, <hi>Did not I tell your Majesty as much,
you find the Mareschal to be of the same opinion, and no man living can know</hi> Montluc <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than he who has so often seen him at work.</hi> To which the King (who naturally lov'd me,
and had ever done so, after he had seen my behaviour at the Camisado of <hi>Bullen</hi>) reply'd,
<hi>that although all those of his Council should speak against me, yet should they prevail nothing
by it: for it was his nature to love me, and that he would not after his election let them all
say what they would.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> then spake and said, <hi>here is a letter very full of
contradictions: for in the first place the Mareschal</hi> de Brissac <hi>says that</hi> Montluc <hi>is cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd
and cholerick and that he will never suit with the</hi> Sie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nois, <hi>but will ruine your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
if you send him thither; and on the other side commends him for qualities that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in a man of command, to whom the trust of great things is to be committed: for he
speaks him:<note place="margin">Cholerick men the best.</note> to be a man of an exact discipline, and great justice, and fit to make the Soldiers
fight in great Enterprizes and Executions; and who ever saw a man endued with all these
good qualities, that had not a mixture of Choller amongst them? Such as are indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things go well or ill may indeed be without passion, and as to the rest, since Sir your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
has your self made the Election, I humbly conceive you ought not revoke it.</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>de St. André</hi> spake next, and said, <hi>Sir, what the Mareschal</hi> de Brissac <hi>complains of
you may easily correct, by writing to</hi> Montluc, <hi>that your self having made choice of his person
above all others for this employment, he must for your sake at much at he can govern his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
having to do with such a fickle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>headed people as those of</hi> Sienne. To which the King made
answer, <hi>that he did not fear but that after he had writ me a letter, I would do as he should
command me;</hi> and immediately thereupon dispatcht away a Courrie: to me to my own
house, by whom he sent me word, that although I should be sick, I must nevertheless put
my self upon my way to go directly to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where I should meet my dispatch, and
should there embark my self with the <hi>Germans</hi> that the <hi>Rhinceroc</hi> brought, and ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of <hi>French</hi> foot, to which place he would also send me money for my journey, and
that I must for a while leave my passion behind me in <hi>Gascony,</hi> and a little accommodate
my self to the humor of that people. The Courrier found me at <hi>Agen</hi> very sick, and under
the Physicians hands, notwithstanding which I told him, that in eight dayes I would
begin my journey, which I did, and verily thought I should have dyed at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> from
whence by the advice of the Physicians I was to return back again, which I would not
do: but caused my self to be hall'd along as far as <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where I was again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by the Physicians to go no further,<note place="margin">Cholerick Captains more valiant than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> they assuring me that if I ventur'd to proceed
on my journey I should never come alive to <hi>Marseilles:</hi> but whatever they could say,
I was resolv'd to go on so long as life lasted, come on't what would, when just as I was
going away there came another Courrier from the King to hasten me, and from day to
day I recovered my health in travelling; so that when I came to <hi>Marseilles</hi> I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comparison much better than when I parted from my own house.</p>
            <p>In plain truth the King my good Master had reason to defend my cause, for my cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
was never prejudicial to his service, it has indeed been sometimes prejudicial to my self
and some others, who would not avoid not comply with my humour. I never lost Place,
Battail, nor Rencounter, nor ever was the occasion of losing any one of his Subjects; my
choler never so far transported me as to do any thing prejudicial to his service, and if it
be violent and prompt, it is the sooner gone: I have ever observ'd that such people are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be employ'd than any other, for they have no malice in them, nor no dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
and if they be more suddain, they are also more valiant than those who by their
moderation would appear to be more wise: but leaving this discourse I shall return to my
voyage.</p>
            <p>At my coming to <hi>Marseilles</hi> I found that the Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> was already departed
with the Army to go to <hi>Argiers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Sienna</hi> was in the year 1555.</note> there to prevail with the King of <hi>Argier</hi> to convoy him
with his Fleet, forasmuch as the said Baron had been advertized, that Prince <hi>Auria</hi> lay
waiting for him with a great Navy to intercept him by the way; and the Kings Fleet of it self
was not strong enough to undertake him, which was the reason that we delayed the time
for a few days. So soon then as the Baron arrived, having the <hi>Argier</hi> Fleet with him,<note place="margin">The Baron <hi>de la Garde.</hi>
               </note> we

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:105656:71"/>
that came out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and was going for <hi>Spain,</hi> which the Baron caused to be set on fire,
excepting two that he took along with him for the support of his Army, and so went on
to <hi>Port' H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rcole,</hi> at which place we could not possibly land, forasmuch as the Marquis <hi>de
Marignano</hi> lay with his Camp near unto the way by which we were of necessity to pass
to go to <hi>Sienna.</hi> We were therefore constrain'd to reimbark our men, and to fall back,
to land with greater safety, near to <hi>Escarlin,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> lay with his
Camp.<note place="margin">The Prior of <hi>Capua</hi> slain.</note> We there heard news that the Prior of <hi>Capua</hi> had but two days before been slain in viewing <hi>Escarlin,</hi> which was a very great loss, he being as brave a man as liv'd, both
by land and sea, and a true Servant of the Kings. He was Brother to Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi>
and it was said, was kill'd by the hand of a Peasant, that fir'd a Harquebuz at him from
behind a Bush. Behold what a sad misfortune this was, that so great a Captain should
perish by the hand of a Rascal with his fire stick. And so we marcht on to <hi>Bonconvent,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> going always a little before us for conveniency of victual, and there
all the Army joyn'd together.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> arriv'd at the said <hi>Bonconvent,</hi> Monsieur de <hi>Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy</hi>
went out in the morning before, with the three thousand <hi>Grisons</hi> (of which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> was Colonel) and the <hi>Italians,</hi> to make room for the <hi>Germans</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> who had need to lye and rest an hour or two. I went over night to wait upon Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> and in the morning departed with him, that I might come betimes to
<hi>Sienna;</hi> where we found Monsieur <hi>de Lansac,</hi> who at our coming treated Monsieur <hi>de
Strozzy,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> and me at dinner. At the coming up of the <hi>Grisons</hi> and
<hi>Italians</hi> there hapned a great skirmish at <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> a Monastery of Nuns near unto <hi>St.
Mark</hi> another Monastery of <hi>Religieux.</hi> The Mareschal <hi>de Marignano</hi> lay with his Camp
at the Palace of <hi>Diau</hi> which is upon the road to Florence, within a little mile of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
and this very morning had raised his Camp to go to <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> there to assault Captain

place. The said Marquis had left his <hi>Italians</hi> at the said Palace of <hi>Diau,</hi> and taken all his

               </gap>sk and round at <hi>St. Bonde.</hi> The <hi>Grisons</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> halted at <hi>la Palassot,</hi> half a
mile from <hi>Sienna,</hi> and our <hi>Italians</hi> also, by the command or Monsieur de <hi>Strozzy,</hi> to the
end that he might both the sooner determine where he should lodge the Army, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
because he would, that before they should be lodg'd, the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
should be come up, that they might all at once sit down in their Quarters: but before
we had made an end of dinner, we heard some little pieces go off at <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> that the
Marquis had thither taken along with him. At which I said to Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,
Sir, the skirmish grows very loud, and is mixt with Artillery, they will deprive you of Captain</hi>
Bartolomeo de Pesera, <hi>pray let us go see what they are doing;</hi> to which he replyed, <hi>let us
go then, and we must go however to see where we are to lodge the Camp.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi>
lent me a gray Turk, for I had not brought my horses by sea; and I then asked Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Strozzy</hi> if he were pleased that I should go see what the business was, whilst he
with Messieurs <hi>de Lansac</hi> and <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> went to take order about lodging the Camp?
to which he answered, with all his heart; and so we went out at the Port St. <hi>Mark.</hi> I
went then directly to the place where the skirmish was, and they a little on the right
hand to see where they should lodge the Army. So soon as I was on the other side the
Tresse, where the skirmish was, I there found not so much as one Captain; so that the
skirmish lookt like a very disorderly business, and the Enemy had got the advantage of
our people; for they had drawn them from the little hills near unto <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> and driven
them to the Medows that lye upon the banks of the River <hi>Tresse.</hi> At my arrival I askt
for the Captains, but met not one that own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d that title, from whence a great disorder
ensu'd: but upon the instant I saw one coming upon a gray horse, and gallopt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
up to him, to ask him if he was a Captain or no, who told me he was; I then
askt him his name, to which he made answer, <hi>Io mj chiamo Marioul de Santa Fiore,</hi> and
I said to him. <hi>Signior Capitano Io mj chiamo Montluco audiamo ensiemi,</hi> Now all the Army
had already heard that I was coming with the recruits;<note place="margin">

seen one anothers faces before, yet we knew one another well enough by our names. I
entreated him them to rally his men, and give a charge upon the Enemy, to beat them
back again up the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, which he did, and we accordingly drave them up to the very top.
In the mean while the skirmish extended it self all along the ridge of a Hill, and by the
Vineyards directly to the <hi>Pall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and on the back of the Mountain a little further the Artillery playd, which the Marquis
had brought to <hi>St. Bonde.</hi> There all the <hi>Italian</hi> Captains, and <hi>Signior Cornelio Bentivoglio,</hi>

Bonde</hi> and <hi>St. Mark,</hi> behind a little Oratory, by which they were covered from the
Canon shot.</p>
            <p>Now betwixt <hi>la Pallassot</hi> and the little Oratory it might be about three hundred paces,
and Signior <hi>Marioul</hi> and I so ruffled the Enemy, that we drave the skirmish all along
the ridge of the Vineyards directly upon them: I had brought with me Captain <hi>Charry,</hi>
who was my Lieutenant at <hi>Alba,</hi> with thirty good Soldiers, almost all Gentlemen, who
would by no means by left behind with my brother Monsieur <hi>de Lioux,</hi> to whom the
King had given the government of <hi>Alba,</hi> at the humble request of Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi>
my Brother, and I had preferred in his behalf. About which there hapned a very great
dispute, for the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac</hi> deferr'd to accept him till he had first had on answer
from me; who so soon as he understood the King's resolution to send me to <hi>Sienna,</hi> he
sent me another Courier,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Liouz</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Alba</hi>
               </note> entreating me not to quit the Government of <hi>Alba,</hi> and that
I might name, either my own Lieutenant, or any other to command in the place till my
return, assuring me that he would accept whomsoever I should appoint, and in the mean
time would take care that my pay should be kept for me, so that I should not lose so
much as a denier; advising me withal to consider, that the Command the King gave me
at <hi>Sienna</hi> would not be of so long continuance as that of <hi>Alba.</hi> But I most humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
him to approve of my Brother, ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring him that he would be as much his effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
servant as I was, and that if it should please God I ever return'd from <hi>Sienna,</hi>
I swore to come and find him out, and to serve him in the condition of a private Soldier,
though the King should not please to conferre any command upon me, that I might have
the honor to be near his person. Now to give you an account of the humour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal,
I will say and maintain, that he was one of the bravest Gentlemen, and the best
Masters that has been these fifty years in <hi>France,</hi> for such as he knew to be zealous and
affectionate to the King's service; and if President <hi>Birague</hi> will lay his hand upon his
heart, he will swear the same.<note place="margin">Character of the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac.</hi>
               </note> He was a man that had evermore a greater regard to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man's profit than his own, a man could never lose any thing by him, but every
man had his share both of advantage and honor, and so to the rest, he lov'd and honor'd
a worthy man, even to the meanest Soldier. The best men he knew by their names, and
would give ear to the advice of all, without relying too much upon his own head-piece
as Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> was too much enclin'd to do. But to return to the Skirmish, I

seen, since my arrival. Betwixt the said Oratory and <hi>la Bonde</hi> there is a great High-way, and
by the side of it two little houses, some ten or twelve paces distant from one another. In this
High-way we gave the Enemy a charge, and gain'd from them the two houses, into one
of which Captain <hi>Charry</hi> put himself, and our <hi>Italians</hi> into the other, they there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
about three quarters of an hour, almost alwayes fighting, insomuch that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
sent thither all his Spanish Harquebuzeers, and even the <hi>Italians</hi> who were at their
Fort of <hi>St. Mark,</hi> and planted six Ensigns of Spanish foot upon the great High-way to
maintain the fight. Now the hottest of the skirmish was on the right hand, and on the
left amongst the Vines, so that the Cavalry could do nothing. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> then by
the advice of his Captains was about to retire, when I remonstrated to him that he must
by no means offer to stir, till first he had some horse, and also the <hi>Grisons</hi> to make good
his retreat, to whom I would presently go, and entreat them to come up half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Pallassot and the Oratory, and would likewise go to request the same of
the Count <hi>de la Miranda,</hi> who was Colonel of the horse, and had halted in a
Valley behind a little Wood near unto <hi>la Pallassot;</hi> which they approv'd of very well;
and so I presently ran to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> entreating them to advance but two hundred paces
only; but the Colonel that commanded under Monsieur <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> would by no
means be perswaded to it. I then spurr'd up to the Count, and pray'd him to send out
four Corners of horse, which he presently did, and they were the Count <hi>de Pontavala,
Cornello, Ioby,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Rabat,</hi> and my Nephew <hi>Serillac,</hi> who commanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Monsieur <hi>de Cipierre.</hi> Now as the Cornets were advancing at a good round gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
I saw Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> who at the importunity of his Captains was again begining
to retire, and presently ran to him, remonstrating that the six Ensigns were upon their
march, and that they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose colours being so large, it was a sign the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
was there in person with all his Army, who would infallibly charge him so soon as
ever he should begin to descend the Hill, entreating him therefore to return back to the
same place, which he did, being departed from it not above thirty paces. I then return'd
to the Corners, and stopt them in the mid-way betwixt the Pallassot and the Oratory,
which having done, I once more went to the <hi>Grisons,</hi> who after I had made them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the danger we were in to lose all the Officers, arose and began to strike up their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105656:72"/>
Drums, and marcht up close by the Horse. The Marquis seeing the Cavalry and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
begin to appear in the field, thought it now convenient to withdraw his six Ensigns
out of the great High-way; there was not one Officer of ours on horseback but my self
and Signior <hi>Marioul,</hi> who never stirred from my side, so that I could plainly see all the
Enemy did: I then said to Signior <hi>Cornelio, Look you Sir, the Spanish Ensigns having
discovered our Cavalry, and the Grisons are facing about, now charge them home, for
now it is time:</hi> which being said, Signiour <hi>Marioul</hi> alighted, and clapt a Target to his
arm, having his sword in his hand; I then said to Captain <hi>Charry, that he was now to
shew what he had ever been, and must let these strangers see what a Gascon could do, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him be sure to charge in before them all.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> had brought four
hundred Italian Harquebuzeers from <hi>Parma,</hi> very brave men, who were drawn up close
by the Oratory (for my part) I will not make my self more valiant than I am, for I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
not, I already began to play the King's Lieutenant, and we divided the men to
the right and left, all along a great High-way, and there we made our charge, which
was a brave one, if ever any was, and such that we drave them as far as a descent on the
left hand of <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> where the Marquis stood with the remainder of his <hi>Spaniards</hi> and
<hi>Germans,</hi> and being the <hi>Spaniards</hi> stood just upon the edge of the ascent, those who were
put to flight rusht quite through them, and both one and the other ran full drive upon
the <hi>Germans.</hi> The Marquis who saw the torrent of this disorder coming upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
as well as he could, to retire by a Valley, without sound of Trumpet, or beat of
Drum. Those who were come out of <hi>St. Marks,</hi> retreated also in very great haste, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
off with them the four little pieces with which they had batter'd <hi>St. Bonde,</hi> into
their Fort. The Marquis told me after, when I came out of <hi>Sienna,</hi> as he accompanied
me two miles from the Town, that had we follow'd the pursuit we had put all his Army
to flight, and given him a total defeat: but we were not aware of his disorder; we
thought our selves very happy, that we had come off so good cheap; and our Enemies
thought themselves happier than we.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> who was in a Valley on the other side the Port <hi>St. Mark,</hi> as he
was consulting with Messieurs <hi>de Lansac</hi> and <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> about the situation of the
Camp, heard very well that there was a very great skirmish; but he knew that all the
Captains were there, and that I was also gone thither; neither did they ever imagine it
had been half so sharp as it was; but in the end hearing it grow so loud, they left all
and came gallopping to us; yet could they not come time enough to the charge, which the
said Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> was very much troubled at, and something discontented that no
notice had been given him of the fight, and Monsieur <hi>de Fourcavaux</hi> was the same, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the <hi>Grisons,</hi> of which he was the chief Officer, were come up just to fight, and
that his Harquebuzeers had fought. But I excus'd it to them both, telling them that
I had never a horse-man with me, but Signior <hi>Marioul,</hi> and that he was too brave a
Gentleman to leave the skirmish, having besides three or four Ensigns under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
wherefore it had not been possible for me to send them word. Now Monsieur
<hi>de Strozzy</hi> at his rising from dinner had sent away Signior <hi>Roberto</hi> his Brother in all haste,
to cause the <hi>Franch</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> to advance, which he did, and found the <hi>Germans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to drink,<note place="margin">The <hi>Germans</hi> are eating and drinking in the midst of the skirmish.</note> and consequently could not suddainly get them from the Tables; for
the said Signior <hi>de Strozzy</hi> had caused meat to be set ready for them upon the great
High-way, which had he not done they had held on their march, and just in the nick
had come into the heat of the fight, and so the Battail had been won; but we must say
with the <hi>Italian. Fa me indevino, &amp; io ti daro denari.</hi> This was that which was done
the first day that I arriv'd at <hi>Sienna,</hi> where I so signaliz'd my self to the <hi>Siennois,</hi> and
all the Italian Captains, that knew me not before, as purchased me a very great esteem,
both with the Inhabitants of the City and the whole Army; for by running up and
down amongst the foot now here, now there, ordering these on the one side, and those
on the other, I gave them to understand that this was not the fist skirmish by a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
wherein I had been engag'd.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal then lodg'd his Camp betwixt <hi>Porto Novo</hi> and <hi>Porto Tuffo,</hi> in the
beautiful Suburbs that are there, and not only there, for I dare boldly say, that if the
Suburbs of <hi>Sienna</hi> had stood altogether, they would have been bigger than the City; for
in the Suburbs were more goodly Palaces, and finer Churches and Monasteries than there
were in the body of the Town. The next morning Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> carried us up
to that part of the wall looking towards the Enemies Camp, where we fell into consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
,<note place="margin">A Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on held at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> about fighting a <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </note> whether or no it were good to hazard a Battail; and there the opinions were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
some thinking it the best, and others conceiving it not convenient so to do. Those
who were of opinion that we ought not to fight objected, that we could not go to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105656:72"/>
Palace of <hi>Diau,</hi> without passing close by a little Fort the Marquis had made, betwixt
the little observance and the aforesaid Palace, where there was three or four pieces of great
Artillery (as it was true), and that leaving that behind, we should also leave our own
Fort of <hi>Camolia</hi> naked of defence. I then propounded that for any harm the Artillery
of the little Fort could do us, we could pass by a little before day, and might leave an
Ensign or two to bridle the little Fort from daring to sally out, and as for the Fort of
<hi>Camolia,</hi> we could leave three or four Companies of the City to keep them likewise in
aw,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> and that I on my part with the rest of the Forces of the City would go out by <hi>Porto
Fontebrando,</hi> and should by break of day to got to the top of a little Mountain, ready to
present my self in the Plain at so opportune a time, that just as our Camp should appear
near to theirs, I should at the same instant be got so near them, that they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
enter into some apprehension, to see us come the one on the one side, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Siennois</hi> made account that they could draw four thousand good men out of the
Town. There were some who approv'd of my proposal, and of the <hi>Siennois</hi> also which
was to fight; and others were of a contrary opinion. The Game could not be plaid
without being lustily disputed,<note place="margin">The Forces of the Marquis of <hi>Marignan.</hi>
               </note> for the Marquis had three Tertia's of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> namely
that the <hi>Sicily,</hi> that of <hi>Naples,</hi> and that of <hi>Corsica</hi> (which we call Regiments) the two
first composed of old Soldiers, and that of <hi>Corsica</hi> of new-raised men (wherein neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there were very good Soldiers) together with two Regiments of <hi>Germans,</hi> each of them
containing twelve Ensigns, and four or five thousand <hi>Italians.</hi> As to the Cavalry I
think ours would have beaten theirs, for we had very good Officers, and very brave Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse
; and for the rest, our Army consisted of ten Ensigns of <hi>Germans,</hi> ten of <hi>Grisons,</hi>
fourteen of <hi>French,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The French Forces.</note> and betwixt five and six thousand <hi>Italians.</hi> Of all this day Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Strozzy</hi> could not resolve what to do, by reason of the diversity of opinions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
I think he was resolv'd the next day to have fought them; for the <hi>Siennols</hi>
were stark mad of fighting, and I do believe fighting for their liberty would have playd
the devils:<note place="margin">The Marquis <hi>de Marignan</hi> dislodges his Camp.</note> But the Marquis either had some knowledge of his intent, or else his design
was not to stay any longer there; for he departed an hour before day in the morning; so
that had God inspir'd Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> that he had this day gone out to fight, we had
in the morning found them all dislodg'd, and had fought them upon their retreat, and
in disorder: but I must repeat what I said before, <hi>Fa me indevino, &amp; io ti daro denari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marquis took the way towards <hi>Mauchaut,</hi> where the Mareschal had left four
Ensigns, or else the Marquis held it, who went to another place hard by, and Monsieur
<hi>de Strozzy</hi> directly to <hi>Mauchaut,</hi> I do not certainly remember whether: but so it was
that their Camps lay eight or nine days within seven or eight miles of one another, the
one going to take some place, and the other following after to relieve it. Nevertheless
the Marquis at last arrived before <hi>Mauchaut,</hi> and began to batter either to take or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it. I was not there, for I staid behind at <hi>Sienna,</hi> according to the King's intention,
and in relation to my command; yet had it not been for a sickness that I began to fall
into, I do believe Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> would have taken me along with him, and have
left Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> Governor, as before; but in the end, as Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>
march't away, Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> took his way towards <hi>Rome,</hi> to acquit himself of his
Commission of Ambassador.<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> goes Ambassador to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> So soon as the Marquis was sensible of Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>'s
coming, he gave place, and drawing off his Attillery, plac't himself a little on the right
hand, at the distance of a hundred and fifty or two hundred paces from the Town,
where he made his advantage of two or three little Mountains, under which lie entrencht
himself on that side by the Fountains. Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> then came and encampt his Army all along a hollow way that there was betwixt the Marquis and the Town. Now
Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> plac't himself so near in design to fight the Marquis, if he could
once tempt him out of this Trenches, and there they lay seven or eight days to see which
should first dislodge. The Marquis knew very well, that in case he should first move,
Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> would infallibly fight him; and therefore would by no means be
drawn to do it, being expresly forbid to put any thing to hazard, as we were after told
by <hi>Don Iuan de Luna</hi>
               <note place="margin">Don Iuan de Luna.</note> himself, who was present with the Marquis at that time, and in
his own person, a very brave <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now betwixt the two Camps there was no more than the breadth of one little field,
and that not above fifty paces over, wherein there daily hapned skirmishes betwixt the
foot of both Armies, and so disadvantageous to us, that we always came off with the
worse, by reason of the Artillery the Marquis had planted upon the three forementioned
little Mountains; so that Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> lost more men by their Canon than by
their smaller sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etch all their water by night; neither could
he ever draw up his Cavalry into Battalia,<note place="margin">The <hi>Fench</hi> very much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy'd by the Enemies Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> but that the great shot did great execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and I was told that in three or four dayes time he had above sixscore men and
horses kill'd, insomuch that our Cavalry was infinitely discourag'd, and the foot also very
much baffled and out of heart. Notwithstanding all which Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
obstinate not to remove his Quarters, and that both out of the hope he had that
the Marquis would first d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>slodge, and give him an opportunity to fight him, as also out
of punctilio, that he would not give him that advantage, as the first to forsake his
ground. Both the one and the other of these Generals had mettle enough, and both of
them had glory in their prospect: but it is better to do one's Masters business, than to
stand upon nicities of honor; I mean if there be no manifest shame in the case.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> every day sent an account of all he did, both to me and to the
Senat, as we also met every day in Council to debate upon what he writ to us, and I eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hour advised, and entreated him not to consume his Forces with continual loss, which
would encourage the Enemies Soldiers, and dishearren his own: the Lords of the Senate
likewise counsel'd h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m the same; but he had so passionate a desire to fight with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
that that longing alone blinded his judgment, and depriv'd him of the knowledge
of his daily loss. I dy'd with desire to go to him, but the Senate would by no means
consent unto it: at last he writ me word, that within two dayes he would retire in the
face of the Enemy, directly to <hi>Lusignano,</hi> whereupon I immediately dispatcht away a
Gentleman to him, who was present when the Letter came, called the Sieur <hi>de Lescussan,</hi>
by him entreating and conjuring him not to make his retreat by day, since the loss in the
skirmishes had hapned on his side (for by ill fortune our poeple had lost more the two

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and that whoever might advise him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
I begg'd of him to be rul'd by me, and to retire by night, for it was no more than
two miles to <hi>Lusignano;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc's</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de <hi>Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy</hi> upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in the face of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</note> beseeching him withall to remember that King <hi>Francis</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
from before <hi>Landrecy</hi> after this manner, and was so far from being condemn'd
for so doing, that on the contrary he was highly applauded for it, and it was lookt upon
by all the Princes and Potentates of Christendome for the most prudent thing he ever did;
yet had he sustain'd no loss by skirmishes. I gave him moreover to understand, that
hitherto I had never seen a good retreat made after this manner, neither by Friend nor
Enemy, if they who made it were closely pursued. I further represented to him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
that Messieurs <hi>de Montegean</hi> and <hi>de Boissy</hi> would make at <hi>Brignolles,</hi> who would
not be perswaded to retire without seeing the Enemy, for all the Captains who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with them could do or say, which was the cause they were defeated within less than
half a mile of their Quarters. I also set before him the exemple of Monsieur <hi>d' Anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baut,</hi>
at that time Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Theroanne,</hi> of Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun</hi> at <hi>Carignan,</hi>
and several others:<note place="margin">Retreats at the head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my dangerous.</note> and that since so great a Prince, and so great a Soldier, as King
<hi>Francis</hi> was, had by all the world been commended for that discreet way of proceeding,
he ought to take him for his president, considering also that so many valiant Leaders had
lost themselves in retreating at the head of an Army; and that by such a loss (if it should
so unhappily fall out) he might guess what would become of the City of <hi>Sienna.</hi> In
short Monsieur <hi>de Lesussan</hi> brought me word, that once Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to do it after his sort,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thom. d' Albene</hi> the cause of Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy's</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</note> and had it not been for one unlucky fellow called <hi>Thomas
d' Albene</hi> he had with him, he had retreated after the manner I advised: but as there
are some men in the world, whom God has appointed to do good, so has he created o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to do mischief, as he did this <hi>Thomas;</hi> for he represented to Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>
so many things, and so preacht what a dishonor it would be to him to steal away by
night, that in the end he made him to alter his determination; who thereupon sent me
word that he was resolv'd to make his retreat in the face of the Enemy: Whereas before,
to let me see that he was resolv'd to follow my advice, he had at one of the clock in the
night sent away two pieces of Canon he had with him straight to <hi>Lusignano;</hi> at which
place I do believe they were already arriv'd (for it was but two little miles) before he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
his resolution. It was four of the clock in the morning before Monsieur <hi>de Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussan</hi>
parted from him, who brought me his determination, and arriv'd at seven of the
clock in the morning <hi>a la mode de France.</hi> This hapned to be in <hi>August,</hi> and presently
I sent to the Senate, desiring them all to meet me at the Palace, for that I had something
of importance to deliver them,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> sick.</note> which they did. Now my sickness was still more and
more encreast upon me, and was at last turn'd into a continued Feavor, with a Flix, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which about nine of the clock I came to the Palace, where I began a Speech

why I have here set it down in French, as also to the end that the Gentlemen of
<hi>Gascony,</hi> who few of them understand that Language, and shall read my Book, as I am
confident they will, may not be put to the trouble to have it interpreted to them. I very
well remember what I said, and do truly believe I do not miss ten words, for my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

                        <p>I have requested you to this Assembly, that I might remonstrate to
you four things, which I conceive to be very important to your conservation, and have
been moved so to do, by reason that Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> has this night sent me word
by Monsieur <hi>de L'Escussan</hi> of the resolution he has taken this morning to retreat in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
day to <hi>Lusignano,</hi> in the very face of his Enemy. You all know very well what
perswasions and intreaties we have used, that he would take heed of retreating after this
manner, and particularly what arguments and exemples I laid before him by the said
Sieur <hi>de l'Escussan,</hi> which he relisht very well at first, and was once resolv'd to do as
King <hi>Francis</hi> did before <hi>Landrecy;</hi> nevertheless, by I know not what misfortune, he
suffers himself to be carried away by a man he has with him, one <hi>Thomas d'Albene,</hi>
who has made him alter his determination, by making him believe that to retreat by
night would be dishonourable to him: God grant the ill counsel of this man do not
prove dishonourable and ruinous both to him and to you also. Now Gentlemen, whilst
we are in expectation what will be the issue of this Battail, I have four things to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to you. The first, and which most nearly concerns you, is, that you will please
to call to mind, that you are Soveraigns in your own Republick, that your Predecessors
from Father to Son have left you this honorable Title: that this War aims at nothing
but the ruine of that Soveraignty; for if the Enemy remain victorious, you are to hope
for no other, than from Soveraigns to be converted into Subjects, and Slaves; and that
therefore it is much better for you to die with your arms in your hands in the defence
of this honorable Title, than tamely to part with your Birth-right, and to outlive the
loss of your Priviledges and Liberty with shame and infamy. The second is, that you
will consider the friendship the King my Master has towards you, who pretends to no
other advantage from you, than that your amity be reciprocal to his, and that since he
has generously taken you into his protection, you will have this confidence in him,
that he will never forsake you: for should you go less in your resolution for one little
blow of fortune, consider with what contempt the whole world will look upon you;
there is not a Prince upon the earth that will aid and assist you, should they once disover

you to continue firm and constant, and approve your selves magnanimous and
faithful in adversity, when you shall hear news of the loss of the Battail, which I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much fear you will soon do, considering the resolution Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
though God of his goodness divert the misfortune. The third is, that you will
consider in what a height of reputation your forefathers liv'd and dy'd, which also
they have left you to inherit, that you may for ever carry the name of the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and warlike people of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and have moreover left behind them honorable
memory of the Battails they have won of those of their own Nation. You also derive
your selves from the antient warlike <hi>Romans,</hi> and pretend to be their true legitimate
Sons, giving their antient arms, which is the Wolf with <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> Founders
of their proud City, the Metropolis of the World.<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Montlue</hi> is a little mistaken in this point, for the <hi>Siennois</hi> are not descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the antient <hi>Romans</hi> but from the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
                           </note> I therefore most earnestly beseech you
Gentlemen, that you will call to mind who you are, and what your Progenitors have
ever been; which title of honor should you once lose, what a shame and infamy would
it be to your famous Ancestors, and what cause will your children have to curse the
hour that ever they were descended of such Fathers, who have abandon'd their Liberty,
to submit their necks to the yoke of servitude and subjection? The fourth thing I
have to trouble you withal is to remonstrate to you, that as I have an entire confidence,
you will manifest your valour and vertue upon this occasion, you in order thereunto
will suddainly think of making provision of all things necessary to the conservation of
your City; for the Battail I already give you for lost, not that it will nevertheless pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from any default in Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> but from the losses we have sustein'd
in the several skirmishes that have been fought before <hi>Mauchaut,</hi> it being impossible
by reason thereof, but that our people must be mightily Crest-fallen and dejected, and
those of the Enemy in greater heart and courage. 'Tis an effect of victory to be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fear is the issue of misfortune and disgrace; neither do the little losses in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,
which are the usual forerunners of a Battail, ever portend any thing but disaster
and ruine. On the other side also, those who retire must of necessity shew their backs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105656:74"/>
to the Enemy; where, although they often face about, yet must they still make for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
where it will be impossible but they must meet with some hedge or ditch, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which they must of necessity pass in disorder; for upon a Retreat every one will

the Battail that <hi>Hannibal</hi> gain'd of the <hi>Romains</hi> at <hi>Cannee</hi> near to <hi>Rome.</hi>

<hi>Romans</hi> who were at home in the City never suspected it possible that their people

terror, that the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> remain'd for three dayes and three nights wide open,

will send us shall arrive; for he is not so inconsiderable a Prince, but that as he has had
the power to send you these aids that are already come, he is yet able to send you more;
and moreover command your three Standard-bearers to have all their Companies in a

my lodging, in expectation of such news as God shall please to send us, and you I hope
in the mean time will take present order about such things as I have put you in mind
of, in which assurance, for the service of the King my Master, and particularly your
own, I make you a tender not only of the little experience God has given me, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over

fortune soever God should be pleased to send them, and to eat to their very children,
before they would for any misfortune that should befall them, depart from the Amity

speeches, that they were a people very well resolv'd to defend their liberty, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
inviolate the friendship they had promised and sworn to me. A resolution at which
indeed I was mightily well pleased. They immediately then caused proclamation to
be made, upon which every one ran to the field to fetch in what they had, and about
five a clock in the Evening arrived Captain <hi>Cambas,</hi> Camp-Master to the French Infantry,
who came to bring me news that the Battail was lost, and Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> wounded
to death,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>August</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

night all those of the Army who had escap't the Battail would be at the Gates of <hi>Sienna.</hi>
I leave any one to judge what a condition I was in, being sick of a Fever and a Dissente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
seeing our General dead, or what was as bad, it being not above fourteen or fifteen
dayes since I arrived in this Republick, not having any acquaintance with any one person
in the City, and consequently not knowing who were good Frenchmen, and who were
not. Time is requir'd to the knowledge of men. Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> had left me but
five Italian Companies, of which I did not know so much as one Captain, and those he
had left in the Citadel and the Fort of <hi>Camolia,</hi> which were the Keys of the City. I then
sent Captain <hi>Cambas</hi> to carry the news to the Senate, who were nothing dismai'd at it,
but told him that three or four dayes before I had remonstrated to them, that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
would be dangerous; and that although by what I had said to them they had give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the Battail for lost, they would nevertheless nothing after the good inclination they had
for the King, nor despair of being reliev'd by him.</p>
            <p>Do not think it strange (fellow Captains) if foreseeing the loss of a Battail, I also fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
it to the <hi>Siennois,</hi> which I did, not to dishearten, but to assure them, to the end
that the sudden news thereof might not strike a general astonishment throughout the whole
City; 'twas this mad them resolve, this made them take counsel to prepare themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in my opinion men do better in expecting the worst, than in being over confident of
their Fortune. Upon what I had said to them every one put on a resolution to die in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105656:74"/>
defence of their walls, and every thing was presently brought into the City. At break of
day in the morning the Infantry arriv'd, for Cavalry were gone away with Monsieur
<hi>de Strozzy;</hi> neither had there indeed at <hi>Sienna</hi> been any thing for the horses to eat. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Rheincroc,</hi> and Signior <hi>Cornelio Bentivoglio</hi> came to my lodgings, where amongst us
it was determin'd, that the <hi>Rheincroc</hi> should out of ten Ensigns that he had make six
Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> six of <hi>Italians,</hi> and Captain <hi>Cambas</hi> six of <hi>French,</hi> and that all the rest
should be sent away to <hi>Montalsin.</hi> The Foot were never permitted to enter the Town,
till first the Election was made, and with the remainder we also sent away five Ensigns of
<hi>Italians</hi> to goe to the said <hi>Montalsin:</hi> to which place I writ to Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>
(upon the assurance Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> had given me that there was yet hopes of his life)
to give him an account of the order I had taken, which he did also very well approve.
The Marquis knew not how to follow his victory,<note place="margin">The Marquis <hi>de Marignan</hi> knows not how to make use of his victory.</note> which if he had, all the Army had
been cut to pieces, and all the earth could not have sav'd Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to a cruel death by the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> 'Tis the ordinary fault of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
You Generals of Armies therefore that shall come after us, learn to be wise at the
expence of so many others, and suffer not your selves to be so far transported with joy
for the winning of a Battail, that you forget to improve it to the utmost; follow your blow,
and do not give your Enemy leisure to recollect himself. The Marquis came not till the
next day to <hi>Lusignano,</hi> for he fear'd lest Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> might again rally his Army,
considering that he had lost none of his horse, and not knowing him to be wounded,
and came not of three dayes before <hi>Sienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not undertake to give any account how this Battail was fought, nor how it
was lost; both because I was not present there, and that also there is some dispute about
it, and various reports made of those who had done well and ill. This is like a trial at

away post to <hi>Rome</hi> for Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> to come and command there; who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
being come as far as <hi>Montalsin,</hi> he was there advised to go by night, and on foot
with two Guides and one Servant, and to balk the great high-wayes, by which means he
might the better escape the Enemies Guards: but as he was come hard by <hi>Sienna,</hi> he
was there met by some Soldiers who were going to the warre,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> taken prisoner.</note> by them taken and carried
to the Marquis, and by him sent away to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he remained prisoner during all

ill advised, for he might have past well enough, had he known how to carry his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Had he come I do certainly believe I had died; for I had then had nothing to
do, whereas my mind was so wholly taken up with the care of my business, that I had
not leisure to think of my disease. Monsieur <hi>de Fourqueva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x</hi> was wounded, and taken
prisoner at this Battail, and Captain <hi>Balleron</hi> Colonel of the French Foot, with several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to the number of betwixt four and five thousand. 'Twas said that Monsieur <hi>de
Strozzy</hi> in his own person, behav'd himself like a brave and valiant Leader. And this
was the success of this unfortunate Battail.</p>
            <p>This History may serve for exemple to such as have a vanity in making retreats in the
face of an Enemy, and I should ever advise that they would rather put it to the push of
a Battail, than to retire after this manner; for I find nothing in the whole practice of
Arms so difficult as a retreat. Of this that of the Constable at <hi>St. Quentin</hi> gives us more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
sufficient proof; a man who in his time had known both how to shew, and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commanders what they ought to do, though such was his misfortune here, that he
could not make use of those precepts himself had at other times give to others. Though
I must nevertheless needs say, that had he been well seconded by the Captains of Foot,
who were without with him, he might perhaps have made his retreat; for they had only
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105656:75"/>
needed to hazard three or four hundred Harquebuzeers with the Mareschal <hi>de St. André,</hi>
who might very well have kept the Count <hi>d' Aignemont</hi> from seeing the disorder that was
amongst the Baggage, which was yet mixt with the horse, and he would never have charg'd
the said Mareschal, had he been sustein'd by the Harquebuzeers, forasmuch as the said
Count had no foot at all,<note place="margin">The Constable defeated at <hi>St. Quentin.</hi>
               </note> and the Constable had had above half an hours time wherein
to be gaining ground, as he had already begun to do, and had recover'd the wood to
save his Infantry, and so had retir'd with all the Cavalry to <hi>la Fere,</hi> by which means
they could have lost no more than the Harquebuzeers, and part of the Mareschal's horse
only; which it had been much better to do, than to lose the General, and all, as they did.
I have since talkt with several of the Foot Officers, who are yet living, and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to them what a riddle this business was to all men of understanding, telling them
that I at the age of eighteen or nineteen only had very well discover'd in the retreat of
Captain <hi>Carbon</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Grammont,</hi> at <hi>St. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ean de Luz,</hi> that a small party was
to be hazarded to save all, of which I my self had had experience, as I have writ in the
beginning: but they excused themselves upon the Camp-Master, and laid all the blame
to him, which was all they had to say for themselves. All these exemples I have set down
that they may be of use to others for the time to come, and cannot forbear often to repeat,
and much to insist upon the fault committed by these kind of retreats, by reason of the
great inconveniencies that ensue upon them, to the loss of a Battail. It were not worth
so much repentance, if they were resolv'd upon a Battail, and to fight it out, that every
one might do his best: but to be beaten when they have a mind to retire, and apparently
decline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighting is intolerable.</p>
            <p>You Generals and Lieutenants of Provinces may here see of what importance these errors
are; when that of <hi>St. Quentin</hi> put the whole Kingdom in danger, and was the occasion
that we quitted all our Conquests; and this put the King's affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> in a very ill
condition. Be not then asham'd to cover your designs with the shades of night, which
is so far from being shameful, that it is on the contrary honorable to fool and deceive your
Enemy, that watches an opportunity to do you a mischief; and who when the day appears
shall find nothing but the empty nest, and the birds flown and gone: it is a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shame and dishonor to you to be beaten turning your backs. If you be so nice of your
honor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

least to play your game above board as they say.</p>
            <p>Now the Marquis lodg'd the Tertia of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that made the Marquis proceed with so much leisure and moderation, was that he waited

of some old houses, where he staid holding his horse in his hand. The noise was so

Two or three hundred <hi>Italians</hi> of ours recover'd the walls of <hi>Sienna,</hi> others fled away
twelve miles from thence, and old Captains too, whom the Mareschal very much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd:
but the bravest men in the world having once lost their judgment, and giving
all for lost, know not where they are. By this you may see how great the dangers of
war are, and how infamous a thing it is to run away, without first seeing an apparent
danger. During this bustle the day began to appear, when <hi>Serillac</hi> remaining upon the
place, found he had lost no more than three or four of his Troop only, who were also run
away with the Foot: but I believe there were not many left of the other Troop, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only a Lieutenant to command them. Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> hearing now no more
noise, with much ado again mounted on horseback, beginning to discover our Cavalry,
and was looking if he could find <hi>Serillac</hi> amongst the dead bodies: when seeing him
come to him,<note place="margin">

and so they marcht together straight towards the City. Now I must needs say
that Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> herein committed one of the greatest follies that any man in his
command ever did, as I have told him an hundred times since; for he knew very well,
that had he been taken all the world could not have sav'd him from being put to an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious
death by the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> so profest and inveterate a hatred he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
against him. And although <hi>Serillac</hi> be my Nephew, I may with truth give
him this honor and commendation, that he was the only cause of Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>'s
safety; which I may the better be bold to write, because Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> himself
told me so. His Troop indeed was a very good one, being for the greatest part <hi>Gascons</hi>
and <hi>French;</hi> for it was the old Company of Monsieur <hi>de Cypierre.</hi> Of Captains there
came to the Town only <hi>Caraffa,</hi> who was since Cardinal, and another, as I was told,
whose name I have forgot, and two or three hundred Soldiers, whom Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> would not suffer to come into the Town, but that night sent them away with
the aforesaid Captain, and kept <hi>Caraffa</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>So soon as Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> came into the City he presently enquir'd how I did,
and was answer'd, that for three or four dayes they had begun to conceive some hopes
of my life,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> goes to visit the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> in <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> whereupon he came and alighted at my lodging, the Bishop and the said
Gentleman being with him, where he found me so miserably worn away, that my bones
had pierc't through my skin in several parts of my body. He comforted me after the
best manner he could, and there staid twelve dayes expecting how God would dispose
of me; when seeing me from day to day recover strength, and grow into a better posture
of health, he resolv'd the thirteenth day in the beginning of the night to depart, without
acquainting any one with his intention but my self only. A little before he took horse
he and the Bishop came to take their leaves of me, knowing very well that his being
there would cause the Marquis to proceed with greater vigour against the Town, and
also that being abroad he might find some way or other to relieve me; where at parting
I promised and assured him to hold out to the last gasp.</p>
            <p>The Mareschal had set Guards upon all the Roads to catch him,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> goes out of <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> but he chose to retire
by a way, by which of all other the Mareschal never suspected he would attempt to
pass; for he went out at the Port <hi>Camoglia,</hi> from whence he descended on the right hand
down into the Valley, leaving the Fort of <hi>Camoglia</hi> above, and going all along by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
towards the Palace of <hi>Dian.</hi> During his stay in <hi>Sienna</hi> he perfectly recover'd of his
wounds, so that he arm'd, and mounted himself upon a good horse. He met by the way
fourty or fifty of the Enemies foot, which gave him some alarm, but he still held on his
way, without losing any but some few servants only belonging to some Gentlemen
who went out of the City to attend him. It was not however without peril. In
a few dayes he escap't three great dangers. A little after his departure I recover'd my
health, and caused my self to be carried in a Chair about the Town. The Marquis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
no time, shut us up on every side, and every day we had very handsome skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes:
but I knew very well that the Marquis would have me for want of bread;
which was the reason that I made this Harangue to the Captains, whom I had assembled
together to that effect.</p>

                        <p>I believe there is none of us who does not desire to come off from this
Siege with honor and repute; the thirst of honor has brought us hither. You see we
are here shut up for a long time, for we are not to imagine that the Enemy will ever
rise from before us, till he have us by one way or another, seeing upon the reducing of
this place depends his victory. You see also that the King is at a great distance from
us, and that therefore of a long time it will not be possible for him to relieve us, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as he must of necessity draw our succours from <hi>Germany,</hi> and out of his own
Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> themselves without the help of others not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to raise the Enemies Siege, who have not only the Forces of <hi>Italy,</hi>
but moreover of almost all other Nations. Now in expectation of this relief we are to have a long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in husbanding as much as is possible our provisions; in order whereunto I am to
tell you, that I have deliberated to lessen the Size of bread from four and twenty, to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to them how far we are distant from the King; that his Majesty cannot suddenly-relieve
us, and that you will rather die of famine, than that it shall be laid in your
dish, that had you had the patience to lessen your diet the Town had not been lost. It
would be an infamous reproach to have it said, that you fill'd your bellies to starve
your honor; you have not shut your selves up within these walls to occasion the loss
and ruine of the City, but to defend and to save it. Represent to them that they are
here amongst strange Nations, where they may set a mark of honor upon their own.
What glory do men acquire, when they not only obtain honor and esteem for their
own particular persons, but moreover for the Nation from whence they come? 'Tis
what a generous heart should principally propose to himself for the reward of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and suffering. You <hi>Germans</hi> shall return home proud of the hardships you have
sustein'd, and the dangers you have undergone, and we <hi>Frenchmen</hi> also: and as for
you who are <hi>Italians,</hi> you shall acquire this renown, with invincible courages to have

long patience, in giving the King my Master time to relieve us; and believe I beseech you,
that his most Christian Majesty will in nothing fail of the friendship he has promised
and sworn to you. If you remonstrate all this to your Soldiers, and that they see and
know, that you your selves are thus resolv'd, I am assur'd they will follow the same
wayes you take. Therefore, Gentlmen, never think to excuse your selves upon them; I
have never known a mutiny happen (and yet I have seen many) thorough Soldiers alone,
if they were not by their Officers set on, and encourag'd to it, If you lead them the
way, there is nothing they will not do, no incommodity they will not suffer. Do it
then I beseech you, or resolve betimes to discover the bottom of your hearts, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell us you have no mind to undergo the length and inconveniencies of a Siege, that
such as had rather dishonourably spend their time in eating and drinking, than stake
their persons upon an account of honor, may depart, and not divert others from nobler
resolutions.</p>

                        <p>had Almighty God been pleased sooner to restore to me my health and
memory, I had sooner thought of what we are to do for the conservation of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the defence of this City. You have all seen how I have by sickness been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
to the very door of death, and how God at last has rather by miracle than any
operation of Nature raised me up again, to do yet more service for this Republick in such
and so great a necessity. Now, Gentlemen, I very well see, that the conservation of
your City and Liberty consists in nothing but the making your provisions hold out;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105656:76"/>
for should the Marquis attempt to have us by force, we shall I hope give him such an
entertainment as shall make him curse the hour that ever he came to besiege <hi>Sienna:</hi>
but I perce he has no mind to go that way to work; on the contrary he intends to
reduce us by famine; against which we must if possible provide, and defeat him of that
expectation. I yesterday called together the Colonel of the <hi>Germans</hi> and his Captains,
Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> here present with his, and <hi>Combas</hi> also with his <hi>French</hi> Officers; to
whom I remonstrated, that to prolong time, and to give the most Christian King lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to relieve us, it would be necessary to lessen the Soldiers bread, from four and
twenty to twenty ounces. Telling them that so soon as all the world should know,
and particularly the King, that we are resolv'd to hold out to the last morsel, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
his Majesty to fall speedily in hand with levying of succours, that so many brave men
may not be lost, and that he may not seem to abandon those he has taken into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in a time of the greatest necessity and danger. Now, by what I have been told
you have, during the time of my extremity, taken account of your provisions, and have
only found so much as to last to the fifteenth of <hi>November.</hi> Of which you have also
sent word to his Majesty, a thing that may very well give him occasion to grow cold
in sending us relief, considering the great distance betwixt him and us, and that also
Winter is drawing on. Armies do not fly, nor ride post. His succours will be worthy
a great Prince, suitable to the friendship he bears to you, and sufficient to force the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
from your Walls, and therefore cannot so suddenly be set on foot. Now (Gentlemen)
after I had remonstrated thus much to the Captains, I found them all ready to suffer to
the last gasp of their lives, and Nation for Nation went to make the same Remonstrance
to their Soldiers, whom they found all willing to have patience, and so have both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and sworn.<note place="margin">Order propos'd by the Sieur <hi>de Mountluc</hi> to the <hi>Siennois.</hi>
                           </note> See then what you <hi>Siennois</hi> ought to do, seeing it concerns the loss

no good usage, having put your selves under the King's protection. I beseech you
therefore, that since we who have nothing here to lose, neither wives nor fires have
shew'd you the way, you will consider of it, to regulate the expence, and appoint
Commissaries to take an account of all the corn you have in the City, and also of the
mouths; and this being done, begin to reduce your bread to fifteen ounces, for it is not
possible, but you must have some little conveniency in your houses, that the Soldiers
cannot have. And of all this good order I shall advertize the King's Ministers at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and from thence shall cause a Gentleman to go on forwards to the King himself, to the
end that his Majesty may judge what time he may have wherein to relieve us, and for
the rest rely upon me, who will have no more priviledge than the meanest Citizen. The

reposed in him of a certain relief, and immediately went about taking of order for the

other provision,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de L'Escus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to hinder any from bringing us in any provisions, and as many Countrymen as were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
attempting so to do, were immediately hang'd without mercy. <hi>L'Escussan</hi> went
first to <hi>Montalsin,</hi> there to give Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> an account of all proceedings, that
he might give notice thereof to the King's Ministers at <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence went to
his Majesty to represent unto him the miserable condition of the <hi>Siennois,</hi> as I had given
him in charge to do, and this might be about the middle of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this time forward I could do nothing worth speaking of until <hi>Christmas</hi> Eve,
saving that a little after the departure of the said <hi>l'Escussan,</hi> we again abated the Soldiers
bread to eighteen ounces, and that of the City to fourteen, though all the while there
were frequent skirmishes, and very handsomely fought on both sides. Upon <hi>Christmas</hi>

Trumpets sent me half a Stag, six Capons, six Partridges, six Borachio's of excellent wine,
and six loaves of white bread, wherewith the next day to keep the Feast. I did nothing,
wonder at this courtesie, because in the extremity of my sickness he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

laden with Greek wine, which was sent me by the Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> my people
having sent the Cardinal word, that in the height of my sickess I talkt of nothing but
drinking a little Greek wine. Whereupon he so order'd the business, that the Cardinal
<hi>de Medici</hi> writ to the Marquis his Brother to suffer it to come in to me, it being sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of making me a Bath. The wine came at a time when I was at the last gasp,
and so was not deliver'd to me; but the half of it divided amongst the big-bellied wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Town. Whilest Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> was there I gave him three or four
bottles of it, the rest I drank as they do Hippocras in the Mornings. All these civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
I had receiv'd from the Marquis before, which made me nothing wonder at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
he sent me now: Part of which I sent to the Seigneury, part to the <hi>Rheincroc,</hi> and
the rest I reserv'd for Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> the Count <hi>de Gayas,</hi> and my self, because we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

betwixt the greatest Enemies; if there be no thing particular betwixt them, as there was
not betwixt us two. He serv'd his Master, and I serv'd mine: He ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a strange thing, that above a month before my mind gave me, and seem'd
to presage that the Marquis would give me a Scalado, and the Captain <hi>St. Auban</hi> would
be cause of the loss of the Fort. This was evermore running in my head, and that the
<hi>Germans</hi> also would occasion the loss of the Cittadel, into which an Ensign of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
every night entred, to keep Guard there; and that was the reason why I plac't an
Ensign of <hi>Siennois</hi> in Guard overagainst the Gate of the Cittadel. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
so far with the <hi>Rheincroc,</hi> that he promised him that in case of an Alarm, and that
the Enemy should offer an assault to the Cittadel, the German Captain that he plac't
there every night upon the Guard should from him have command to let in the <hi>Siennois</hi> to
help to defend it, though I think he that night forgot so to do. Every night I went to see
a Company of <hi>French</hi> Foot mount the Guard in the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> and another of <hi>Sien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> betwixt the Fort and the Gate of the City, under a great Market-house, which on the
two sides was enclosed with a little Trench; but in the front of it, which went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Fort, it was all plain with the pavement, and it might be from this Court of
Guard to the Fort threescore or fourscore paces, and as much to the Gate of the City. I
plac't this Guard there for two reasons, whereof one was to relieve the Fort if occasion
should be, as the other Company of <hi>Siennois</hi> was to do the Cittadel, and the other to
watch that the Enemy did not storm the Wall of the City; forasmuch as on the left hand, at
the going out of the Town, the wall was very low, and moreover a part thereof fallen down.

or half pace, where the Soldiers had so much room only as to sustein themselves upon
their knees. The Enemy had another Fort three times as big as ours, and just opposite
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105656:77"/>
to it, within an hundred and fifty paces the one of the other. So that neither they nor
we durst pop up a head without being hurt from that Quarter; and in ours there was
a little Tower exactly overagainst theirs, where for greater security we had evermore thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
or four Soldiers which serv'd us for Centinels, and who got up into it by a little hand
ladder, as they do into a Pidgeon-house. The said Tower had been broke through on that
side towards the Enemies Fort, and we had there plac't barrels fill'd with earth, for the
hole had been made by the Artillery from their Fort. Which Fort of theirs Monsieur
<hi>de Termes</hi> had caused to be made; but when he went away it was not wholly finish't:
nevertheless when the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> broke with the King, the Marquis in one night
made a very long march, carrying a great number of Pioneers along with him, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself of it (for there was no Guard kept there) immediately put it into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Now, as I have said before, at one of the clock in the night the Marquis at once
gave me a Scalado<note place="margin">The Scalado;</note> both to the Cittadel and the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> where by ill luck the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>St. Auban</hi> was this night upon duty. The Marquis with the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Foot assaulted the Cittadel, where by good fortune they had but three Ladders
long enough, and at the very first so overcharg'd those three with men, that one of them
broke. Our <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> presented themselves at the Gate, as
they were appointed to do. But the Captain of the <hi>Germans</hi> who had the command of
the Gate would by no means let them in.<note place="margin">The Citadel seaz'd.</note> This dispute lasted for above half an hour,
during which five or six of the Enemy entred, and forc't the <hi>Germans,</hi> who began to
turn their backs and fly. They then open'd the Gate to the <hi>Siennois,</hi> who ran to the
head of the Cittadel, where the Enemy began to enter, and met these five or six, who
were already entred, whom they cut in pieces, two of them being the Marquis his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
one whereof did not immediately die; and this cool'd the courage of the rest
who were upon the point to enter. At the same time they gave a Scalado to the Fort
<hi>Camoglia. St. Auban</hi> was in the City, in bed at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase, and his Lieutenant call'd <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borcy</hi>
was at the Fort, a young man of no experience; but that I think had he had good
men in his Company would have done his duty. They are both of them turn'd Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
since. So soon as the Enemy presented their Ladders by the three Courtins, all his
Company betook them to their heels, and the Enemy consequently entred in; and of
the four that were in the Tower, three threw themselves headlong down, and the fourth
beat down the barrels from the hole, and drew the Enemy in.<note place="margin">The Fort <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moglia seaz'd</hi> by the Enemy.</note> This Rogue had been
taken a few dayes before, and had remain'd above ten dayes prisoner, and I do believe
it was upon his account that the Marquis resolv'd upon this Scalado; for he went away
with them, and we never saw him after. Now Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi>
were lodg'd near unto the Port <hi>Camoglia,</hi> who immediately upon the Alarm ran to the
Gate, where they found the greatest part of the Company of the <hi>Siennois</hi> before it, and
the rest were firing at the Enemy, who fallyed out of the Fort to fall upon them. Signior
<hi>Cornelio</hi> then left the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> at the Gate, and came running to give me the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm,
where he met me coming out of my lodging with two Pages, each of them carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Torches, and whom I immediately sent back, bidding him both he and the
Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> to go out, and of all things to take care that the <hi>Siennois</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their Court of Guard, and to encourage them the best he could, for I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
come out after him. He did as I bid him, and came in so opportune a season, that
he found all abandoned, and gave the Enemy a charge with the <hi>Siennois,</hi> and beat them
back into the Fort they had taken. The Alarm was already throughout the whole City,
and some ran to the Cittadel, and others to the Fort of <hi>Camoglia.</hi> As I arriv'd at the
Gate there came to me <hi>la Moliere</hi> and <hi>l' Espine,</hi> both on horseback, the one being Muster-Master,
and the other Treasurer, whom I commanded, the one to the Port <hi>St. Mark,</hi>
and the other to <hi>Port<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t some in the Town might have
intelligence with the Enemy, who hearing this cry would not dare to discover themselves.
In the mean time I was at the Gate of the City,<note place="margin">A device to break Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</note> sending out the Captains and French

               </gap>iers to succour Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and when I saw there were enow gone out, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Lieutenant of Captain <hi>Lussan</hi> to stay at the Gate, and to shut the Wicker so
soon as ever I was out, and that in case I should be beaten back, he should by no
means open it, but rather suffer us all to be killed without, and me in the first place. I
then went out with my four Torches, and found Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> the Count <hi>de Gayas,</hi>
and the other Captains I had sent out, who had recovered the Rampire, and had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Soldiers upon the little half pace upon their knees, who shot at the Enemy into
the Fort, and they again at ours, who could not put up their heads without being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105656:78"/>
and on the other two sides the Enemy assaulted, and ours defended. Now whilst
I was putting the men out at the Wicket <hi>St. Auban</hi> slipt by without my seeing him.
The Gate into the Fort which we had lost was contrived after the manner of a hole,
having one step forwards, and another one side, waving and winding to and fro,
and so straight that one man only could enter a breast, In this Entry <hi>I found Captain
Bourg,</hi> who was Ensign to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Gayas close</hi>
by him. Monsieur <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> Master of the Ordnance was always with me, and
one of his Canoneers. I saw very well that the fight was like to continue, and fearing
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st our powder should fail us, bad Monsieur <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> dispatch away two of his
Canoneers to fetch more, which he did, and I dare boldly say, he was as much the cause
of our safety as all our fighting, as you shall hear. Those that we fought withal were
<hi>Italians,</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> stormed the Cittadel.
I continually ran first to
one, and then to another, crying out to them <hi>Courage friends, courage camrades,</hi> and
presently on that side on the right hand of the Gate, where the three forenamed stood,
I spyed <hi>St: Auban,</hi> to whom (running to him, and setting the point of my sword to his
throat, I said <hi>Rogue! Son of a whore! thou art the cause that we shall lose the City, which

not immediately leap into the Fort:</hi> to which <hi>(sufficiently terrified)</hi> he made answer, <hi>Yes
Sir, I will leap in,</hi> and then called to him <hi>Lussan, Blagon,</hi> and <hi>Combas,</hi> who were his
Companions, saying to them, <hi>Come on Camrades, second me, I pray leap in after me;</hi>
to which they made answer, <hi>Do thou leap, and we will follow;</hi> whereupon I said to him,
<hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> no care, I will follow thee my self,</hi> and we all set foot upon the half pace with
him, and immediately after his first step, without any more delaying (for if he had
he had died for't) he threw himself desperately in, having a Target upon his arm,
and his Companions also, for he was no sooner in the air, but the rest were also with
him, and so all four leapt in together, and it was within two steps of the Entry, that
<hi>le Bourg,</hi> Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> disputed. I then immediately made
fifteen or twenty Soldiers leap in after the four Captains, and as all these were within,
<hi>le Bourg,</hi> Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> passed and entred into the Fort. I
caused the Torches to be set upon the Rampire, that we might see, and not kill one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and my self entred by the same way Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> had gone before me. Now
neither Pikes, Halberts, nor Harquebuzes could serve us for any use here, for we were at
it with Swords and Steeletto's, with which we made them leap over the Curtains by the
same way they had entred, excepting those who were killed within. There were yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
some remaining in the Tower, when Captain <hi>Charry</hi> came up to us, though but eight
days before he had received an Harquebuz shot in his head, and such a one as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we had given him for dead, notwithstanding there he was with his Sword and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
and a Morrion upon his head, ever the Cap that cover'd his wound: a good heart
will ever manifest itself; for though he was desperately hurt, yet would he have his
share of the fight.<note place="margin">The Fort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> I was at the foot of the Ladder, and had sent Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and
the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> out of the Fort, to encourage those who defended the Flanks, bidding
them take the one the one side, and the other the other, as they did, and found work
enough to do. I then took Captain <hi>Charry</hi> by the hand, and said, <hi>Captain</hi> Charry, <hi>I have
bred you up to die in some brave service for the King, you must mount the first;</hi> which said,
he (who was certainly a man of as much courage as ever any man had) without any
more dispute began to climb the Ladder,<note place="margin">The courage of Captain <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </note> which could not be above ten or twelve staves,
and he was to enter by a Trap-door above, as I have said before. I had very good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers,
whom I made continually to shoot at the hole of this Trap-door, and put
two of the said Harquebuzeers upon the Ladder to follow after him: I had two Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with me (for the other two Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and the Count had taken along with
them) by the light whereof we saw so clearly, that the Harquebuzeers did not hurt to
Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> who mounted step by step, still giving our Harquebuzeers time to fire,
and so soon as he came to thrust up his head into the Trap-door, they fir'd two Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzes,
which pierced through his Target and Morrion without touching his head. The
Harquebuzeer who followed next after him discharged his Harquebuz under his Target<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by which means Captain <hi>Charry</hi> advanced the last step, and so they all three leapt in the
one after the other, where they kill'd three of the Enemy, and the rest leapt out at the
hole. Those in the Flancks were also beaten off, and so our Fort was regain'd on every
side.</p>
            <p>Now the Marquis had given order to him that commanded at the Scalado of the Fort,
which was the Governor of their Fort of <hi>Camoglia,</hi> that in case he the Marquis should
first enter by the Cittadel, that then he should come away to him with all his <hi>Italians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105656:78"/>
and if also he should first gain the Fort, that then he would come with his <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and <hi>Germans</hi> to relieve him. According to this Agreement, so soon as the Governor of
the Fort had gain'd ours, he presently sent to acq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l and the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> the said Marquis
could not come so soon as he would, though he had made so good haste, that when we
had thought all had been at an end,<note place="margin">The Marquis <hi>de Marignan</hi> comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his men at the Fort <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moglia.</hi>
               </note> we saw their whole Camp coming upon us, having

two Canoneers return'd with the powder, which in great haste we divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, and it lasted till the day took them off. They there
committed one of the greatest pieces of folly that ever men did; for by the light of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
torches we saw them more plainly than if it had been broad day, whereas had they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the advantage of the night,<note place="margin">Error of the Marquis.</note> and advanced with few lights, they had put us a great
deal more hardly to't than they did. The two hundred <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent for, for we had use for it all before we parted, by reason of the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the fight, where it was well assaulted, and better defended.</p>
            <p>This was the issue of the fight, the greatest, and of the greatest duration without a
Battail wherein I have ever been, and where I believe God Almighty did as much assist
me, if not more, preserving my judgment allthe while entire, as at any time in my whole
life; for had I fail'd in the least particle of command we had all been lost, and the City
to boot; for on that side we had not fortified at all, and all our confidence was in
this Fort: I prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st to God, that for at least three months after my hair stood an end, so
oft as I called to mind the danger we had been in. The Enemy there lost six hundred
men killed and wounded, as we were enform'd by prisoners we took, and we lost but an
hundred and fifty in all both hurt and slain. That which made them lose so many
was the light of the Torches, which gave our men such aim that they could not miss, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
being within a Pikes distance or two at the most of the one another, which made a
great incongruity in the Marquis, as I said before: for we having but little light, and
they so much, we discovered them so plain, as gave us a mighty advantage. So soon
as it was fair light day we went to take a view of what dead we had in the Fort amongst
theirs, where I found my <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> and my Groom, who both leapt in after the
Captains; in my life I never had two better servants. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and the Count <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Gayas</hi> went likewise to visit the Cittadel, for I was no longer able to stand, being yet so
weak with my great sickness, that with a puff one might have blown me down; so that
I wonder how I was ever able to take such pains: but God redoubled my forces in time
of need; for in truth during all this great and tedious fight I never ceased running and
skipping, now here, now there, without ever feeling my self weary, till there appeared
no more an Enemy to molest us. They came and gave me an account of all that had past,
to be carried to their Lodging, and his wounds dressed.</p>
            <p>I will not forget to insert here for an Exemple to others, that if ever man was well se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
in a time of so great danger, I was, and would for no consideration deprive the
Chiefs who were there of their due honor, nor the common Soldiers: for from the time
that Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and the Count went out before me and charged the Enemy; neither
after I was gone out to them did so much as any one man ever offer to come in again (as
<hi>Lussan's</hi> Lieutenant, whom I had left at the Gate, swore to me) excepting <hi>Bossompierr</hi>'s
two Canoncers, who were sent for powder.<note place="margin">Loyalty of the <hi>Sie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </note> All the whole City remain'd in arms during
the whole time of the fight, and I will give the <hi>Siennois</hi> this commendation, with truth
(as God is true) that there was no so much as any one man, who staid in the houses, and
who did not take arms, both young and old, nor a man that discovered the least affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Emperor; which gave me a great assurance of two things, one of their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and the other of their Courage. Three dayes after the Marquis sent me a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105656:79"/>
(the same who had brought me the Present before) to see if any one of those was living
who had entred the Cittadel, and that he would not deny to me, but that there were two
of his Kinsmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> then carried him to look upon that who was yet alive,
and he prov'd to be one; whereupon the Trumpet immediately returned to the Marquis
to acquaint him with it, who at the same instant sent him back again, entreating me to
restore him back to him, and that he would be responsible to me for his ransome, which I
did in a Litter he had sent to that purpose: but he died three dayes after he came into
their Camp.</p>
            <p>Methinks you Governors of places ought here to take a fair exemle to present your
selves to the fight: For there are some who say, that a Governor, or a Lieutenant of a
Province never ought to hazard his own person, arguing that if he chance to miscarry all
is lost. I grant them, that he ought not to expose himself at all times, and upon every
light occasion, like an ordinary Captain; but when all lies at stake, what is it that you
are made Governors and Lieutenants for? what question will be made of your courage?
and how will your honor and reputation be brought into dispute? Will it think you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
you to say, I would not hazard my self in the fight, left losing my self I should
lose all: especially in the night to relieve a Fort or a Citadel, considering I was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
able to defend the Town? This excuse will not serve your turn; and believe me
the loss of a Fort is of so great importance, that your Enemy has by that means one
foot upon your throat already, you are therefore to die, or to recover what you lost,
as I did, having at my going out caused the Wicket to be shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, to take from us all hopes
of retreat, being resolv'd to die, or to expel the Enemy, and also letting them alone with
their Conquest I had been infallibly lost.</p>
            <p>And you Captains my Camrades, take notice and exemple by <hi>St. Auban,</hi> that you
may value valiant men above money, for the love of money will lead you to the loss
of your lives and reputations, and valiant men about you will defend both one and the

you can the great heart of <hi>Charry,</hi> who although half dead, would yet come to the fight,
and presented himself to enter the first, and pass by a Ladder through a hole, than which
a more dangerous passage could not possibly be; for in such a place an Enemy has a
mighty advantage. No danger nevertheless could deterre this brave Soldier from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the hazard. To conclude, I shall tell you Governors of places, that whenever you
entertain an ill opinion of an Officer, you provide against his remisness, cowardise, or

<hi>St. Auban</hi> being suspected to me, since I could not totally rid my hands of him, to have
employ'd him in some other place. It has since taught me to be wiser, and I have found
advantages by it, having never since that time entrusted any man of whom I had a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
There are wayes enow to shake them off, without either offending any other, or
disincouraging the party himself.</p>
            <p>A little after, as we understood, there came a Gentleman of the Emperor's Bed-Chamber,
who brought letters to the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and to the said Marquis, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he writ them word,<note place="margin">The Emperor complains of the Marquis his slow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> that he thought it very strange this War should continue so long,
and that he very well knew <hi>Sienna</hi> was not a place to resist Canon, but that it was the
Marquis his custom evermore to spin out a War in length. In answer whereunto the
Marquis remonstrated, that he had done all that in him possibly lay, and knew very
well that Artillery would not take the Town, for I had valiant men within, and the
whole City were resolute to stand to me to the last, speaking more honourably of me
than I deserv'd, commending my vigilancy, and the provision I had made for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
so that he very well knew by the good order I had taken in the City, he should
but lose so much time by attempting to batter. Notwithstanding the Gentleman being
come from the Emperor to this effect, and having already spoke with the Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> they together order'd it so, that they made the Marquis at last resolve upon a
Battery. He had before omitted nothing that a good Soldier ought to do, having coop't
us close in, without any hopes of relief, and yet he was accused of a design to protract
the War: But it is the ordinary reward of a man's endeavour, when things do not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to the appetite of such as talk of things at their cafe. The desires of those
we serve and fight for run a great deal faster than we are able to follow.</p>
            <p>About the twentith of <hi>January</hi> we had notice that the Artillery set out of <hi>Florence,</hi>
to the number of six or eight and twenty Canon,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siennois</hi> frighted with the coming of the Artillery.</note> or double Culverine to come to the
Camp. The <hi>Siennois</hi> hearing this news were so curious as to send out a spy, that they
might be certain of the truth of this report, who at his return bringing them word back,
that the Artillery was already come as far as <hi>Lusignano,</hi> it put the whole City into some
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105656:79"/>
apprehension, and made them resolve the next day to assemble all the Gentry and the
chief of the City to the Palace, there to determine amongst themselves, whether they
should abide the assault, or surrender upon composition. Now I was not to huffe and
vapour with these people, for they were stronger than I: I was therefore necessitated to
win them by gentle remonstrances, and civil perswasions, without the least heat or shew
of anger, and you may believe it was not without great violence to my own nature, that
I proceeded after this manner, contrary to my disposition, and the image the Constable
had represented of me to the King, as he had seen me in my younger and more precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
age. A prudent and staid Governor, when he is amongst strange Nations must try as
much as in him lies, to conform himself to the humour of the people with whom he has to
do.<note place="margin">A Governor ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himself to the humour of the people over whom he is placed.</note> With the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Swiss</hi> you must be cholerick and rough: with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> you

all the Gentry and the Heads of the Corporation were going to the Palace, <hi>Misser Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hispano,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Sienna,</hi> a principal man in the City, and one of the eight
of the Council of War, before he went to the Palace, came in all hast to speak with Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Cornelio,</hi> where he told him that all the chief of the City were summon'd to repair
to the Palace, and that it was to determine, whether they ought to stand out a Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that he had already heard that the major part of them had voted, that they ought to
condition, and not to endure a Battery, and an Assault, for fear they should come by the
worse; that he was now going thither to them, wherefore he entreated him to give me
notice of it. Hereupon Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> came to me, and found me ready to take horse
to go view the Guards: but so soon as he had told me the news we both went up into my
Chamber, where we long debated by what means we might divert this blow; and whilst
we were in this deliberation came Signior <hi>Bartolomeo Cavalcano,</hi> who told me as much
as I had heard before, and moreover, that he thought the resolution was already taken
throughout the whole City, and that he only went to the Palace, to cast in his lot, and
that after the lots should once be cast it would be too late to speak.</p>
            <p>We were all three in a very great straight, they which way to advise me, and I was as
much to seek whad advice to take. In the end I resolv'd to go to the Palace, and to take
with me the <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> and his Captains, Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> with his <hi>Italians,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Combas</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Officers. Our <hi>Germans</hi> began to suffer much for want of wine,
and their bread was very small, for as for flesh there was no more talk of any, unless of
some horse,<note place="margin">Great scarcity of all things in <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> or some ass, that was exposed to sell in the Butchery, and as for money there
was no such thing in nature; for Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> had no possible means to send any
in to us: all which consider'd, it put us into some fear, lest the <hi>Germans</hi> should joyn with
the City to enter into composition, which was the reason that I desired Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi>
to go to the <hi>Rhin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

bring his Captains along with him, and that he would in the mean time leave his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
and Ensigns every one in his own Quarters, to the end there might be no sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
about the Walls whilst we should be at the Palace: I wisht him also himself to do
the same, and order'd Captain <hi>Combas</hi> to come likewise, which being done, I sent <hi>Bartolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo</hi>
in all haste to the Palace, to try if he could secretly gain any one to his party that
might help to break this design: for I had an opinion, that if I could but divert this
one blow,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> I would deal with so many people afterwards, that the blancks should be the

further acquainted by me what I intended to do.</p>
            <p>I was yet so ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reamly lean, and worn with my late sickness, and the cold was at this
time of the year so very great and sharp, that I was constrained to go continually with
both my Body and my head so wrapt and muffled up in Furrs, that as they saw me go
up and down the streets of the City, no one had any hopes of my recovery, believing
that my inwards were decayed and perished, and that I would fall down and die on a
sudden. What shall we do said the Ladies and the Citizens Wives, what will become of
us if our Governor should die? we shall all be lost; for next after God all our hope is
in him; it is not possible he should escape. I do verify believe that the prayers of those
good women redeem'd me out of the extremity and languishing weakness I was in, I
mean that of my body; for as to the vigour of my mind, and the quickness of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nderstanding,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105656:80"/>
I never perceiv'd any decay there. Having then before been accustomed
to go so wrapt and mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

me in so lamentable a plight, I call'd for a pair of Breeches of Crimson Velvet, which I
had brought from <hi>Alba,</hi> said over with gold lace, finely cut, and very near, for I had
made them at a time when I was forsooth in love. We had there leisure enough for those

               </gap>es whilst we lay in Garrison, and having little else to do, it was fit to give the Ladies
some part of our time. I put on a Doublet of the same, under which I had a Shirt fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrought with crimson silk and gold twist very rich: (for in those dayes they wore
the neck-bands of their Shirts a good way falling over the collar) I then took a buffe
Collar, over which I put on the Gorget of my Arms, which was very finely gilt. I at
that time wore gray and white,<note place="margin">A pleasant Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> in honor of a fair Lady to whom I was a Servant when I
had leisure; I therefore put on a Hat of gray silk of the German fashion, with a great
silver Hatband, and a plume of Heron's feathers, thick set with silver spangles; the Hats
they wore in those dayes were not so broad as they wear them now: I than put on a
short Cassock of gray Velvet garnisht with little plaits of Silver, at two fingers distance
from one another, and lin'd with cloth of silver, all open betwixt the plaits, vvhich I
vvore in <hi>Piedmont</hi> over my Arms. Now I had yet two little bottles of Greek wine left
of those had been sent me by the Cardinal of <hi>Armag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and vvith them rubbed my face, till I had brought a little colour into my cheeks, and
then drank a small draught with a little bit of bread, after which I look't my self in
the Glass. I swear to you I did not know my self, and methought I vvas yet in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
and in love as heretofore. At which I could not forbear laughing, for methought
I had got on a sudden quite another face.</p>
            <p>The first that came to me vvith his Captains vvas Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and the Count <hi>de
Gayas,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bossompierre</hi> and the Count <hi>de Bisque,</hi> whom I had also sent for;
vvho finding me dress'd after this manner, all fell a laughing. I strutted up and down
the room before them like fifteen <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and yet had not strength enough to have
kill'd a Chicken, for I vvas so vveak as nothing more. <hi>Combas</hi> and the French Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
came also, and the vvhole Farce tended to nothing but laughter for all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
the last that came vvas the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>intcroc</hi> and his Captains, vvho seeing me in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
laught to that excess that he sobb'd again, when pulling him by the arm, I said to
him, <hi>What Colonel, do you think me to be that</hi> Montluc <hi>that goes every day dying through
the streets? No, no, you are mistaken, that fellow's dead, and I am another</hi> Montluc <hi>sprung
up in his room.</hi> His Interpeter told him what I said, which made him laugh still more,
and Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> had already acquainted him with the reason why I had sent for him,
and that it was necessary by one means or another to disposses the <hi>Siennois</hi> of their fear.
Thus then we went all on horseback to the Palace, where so soon as we were got up to
the top of the stairs, we found the great Hall full of Gentlmen, and such other Burgers
of the City as were of the Council. Within the great Hall on the left hand there is a
lesser room, into which none were to enter but the Captains of the people, the twelve
Counsellors,<note place="margin">Of what the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus then I entred into the great Hall, where I put off my Hat to them, but was known
by no body at first; they all believing me to be some Gentleman sent by Monsieur <hi>de Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy</hi>
into the City to command at the Assault, by reason of my great weakness. I then
entred into the little Hall, with all the Colonels and Captains after me, who kept at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
by the door whilst I went and sat down by the Captain of the people, in the
place vvhere those vvho represented the person of the King vvere used to sit, as I my self
upon that account had often done. In going up with my Hat in my hand, I smil'd
first upon one, and then upon another, they all vvondring to see me, and tvvo had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
deliver'd their opinions, vvhen I began to speak to them in <hi>Italian</hi> to this effect.</p>

of the Enemies bringing up Artillery to your walls, you have entred into some debates
which have rather begot amongst you fear and astonishment, than any noble resolution

However in the end I resolv'd with the Colonels and Captains of all the three Nations

from your own mouths the truth of all that has passed. Now I besiech you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

generous hearts as those of the <hi>Siennois</hi> should enter into astonishment for hearing
talk of Canon? will you be afraid for this? I cannot think that this proceeds from you,
who have given so many, and so ample testimonies of your valour; neither is it out of any
want of friendship to the most Christian King, nor out of any distrust you have in
him, that he will not certainly relieve you, neither can it be out of any diffidence you
have in one another, by reason of any factions in your City, for I have never observ'd
the least division among you: But on the contrary, the greatest unanimity for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of your liberty and Republick. I have ever seen you resolute to dye
with your swords in your hands, rather than suffer it to be ravish'd from you. I have
ever seen all men of all conditions move with the same motion, and inspir'd with
the same resolution. Neither can it be for want of courage, for I never saw you sally
out to skirmish, that some of your young men did not evermore sigualize themselves above
our people, though much older Souldiers than they, who in a longer practice of Arms
have perform'd acts worthy to be prais'd and esteem'd of all. I cannot then believe
that men who do so well, should for the noise of Canon, which brings more terror than
harm, enter into astonishment, and resolve to surrender themselves slaves to that inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and insupportable Nation of the Spaniards; or your neighbours, your ancient and
professed enenemies. Since then this apprehension cannot proceed from any defect in
your selves, it must of necessity proceed from me, who have the honour to be Lieutenant
for the King of <hi>France</hi> your good Friend and Protector. If as to what concerns me, you
apprehend, that I shall want health and vigour to undergo that toil and labour that will
be necessary, and requir'd at the time when the Enemy shall assault us, by reason of
the weakness wherein I now am, through my great sickness; that consideration ought
not to beget in you the least distrust, arms and legs do not do all: The great Captain

any other of our Age has done on horseback. God has ever been pleas'd to preserve
my judgement, to preserve you. Have you ever known me fail? Was I then stretch'd
at ease in bed when the Enemy gave you the great Camisado, and Scalado? Do but
mark I beseech you, Gentlemen, the great grace God was pleas'd to shew me on a sudden,
supplying me with as much strength as I had never been sick; by which you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that Almighty God loves us, and that he will not that either you or we perish. I
feel my self strong enough now to wear my Arms, you shall no more see me swath'd and
furr'd up as before. If perhaps you do it out of fear of my incapacity, or little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
you do therein a great wrong to the King, that being as much, as to give all
the world to understand, that His Majesty has hither sent you a man void of all abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and poorly experimented to know how to order what should be done for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of your City? What? do you believe the King has so little kindness for you,
as to send me hither, had he not had a great confidence in my capacity, and before hand
made sufficient tryal elsewhere both what I am, and what I can do? I shall tell you
nothing of my self, it would not become me to be my own Trumpet, something you
have seen your selves, and the rest you may have heard from others. You may then well
judge, that the King has not singled out me, amongst so many Gentlemen of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and has not sent me to you, without having well weigh'd what I am able to do
by the long experience he has had, not only of my Politicks in point of Gorvernment,
of which you may hitherto have taken some notice: But moreover, of my conduct in
matter of Arms, when an Enemy would carry a place by fine force. Do you fear, Gentlemen,
my courage will fail me in time of need? what then do all those testimones I
have given you since my coming hither being sick avail? You have seen me sally out
from the time I have been able to mount to horse, to go to see the skirmishes so near,
that my self commanded them. And have you altogether forgot the day, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into this City, and the great skirmish I then made? Your people saw it, and
had a share in the sight; and upon <hi>Christmas Eve</hi> yet a greater, where the sight last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105656:81"/>
for fix long hours together? Did I not then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ight in my own person? Did you
not then see, that I neither wanted judgement to command, nor valour to fight? I am
asham'd to say so much of my self; but seeing you all know it to be true, I need not
blush to speak it. I will tell you nothing, but what your selves have seen, I am no
bragging Spamard, I am a Frenchman, and moreover a Gascon, the most frank and
plain dealing of all that Nation. Now methinks, Gentlemen, you have so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of your selves, as will render you worthy of a perpetual reproach, should
you go less in your resolution, besides the ruine it would infalliby bring upon you.
Methinks you ought to know me sufficiently, having been so long amongst you, and
that I have omitted nothing of what the King propos'd to himself, I should perform
for his service, and yours in the greatest necessity and danger. All this that I have
remonstrated to you, as well for what concerns your own particular, as what relates to
my self, ought to make you lay aside all apprehension, and to assume the courage
and magnanimity that your Predecessors and selves who are now living have ever had.
Wherefore I beseech you, that you will unanimously take up such a resolution, as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men, such as you are, ought to take, that is, to dye with your weapons in your
hands, rather than to loose your Sovereignty and the liberty you have so long exercis'd
and enjoy'd. And for what concerns me, and these Coloness and Captains, whom you

            <p>I then rose up, bidding the German Interpreter to remember well all I had said, to
repeat it to Rhinecroc, and his Captains, and then directed my speech to the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and said to them, <hi>Signori mi &amp; fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Which being said, every one held up his hand, and the Interpreter told it to the Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croc,
who also held up his hand,<note place="margin">The Oath of the Soldiers, Foreigners.</note> and all the Captains crying, <hi>Io, io buerlie,</hi> and the other,

of the people arose, and all the Council, returning me Infinite thanks; and then
turn'd towards the Captains, whom he also very much thank'd, and with great chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
They then entreated me, that I would retire to my Lodgings, till such time
as they had spoken with all the Council, who were in the great Hall without, and given
them an account of what I had remonstrated to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I accordingly did, and at
my going out of the little room, I there met with <hi>Miss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after, came four of the Magistracy, of which <hi>Misser Hieronimo Espano</hi> was one, having
in charge from all the <hi>Signeury</hi> in general, to return me infinite thanks; and he told me,
that <hi>Misser Ambrosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Mitti</hi> had made a speech in the accustomed chair, which is in
the middle of the great Hall, against the wall, giving them to understand, what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance
I had made to them, wherein he forgot nothing (for he was a man of great
Eloquence and wisdom) and the Oath that all the Colonels and Captains had taken, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exhorting them to resolve all to fight. I do not remember whether they put it to the

that they had never seen a greater joy, then what generally appear'd amongst them, after
the Proposition of the said <hi>Ambrosia Mitti.</hi> Telling me moreover, that after I had been
in the said Hall, and made an end of the forementioned Harangue, the two Gentlemen,
who had deliver'd their opinions before, that they ought to capiculate, and come to a composition
with the Enemy, had requested the Senate to do them that favour, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
what they had said, and take no notice of it, but give them leave to vote anew; which
being accordingly done, they again deliver'd their opinions, that they ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight, and
enter into no kind of composition,<note place="margin">The resolution of the Sienois.</note> but rather dye with their Arms in their hands. I then
told <hi>Misser Hieronimo Espano,</hi> that I would retire my self for all that day, and for all
that night, to write down the order of the fight; which having done, I would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
send it to the <hi>Germans</hi> in their Language, and to the French in theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:105656:81"/>Governors and Captains, you ought to take some example here, forasmuch as there
are some, who say, they have surrendred a place, that the Soldiers would not defend, and
moreover, that the Inhabitants of the Town went about to betray them, and by that
means compell'd them to Capitulate. These are mere excuses, believe me they are <unclear>mere</unclear>
excuses. The thing that compels you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is your own want of experience. Gentlemen
and Camrades, when ever you shall happen to be at such a Wedding, put on your best
Clothes, make your selves as fine as you can, wash your faces with Greek wine, and rub a
good colour into your checks, and so march bravely thorough the streets, and amongst the
Soldiers with your faces erect, having nothing in your months, but that very soon, by Gods
help, and the strength of your own Arms, you will in despite of them, have the lives
of your enemies, and not they yours; that it is not for them to come to attaque you in
your own Fort; that it is the only thing you desire, forasmuch as upon that depends their
ruine, and your deliverance. And by carrying your selves after that manner, the very
women will take courage, and much more the Souldiers: But if you sneak up and down
with a pale face, speaking to no body, sad, melanchollick and pensive, though all the
City, and all the Soldiers had the hearts of Ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, you will make them as timerous as
sheep. Speak often to those of the City in four or five words, and likewise to the Soldiers
saying to them, Well friends, are you not in heart? I look upon the victory as our own,
and hold the death of our Enemies already for certain: For I have I know not what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
spirit, which whenever it comes upon me, I am always certain to overcome, which
I have from God, and not from men. Wherefore rely upon me, and resolve all of you
to fight, and to go out of this place, with honor and reputation. You can dye but once,
and 'tis a thing that is predestin'd, if God has appointed it so, it is in vain for you to fly.
Let us then dye honorably; but there is no appearance of danger for us, but rather for
our Enemies, over whom we have the greatest advantage imaginable. And who Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
and Captains, would you have dare to say he is afraid, seeing you so bravely resolv'd?
Let me tell you, that though they trembled before, they will lay aside their fear, and the
most cowardly will become as bold as the most couragious of the Company.<note place="margin">All things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Chi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f.</note> The Soldier
is never astonish'd, so long as he sees the confidence of his Chief continue firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken.
As the Chief therefore carries away all the honor, and the rest have nothing,
but what he shall give them, in his report of their valour to the Prince; so ought he to
resolve never to discover the least shadow of fear: For behaving himself after that fearless
manner, the Soldiers themselves will be sufficient testimonie for him, so that the reputation
he shall have acquir'd, shall remain indisputably his own, without any one being able
to contradict it. I do not then advise you any thing, I have not first tryed my self, not
only here, but in many other places also; as you will find in this Book, if you have the
patience to read it.<note place="margin">The design of the Author.</note> Now this is the order I set down for the fight, and for all the whole
City, all which particularities I represent to you, without contenting my self to say, that
<hi>Sienna</hi> was besieg'd, where I nine or ten months sustain'd the Seige, and was at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to Capitulatety Famine; for of such a General account as that, a Kings Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
a Captain, or a Soldier, can make no benefit. This is the Historians way, and of
these kind of Writers, there are but too many: I write of my self, and will instruct others
that come after me; for to be born for a mans self only, is in plain English to be born a Beast.</p>
            <p>I then order'd in the first place that the City should be divided into eight parts,<note place="margin">The order at <hi>Sienna</hi> for the <unclear>Fortification</unclear>.</note> of
which the eight of the Council of War should have every one a part; that every one of
the Council of Eight should appoint a person for whom he should himself be responsible,
to take a List of the Quarter should be assign'd him, how many men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
there were in that division, from twelve the males to sixty, and the females to fifty
years of age, which were to carry Baskets, Barrels, Shovels, Picks, and Mattocks, and that
each one of his own Quarter should make Captains of every Trade, without mixing
them together: that every one should be commanded upon pain of death, so soon as
ever their Captain should send for them to come to the place appointed immediately to
haste away, as also the women and children; that every one should forthwith make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of such things as were proper for his or her employment, and that the Masters of
Men-servants and Maids, or their M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stresses should be obliged speedily to take order, that
their Men and Maids be furnisht with tools and utensils wherewith to labour at the
work, for which they shall be appointed, upon pain of two hundred Crowns, and the
City to furnish the poor, who have not wherewith to buy them, at the expence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Treasure: that the said Deputies shall make their Catalogues, and shall go from
house to house to Register their people; and that so soon as the Captains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every one in his
own Quarter should cry out Force, Force, every one both men and women should run
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105656:82"/>

appoint them to come; and that the Deputies should deliver in the Lists of all both men
and women, they shall have found in their respective Precincts to each of the Eight of the
Council of War, Quarter for Quarter; that the old men and women above the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Ages shall remain in their Masters houses, to get meat, and to look to the
house. That the said Deputies should take a List of all the Masons and Carpenters,
who should be found in their Quarter, which List they should also deliver to him of
the Eight of the Council of War by whom they shall be deputed. And this was the order
for the Laborers and Pioneers.</p>
            <p>The order for those who bore arms,<note place="margin">Order for the Fight.</note> was, that the the three Standard bearers, namely
of <hi>St. Martin,</hi> of <hi>Ciotat,</hi> and of <hi>Camoglia,</hi> should forthwith take a view of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
which were four and twenty, and examine every mans arms, if they were in good

one of the Eight of War should come to give them order what to do; that the antient
Gentlmen who were not able to bear arms, nor to work, should present themselves to
sollicit the Pioneers of that Quarter where their houses stood, and to assist the Captains
of the said Pioneers. Now I had ever determin'd, that if ever the Enemy should come
to assault us with Artillery, to entrench my self at a good distance from the Wall, where
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Battery should be made, to let them enter at pleasure, and made account to shut up
the two ends of the Trench, and at either end to plant four or five pieces of great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
loaden with great chains, nails, and pieces of iron. Beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be entred in, to cause the Artillery and small shot to fire all at once, and we at the two
ends then to run in upon them with Pikes and Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erts, two banded Swords, short
Swords and Targets. This I resolved upon, as seeing it altoget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er impossible for the
King to send us relief, by reason that he was engaged in so many places, that it would
not be possible for him to set on foot Forces sufficient to raise the Siege, neither by sea nor
by land; and Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> had no means to relieve us, wherefore I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them to enter, and make little defence at the Breach, to the end that I might give
them battail in the Town, after they had past the fury of our Canon and smaller shot:
For to have defended the Breach had in my opinion been a very easie matter; but then
we could not have done the Enemy so much mischief, as by letting them enter the
breach, which we would have pretended to have quit, onely to draw them on to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight.</p>
            <p>For five or six dayes before the Artillery came I every night sent out two Peasants<note place="margin">Centinels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues.</note>
and a Captain, or a Serjeant, as Centinels perdues, which is a very good thing, and of
great safety; but take heed whom you send, for he may do you a very ill turn. So soon
as the night came the Captain set a Peasant Centinel at some fifty or sixty paces distant
from the Wall, and either in a ditch or behind a hedge, with instructions, that so soon as
he should hear any thing he should come back to the Captain at the foot of the Wall,
which Captain had in charge from me, that immediately upon the Peasant's speaking
to him they should clap down upon all four, and so creep the one after the other to the
place where the Peasant had heard the noise, or rather fall down upon their bellies close
to the earth, to discover if there were not three or four who came to view that place, and
to observe if they did not lay their heads together to confer; for this is a certain sign
that they came to view that place in order to the bringing up of Artillery. To do which
as it ought to be done, they ought to be no other than the Master of the Ordnance,
the Colonel or the Camp-Master of the Infantry, or the Engineer, the Master Carter,
and a Captain of Pioneers, to the end that according to what shall be resolved upon by
the Master of the Ordnance, the Colonel, and Canoncer; the Master Carter may also
take notice which way he may bring up Artillery to the place; and the Canoneer ought
to shew the Captain of the Pioneers what is to be done for the Esplanade, or plaining of
the way, according to the determination of the rest. And this is the discovery that is
to be made by night, after you have discover'd a little at distance by day; for if those
within be an Enemy of any spirit, they ought either by skirmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes, or by their Canon
to keep you from coming to discover at hand. The Captain had order to come give me
a present account of what he and the Peasants had heard or seen, and to leave the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
still upon their perdue, and a Soldier in his own place till his return. Three times
the Enemy was discover'd after this manner, and immediately upon the notice, having
also the List of the Eight Quarters, and of the Eight of War who commanded those
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105656:82"/>
Quarters, I suddenly acquainted Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> who could presently tell me both the
Quarter against which it was, and the Gentleman of the Eight of War that comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it. I had never discover'd my intention to any one, but to Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> onely,
who was a man of great wisdom and valour, and in whom I reposed a very great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
who, so soon as he knew that I meant to give them Battail in the City, we did
nothing of one whole day but walk the round both within and without, taking very good
observation of all the places where the Enemy could make a Battery, and consequently
by that knew where to make our Retirade. And so soon as ever notice was given me
by the Captain who stood Centinel without the City, I presently advertized the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of that Quarter, and he his Deputy, and his Deputy the Captain of the Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers,
so that in an hours time you might have seen at least a thousand, or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
persons beginning the Retirade. Now I had order'd the City to make great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of Torches, so that those who had discover'd were hardly return'd to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis,
but that they saw all that part within the Town cover'd with torches and people,
insomuch that by break of day we had very much advanc't our Trench, and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sent back those to rest, calling in another Quarter to the work till noon, and another
from noon till night, and consequenty others till midnight, and so till break of day,
by which means in a little time we performed so great a work, that we could by no means
be surpriz'd. After this manner I still turn'd the defences of the Town towards the
Marquis his attempts,<note n="*" place="margin">A phrase sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that a man is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plust, and knows not what to do, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before we departed out of the City, betwixt their Quarters and the Fort <hi>Camoglia</hi>) told
me that the Marquis had some jealousie, that some one of their Council betray'd to me
all their deliberations, seeing he had no sooner design'd to batter any part, but that we
alwayes fortified against that place; for by night the least noise is easily heard, and so
great a bustle cannot be concealed; and because he told me that he had compiled a Book of
the particularities of the Siege of <hi>Sienna.</hi> he entreated me to tell him by what means I so
continually discover'd their intentions, whereupon I told him the truth.</p>
            <p>But to return to our subject,<note place="margin">A new Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize upon <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> the Marquis in the end came and planted his Artillery
upon a little Hill betwixt Port <hi>Oville</hi> and the great Observance. The choice of this place
put me, who thought my self so cunning, almost to a nonplus, forasmuch as at Port <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
there is a very spatious Antiport, where the houses of the City do almost touch,
having nothing but the street between, which made it impossible for me of a long time to
make the necessary Retirade, to do which I must be constrain'd to beat down above an
hundred houses, which extremely troubled me; for it is to create so many enemies in our
entrals, the poor Citizen losing all patience to see his house pulled down before his eyes.
I gave to the Count <hi>de Bisque</hi> the charge of terrassing up this Gate, for which use we
took the earth out of the Gardens, and vacant places that lie a little on the left hand. O
the rare exemple that is here, which I will commit to writing, that it may serve for a
mirror to all those who would conserve their liberty.</p>
            <p>All these poor Inhabitants, without discovering the least distaste or sorrow for the<note place="margin">The noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the <hi>Siennois.</hi>
               </note>
ruine of their houses, put themselves their own hands first to the work, every one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
who should be most ready to pull down his own. There was never less than
four thousand souls at labour, and I was shewed by the Gentlemen of <hi>Sienna</hi> a great
number of Gentlewomen carrying of Baskets of earth upon their heads.<note place="margin">The praise of the Ladies of <hi>Sienna.</hi>

white Ensign. In their Ensigns they had very fine devices, which I would give a good
deal I could remember. These three Squadrons consisted of three thousand Ladies,
Gentlewomen, and Citizens, their Arms were Picks, Shovels, Baskets, and Bavins, and
in this Equipage they made their Muster, and went to begin the Fortifications. Monsieur
<hi>de Termes,</hi> who has often told me this story (for I was not then arriv'd at <hi>Sienna)</hi> has
assur'd me, that in his life he never saw so fine a sight. I have since seen their Ensignes,

took his Morrion and put it upon her head, his Breeches, and a Collar of Buff, and put

            <p>But to return to our subject, it was not possible of all that day, nor the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Count to perfect his Terrass, nor we our Retirade, at which we wrought
exceeding hard, leaving about forescore paces to the Marquis, if he had a mind to enter
there. We had made a Traverse by the Port <hi>Oville,</hi> where we had plac't three great
Culverins, laden as I have said before, at which place were Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> the Count
<hi>de Gayas,</hi> and three Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

right hand upon an Eminence was the great Observance, betwixt which and the walls we
had planted five pieces of Canon ram'd with the same, which the said <hi>Bassompi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rre</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in his own person; yet both the one and the other were so well conceal'd, that
the Enemy could discover nothing from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e hills about us. Well did they perceive,
that above at the Observance there were people; for they had evermore a clap at that:
but we were all behind a Trench we had cast up betwixt the Observance and the Wall of
the City, tapist, and squat, so that we could not be seen. The Soldiers were all before the
houses, through which they had pierc't several holes to come, and go under cover. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Retirade, which was not much above the height of a man, they were also shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
from being seen. Signior <hi>Corneli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> was also under cover, by reason that he lay in a
low place, and under the shelter of a very thick wall, which join'd to Port <hi>Oville.</hi> The
order of the fight was thus.</p>
            <p>Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> had with him one Ensign of <hi>Germans,</hi> two of <hi>French,</hi> four of <hi>Italians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The order and design of the Fight.</note>
and four of <hi>Siennois,</hi> having also the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> to assist him: and with me at the
Observance was the <hi>Rhinecroc,</hi> with three Companies of <hi>Germans,</hi> two of <hi>French,</hi> two of
<hi>Italians,</hi> and four Ensigns of <hi>Siennois.</hi> In all the two Troops both of Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi>'s and
mine there was not so much as one Harquebuz, but Pikes, Halberts, and two hand-Swords,
(and of those but few) Swords and Targets, all arms proper for close fight, and
the most furious and killing weapons of all other; for to stand popping and pelting with
those small shot is but so much time lost; a man must close, and grapple collar to collar,
if he mean to rid any work, which the Soldier will never do so long as he has his fire
arms in his hands, but will be alwaies fighting at distance.</p>
            <p>All the night the Enemy were placing Gabions for six and twenty or seven and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pieces of Ordnance, and by break of day they had planted twelve, as they would in that
time have done all the rest, had it not been that they had been necessitated to draw their
Canon up to this Mountain by strength of hand. The Wall is good enough, which not long
since by one of the two Popes <hi>Pius</hi>'s, who were of the house of <hi>Picolhuomini,</hi> and of the
Order of the people, had caused to be made. At break of day they began their Battery
within a foot or two of the bottom of the Walls,<note place="margin">The Battery of the Imperial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists.</note> at the distance of about an hundred
paces; which they did to cut the Wall by the bottom, making account the next day with
the rest of the Artillery in a short time to beat down the whole wall: but for all that
the Count <hi>de Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>que</hi> ceassed not continually to fill the Antiport, leaving us Flanckers, so
that we could see all along the breach. About noon they gave over their Battery below,
and began to batter the middle of the wall, when so soon as I saw them begin to let in
light, I left Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> who continually went up and down from place to place,
and took Monsieur <hi>de Bassomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erre,</hi> with whom I went to the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> from
whence we could plainly see into the recoyle of their Canon: but I shall leave this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conrse
to finish the Order.</p>
            <p>I left a French Company at the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> another at the Citadel, there being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
two Companies of <hi>Siennois</hi> at each, more than two Companies of <hi>Germans</hi> at the
place, each a part by themselves; one of <hi>Italians</hi> at the Port <hi>St. Mark,</hi> and all along the
wall towards <hi>Fonde-brando, Siennois,</hi> and towards <hi>Porto Novo</hi> the same, having given
the word to the two <hi>French</hi> Companies, that in case I should stand in need I would send
for them, leaving the <hi>Siennois</hi> still in the Citadel, and in the Fort. The same Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I left with the <hi>Germans,</hi> and had taken order that from six hours to six hours we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105656:83"/>
would change the word, as well by day as by night, to the end that whilst every one
lay close at his post, if there should be any Traytor amongst us, he might go to no place
where he might have any Intelligence with the Enemy, to draw men from that part to
weaken that Post, to carry them to another: but that no one should be believ'd if he did
not bring the word, in changing of which it should be carried to the <hi>Siennois</hi> by two of
the Council of Eight, by the one to the one half, and by the other to the other; so that
unless those themselves brought the word they were not to stir from their Post. I was
ever afraid that the Marquis had some intelligence in the City, which made me take this
course to prevent him. The <hi>Germans</hi> who were at the great place had the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and moreover that an Officer, or a Serjeant of the others should come to fetch them:
to which end there were six Serjeants chosen out of our <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Companies,
who had in charge, that during the time of the Battery, or of an Assault, they should
continually be moving along the Curtain of the Wall to the Quarters I had appointed,
and never to abandon their Quarter. It was also ordain'd that no one upon pain of
death, of what Nation soever, not so much as the <hi>Siennois</hi> themselves should dare to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
the Retirade, being of the number of those who were there appointed for the fight,
and the same was carried quite round the walls of the City. It was also order'd, that o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
eight of the Council of War, four were continually to remain with me and Signior <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelio,</hi>
to the end that the two who remain'd with him might go continually on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
with the word, to fetch such succours as Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> should send for, to relieve
him if occasion should be, and my two the like; that is to say of the Captains of the
City, and the other four should go to the places where the six Serjeants were appointed to
be, to the end that they might joyntly encourage the Soldiers to fight, if necessity should
require. And there where there was no business to be done, and that any came to them
with the word for succours, they should deliver him the one half, and keep the rest to
defend that Post. That the Officers of the King, as Controulers, Commissaries of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
Treasurers, or their Deputies, should ordinarily be, part by day, and part by night,
still on horseback, riding up and down the streets of the City, and that from hour to
hour one of them should bring me news how all things stood in the body of the City,
and about the Walls, bringing us still some token or another that they had spoke with
the four of the Council, and the Serjeants who were deputed with them. This was the
order I gave, at least as much as I remember, never failing my self every day to visit the
Companies, and to encourage the Inhabitants to do well.</p>
            <p>I now return to what we did at the Fort <hi>Camoglia:</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> ran to
fetch a Canon we had in the Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>adel; but as he went out to remove it the Carriage broke,
so that instead of it he brought a Demy-Canon, which a <hi>Siennois</hi> the said <hi>Bassompierre</hi>
had entertein'd in the quality of a Canoneer evermore shot in, and so well that he could
hit with it as small a mark as if it had been a Harquebuz. He was assisted by some <hi>Italian</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Soldiers of the Citadel to bring it, whilst I was making ready a Platform
with the Soldiers of the Fort, till my Company of Pioneers came, which I had sent for
in all haste, and in less than an hour and a half we dispatcht it, where I mounted my Demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Canon.
I gave ten Crowns to our <hi>Siennois,</hi> that he might make some good shots with
that Piece here, as he had done several at the Citadel before. The Enemy had plac't Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions
on the Flanck of their Battery towards us. <hi>Bassompierre</hi> and I went a little on the
right hand, and observ'd the Bullet in the air like a hat on fire, flying very wide on the
right hand, and the second as much on the left, which made me ready to eat my own
flesh for rage: Monsieur <hi>de Bassompierre</hi> always assur'd me, that he would presently take
his level right, and still went and came to and fro betwixt him and me. The third shot
light upon the bottom of the Gabions, and the fourth playd directly into their Artillery,
and there kill'd a great many of their men, whereupon all those that assisted fled behind
a little house which was in the rear of their Canon. At which I ran and took him in
my arms, and seeing him with his Linstock ready to fire again, said to him, <hi>Fradel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>di, &amp; d'une biechier de vino Graeco.</hi>
I then left him the French Captain, who had the Guard of the Fort, to furnish him
continually with such things as he stood in need of, and Monsieur <hi>Bassompierre</hi> and I
return'd to our Post. There then advanc't a German Ensign to the Enemies battery, who
came along by the other Gabionade with his colours flying, and this might be about four
of the clock in the afternoon, we could see him march from behind the Observance, and
was no sooner come to the Artillery, but our Piece fir'd and kill'd the Ensign, upon
which the <hi>Germans</hi> immediately fled away, retiring to the place from whence they came.
And this <hi>Sienuois</hi> made so many brave shots, that he dismounted them six pieces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and their Artillery remain'd totally abandon'd till the beginning of the night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:105656:84"/>
playing any more than two pieces of Canon, that were covered with Gabions, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lanckt towards the Fort <hi>Camoglia,</hi> which our Artillery could not touch, because they shot
over by reason of the height of the Gabions, and in the twilight they made seven or
eight shots at the Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rvance where we were, and the houses adjoyning, and of all
night after shot no more. We work't exceeding hard all night to finish our Retirade,
and the Count <hi>de Bisque</hi> was no less diligent at the Antiport, so that two hours before
day all was perfected, and every one settled in his Post where he was to fight. That
which made us make so much haste, was, that we heard a great noise at their Artillery,
and thought they were bringing up the rest, which made me put out a man to discover
their Battery, who brought us word, that they had cut above fourscore paces of the wall,
within a span or two of the bottom, and that he believ'd in a few hours they would have
beaten it totally down, which we did not much care for though they did, for we hop'd
to sell them their Entry very dear; and about an hour before day they ceased their noise,
which made us think that they only expected the break of day to give fire. I then
mounted upon the wall, having Captain <hi>Charry</hi> always with me, who by main force
would needs have me down when the day began to break, and soon after I perceiv'd, that
at the Windows of the Gabions there was no Artillery,<note place="margin">The Marquis draws of his Canon.</note> and that instead of planting
more they had drawn off those there were. I then called out to Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> that we
were out of danger of an Assault, and that the Enemy had drawn off their <hi>Canon;</hi> at
which news every one began to come upon the wall, where the <hi>Siennois</hi> sufficiently rated
the Enemy in their language, saying, <hi>Coioni marrani, venete qua vi metteremo per terra
vinti brassi di muri<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They were constrain'd to stay three days at the foot of the mountain
to repair their Carriages, which the Demy-Canon we had brought to Fort <hi>Cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>glia</hi>
had broken and spoild them.</p>
            <p>Now (as I have already said) the Gentleman of the Emperors Bedchamber had all
the while kept a great deal of clutter what Canon would do to the winning of the
Town: but after he had been an eye witness of all that has been related, and that the
Marquis had remonstrated to him that the Retirade, and those other Fortifications I made
within, was to let him enter, and to give him Battail in the City (for if I knew what
he did, he was no less enform'd of my proceeding, there being evermore one Traytor or
another amongst all people) he then was of the same opinion with the Marquis and the
other Captains,<note place="margin">The Marquis his resolution.</note> that the Town was never to be taken by force; but that it was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't
to famine, and therefore thought it convenient that the Artillery should be sent
back to <hi>Florence.</hi> He then return'd back to his Master to give him an account of what
he had seen, and that the Marquis could do no more than what he had already done.
I do not know whether or no he acquainted the Emperor with the fright he had been in,
which the Marquis himself gave me a relation of at my going out of <hi>Sienna,</hi> as he went
along with me above two miles of my way, where he told me, that at the time when
their Artillery was forsaken, by reason of the Havock our Demy-Canon made amongst
them, he was close by the side of the little house in his Litter, being then very lame of the
Gout, where his Litter being set down upon the ground, this Gentleman of the Emperor's
was talking to him, having his hands upon the Cover of the Litter,<note place="margin">The Marquis his danger and fright.</note> and his head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, whispering with the said Marquis; when our Governor seeing the Artillery aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
and every one retyr'd under the shelter of the little house made a shot at it, with
which a part of the wall, which was of brick fell upon the Litter, so that the said Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was by it beaten down upon the Marquis's Legs, sc astonish't as nothing more, and
the Marquis swore to me, that in his life he was himself nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r in so much f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar of being
kill'd, as at that time: that they drew the Gentleman out from off his legs, and himself
after with much ado, all the Litter being full of the ruine, and covering of the said house.
And the said Marquis moreover told me, that at the great fright he was in his Gout left
him, for the whole ruine fell at once upon him, and upon the Gentleman, who verify
thought himself to be kill'd. I have often heard that the apprehension of death has
cur'd many diseases; I know not if the Marquis his Gout be returned since, but he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me he had never had it after from that fright, till the time I saw him. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
or no I leave others to enquire.</p>
            <p>This might be about the middle of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Germans</hi> can no longer endure the want of bread and wine.</note> and not above eight dayes after we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to perceive that the <hi>Germans</hi> grew very impatient at the little bread they had, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no wine, which was the most insupportable of all. The <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> himself, who
was sickly, could no longer endure, there being nothing to be had unless it were a little

               </gap>lesh, or a piece of an Ass. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and I then began to contrive which
way we might get these <hi>Germans</hi> out of the City, and conceited that if they were gone
we could yet keep the Town above two moneths longer, whereas if they staid we should
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105656:84"/>
be necessicated to surrender: we therefore concluded to send a man privately to Monsieur
<hi>de Str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zzy</hi> to remonstrate all this to him, and to entreat him to send for them after
the most plausible manner he could (which I also directed him how to do) and sent to
him Captain <hi>Cosseil,</hi> who is now my Ensign, very well instructed. It was with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great difficulty that he was to pass, which that he might do, we were to fight two
Courts of Guard, by reason that the Marquis had already cast up a great number of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which came up close to the walls of the City on every side. Of these Captain
<hi>Charry</hi> fought the one, and the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> with a Company of <hi>Italians</hi> the other;
so that whilst they were fighting he got over the Trench, and recovered the rear of the
Camp with his Guides, and two dayes after return'd in Company with an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
call'd Captain <hi>Flaminio,</hi> who brought Letters to the <hi>Rhinecroc,</hi> and to me also
wherein Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> writ to me to send the <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> with his Companies
out to him, for that he intended to set on foot a flying Army, having with him great
store of <hi>Italian</hi> horse and foot,<note place="margin">A device of the the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> to be rid of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> and that without some of those Tramontane sinews he
should never be able to relieve me, and that he would protest against me if the City was

Captain <hi>Flaminio</hi> very perfect in his Lesson. The <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> upon the receiving these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
broke out into very great complaints, saying that Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the greatest extremities, and that it was impossible for him to get away without being
defeated: but that he would however speak to his Officers, which he did, and which
begot a very great dispute amongst them. At length one of them in whom he reposed
the greatest confidence, and who serv'd him in the quality of Camp-Master, remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, that he had much better hazard with his sword in his hand to make his way
through the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself to the Enemies discretion, which however in a few dayes he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
do; for there was nothing left to eat, and their Soldiers began to murmur, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that they evermore expected when a great part of them should go give themselves
up to the Enemy, which made them resolve to depart. The <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> was not much to be
blam'd for his unwillingness, it being a very perilous Journey, for at the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Gate, he was of necessity to fight several <hi>Spanish</hi> Guards, and half a mile from thence
another, at a Trench the Enemy had cast up near unto a certain Mill, which was in his
way. Upon their determination to depart, I gave express charge that no one living should
speak of this sally, causing the Gates of the City to be close shut, and at the beginning of
the night they all came with their Baggage to the great place before <hi>Porto Novo.</hi>

               </gap> need; and so we began to open the Gate, it being about one of the clock
in the night. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> marched out first (for it was he who alwayes led the
dance) <hi>Blacon</hi> after him, the Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> next, and then the <hi>Germans,</hi> who in a trice
put themselves into the Valley.<note place="margin">The Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Imperialists.</hi>
               </note> We immediately heard the fight betwixt our <hi>French</hi> and
the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Captain <hi>Charry</hi> routed the two Courts of Guards, the one after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and beat them up as far as that of <hi>St. Lazaro;</hi> whereupon those of the <hi>Charter-house</hi>
came out to relieve their people, and came to the <hi>Augustins</hi> (where <hi>Blacon</hi> had made
a halt expecting Captain <hi>Charry)</hi> and there clapt in betwixt them. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> having
done his business, thought to return (hearing very well that they were fighting with
<hi>Blacon</hi>) and met the Enemy, which redoubled the fight. The Count <hi>de Gayas</hi> could
not come to assist him, by reason that I had expresly forbid him to engage in the fight,
till he should first be sure that the <hi>Germans</hi> were out of danger: but in the end he was
constrain'd to do as the rest did, our two <hi>French</hi> Companies being driven upon him.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:105656:85"/>
The Fight continued above a long hour. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and I were without the Gate
by the Portcullis, and nothing was open but the wicket, and there as the Soldiers came one
after another, we put them in, when on a sudden we heard the fight coming towards us,
some crying <hi>France,</hi> and others <hi>Spain,</hi> when at last they all came up pel mel together to
the Portcullis. We had torches within the Gates, and through the wicket saw a little light,
by wich we drew the Soldiers in. I must needs say, there were very valiant men, both
on the one side, and the other; for not so much as either <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italian,</hi> ever once ran
furiously upon us, but still fac'd about at the Portcullis, and never retir'd, but step by
step, till we pull'd them in. All the three Captains were wounded, and we there lost
what slain, and wounded above forty of the best Soldiers we had, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
and in the end we got in all the rest of our people. And because before the Sally,
the <hi>Siennois</hi> were astonish'd at the departure of the <hi>Germans,</hi> I made Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> to
go about to the several Guards, and to the Forts, to reassure our men, for no one knew
that the <hi>Germans</hi> were to go away, and I my self went to the Palace, where I found all
the Senate in a very great distraction, to whom I spoke as followeth:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I see well (Gentlemen) that you have here assembled your selves upon the occasion of<note place="margin">Speech of Monsieur <hi>de Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tluc</hi> to the <hi>Siennois.</hi>
                  </note>
the <hi>Germans</hi> departure, and that you are enter'd into some apprehension and jealousie,
that by that means your City will be lost: But I must tell you, it is the conservation, and
not the loss of your City; for those six Ensigns devour'd more, than the twelve of the
<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> On the other side, I know you must have heard that the said <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
already began to mutiny, being no longer able to endure. I also discover'd well
enough, that even their Captains were not like to govern them, themselves apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they would go over to the Enemy, and you your selves have for five or six days
last past heard the Enemy call out to us at the very foot of our walls, that we were lost,
and that our <hi>Germans</hi> would soon be with them. Yet did not this proceed from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
in their Officers, but from the impatience of the common Soldiers, who were no
longer able to suffer. Now (Gentlemen) should you appear dejected upon their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the world would say, that both your courage and ours, depended only upon
theirs, and so we should dishonor our selves, to honor them; to which I shall never
give my consent: for you knew all the great fights that have hapned in this siege, have
been perform'd by you, and us only, and they have never so much as sallied out of the
Town, save once only, that in spite of me the <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> would send out his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the conduct of his Nephew and his Camp-Master, and would accept of no one of
any other Nation, than his own, at which time you saw how soon, and how easily they
were beaten back, even into the ditch of the Ravelin of <hi>Porto Novo;</hi> so that if, by good
fortune,<note place="margin">The Germans by no means proper for a siege.</note> I had not been there, and had not made the <hi>Italian</hi> Guard sally out to their
rescue, not a man of them had come off alive. I will not disparage them, but they are
much more proper for a Battel, than a Siege. Why then (Signiors) should you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at their departure? I will say one thing more to you, that although I had also sent
away the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elve Companies that remain with me in this Town, I would yet undertake to
defend your City, provided the Captains stay'd behind to relieve me. You must make
your Ensigns Captains of the Watch by turns, who shall have two nights of intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ours shall have but one, and we must begin to contract our allowance of bread to
fourteen ounces, and you of the City to ten. You must also put the useless mouths out of
Town, and appoint six persons to take a lift of their names to morrow, without further
delay, and that without regard of persons, and speedily thrust them out of your City,
by which expedient we shall make our bread last three months longer, which will be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
time for the King wherein to relieve us, especially now that the Spring is drawing
on. Cease therefore your apprehensions, and on the contrary approve what I have done
in order to your service. If I have done it without pre-acquainting the Senate with my
design, it was not out of any dis-respect to them, but to keep this departure secret,
which was of very great consequence, as you your selves may have observ'd; I having
been constrain'd to put Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> upon the business to deliver my self from a
people so entirely devoted to their bellies.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Senate having heard my Remonstrance, desir'd me to go to my repose, and that
they would consider of what I had said, rendring me very many thanks for the comfort
and good counsel I had given them. In the morning my whole Speech was divulg'd all
over the City, and there was no more thought of fear amongst them: But they could not
well agree amongst themselves about the unprofitable mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and dignity, anciently belonging to the old Dictators of <hi>Rome.</hi> I thereupon created

               </note> which in three days after I had deliver'd in the List, was performed. A

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the King's Officers, and
the Captains who were then present in <hi>Sienna,</hi> I should not however have mention'd in
this place, lest the world should take me for a lyar: but it is most perfectly true. The
List of these useless mouths, I do assure you amounted to Four thousand and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
people, or more, which of all the miseries and desolations that I have ever seen,
was the greatest my eyes ever yet beheld, or that I believe I shall ever see again; for the
Master was hereby necessitated to part with his servant, who had serv'd him long, the
Mistress with her maid, besides an infinite number of poor people, who only liv'd by the
sweat of their brows; which weeping and desolation continued for three days together:
and these poor wretches were to go thorow the Enemy, who still beat them back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City, the whole Camp continuing night and day in Arms to that only end;
so that they drove them up to the very foot of the walls, that they might the sooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the little bread we had left, and to see if the City out of compassion to those misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Creatures would revolt; but that prevail'd nothing, though they lay eight days in
this condition, where they had nothing to eat but herbs and grass, and above the one half
of them perish'd, for the Enemy kill'd them, and very few escap'd away. There were a
great many Maids and handsome women indeed, who found means to escape, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
by night stealing them into their quarters, for their own provision, but it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the Marquis, for it had otherwise been death; and some strong and vigorous
men also forc'd their way, and escap'd by night: But all those did not amount to the fourth
part, and all the rest miserably perish'd. These are the effects of War. We must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
sometimes be cruel, to frustrate the designs of an Enemy. God had need to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to men of our Trade, who commit so many sins, and are the causers of many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and mischiefs.</p>
            <p>You Captains and Governors of places, if you be not perfect already, learn these Arts
and Stratagems: It is not all to be valiant and wise, you must also be circumspect and
cunning. Had I entreated the <hi>Rhinecroc</hi> to depart the City, he would have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd,
and have reproach'd me, that I sent him to the slaughter, but I proceeded more
discreetly, serving my self with the authority of Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> wherein I had no
other end, but to gain time to tire out my Enemy, and to give the King leisure to relieve
us: But as I have said before, he emplo'd his Forces there where he had the most concern.
<hi>Nearer is the skin than the skirt.</hi> Never f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar to discharge your selves of useless mouths,
and bar your cars from all crys of the afflicted: Had I obey'd my own disposition, I had
done it three months sooner, which if I had, I might peradventure have sav'd the Town, or
at least I had longer held my Enemy in play; and I have a hundred times since repented
me, that I did not.</p>
            <p>The Marquis seeing that I had put the <hi>Germans</hi> out of the Town (who were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est<note place="margin">The <hi>Germans</hi> defeate.</note>

and seeing also that I had driven out the useless people, both which would help to
prolong the Siege, with the contracting our allowance of bread (which he had also learn'd
from those that went out) these things made him to think of some other way,<note place="margin">The Marquis his design.</note> to bring

which was five or six days, and every return some of their beasts of burthen dyed. For
about the Camp there was no more, so much as one herb; neither hay, straw, nor grain

               </gap>phew, which consisted of no more than fifty Horse, and was also eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fifteen days to be reliev'd, by fifty others that were quarter'd at <hi>Banconvent.</hi> So that
had God been pleas'd to send us a little snow, though but for eight days only, his Camp
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105656:86"/>
would have been necessitated to rise, and to shift for themselves in the most commodious
quarters abroad in the Country. All these things together put the Marquis upon an attempt
to shorten the War, wherein his design was one way or anotherto sow division amongst the
quarters of the City, seeing us weak, and knowing very well, that although we had yet
twelve Companies, there was nevertheless not eighteen hundred men: To which effect by
those of the <hi>Siennois</hi> who were banish'd the City, and were with the Marquis, an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was found out to gain a Citizen of the Town called Messer <hi>Pedro,</hi> a man with one
eye, and of the order of the people (which was that wherein we most confided, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the order of the Reformators) and that by the means of certain little boys, who
went with little sacks to gather herbs in the Meadows upon the River <hi>Tresse.</hi> By whom
the Marquis so order'd the business, that he corrupted this man, and made him a Traytor
to his People and Countrey; and the form of this practice was,<note place="margin">The Marquis his practices in <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> that Messer <hi>Pedro</hi> should
receive several blancks, sign'd by the <hi>Siennois,</hi> who were in the Marquis his Camp, which
he himself should write over at his own discretion.</p>
            <p>The plot of this design was thus, that Messer <hi>Pedro</hi> should in his Letters write these
words, <hi>that they wonder'd they should thus suffer themselves to be so manifestly abus'd by
the Seigneur</hi> de Montluc; <hi>and that a child might discern all the assurances he gave them of
relief from the King of</hi> France <hi>to be no other than gulleries and deceits: That although they
had unworthily been thrust out of the City, yet did they nevertheless, with tears in their
eyes, infinitely lament to see them so miserably loose themselves, and that if they would send
out a man to go so far as</hi> Rome, <hi>to enquire if the King was raising an Army for their
succour, they would then infallibly discover the Cheat: That they begg'd of them not to suffer
themselves to be reduc'd to the last morsel, which if they should do, they would not then come
off cheaper, than at the price of their heads, the ruine of their estates, their wiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That they had yet means to make their peace with the Emperor, by the Mediation

if they would consult and joyn with some of the City, who had already engag'd themselves to
them; and that they might know who were of the intelligence, they were to go into such a

to one of those in whom we repos'd an absolute trust, being very certain, that he would
forthwith carry it to the Magistrate, and that the Magistrate would also in the morning
send into the street mention'd in the Letter, and would seize upon the Gentleman of the
house, at whose door the Cross should be found. However he resolv'd ever to make his
Cross at some house of the orders of the <hi>Novl,</hi> and the Gentlemen, forasmuch as the other
two Orders had them in suspicion, and the Marquis thought (knowing the humor of
the <hi>Siennois,</hi> and the hatred they bore to one another) that immediately, so soon as that
person should be taken, they would hurry him without any other form of J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>men,
would enter into so great an animosity and despair, that to save their lives they wou'd
be constrain'd to betake themselves to arms, to possess themselves of a Canton of the
City near unto the walls, to favour the Enemy, and to help them into the City.</p>
            <p>This cursed Rogue then began to forge his first Letter, and by night went and thrust
it under the door of the house of one of the Gentlemen, who was unsuspected, and
made his little Cross in another street at the house of one of the richest Gentlemen of the
Order of the <hi>Novi;</hi> so that in the morning the Gentleman to whom the Letter was directed,
found it in the Entry of his house, presently read it, and careird it to the Magistrates,
who so soon as they had look'd upon it, immediately sent it to me by Misser <hi>Hieronimo
Hispano,</hi> sending me word withal, that they had determin'd to go apprehend the said
Gentleman, and forthwith to carry him directly to the Scaffold. Whereupon I sent
the Signiors <hi>Cornelio</hi> and <hi>Bartolomeo Cavalcano</hi> back to them, to entreat them not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitously
to proceed to blood, for that it might be an invention of the Marquis to set
division amongst us: but that they might do well to commit him to prison, which they
accordingly did. Two days after there was another Letter found in the same manner, in
the house of a Gentleman of the Order of the <hi>Novi,</hi> a man no more suspected than the
other, and the little Cross under the door of one of the Order of the Gentlemen: At
which the Senate was so incens'd, that I was fain my self to go to the Pallace, where I
had much ado to obtain the favour, that they would defer execution for five days only,
to see if in that time God would please to give us further light into this Fact. All the
whole City was enrag'd, and talk'd of nothing but cutting off heads. As God help me,
it could never sink into my head, that it was any other, than a device of the Marquis, for
I knew very well with whom I had to do. I then entreated Messer <hi>Bartolom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o Cavalcano,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:105656:86"/>
that he would never cease day nor night, to go visit the said Gentlemen, and the Citizens of
the Orders of the Gentlemen,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> and the <hi>Novi,</hi> whom the misfortune concern'd, to entreat
them not to despair, and to tell them, that I would take order no blood should be shed,
and that I gave no credit to those Letters and Crosses. Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> also assisted me
very much in this affair, who had a very great interest in the City, by reason of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with whom he had always liv'd during his abode in this City.</p>
            <p>Now three or four days after this, thinking the fury to be over, behold another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and another Cross found in the same manner as before: At which every boody lost all
patience, and would immediately drag all three to execution. I then ran to the pallace,
taking Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and <hi>Signior Bartolomeo</hi> along with me. As I was going it came
into my head, that I had no way to divert this blow; but by a colour of devotion, and
so soon as I came there, I found the great Hall already almost full of men of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and of the Order of the people: when so soon as I enter'd into the Hall of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, they all began to cry out, <hi>that it was now no longer time to forbear, but that they
were to proceed to a speedy execution of Iustice;</hi> whereupon having taken my place, I spoke
to them in Italian, as at other times, after this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Gentlemen, since the time that I have had the honor to Command in your City,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue to the Senate of <hi>Sien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>

the appointment of the King my Master, you have never undertaken any thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as to matters of War, or as to the Government of your Corporation, without first
communicating to me your intention, and asking my opinion and advice. Wherein, by
God's good pleasure, I have been so happy, that I have hitherto never advis'd you to
any thing which has not succeeded to your advantage and honor; neither would I do
it for the world, my own life and safety not being dearer to me, than your preservation.
Seeing then (Gentlemen) I have been so fortunate, as ever to have given you sound
and useful counsels; let me beseech you to retain the same opinion of me now, and to
give credit to me in an affair of so great importance, as this that presents it self before you,
with which your judgements seem to be very much perplex'd. I beg of you with joyn'd
hands, and in the name of God, that of all things you take heed of embruing your
hands in the blood of your Citizens till the truth shall be fully known; neither can it
possibly be long conceal'd: 'tis to much purpose to cover the fire, the smoak will how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
issue out; in like manner they may endeavour to mask and disguise this practice,
but the truth will infallibly appear. All the world (and I beseech you be of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
cannot make me believe, that this is any other than an Artifice, and a trick of the
Marquis, who having found that the Lyon's skin will do him no good, has therefore
put on that of the Fox, the better to bring about his design. Which to do, he had no
better, nor more subtile way, than by sowing division in the heart of your City. And
which way could he better do it, than by making you believe there are Traytors among
you, and within your own walls? Knowing very well that that would make you not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to imprison such suspected persons, but also to put them to death, and by that execution
to set discord in your City, for true blood cannot lye. The Parents and friends of the
sufferers will bear the death of their kindred, though it should be just, with great sorrow
and discontent, and will eadeavour to revenge them; by which means behold you have
created so many domestick enemies, much more dangerous than those without, and you
will be perplexed about the death of your own people, at the time when you meditate
that of your open and declared foes. See then (Gentlemen) what joy, what satisfaction
and delight you will administer to your enemies when they shall know that you busie
your selves about cutting off the heads of your own Citizens, and of those, who I dare
say and swear are innocent. However it may prove to be, the expectation of the truth
can no ways be prejudicial to you, for you have them in sure hold: you are secure
of your prisoners, you have them under safe custody. I will also be vigilant on my part,
why then should you make such haste to put them to death? For the honor of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, you will not repent your patience. I have no interest but yours, let us have
recourse to God in so great a necessity. Command that all your Clergy to morrow or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein
a general Procession throughout the whole City, and let every one be enjoyn'd to be
assisting at it, and let them joyn in prayer, that it may please God to do us that grace
as to discover to us the truth of this affair, the treason, if treason there be, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
of the Prisoners, if there be none. I assure my self that God will hear us, and
you will soon be satisfied of the truth, after which you may proceed to justice against
the guilty if cause require: but to do it before, and in heat to embrew your hands in
the blood of your Citizens, without having m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>turely weighed every circumstance, you
would in my opinion do very ill, and bring a great mischief upon your City. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:105656:87"/>
the sole affection I have to your service, your safety, and conservation, has made
me speak thus freely to you without any other consideration, and I once more most
earnestly beseech you to grant me this favour, as for a few dayes to supersede your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which in the mean time we will employ in prayers and supplications, that God
will please, by manifesting to us the truth, to direct our justice.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I had no sooner ended my Speech, but that a confused murmur arose throughout the
whole Hall, some saying I, and others no, for there will be evermore some opposers; but
in the end my advice was followed, and presently intimation given to the Churches, and
to all the people, to prepare themselves against the next day for a general Procession, to
pray unto Almighty God; for as for fasting we had enough of that already.<note place="margin">A General Procession.</note> I was my
self assisting at the Procession, and all the Captains, together with all the Gentlemen and
Ladies of the City, the Kindred of the Prisoners followed weeping; and to be short, all the
whole body of the City this day, and the day following were in humiliation and prayer,
every one beseeching of God, that he would please to afford us that grace, as to discover the
truth of this treason. In the mean time I slept not, for all the night Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and
I were in consultation, which way this practice of the Marquis could be set on foot. I
consider'd with my self, that the business being gone thus far, he who carried on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe would not rest there, and that the Council of the City would not be kept so secret,
that the Marquis would not infallibly have intelligence of what had been concluded,
there being evermore some tell-tales in these great Assemblies; and then very well knew
that I had committed an error, in so openly declaring that I was assur'd it was a trick
of the Marquis, it being to be feared that it would make him enter into some jealousie of
his Agent. Now because it was likely he would by his Letters and Tickets give us some
new alarm, I thought fit to cause certain men to walk up and down the streets of the City
by night, after the most private manner they could, to try if by that means something
might not be brought to light, and after this manner caused Centinel to be made two
nights together.<note place="margin">The prudence of the Sieur <hi>de Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> By day I caused the people to be taken up with Processions in three
respective Parishes, and when any of the Signiory came to tell me, that it was so much
time lost, and that they must proceed to Justice, I entreated them to have patience, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them that I began to discover some light into the business; for it was necessary
to proceed after this manner, to restrain the fury of the people.</p>
            <p>Now it hapned that the third night about midnight this <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r Pedro</hi> was seen to pass
by, and stopping at a house, put his hand to a Casement, which was low, and hapned
to be shut, and one of the three Letters had been found to have been put into a low win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
as that was. He then kneel'd down, and under the door put in the Letter as far
as he could thrust his arm, which having done he went his way along the street. A
Gentleman who lay at watch went presently after him, and taking him by the arm said,
<hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o;</hi>
which having done he knockt, and made them open the door, where he found the Letter
of the same contents with the former. He then immediately went and carried it to the
Magistracy, who sent me two of their Council, to give me an account of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and those two went and call'd up Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> who came along with them;
where amongst us it was concluded, that the Gates should not be open'd in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor the Guards and Centinels reliev'd, till he was first taken; and in the morning
Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> went with a hundred men to beset the house both before and behind. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Cornelio</hi> knew the man, and so soon as he had placed his Soldiers, knockt at the
door, where he found him yet in bed, and presently sent me word of his being taken.
Whereupon, the time of my Dictatorship being expir'd, I made use of entreaties, as
before, requesting the Senate that he might be forthwith put upon the Rack, for he
both denied the Letter, and also that he had seen the Gentleman of all that night.
As he was upon the Rack he begg'd that they would to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>They were brought by Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and <hi>Bartolomeo Cavalcano,</hi> and so soon as they

nor the Son his Father, since it concern'd no less than their lives and fortunes; and that
therefore I desir'd they would go to the Magistracy to give them hearty thanks that they
had not proceeded to speedy execution, but had had patience till such time as God had
discover'd the truth.</q> They return'd me answer, that I should pardon them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing they would never do; neither was it they that had saved their lives, but that
it was I, and that they would give God thanks and me; but that they had no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them at all. We were all three above a long hour labouring to perswade them,
where I remonstrated to them, that not to do the thing I requested of them was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
the Marquis his designe, and to give him his hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s desire, which was, that
they should remain in division and mortal hatred; and whatever else I could contrive
to say, that might any way serve to perswade them to go, I represented to their consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
to pacifie and appease them. In the end remembring how highly they stood ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to me for the saving their lives, they promised me that they would do it, and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Cornelio,</hi> and <hi>Messer Bartolomeo</hi> at my request went along with them, for I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
they might repent by the way; where so soon as they came before the Magistracy,<note place="margin">The Prisoners go to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note>
one of them spake for the rest, remonst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ating their innocency, and the wrong that had
been done them; which nevertheless they would no more remember, considering the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the time, and the Estate of the City, affectiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely beseeching them to esteem
them for their good Citizens and friends, and loyal to the Common-wealth; and that
for the time to come neither they nor their posterity might have any blemish upon their
names upon this occasion, they desired they would please to grant them Patents seal'd
with the broad Seal for their satisfaction. The Captain of the people then made them a
very ample Remonstrance, wherein he entreated they would excuse them, if the publick
safety being in question, they had been constrain'd to shut their eyes to particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and by the importance of the affair had been constrain'd to be so severe in their
inquisition: but that they did acknowledge and esteem them to be good and loyal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.
Whereupon they all descended from their seats and embraced them, and as
<hi>Mess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

retired to his own house.</p>
            <p>Now because this one-ey'd Villain was of the Order of the People, which was the

some mutiny or sedition, and make them in the end betake themselves to arms, which
was the reason that I made a request to the Senate to give me his life, and to banish him
for ever, that all things might be husht up, and that the Marquis might not say that any
of his policies had succeeded any more than his attempts by arms. And thus were all
things discovered and hudled up, for the Senate granted my request.</p>
            <p>I have often since wondred how I came to be so discree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and so moderate in an affair
of this importance, considering how reasonable it was, that an exemple should be made;
but it would peradventure have done more hurt than good. We must not alwayes be
so severe, and the seeing others so hot upon blood I do believe made me a little more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate.
And you (Gentlemen) who have the charge of places, do not suffer your selves
to be transported at the first appearance of things, nor upon too light information;
consider and weigh the circumstances, and hinder the violence of the people over whom
you command by one pretence or another, as I did, amusing them with Processions; nor
that that was not nevertheless well done, but I would see if time would make any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
and had I suffered these men to have been put to death, their kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

City, where all was accommodated and appeased. Consider also with what enemy you
have to do; for you may well imagine that he will leave no stone unremov'd, nor no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice

(Governors of places) must discern if there be appearance in the thing; whether or
no the party accused be a man capable of practice, or have any means whereby to bring
his purpose about, and whether or no he have done any thing any wayes tending to such
a design. If in apprehending him you discover any confusion in his countenance,<note place="margin">Worthy consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of a Governor.</note> or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
in his answers. You ought in this to be very circumspect and discreet, and to
consider that there is nothing more easie than to calumniate a man. God be praised.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:105656:88"/>
all here passed with moderation, and the Prisoners with their friends came to give
me thanks.</p>
            <p>Now after the Marquis saw himself disappointed of his expectation, and that all his
plots and stratagems came to nothing, he suffer'd us to rest in peace, not expecting to
have us till we should be reduced to the last morsel of bread; and we began to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the month of <hi>March,</hi> when we were in the greatest necessity of all things; for of
wine there had not been one drop in the whole City from the middle of <hi>February:</hi> We
had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aten all the Horses, Asses, Mules, Cats and Rats that were in the Town. Cats sold
for three and four Crowns a piece, and a Rat for a Crown. And in all the whole City
there was onely remaining four old Mares, so lean as nothing more, which turned the
Mills, two that I had, the Controller <hi>la Moliere</hi> his, the Treasurer <hi>P Espine</hi> another, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>Cornelio</hi> a little Bay pad-Nag, that was blind with age, and <hi>Misser Hieronimo Hispano</hi>
a Turk of above twenty years old. These were all the Horses and Mares that were left
in the City in this extremity, which was greater than I can represent it, and I do believe
there is not in nature so dreadful a thing as Famine. We had from <hi>Rome</hi> some hopes
sent us of succours, and that the King was sending away the Mareschal <hi>de Briss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c</hi> to relieve
us, which was the reason that we again lessened our bread to twelve ounces, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Citizens of the Town to nine: whilst in the mean time by little and little we
lost several Inhabitants and Soldiers, who fell down dead as they walked the streets, so
that they died without sickness. At last the Physicians found it out that it was the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
they fed upon, that being an herb that does relax the stomack, and obstructs digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Now we had no other herbs all along the walls of the City, they having been all eaten
before; neither could we come by these without sallying out to skirmish, and then all the
women and children of the Town went out to gather them. But I saw I lost so many
men in these skirmishes, that I would no more permit any one to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly out. Now to
hear any more news of the Mareschal <hi>de Brissac</hi> was henceforward impossible, for the
Trenches were brought up to the very Gates of the City,<note place="margin">This memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sally of the <hi>Siennois</hi> was in the year 1526.</note> which Trenches the Marquis
had also redoubled for fear we should sally out upon him in despair, and give him Battail,
as the <hi>Siennois</hi> in their antient wars had formerly done, as themselves report.</p>
            <p>In this condition we languished on till the 8th of <hi>April,</hi> that we had lost all manner of
hopes of relief, and then it was that the Seigneury intreated me not to take it ill if they
began to think of their pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rvation. When seeing there was no other remedy, unless to
eat one another? I could not deny them, cursing to the pit of hell all those who engage
men of honor in places, and then leave them in the lurch. Yet did I not herein intend to
speak of the King, my good Master, he lov'd me too well for that; but those who gave
him ill counsels to the prejudice of his affairs, and I have ever observ'd more evil than
good Counsellors about Princes.<note place="margin">The people of <hi>Sienna</hi> begin to capitulate.</note> They then sent out one of their people to the Marquis to
entreat of him a safe conduct for two of their Senate, whom they would send to him,
which he granted, and they began to capitulate. The Marquis himself did very much
facilitate the Treaty, and they began to enter into great confidence of him, for he very well
saw, that to cause the City to be sack'd and ruin'd would be no profit, neither to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
nor the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and would only benefit the Soldier, and on the other
side he fear'd left if the <hi>Siennois</hi> could obtain no good conditions, we should sally out
upon him, <hi>a la desesperade,</hi> having already lost above the third part of his men, who
were either dead through the length of the Siege, or run away, so that he had almost no
<hi>Italians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The extremity of the Marquis.</note> who were quarter'd at the Fort <hi>St. Mark;</hi> and the Marquis had remain'd for
above a moneth with no more than six Ensigns for the Guard of his own person, all the
rest being in the Trenches; neither could he ever relieve them with more than ten Ensigns,
and those had only one night of intermission, and some such Guards there were that were
not reliev'd in six days. To this condition was he reduc'd without, as well as we within;
neither could he make any use of his horse, no more than Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> could of
the Cavalry he had, by reason that there was no manner of thing upon the ground, to
give the horses to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I will now give an account of my self after what manner I liv'd. I had no manner of
advantage, no more than the meanest Soldier, and my bread weighed no more than twelve
ounces, and of white bread there was never above seven or eight made, whereof three
were brought to my Quarters, and the rest were saved for some Captain that was sick.
Neither those of the City, nor we from the end of <hi>February</hi> to the 22th of <hi>April</hi> ever eat
above once a day; neither did I ever hear so much as any one Soldier complain, and I can
assure you the Remonstrances I often made to them serv'd to very good purpose; for if
they would have gone over to the Enemies Camp, the Marquis would have created them

skirmishes that had happened betwixt us had had very sufficient tryal of their valour. I
had bought thirty hens and a Cock to get me eggs,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</note> which Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> the Count <hi>de
Gayas,</hi> and I eat, for we all three constantly eat together; at noon in one place, and in the
evening at another; but towards the end of <hi>March</hi> all these were eaten, the Cock and
all. 'Twas pitty we had no more: and so I remain'd without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lesh, and without eggs,
and had nothing to eat but my little loaf, with a few pease boyl'd with a little Bacon and
Mallows, and that but once a day only. The desire I had to acquire honor, and to put
this bafflle upon the Emperor, so long to have held his Army in play, made me find
this so sweet that it was no trouble to me to fast: and this pittiful supper with a bit of
bread was a feast to me, when returning from some skirmish, I knew the Enemy to be
well drub'd, or that I knew them to suffer under the same necessities we did.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Capitulation; the Marquis sent to the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Don
Iuan Manricon,</hi> who was Embassador from the Emperor to the Pope, and resided at
<hi>Florence</hi> by reason of the Siege; whereupon the said Duke sending a safe conduct, the
<hi>Siennois</hi> also sent to the Pope (which was Pope <hi>Iulio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pope</hi> Iulic.</note> who died two or three days after)
from whom they received a very scurvey answer, he reproaching them with their obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and commanding them to submit to the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his mercy without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
He was a terrible Pope: but the Duke proceeded after a more modest and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
manner, as a Prince ought to do, who would gain the hearts of a people, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was one of the greatest Polititians of our times. It behooved him so to be to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
his Principality, in the time of two of the greatest and most ambitious Princes
that ever were, who had both of them a great mind to get footing in <hi>Italy.</hi> But the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi>

Trumpet to me, entreating I would send two Gentlemen out to him in whom I might
confide, he having something to say to them that he desired I should know, and that he
was come to <hi>St. Lazare</hi> to that effect. I thereupon sent out to him Signior <hi>Cornelio,</hi> and
Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> who being come to him, he there acquainted them with the terms of the
Capitulation, which would that night be brought to the City, and that amongst other
things there was one Article which exprest, that the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> with his Italian
and French Companies, and all the Officers of the King, should march out with Bag
and Baggage, Colours flying, Drums beating, with match lighted, and Bullet in mouth:
but that this Article would do me no good, forasmuch as we did not belong to the <hi>Sien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>

I were two poor Gentlemen, who by our Arms were arrived to such degrees of honor,
that the greatest both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> would be glad to have our places, telling them
withal he would there stay to expect my answer. They found me at <hi>Porto Novo</hi> walking

Province I was a Native, and that if he would not content himself, that the <hi>Siennois</hi>
had comprized me in their Capitulation, I would at my coming out let him see, that
I was descended from those warlike <hi>Romans,</hi> who would rather have lost a thousand
lives, could they have had so many to lose, than an inch of their honor: that I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Siennois</hi> should capitulate for me, than I for them, and that for my part the
name of <hi>Montluc</hi> should never be found subscrib'd to a Capitulation.</q> They then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to him, to whom having repeated my answer, he said to them in Italian. <hi>Che vol dir

Fight than a Capitulation; nothing so much puzzels him as that, besides the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it gives to your own people. I was as much afraid as another, seeing my self so
desperately engag'd, and no news of any relief, neither of victuals nor men: but ask any
one who is yet living, whether they ever saw me any more dejected than the first day I
came into the City. And at the last of all, when we were reduc'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Late at night came the Capitulation, and upon Tuesday morning four of the Senate

                        <p>I have seen your Capitulation, which tends rather to the cutting off of
your heads, than to any indemnity for your Lives and Estates. You have there one

Lives and Estates saved, excepting such as are Rebels to the Emperor, the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> Now you know very well that the Emperor, has
caused you all to be declared Rebels in his Imperial Chamber, as Subjects, of the Empire,
for having rebelled against him. By which you see you are declared Subjects, and you
say you are not Subjects, but only stand in recommendation to the Empire. The dispute
is not yet determined, whether you are Subjects or recommended, and when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

the hatred the Emperor and the Duke have conceiv'd against you. A Prince
rarely pardons Subjects who have once rebelled against him; but if ever he can pick a

long liv'd together, without ever having so much as one unkind word pass betwixt us,
and that I have receiv'd so many honors at your hands, if you will take my advice, we
will make the Marquis think of something he never thought of yet, that is we will sally
out with our weapons in our hands to the fight, and give him battail, and we ought
to believe, that God will be on our side, and assist us, considering the cruelty they would
exercise upon you. For my own part, I freely offer you my life, and those of all my

            <p>Now I knew very well, that this exception did not point at the <hi>Siennois,</hi> but only at
those I nam'd before, so that this was only a device of mine, to make the <hi>Siennois</hi> engage
with us in the fight, for I had rather have put all to the hazard of the sword, than that any
one of those who were within with us, and who upon my account had been obstinate in the

defence of the City should be lost. They took it however for current pay, and after I
was departed from them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siennois</hi> resolve to fight.</note> all of them resolv'd to fight it out to the last man. I then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sent them word what they were to do, which was, that the Standard-bearer should
command all their Powder to be refined, their Swords, Halberts and Pike-heads to be
scowr'd and ground: that upon pain of Death, every one who was able to bear arms,
should be ready in two days, and that the Priests and Religicux, who had taken arms for
the defence of the Town at the Battery, should now take them again under the same
Captains they did before; insomuch that I do believe that for two or three days so great
a bustle in the City had never been seen. The two Deputies hereupon of the Duke of
<hi>Florence</hi> and the Marquis, who had safe conduct into the City, return'd about three of
the clock in the afternoon back to the Marquis, where they shew'd him this Article, which
had put not only the whole City, but also the Soldiers, into despair of fair Quarter, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him how we were all resolv'd and by what means they came to understand the hubub,
and preparation that was making in the City to give him Battel, which was the reason
that he sent all night to the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> and Don <hi>Iuan Manricou,</hi> whom I since saw
with the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> giving them an account how all things stood, and
entreating them withal, that since he was now upon the point to have the Town surrendred
to him, they would not for this one Article put him in danger of losing all; but consider,
that he had to do with a great Captain, and an old Souldier, commending me more than I
deserv'd: that as themselves very well knew, he had lost near upon the one half of his Army,
and had a great many sick of those he had left, and that he had not twenty Horse, there
being nothing upon the place to support them, nor any means by which to bring them
any from other places; and that they would do well to weigh and consider of this affair,
for as for his part, he must discharge himself upon them, if any thing fell our amiss. So

along the street that leads to S. <hi>Lazaro,</hi> on both sides the street, his Germans were drawn
up in Battalia, a little on the right hand in a Camp, and at S. <hi>Lazaro</hi> was Signior <hi>Cabry</hi>
his Nephew with fifty or threescore horse, which was all they could make (as I have said

did, and which before I went out, I distributed amongst the <hi>Siennois,</hi> who put upon
them the ancient women, and some children in their laps. All the rest were on foot, where
there were above an hundred Virgins following their Fathers and Mothers, and women who
carried cradles with Infants in them upon their heads, and you might have seen several
men leading their daughter in one hand, and their wife in the other, and they were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

               </gap>ing at the
turning out the useless mouths; but I saw as sad a one at the separation of those who
went out with us, and who remain'd behind. In my life I never saw so sad a farwel;
so that although our Soldiors had in their own persons suffer'd to the last extremes, yet
did they infinitely regret this woful parting, and that they had not the power to defend
the liberty of these people, and I more than all the rest, who could not without tears
behold this misery and desolation of a people, who had manifested themselves so devout
for the conservation of their liberty and honor. So soon as Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> was gone out,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105656:90"/>
all the Italians follow'd,<note place="margin">The French march out of <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> and the Citizens in the rear of the Italians. Then at the head
of our French went out S. <hi>Auban</hi> and <hi>Lussan</hi> arm'd, with pikes upon their shoulders, and
a Company of Harquebuzeers after them, two Captains at the head of the Pikes, with
another company of Harquebuzeers led by <hi>Charry</hi> and <hi>Blacon,</hi> having each of them a
Halbert in his hand, and the Ensigns in the middle of the Pikes, after the same manner
the Italians had past before. After these I went out arm'd, and Messer <hi>Hieronimo Espanos</hi>
side by side with me, for I was afraid they would have seiz'd upon him, he having been
a principal Actor in the revolt of the City. He was mounted upon an old Turk, and I
upon another miserably lean and haggled our, notwithstanding which I set a good face on
the matter, and made the best meen I could. I left two <hi>Siennois</hi> Ensigns at the Gate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
them to clap to the Gate immediately after me, and not to open it till the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis

him through all the files, to take care that no one meddled with the <hi>Siennois,</hi> for as to our
Baggage, it was so little, as it made no number. The Spanish Camp-Masters then came
to salute me, and all their Captains. The Camp-Masters alighted not, but all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
did, and came to embrace my knee, after which they again mounted on horseback, and
accompanied me till we came to the Marquis and Signior <hi>Chiapino,</hi> which might be about

With this, and other discourse of the same nature we entertain'd ourselves, till we were
got a mile beyond S. <hi>Lazaro,</hi> and there the Marquis bad Signior <hi>Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that if any one offer'd to take any thing from us, he should kill all such as should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, and that he should give the same command to the Captain of the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Harquebuzeers. So soon as Signior <hi>Chiapino</hi> was gone from us, the Marquis embracing
me in his arms said these words, in as good French as I could have spoke my self. <hi>Adieu
Monsieur</hi> de Montluc, <hi>I pray present my most humble service to the King, and assure him,
that I am his most humble and affectionate servant, as much (my honour safe) as any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in</hi> Italy. <hi>I then return'd him thanks for the good inclination he had towards the
King, and the courtesies I had receiv'd at his hands, which I would proclaim in all places
wherever I should come, and when it should ever lie in my power to do him service, would

than four or five horse with him, they being all behind in the same order he had left them,
and so he return'd back towards the City, and soon after Signior <hi>Chiapino Vitelli</hi> return'd,
where we also embrac'd and parted.</p>
            <p>We then went to <hi>Arbierroute,</hi> a little Village upon the <hi>Tresse,</hi> or else the River it self
is call'd <hi>Arbie,</hi> and there we found eighteen Asses loaden with bread, which the Marquis
had sent thither to distribute amongst us upon the way; of which one part I gave to the

through the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I saw that the Soldiers had also purposely brought bread along
with them to give to our people. I dare boldly say, and that by the testimony of those who
were then with me, that this bread sav'd the lives of two hundred persons, and there are
many who will affirm, that it sav'd the lives of four hundred, and yet could it not go so
far, that there was not above fifty who dy'd that very day; for we had been from <hi>Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
till <hi>Sunday</hi> without eating any more than six ounces of Biscuit a day a man; and
upon the <hi>Thursday</hi> of two horses I had, I kill'd one, that would now be worth 900
Crowns, he was then indeed very lean, which I divided amongst the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi>
Companies, causing all the oyl to be taken out of the Lamps in the Churches, which I
likewise divided amongst the Souldiers, who with Mallows and Nettles boil'd this flesh
and oyl,<note place="margin">Great famine in <hi>Sienna.</hi>
               </note> and so sustein'd themselves till <hi>Sunday</hi> morning, when not a man amongst us at
our going out, had eaten one bit of any thing in the world? The Marquis also caus'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105656:90"/>
four Borachio's of wine to be brought for me, together with five or six loaves of white
bread, and so soon as we came to <hi>Arbierroute,</hi> we halted, and under some Sallows that
were by the River side, eat our bread. I gave two of my Bottles of Wine to the <hi>Sien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
the other two we drank our selves, each one a little, and afterwards went on our
way directly towards <hi>Montalsin,</hi> when so soon as we came to <hi>Boncovent,</hi> Signior <hi>Cabry</hi>
made the foot Convoy to return: but till he saw Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> who came out
with a party of horse to meet us, would himself never leave us; and then he bade me far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,

able either of us to utter one word; neither am I able to say which of us had his heart
the most full of the remembrance of our fortunes. In this manner then, nothing but skin
and bone, and more like Ghosts than men, we arriv'd at <hi>Montalsin,</hi> which was upon
<hi>Sunday,</hi> and all <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tuesday</hi> we were shut up with the Treasurers and Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers,
to examine and state our accompts, and to see what I had borrow'd to lend the
Souldiers, where we found that the King was four months to us in arrear, and Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had not half so much more left; for Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and I had been constrain'd to
borrow 400 Crowns to disengage his great Order, which he had pawn'd to a Jew at the
beginning when he came to <hi>Sienna.</hi> I would afterwards have restor'd it to him, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>O Camrades, you who shall do me the honor to read my Book, will you not grant
me what I have said before, that God did ever as much go along with my fortune, as with
that of any other Captain of my time? You have observ'd the great adversities I sustein'd
in this Siege, and the little helps I had, nothing being to be expected from without, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
having his hands so full on eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> side. You have heard that no art nor force was
spar'd to reduce me, you have also seen the great famine I endur'd, the traverses the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis

               </note> you will find that I have been as much assisted by Almighty
God, as any man that has born Arms these hundred years. I cannot lye in my Book if
I would, there are too many witnesses alive for that. Do you not then see, that I spoke
the truth, when I said before, that we are to employ all that God has given to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we give our selves for overcome? Pray consider, whether or no any thing was here to be
omitted, or whether I ever omitted or forgot any thing in what condition soever I was,
but put this poor City, and moreover the Kings honour and reputation in dispute through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole world. I never call it to mind, but it makes me sad to think what a folly
I committed in exposing this City, together with his Majestities reputation, and all the
rest of us, to the Enemies discretion, at the last morsel of bread. For the King would
by no means have had me reduc'd to that, and let any one ask Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>la Chappelle,</hi> whom
his Majesty exprefly dispatch'd away to me, to give me advice, that I should not suffer
my self to be reduc'd to that extremity, as to come off to his dishonor. Princes are proud,
and fight more for glory than for purchase; and I must needs say, that it was not the
work of man, but of God, that we came off so good cheap, as we did.</p>
            <p>Two days before we came out of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the Senate gave me my discharge in Patent,<note place="margin">The Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Siennois</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Sieur <hi>de Ment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>
               </note>
signed with their broad Seal, acknowledging therein, that I would neither Capitulate
for the City, nor for our selves: but that considering the extremity to which they
were reduc'd, I would not hinder them from doing it, calling me to witness of the loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and fidelity they had manifested to his Majesties service, wherein they had in nothing
fail'd of the Oath they had made to him, and that I went out upon their Capitulation,
and not they upon mine. Now where will you find in any History, that ever man went
out of a place without capitulation, if he did not steal away by night, but not after the
manner I went out. For every one will confess that I did not belong to the <hi>Siennois</hi>
and that consequently they could not capitulate for me; as the Marquis told Signior <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelio,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Charry.</hi> So it was, that by the good will of God, I came out after
this manner, and the Patent is to be seen in the King's Treasury, as I shall say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>I know very well (Gentlemen) that many of you will take delight in what I have to
say to you, conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning the Government and Conservation of places, and that others will
make little account of it, forasmuch as there are a sort of people so good natur'd, as
to think they know all things of themselves, and nothing value the knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of other men, as if God had sent them into the world like S. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:105656:91"/>
inspir'd from their Mothers wombs. Which is the reason we are not to wonder, that
so many fall into mishaps; for their own arrogancy and self conceit, leads them by the
hand till they come to a Precipice, from whence they tumble headlong from the top to
the bottom, with so great a fall, that they are never able to rise again. Yet was this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
if the fall hurt no body but themselves; but the King and his people suffer also
by it. Do not then disdain to learn, and although you may have great experience of
your own, yet can it do you no great harm to hear and read the discourses of old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
When I was but five and twenty years old, I took more pleasure in hearing an
old Soldier talk, than ever I did to sit and chat with the finest woman that ever I was
in love with in my life; therefore I beseech you take a little notice of what I am going
to say.</p>
            <p>When your Prince shall give you a place to keep, you are to consider three things;
first the honor he does you in reposing so much confidence in your valour and wisdom,
as amongst others to make choice of you, to entrust with a Command of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Wherein the honor he does you, is no little one, forasmuch as he does not only
honor you in your own person, but moreover sets a mark of reputation upon your whole
race, by entrusting in your hands a Key of his Kingdom, or some City of very great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to him as this was, the Siege whereof I have related to you. This honor, I say,
that he does you, draws so long a train after it, that your renown does not only spread
it self through the whole Kingdom from whence you come, and the Countreys adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the place you defend, but moreover throughout the whole world. Every body is
curious to enquire who does well or ill, and who is a good or bad Commander; nay,
although we have no concern in the affair, yet are we evermore inquisitive after news, for
such is the nature of man: by which means thorow all Forreign Nations your name will
be for ever known, either to honour or infamy. For whatever is done, is committed to
History, without which the greatest part of men of Honor, would not care for acquiring
renown,<note place="margin">The desire of eternizing a mans name.</note> it costs so very dear. Never did any men ever purchase it upon harder terms
than I; but the laudable desire we have to perpetuate our names, makes the pain seem
easie to him who has a generous heart. Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hought all the time when I read <hi>Titus
Livie,</hi> that I saw all the brave <hi>Scipio's, Cato's,</hi> and <hi>Caesar's</hi> alive, and when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and saw the Capitol, calling to mind the things I had heard (for I for my own part was
ever a bad Reader) methought I ought to find those ancient Romans there. The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
then, who omit nothing of any kind in their writings, will mark your name in
white or black, with glory or with shame, according to your desert, as you see they
have done by so many Captains who have gone before us.</p>
            <p>The second thing that you ought to set before your eyes, is to consider if you lose the
place committed to you, first what a loss it will be to the King, it being part of his estate,
and his house, there being no Garrison, that is not properly the Kings own house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the revenue is his, of which you deprive him in losing the place, enrich his
Enemy, and augment his reputation, whilst you dishonor your own Master, who shall
read in the Histories dedicated to Eternity, that in his Reign such a Town, such a Castle,
such a Fortress was lost. You ought then to reflect upon the miseries you bring upon his
poor Subjects, how many curses will they load you with, who shall be neighbours to the
place you have lost; for they will certainly be destroy'd, and by your carelessness or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize
ruin'd and undone. They will curse the hour that ever you was born, and
especially the poor Inhabitants, who through your fault, must either change their King
and Master, or taking their children upon their backs, be constrain'd to seek another ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.
O that the poor English who had above three hundred years been settled in the
Town of <hi>Calice,</hi> have reason to curse the cowardize and treachery of him, who so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously
lost so strong a place! How can you ever have the confidence to look up, should
you once fall into such a misfortune as this? Before you were honor'd and esteem'd, and
every one rejoyc'd at your coming, praying to God to preserve and bless you; but should
you once fall into a misfortune like this, instead of prayers and acclamations, you shall
meet with affronts and injuries; for prayers, maledictions; and they will curse you to all
the Devils in Hell. Instead of caressing, they will turn their backs upon you, every one
will point at you, so that a hundred times a day, you will curse the hour that you were
not kill'd upon a platform, or in a breach in the defence of your Garrison, rather than
so shamefully to have given it up to your Enemy.</p>
            <p>And not only your Master, the Princes and Lords will look upon you with an eye
of contempt, but the very women and children; nay, I will say more, your own Wife,
though she make a shew of love,<note place="margin">Women hate Cowards.</note> will hate and despise you in her heart; for the nature
of all women is such, that they hate all Poltrons, let them be never so proper men, or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105656:91"/>
never so handsomely dress'd, and love the bold and couragious, let them be never so
slovenly or deform'd. They participate of your shame, and although being in your arms
in bed, they may pretend to be glad of your return, they with in their hearts you had
been smother'd, or carried away by a Canon shot: for as we conceive it to be the greatest
disgrace to a man to have a Whore to his Wife, the women also think that the greatest
shame can befal them is to have a Coward to their husband: and thus <hi>Monsieur le Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi>
you who have lost your place, you will be in a marvellous happy condition, when
you shall be curss'd in your own bed.</p>
            <p>But what shall we say of your Children? people will not only reproach them, that
they are the sons of a Cowardly father;<note place="margin">Children de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam'd by the Father.</note> but they will moreoever themselves see his name
in Print, and the mischiefs of which his Cowardize has been the cause. For a Town is
never lost, let it be never so considerable, that it does not draw a great deal of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
along with it. It brings so mighty an inconvenience upon your children, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
your ill repute, and to raise their own to some tollerable degree of esteem, they
must hazard their lives upon all occasions, without either fear or wit, and few escape
being kill'd, who by this means to wipe off the stain from their family, would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize
themselves. How many have I seen in my time, who by endeavouring to repair
some notorious fault, have lost themselves and expos'd themselves to death upon the first
occasion has presented it self, being asham'd to live. And though your children should
escape these dangers, yet will the King be afraid (what great reputation soever they may
have acquir'd) to trust a Town to their custody, left the Son should take after the Father,
as it ordinarily comes to pass. Thus shall you not only ruine your selves, but your
whole Family.</p>
            <p>To avoid and to break the neck of your ill fortune; and of all these mishaps, there is
a good remedy, which I have learn'd my self, and am willing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each it you, if you know
it not already. First you ought to consider all this that I have told you, and set on the
one side the shame, and on the other the honor you will obtain, if you bravely defend
your place, remaining victorious; or at the least having done all that a man of Honour
could do, to come off Triumphant, and like a Conqueror, though you be overcome,
as you see I did in this Siege. Imagine still that you see your Prince and Master be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, and what countenance you ought to hope for, if by your Cowardize you lose
his place. And seeing nothing ever had a beginning, but that it had likewise an end,
consider from the beginning what the end is like to be, and remember that your Master
has not entrusted this place in your hands to deliver it up, but to defend it; that he has
put you into it, not to live there only, but to dye there also bravely fighting, if occasion
be. If you ask him at your going away to your Command, Sir, must I dye before I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
the place you have given me in trust? he will tell you, that you are to fight to the
last moment of your life; for being you are his Subject,<note place="margin">A Saying of the Sieur <hi>de Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi> to the King.</note> your life is his. The Seigneur <hi>de
Iarnac</hi> one day told the King, that it was the greatest craft and Policy, that ever Kings
found out, to make their Subjects believe, that their lives were theirs, and that it was the
greatest honor they could have to dye for their service: but that it was a great simplicity
in us to believe it, and to keep such a clutter with this fine bed of honor. It is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
true, that our lives and estates are the Kings, our souls belong to God, and our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is our own, for over my honor the King has no power at all.</p>
            <p>To return to what I was saying before, if in accepting the charge committed to you,
you have not this resolution within your selves, you would do a great deal better to
make an excuse. There are ways enow to put it off, and there will be enow,<note place="margin">A Captain must never fear death</note> who will
be glad to accept of what you refuse. If you accept it with a resolution to bring it to
a handsome issue, do one thing, never think of dying. `Tis for a Coxcomb to fear death,
till he see it within three inches of him, and yet cannot he forbear representing it to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
though it be a hundred Leagues off. On the contrary, meditate how to kill
your Enemy; for if you once enter into an apprehension and fear of death, you may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
give your place for lost; for that is to take away your understanding and your
judgement, which is the best piece in your harness. Tis to much purpose to be valiant,
if this fail you at need; which if you intend to preserve, you must by no means enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this fear of dying; for fear is of it self, and by the fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lty of our own nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo apt
to intrude upon us, without our needing to assist it with our own imagination. If then
it present it self before you, you must reject it, and have sudden recourse to the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the King, and to what end he plac'd you there. Think of the shame and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
you are running into. Read often, or cause to be read to you, Books that speak of
the honor of great Captains, principally those of our own times; as for example, <hi>Langey</hi>
and another, who has writ in Italian (I cannot think of his name) who has writ to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105656:92"/>
well since King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight. I have often read him, and he is a very good Author.
Would to God that all of us who bear arms would take up a custom to write the things
we see and do; for I am of opinion it would be better done by our own hands (I mean as
to feats of war) than by those letter'd men, for they too much disguise the truth, and this
relishes of the Clerk. Read then these Books, and meditate with your selves, if I do like
<hi>Antonio de Leva</hi> at <hi>Pavie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Captains that have well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended places.</note> the Sieur <hi>de Lude</hi> at <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> the Signeur <hi>de Bouillon</hi> at <hi>Peronne,</hi>
the Signior <hi>de Sansac</hi> at <hi>Miranda,</hi> and <hi>Montluc</hi> at <hi>Sienna,</hi> what will they say of me?
what honor shall I carry back to my own house? and on the contrary, if I surrender, what
shame and infamy for me and mine? Then apply your selves to Almighty God, and beg
of him that he will defend you from falling into these misfortunes, resigning up all things
into his hands. After this assist your selves with all that he has put into the power of men,
as you see I did in this Siege, and above all things be always diligent and vigilant, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
mindful of your charge, if you do this (forgetting withal death and danger) you
will find means to defend your place, though it were but a Dove-Coat; and though it
should be lost, you having perform'd your duty, you must conclude it to be by the hand
of God. We must however always trie; for I have seen a place lost that was never suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be in danger, and such a one sav'd as has been given over for gone. If you there
die in your defence, you will neither dishonor your selves nor your posterity, but shall be
laid in your grave with an immortal renown, which is all that a man of arms ought to
desire. For a man that fears to die ought never to go to the wars,<note place="margin">A man that fears dying must never go to wars.</note> there being in the world
so many other employments to which he may apply himself, especially in this Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> where there are so many orders, what of Justice, and what of the Finances; too
many indeed for the good of the King and of his Kingdom, such a brave and numerous
youth living idle, who would be fit to bear arms. As I have entred sometimes into the
Parliaments of <hi>Tholouze</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> since my being the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Guienne,</hi>
I have a hundred times wondred how it was possible so many young m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n should eternally
amuse themselves in a<note n="*" place="margin">Or Hall, or Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or Law.</note> Palace, considering that the blood ordinarily boyls in young men;
I believe it is nothing but custome, and the King could not do better, than to drive away
these people, and to enure them to arms. But to return to you who have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of places, and you who have a mind to put your selves into a Town to defend it, if
you so much fear death, never go, though it be but a folly to fear it, for those that blow
the fire at home in their own houses are no more exempt than the others, and I do not
know what choice there is betwixt dying of a Stone in the kidneys, and being knocked o'th'
head with a Musket bullet, though, if God would give me my choice, I should not be long
in choosing.</p>
            <p>Above all things (Camrades) you must be sure to be evermore intent upon your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and have your Judgment Centinel to spy what he can do against you; and play two
parts, saing to your self, If I was the Assailant, what would I do? on which side should
I make my attaque? for you ought to believe that your opinion, and that of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
do very often jump. Communicate then what you have thought of to such as you
know to be of understanding, sometimes in common, that you may give no distaste to the
rest; but most frequently in private. When you shall find your selves engaged with a
people, where you are to piss small, and have not the ruling power, apply your selves
to their humours, and bite your tongues rather than speak too much. Reduce them by
sweetness and obligation, and above all things, when you are to suffer, your selves shew
the way. For if you <hi>(Monsieur le Governor)</hi> will keep open house, and in the mean time
cut others short of their bread, you will draw upon you the hatred of all your Captains
and Soldiers, and it is but reasonable that you who have the greatest share of honor, should
likewise have the greatest share of suffering.</p>
            <p>I will put you in mind of another thing,<note place="margin">A Governor ought fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to shew himself to the people.</note> which is, that when extraordinary want pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon you, you seldom remain shut up in your Cabinet, but shew your selves to the
Captains and Soldiers, and appear to the people with a chearful and assured countenance,
Your single presence will redouble their courage. I have in my time known several of
the King's Lieutenants, who have driven away the Gentlemen, by making them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wait too long in their Halls, without vouchsasing to speak to them. A Gentleman
will be civilly used, especially a Gascon, and in the mean time they pretend to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
busie. I have known one once in my life (whom nevertheless, because he was
Master of a great many very good qualities, I shall forbear to name, for no man is perfect)
who two hours in a day would constantly lock himself up in his Closer, pretending to be
busie about some dispatch of importance, but it was to read <hi>Orlando Furioso</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi>
as his own Secretary told us, which we took highly ill from him, we being in the mean
time left to measure his Hall, or to take a survey of his Court. Do not use men of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105656:92"/>
so. Your hours of vacancy and pleasure ought to be spent in walking upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
and visiting the Magazines, to see that nothing be wanting.</p>

to serve your selves with the means I used to rid my self of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emple

any treason, and cannot discover the bottom of it, cause some counterfeit information
to be given you, and without naming the person, say you are inform'd that there is
treason plotted against you, and that you are upon the point to discover it; pretend also
to have some intelligence in your Enemies Camp, though you have none, for this will be
a Countermine. I will say but this one word to you more, which is, that you set at once
before your eyes the favour and displeasure of your Prince, for you have your choice. A
King's inchgnation does not cool like that of another man. They seldom forgive a man
that makes them lose any thing, for they would alwayes win. How was that brave Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Lautrec</hi> received at his return from <hi>Millan,</hi> and yet God knows he was not in
fault. He was wont to say, it was the greatest affliction of his whole life. Suffer then
all sorts of extremities, and omit nothing that men of honor ought to do. I know very
well that men must lose and win, and that no place is impregnable; but choose rather a
hundred thousand times to die, if all other means fail, than to pronounce that infamous
and hateful, I yield.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> lent me a Galley to carry me back into <hi>France,</hi> and sent a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his, a young man of twenty years of age, and a Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> to <hi>Civita Vechia</hi>
to make it ready,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and would that the Knight should himself conduct me to <hi>Marseilles.</hi>
On Wednesday morning then I took post, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I arriv'd about four
of the clock in the afternoon, having sent the Captains <hi>Lussan, Blacon,</hi> and <hi>St. Auban</hi> to
stay for me at <hi>Civita Vechia;</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> having given them leave for four
months, the rest remain'd with the said Signeur. The Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac</hi> lodg'd
me in his own Palace, and I was receiv'd with as much honor by all the Kings Ministers,
as any Gentleman could be. They had already heard of my coming out of <hi>Sienna,</hi> the
Marquis having sent word of it by an express Courrier to the Cardinal his Brother. I there
found Monsieur <hi>le</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Father of this that
now is, being yet there since the creation of Pope <hi>Marcellinus.</hi> His Holiness asked the
Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> if I was arriv'd, as he had been told, to which the Cardinal making
answer, that I was, he entreated him to bring me to him, for he had a great desire to see
me. The Cardinal found me at the Ambassadors Monsieur <hi>d'Avanson,</hi> where he told
me that I must go to his Holiness, who had a desire to see me, and Monsieur <hi>d'Avanson</hi>
lent me his own Coach. I found the Pope newly got up, and set in a Chair by his Bed side,
so ill that he had much ado to speak: but nevertheless he entertained me with very great
favour. I told him that I would not now trouble his Holiness with discourse, but that
I hoped God would in two or three daies restore him to his health, and that then I would
come and give him an account how all things had passed at <hi>Sienna.</hi> He then told me that
he had already been informed of me, but that he should be glad to hear it again from my
own mouth; adding these words, <hi>That I might say never any man, of what Nation soever,
had ever had so much interest, love, and esteem among the Siennois as I.</hi> I then took my
leave that I might not be a trouble to him, and returning back found the Cardinal <hi>de Guise</hi>
still at the Ambassadors, to whom I said, that they might again go enter the Conclave to
choose another Pope, for that this by to-morrow night would not be alive, and my words
prov'd true; for the next day about Vespers he died,<note place="margin">The death of Pope <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus.</hi>

morning by break of day I went aboard. The pomps, pleasures, delights and curiosities
of this City could not detein me a day longer, conceiving I might elsewhere be serviceable
to the King my Master. One thing I must needs say, though it be in my own commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
that as I passed along the streets, and going to the Castle of <hi>St. Angelo,</hi> every one
ran to the windows, and to their doors to see the man that had so long defended <hi>Sienna.</hi>
Which only serv'd to enflame my courage the more to acquire more honor; and though
I had scarce money to carry me home, I fancied my self as rich as the greatest man in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About break of day we set sail, with as good a wind as we could desire, and in the
close of the evening came to <hi>Capocorea,</hi> we there came to an Anchor, and two hours before
day passed the straight betwixt <hi>Sardignia</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> and about nine of the clock in the

that Prince <hi>Auria</hi> was gone towards <hi>Piombino</hi> with three or four thousand Soldiers,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lle,</hi> who immediately thereupon sent away to
the said Sieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and so seasonably, that he was scarce risen in time to avoid being
surpriz'd, and was constrain'd, as he himself told me since, to tumble three pieces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
into the Sea, which he afterwards went to fish out again. I there did him a good
turn, and a good piece of service for the King my Master. You who bear arms, and have
a desire to serve your Princes well, have evermore an eye to every thing that concerns
them, to give notice of every thing that you conceive conducing to their service. I have
known some such good friends, as have rejoyced at the miscarriage of their Companions,
thinking to augment their own glory by their disgrace: I never did so, nor would I do it
to the greatest Enemy I had in the world. Of this I could produce great and notable
exemples; but I pass them by to return to my business. The Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> lay also in
a Sea port near unto the place where Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> was, and had speedy intelligence,
that prince <hi>Auria's</hi> Fleet was out at sea, but he knew not where, however suspecting the

Garde</hi> in this Haven where he lay, he had intelligence that he was gone away not above
five or six hours before, which made him to follow after, steering the same course (which
was upon the same Saturday, that I had the good gale of wind) and pursued him as far
as the Isles <hi>Dicrcs.</hi> The Baron without staying held on his course towards <hi>Mars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

it was well he did so, for had he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tayed at the Islands he had been trussed, forasmuch as
he had no more than fourteen or fifteen Gallies. I departed from Monsieur <hi>de la Molle</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sunday about ten of the clock, and of all day could make no way, the wind being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
but about two hours before day the same wind we had upon Saturday before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and we set forward, it being Monday morning.</p>
            <p>About break of day I asked the Knight, if they had no bigger sails, who told me, these
were the largest they had, enquiring of me why I asked that question, and whether I
had a mind to make more haste, to which I made answer that I had, whereupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
clapt a sail upon the Missen, and about break of day there fell a great mist, which
continued till the Sun grew pretty high, that it began to disperse: the Watch then from
the Main-top began to cry out <hi>a sail, a sail,</hi> and presently after <hi>a Galley, a Galley,</hi> at which
the Knight told me,<note place="margin">Two and fifty Galleys of Prince <hi>Auria.</hi>
               </note> that they could be no other than either Prince <hi>Auria,</hi> or the Baron
<hi>de la Garde.:</hi> When the mist suddenly clearing up we saw our selves in the middle of
two and fifty Galleys, whereof fourteen that were separated from the rest of the Fleet
stcered their course toward <hi>Sardignia,</hi> and we were between them. Every one in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
then began to despair; the Pilots would make for the Coasts of <hi>Barbary</hi> to escape;
the Master was not of this opinion, but rather that we should make forwards by force of
O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s and Sails: <hi>St. Auban</hi> and the other Captains were in the greatest fright that possibly
could be, saying, that being newly come out of so great an extremity as the Siege of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
they were upon the point to be reduc'd to that misfortune, as to see themselves chain'd to
the Oar, which rather than to undergo, they had far better die with their swords in their
hands. What face soever I might set upon the matter, I was in no much better heart
than they, and would have been glad to have been planting Cabages. On a sudden four
of the fourteen began to turn their prows to fall upon us, whilst the others in the mean
time stroke sayl to stay for them; and as the other had made all the sail they could to come
upon us with all their Oars amain, the heads of their Galleys were just over against our
Cook-room. Now the Knight all this while not speaking one word, whilst every body
in the Galley was crying out in a miserable confusion, I said to him, <hi>O Knight, you seem
to lose your self; you have been br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with one of the bravest men that ever went to Sea, which
was the Prior of Capua;</hi> to which he made answer, <hi>No me perde, no me perde per Dio: mas
io gardo la mie.</hi> The Enemies Gallies in the mean time came within a Harquebuz shot to
enclose us, and then the Knight running from Poop to Prow, encouraged every one, making
them to row amain, insomuch that when they thought to have hemm'd us in, we were
got above fifty paces before them, and began to bestow upon them some Harquebuz shot.
They pursued us about half a league; but by reason of our three sails, together with our
fear that lent us wings, it seem'd as if our Galley flew before them, so that they presently
gave us over, and tack'd about, and our Seamen plyed them with their courteous kind of
language, every one striving who should pay them most with railing; and thus by the
great diligence of our Seamen, we in despite of them escap'd. Towards night the wind
began so to slacken, and change upon us, that we could not get to <hi>Marseilles</hi> till Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
supper time, where we found the Count <hi>de Tande,</hi> the Countess, and the Baron <hi>de
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105656:93"/>
la Garde</hi> at supper in the Garden of Monsieur <hi>Blancart,</hi> who were all astonish'd to see me,
having made account that I was dead, and <hi>Sienna</hi> sack'd and burnt down to the ground;
for they being in <hi>Corsica</hi> had heard news day by day from <hi>Romania,</hi> that I was at the last
extremity without any hopes of composition; the Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> had been confident
in this belief all the while he was with Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> in <hi>Corsica,</hi> and also after he
was come back to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and that I would play a desperate game at my coming out,
in case the Marquis would not give me such conditions as I would have. Others said
that I had lost my understanding, and that God would punish me for my great temerity
and folly. They were talking of me just as I entred into the Garden, but they would
not let me tell them any thing till I had supp'd, for they had almost done. I had soon
dispatch'd, for I was forbid to eat much after I had fasted so long, which I think was
the death of very many after they came out; for nature must by little and little be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and restor'd to her usual habit. I afterwards gave them an account from point
to point of all that I had done, which they thought very strange. The Baron was very
much astonish'd when I told him, that Prince <hi>Auria</hi> had pursued him as far as the Isles
<hi>Dieres,</hi> giving God thanks that he had not yielded to the importunity of those he had
with him, who would have perswaded him to cast Anchor at the Islands, and gave Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Termes</hi> for lost, or at least all his Artillery: but I told him, that upon my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
Monsicur <hi>de Molle</hi> had dispatch'd away to him in all diligence to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
The next day I dispatch'd away the Sieur <hi>de Lecussan</hi> to the King, to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
notice of my arrival, for the Count had told me,<note place="margin">The King dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> that the King was very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
with me, for suffering my self to be reduc'd to the last morsel, by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he could expect no other than the loss of me, and the ruine of the City, upon which
depended all his reputation in <hi>Italy.</hi> See what hazards we run to serve these Princes! but
there is no remedy, they are born to command, and we to serve and obey; and God
knows if I had not cause to complain to be so abandon'd, and left a prey; but 'tis all one
they think it yet too much honor for us to die in their Quarrels. The Baron mightily
pressed me to send thither, and moreover made <hi>Lecussan</hi> promise him to ride night and
day, which he did. I stayd with them until Friday morning, that I took post and came
to St. <hi>Mathurin</hi> the 9th or the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> where I found the said Sieur <hi>de Lecussan,</hi>
who staid there to tell me the great joy the King was in when he heard the whole story,
his Majesty wondring at my fortune, and saying to every one, that he thought me the
most fortunate man upon earth, after such and so long a Siege, and without hopes of relief,
to come so honorably away, especially having to do not only with the Emperor, but also
with the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> who desir'd to be reveng'd of the <hi>Siennois.</hi> He looked also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the escape I had by Sea, out of the clutches of Prince <hi>Auria,</hi> for a singular good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
The next morning I was at the rising of Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> who could never have
his fill of embracing me, and led me to the Kings Bed-chamber, who was yet in Bed, but
awake. At his entring into the Chamber he began to cry out aloud, leading me in by the
hand, <hi>Sir, here is your lost man,</hi> and I then drew near to kiss his Majestie's hands, who
embrac'd me with both his arms, holding my head to his bosom, almost as long as one
might be saying a <hi>Pater noster,</hi> saying to me twice whilst he held me in this posture.

my life to do it; whereupon he again embrac'd me, and then start out of his bed. I then
retired my self to the appartment the Vice-Chamberlain by his Majestie's order had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for me, as well satisfied with the gracious countenance of my Master, as if he had
given me the noblest Present; for I have ever been proud,<note place="margin">The Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so, being a Gascon. This alone had been sufficient to have made me have gone through
impossibilities. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Constable were at this time at <hi>Ardres,</hi>
treating a Peace betwixt the Emperor and the King.</p>
            <p>After, when his Majesty had din'd, about one of the clock he retir'd into the Gallery,
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> only being with him, where he was pleased to call for me, and so soon

have me to give him an account at large of all the particularities of this Siege, from the
first day I enter'd into <hi>Sienna,</hi> to the last, which made the story continue so long, that
the Captains who were come along with me, and waited without upon the Terrals, told
me, that they heard the clock strike five times whilst I was in the Gallery with the King.
He was very much delighted with the order I took about the retrenchment of the bread,
and the manner after which I did it, together with the Remonstrances I made to the
Captains, and to the Senate. He was also mightily pleased with the resolution I had taken
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105656:94"/>
to give the Marquis battail in the City, and above all things with the order I had drawn
in reference to it, which was at that time much fresher in my memory than it is now,
and was printed in <hi>Italy;</hi> and I remember the last time I return'd out of <hi>Tuscany</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Vrbin</hi> told me at <hi>Pesero,</hi> that he had it by him, and had never in his life read
any thing that pleased him so much as that. His Majesty would also that I should make a
Narrative of it in writing, which I did, and whereof he distributed several Copies to divers
Governors, and one I remember he caused to be sent to <hi>Mariambourg,</hi> where the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>de Cosseé</hi> commanded, or else Monsieur <hi>de Fumel.</hi> He expressed a great sense of pity
when he heard the business of turning out the useless mouths, and in conclusion was pleased
to ask me two questions.<note place="margin">A question of the King's to the Sieur de <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> The first was, how I could make the four Nations, mortal enemies
to one another, agree so well together; for all of them in general, as he had been told, had
behav'd themselves so exceedingly well to one another, without the least disorder, that they
could not possibly have done it better: A thing that every one looked upon as a miracle,
so much as the Emperor himself, wondring I could compose these people after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
(the <hi>Italians</hi> themselves, who came out of <hi>Italy</hi> reporting it to him) as an unheard
of thing.<note place="margin">His pleasant Answer.</note> To which I made answer, that I had found it a very easie matter, and (being
I saw he had a mind to hear it, and that I saw he took a delight in my Narration) I told
him, that I went one Saturday into the Market, where in the sight of all the people I bought
a Sack, and a little Cord to tye it with, together with a Fagot, all which having before
them all laid upon my Shoulder, when I came to my Chamber I call'd for fire to light
my Fagot, and after took the Sack, and there put into it all my ambition, all my avarice,
my particular hatreds, my letchery, my gluttony, my sloth, my partiality, my envy, my
particularities, and all my Gascon humours, and to be short, all that I conceiv'd might
hinder me from considering every thing I was to do in order to his Majesties service; and
told him moreover, that if all his Ministers to whom he entrusted the commands of
men and places would do the same, his Majesties affais could not but prosper; for my
mind was ever free and undisturbed with any thing that might hinder me from consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I had to do, and bring about my design, which was never to go out of that
place but with the last morsel in my mouth; and I will say moreover, that whoever shall
strip themselves of the forementioned vices, and burn them, God will ever be assisting to
them, who favouring our designs, we cannot fail to effect whatever we have a mind to
undertake. For God ever goes along with such people, and on the contrary abandons
those who do not serve their Masters after this manner, because they forfeit the Oath they
have taken, having sworn loyally and faithfully to serve him, which no man can possibly
do reteining these vices. His Majesty laughed at my discourse, commanding me to tell
him one thing, and to tell him true, to which I made answer, that I would no more lye
to him than I would to God Almighty.<note place="margin">Another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the King's to the Sieur de <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>
               </note> He then asked me whether Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>
could not have reliev'd me if he would; for his Ministers at <hi>Rome</hi> had several times sent
him word, that he was in a capacity to do it, and that it only stuck at him that I was not
reliev'd? To which I answer'd, that his Majesty asked me a thing himself was better able
to resolve than I. How can that be said he, seeing I have not been upon the place? Sir,
said I, you Kings and Princes have so long ears, that you hear every thing that is done,
though you be a hundred leagues off: notwithstanding I told him that his Majesty being
engaged in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Calice,</hi> at <hi>Mariambourg,</hi> and other neighbouring Castles; at <hi>Metz,</hi>
and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and in <hi>Corsica,</hi> he ought better to know than I, whether after having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all things necessary for all these places, wherein his honor was engaged, he had been in
a condition to send money to the said Sieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> wherewith to raise a sufficient Army
of horse and foot to fight so great forces as the Marquis had before <hi>Sienna;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Monsieur de <hi>Strozzy</hi> to the King.</note> which if his
Majesty had not been able to do, how could he imagine Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, who had not a man to make head against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans?</hi> That
of <hi>Italians</hi> it was true, he might have had but too many: but that had been no equal
match: that Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi> was full of courage, and very affectionate to his service;
but that no one could flye without wings; and that three several times he had run very
great hazards for his service, of which I also gave him a particular account. His Majesty
then told me, that he was satisfied with my answer, and that he believ'd Monsieur <hi>de
Strozzy</hi> to be his servant, and too much a man of honor to be any way in fault; making
me thereupon very many excuses, for that having been engaged in so many places at once,
it had not been possible for him to send an Army into <hi>Italy</hi> to the said Sieur <hi>de Strozzy</hi>
strong enough to raise the Siege, and to give the Marquis battail. Why then Sir, said I,
you are neither to blame Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> nor your self, both of you having done all
that lay in your power, but this will reach you another time to look better to your affairs.
This was a charity had been done the said Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> who was as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105656:94"/>
as the King, and more about the loss of <hi>Sienna,</hi> for the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tred he bore to the Duke
of <hi>Florence.</hi> After we had ended our discourse, his Majesty went out to look the Queen,
and Madam <hi>de Savoy</hi> that now is, to whom he repeated all that I had said to him, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that about Monsieur <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> which the Queen was very glad of, and the next day
did me the honor to give me thanks for the office of friendship I had done Monsieur <hi>de
Strozzy,</hi> who was a concern of hers. I had no reason to do otherwise, for besides that I
had lied, I had a particular honor for him, and it was just I should have so, forasmuch
as he lov'd and esteem'd me more than any Gentleman that ever came out of <hi>Gascony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was upon <hi>Monday</hi> and upon <hi>Tuesday,</hi> Madam <hi>de Valentinois</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Madam</hi> de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinois.</note> told me, that she had
never known any man return from an employment with whom the King was better satisfied
than he was with me, and that he did highly commend me. Which whether or no she
said to flatter me, I cannot say: but she better knew then any other, for she had very
much gain'd the King's heart, and told me that I was very happy. As I was talking
with her, the King came, and put me again upon some passages of my voyage. Now I
had there the Patent and Declaration the Senate had given me under their broad Seal;
wherein was declar'd, that I would never consent to the Surrender of <hi>Sienna,</hi> nor Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
in the name of the King: but also that they call'd me to witness, whether they
would ever hear of any Capitulation, till they were reduc'd to the utmost extremity, and
the last morsel of bread. His Majesty took the Patent, and read it; after which he ask'd
me, Why I would not Capitulate for my self and the Souldiers, telling me that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Marquis did not defeat me at my coming out. To which I made answer,<note place="margin">The resolution of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> That
it was for two Reasons, whereof one was, that I had made a resolution never to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any place; but rather to dye, and that the name of <hi>Montluc</hi> should never be found
to a Surrender or a Capitulation, having never put my self into a Town to deliver it up,
but to defend it to the last moment of my life, as I had sent word to the Marquis by
Signior <hi>Cornelio</hi> and Captain <hi>Charry.</hi> The other Reason why I would not Capitulate
was, that in case either His Majesty, or any of his Successors, should hereafter reconquer
<hi>Sienna,</hi> and that the <hi>Siennois</hi> should fortifie themselves with his protection, as they had
done before, he might herein be left free to his own liberty and discretion. For they
could not say, that his Lieutenant <hi>Montluc</hi> had consented to their Surrender, and that
His Majesty ought not to quit his own interest; nor that of those who were to succeed
him to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The chances of War, Sir, said I, are divers and variable.
<hi>Millan</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> have been the one twice, the other three times in our possession, and
<hi>Sienna</hi> may be ours again. I have done nothing to prejudice your title, His Majesty
lik'd my Reason so well, that he remain'd very well satisfied, commanding me to lay up
the Patent amongst the Records of my Family, that it might be preserv'd for ever.
Madam <hi>de Valentinois</hi> then put in, and said, that the Archives of a private Gentleman,
was not so secure, as the Treasury of a King, and that if this Patent was of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
his Majestie might do well to cause it to be laid up in his. He then took it out
of my hand, and gave it to one of his Gentlemen, or else to Madam <hi>de Valentinois</hi> to
deliver it to Monsieur <hi>le Garde de Sceaux,</hi> who since was Cardinal of <hi>Sens,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to lay it up in his Treasury, amongst the Evidences of the Crown. This cannot
be above sixteen or seventeen years ago: So that if it would please the King his Son, who
now reigns, to command Monsieur <hi>de Fizes,</hi> who was at that time Secretary to the
Cardinal, to search for the Patent, I am confident it would be found. I would I had
given 500 Crowns for a Duplicate of it, that I might have such a Record of my self,
and insert it in my Book. For that will testifie that I came out of <hi>Sienna</hi> with Colours
flying, Arms shoulder'd, and Drums beating, without any Capitulation at all. A thing
not to be found in any History, that ever any man did the like. So that no one ought
to think it strange, that I so much desire a Copy of that Patent; neithet ought the
King so much to despise it, as to be out of hopes one day to make it useful to him, and
His Majesty ought rather to be curious than I to have it sought out; for he is the most
concern'd.</p>
            <p>The day following being <hi>Wednesday,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> in the evening told me, that
His Majesty was the next day resolv'd to give me the Order; which in those times was so
noble a thing, and so much sought for, that the greatest Prince in <hi>France</hi> would not have
been satisfied without it, and would rather the King should never confer any honor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, than deny him that; for it was then a mark of honor, that was not so profan'd
as it is now adays. The next day then,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> made Knight of the Order.</note> being <hi>Thursday</hi> in the morning, the King was
pleas'd to honour me with it, and after dinner I begg'd leave of him, that I might go to
<hi>Paris,</hi> to put my self into some tollerable Equipage, for that I was too torn and tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
for a new Knight of the Order. He was pleas'd at the first word to grant me leave,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105656:95"/>
and before I went gave me an allowance of three thousand Francs in Pension out of the
Exchequer, and three thousand Livers Revenue out of his Demeasn, wherein the County
of <hi>Guar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rest. I two years enjoy'd the County, but not <hi>Bregeyrac,</hi> forasmuch as it was mortgag'd
before. I very much desir'd to disengage it, because Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother
had a Priory there, and had rather have settled himself in <hi>Perigort,</hi> than any other part
of <hi>France.</hi> If I could have done it, I should very well have prevented the Roguery
that has been hatch there since. His Majesty also gave me two thousand Crowns in ready
money,<note place="margin">Recompences given by the King to the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </note> bidding me moreover ask him any thing else that I wanted. I then asked him
two Councellors places in the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouze,</hi> to help to raise my daughter's
Portion, whom I married to Monsieur de <hi>Fontenilles,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> having sent me
instructions from <hi>Paris</hi> to ask that of the King, of which I should sooner raise money
than of any other thing. His Majesty was pleased at the first word to give me this also,
and with this money I married my said daughter, together with some little more that my
wife had. His Majesty moreover promised me the first Company of <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> that
should become vacant. I had not the first, nor the second, but I had the third; for
Kings promise so much, that it is not possible for them to keep their words with all. This
vacancy hapned after my return from <hi>Montalsin,</hi> the second time his Majesty had sent
me beyond the Mountains, and was the Company of Monsieur <hi>de la Guish.</hi> There were
the benefits I receiv'd from the King at that time, which were no small ones, and in
brief I had whatever I desir'd. I am sure since the death of this good Prince my Master
I have a hundred times wish'd my own, considering the traverses have been given me,
and the crosses I have had.<note place="margin">The good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> It had not been in the power of mankind to have done me
wrong if he had liv'd, for he never forgot any services, let them be never so inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
neither was it in the power of calumny to take away his good opinion from any one
that did him good service. And on the contrary when any one fail'd in his duty, what
good countenance soever he might shew them, out of complacency to such as would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posess
him of the ill opinion he had conceiv'd, it never came from his heart, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
<hi>de St. Andre'</hi> has often assur'd me, who told me his humour. He was very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
with him, and understood him very well. Five or six daies after, his Majesty came to
<hi>Paris,</hi> where I ask'd leave of him to go home to my own house, to see my family, which
he freely granted. I shall never conceal the benefits, and the honor my Masters have
conferr'd upon me, that being only worthy, and becomming a mean and dirty nature,
and an ungrateful heart.</p>

COMMENTARIES

MARESCHAL of
FRANCE. The Fourth Book.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had scarce been three weeks at my own house,<note place="margin">The King's command to the Sieur de <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> when His Majesty
dispatch'd a Courrier to me, commanding me forthwith to repair
to him wherever he was, without reply, or staying for any other
command: which I presently did, having scarce seen my house
and my friends: But <hi>Glory is a notable spur.</hi> At my arrival His
Majesty told me, that I must of necessity go into <hi>Piedmont</hi> to
Monsieur <hi>de Brissac,</hi> who had sent to demand me to command
the Foot, making account that to relieve S. <hi>Iago,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>de
Bonnivet</hi> was shut up, he must be forc'd to come to a Battel. Two
days after I had my dispatch, the King manifesting great tokens of Friendship to me,
and to be very well satisfied with my service. I found Monsieur <hi>de Brissac</hi> at <hi>Turin</hi>
very ill of the Gout; and the next day went to seek out Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> who
commanded the Army at S. <hi>Valant</hi> near <hi>Vlpian,</hi> which consisted of five thousand foot,
a thousand men at Arms, and twelve hundred Light Horse. The King at my going
away, gave me a Courser of his own, which was an exceeding good one, and which I
ordered with my Train to follow after me, for I went post. The same day that I came
to Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> I would go to take a view of <hi>Vlpian,</hi> in order to a siege; for the
Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had made a fool of the work, and quitted S. <hi>Iago;</hi> and the laid Sieur <hi>d'
Aumale</hi> lent me a little grey Nag. I went then in open day to discover the place, with
in less then fifty paces of the wall; for I would let them see, that for having been
lately with my Wife, I had forgot nothing of what I was wont to do. This discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was made in the sight of Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> and several others: where at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
I gave him so good an account, that he found I had told him the truth of all.
The next day he drew part of the Army toward the Castle, where the Enemy had cast
up a great Platform, environed with a large ditch, with a<note n="*" place="margin">A Tenaille is a kind of Fortification of the shape of a pair of Pincers.</note> Tenaille that covered the Castle, and betwixt the Tenaille and the Castle, there was fourscore paces or more; in
which space they had moreover cast up a Trench in the middle; to the end, that in case
they should lose the head of this great Bastion and Tenaille, before they could get to the
Castle, they might retire to this Trench. Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> had at this time for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers
<hi>Duno</hi> and <hi>Balasergues,</hi> who began their Trenches above five hundred paces from
the Town, where they found the earth so full of little slints, that a hundred men could
not cast up twenty paces of Trench in a day, and the said Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> spent
two days in this kind of work. I was very much discontented that they would not do<note place="margin">The Siege in <hi>Sep.</hi> 1555.</note>
as I would have them; but in the end Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> was resolved himself to see
what I would counsel him to do, so that an hour after day-light, we went on that side
by the corner of the Town on the left hand, and behind a little Chappel, which was
within fifteen or twenty paces of the Counterscarp. He took no soul living with him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105656:96"/>
but me and <hi>Fequieres,</hi> who as I have been told, has since fac'd about to the House of
<hi>Guise,</hi> though the said Seigneur shewed him as much favour and respect, as any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
about him. Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> and I went upon the Counterscarpe,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> goes himself to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</note> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
went underneath, where we measured how much of the Counterscarpe we were
to cut, to plant the Artillery upon the brink of the Ditch; and to discover also if the
Enemies Harquebuzeers might not see into the Recoil of the Canon, and us also, should
we lodge on the other side of the Counterscarp. We went upon it, and all along by
the Ditches above sixscore paces, and whispering to one another, past by two of their
Centinels, without being questioned by them: so that had we brought two Ladders with
us, Monsieur <hi>d'Aumale</hi> would have tempted Fortune, to have seen what would have
been the issue (for she often presents her self, when we least dream of any such matter)
and when we came to the third Centinel, he call'd out and wak'd the rest, who as I
believe were certainly asleep, which made the said Seigneur and me retire towards the
little Chappel, much better accompanied at our return, than when we went, but it was
with good round volleys of Harquebuze shot, so that we were constrained to run into the
Chappel, the backside of which <hi>Fequieres</hi> recover'd. Now this Chappel was open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Town, and that part to which the door had been hung, when it had one, was
a square pillar of stone, about the thickness of a man that was not very gross,<note place="margin">The danger of Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> and the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and the
Harquebuze shot put us in such haste, that Monsieur <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Aumale</hi> was forc'd on a sudden
to clap behind this pillar bolt upright, and I behind him, for all the Chappel besides was
open. In my life I never heard so great Harquebuze shots; I know not whether it was
not our fear, that made them seem so, but I am sure there was good cause to be afraid,
for the Bullets almost continually slapt against the pillar with which Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi>
shelter'd himself: He serv'd me for a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ield, and I held my head and my body close to
him. They kept us there above a long half hour besieg'd, and it is most certain they had
heard us; for vvhen vve vvere enter'd into the Chappel, vve heard them in Spanish
cry out, <hi>Iuro a Dios ellos son en la Capilia, io los è entendidos.</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> has
often since talkt to me of the frights we were in; for I do verily believe that above a
hundred Harquebuzeers came to take aim at us, they also threw wisps of flaming straw
into the ditch, that they might aim the better. <hi>We were in a fine case,</hi> said Monsieur <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'
Aumale, should they sally out upon us. Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>those of the house of</hi> Lorrain <hi>were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so unhappy as to be taken skulking: neither will the rule of War permit them to sally
out, without knowing what we are: We have here a good Buckler of</hi> Barcellona: All this
while the bullets clatter'd against the stones, and it was convenient for us to tweak in
our buttocks. <hi>Fequieres</hi> play'd here one very senseless trick; for not knowing where we
were, he whistled to call to us, which I believe was the reason they shot so very long.
In the mean time the Alarm run quite thorow the Town, and in the end they grew as
weary of shooting, as we were of being shot at, and so we walk'd out and found <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres</hi>
behind the Chappel, who had made a cunninger choice of his retreat then we,
and there Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> concluded the night following to bring the Artillery to
the edge of the grass, and all our Ensigns. And there I got the victory of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers,
who said, that all our men would be kill'd there, and that we should be forc'd
to quit the Canon; and hereupon by good fortune arriv'd Monsieur <hi>de Caillac.</hi> In the
morning Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> in my presence told him all we had seen over night, and
sent <hi>Fequieres</hi> along with him, to go to discover behind the Chappel: for the same night
the said Seigneur had appointed two Ensigns, that lay a great way from the Chappel,
to go and immediately to encamp themselves just behind it. The besieg'd committed
there a great incongruity, for they ought not to have contented themselves with laying
the Chappel open only, but they ought moreover to have raz'd it to the ground. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Caillac</hi> at his return was of our opinion; whereupon Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Monsieur <hi>de Caillac</hi> and me to go and carry along with us the Pioneers to cut
the Counterscarpe, ordering <hi>Duno</hi> and <hi>Balasergues</hi> to bring the Canon after, and caus'd
a Gabionnade also to be made in the Meadow, some forty or fifty paces from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarp,
wherein to lodge the powder: so that by break of day we had cut the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarpe,
and the Artillery was planted in Battery so near, that the very mussel of the
Canon hung over the Graff. Beginning to batter, Monsieur <hi>de Bonnive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> went to and fro
in the very face of the Bastion, betwixt the Battery and the place where Monsieur <hi>d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi>
was, and the Mareschal <hi>de Cosse</hi> did the same. Two nights before we had cast up
the Trenches at the head of the Bastion, which cover'd the Castle to approach to the
Ditch, the Baron <hi>de Chipi,</hi> who was Camp-Master, put his Soldiers into Camisado, and
threw himself headlong into the Ditch pel-mel amongst them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chipi</hi> Camp-Master.</note> and gain'd two Cazamatts
that flank'd the Ditch, killing those that were within them, for they could not retire:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105656:96"/>
and at the same instant Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> commanded the Engineers to mine at the head
of the Bastion, which they did, and made three. Monsieur <hi>de Cossé</hi> then ran to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to see if the Mines were ready, and so return'd to Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery

ruine came to blows with fourscore or a hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> (that were entred but four
or five dayes before, but not without the loss of a great many of their men at their entry)
and two or three hundred more, all choice men, and cull'd out of all the Spanish Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
and there d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>st up in the space betwixt the Bastion and the Castle, for they would
have retir'd to their Trench, and ours followed so close, that they entred with them.
They then attempted full speed to recover the Castle, but he who commanded within it
would not let down the draw-bridge, so that there all the rest were dispatch'd. This was
the success of the Bastion, which was bravely carried. There was there slain <hi>Ceasar de Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
a Nephew of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and among the Prisoners Signior <hi>Sigismundo de Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga,</hi>

the truth was reasonable enough. It was assaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed at the same time with the Bastion, as
it ought to be, where though all these Princes and Lords behav'd themselves with very
great bravery, mounting the breach themselves to encourage the Soldiers, yet did they
within gallantly de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end it, and sent us back again very well beaten. Here was slain the
Count <hi>de Creance,</hi> and several others bore him company; yet knowing what had been done
on the other side it comforted us a little, and gave every one hope that we should bring
about our design. Being mounted upon the Platform of the Bulwark which was left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
I sent <hi>Duno</hi> to tell Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> that he must lodge three or four pieces of
Canon upon this Platform, to thunder the Enemy in the Town; which accordingly was
presently done, so that in the morning they all began to play.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here there is wanting several particularites of this Siege
writ by Monsieur de <hi>Montluc,</hi> as appears by the
sixth Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so much astonish'd those within, that they began to lay their hands upon their
hearts, and to parly. In the end the Capitulation was concluded; and also for the Castle,
against which (to save the Governor's honor) we made fifty Canon shot. In the mean time
news was brought that Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> was coming in the quality of the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
which gave great occasion of discourse, and several reasons were by several men
given for this change. The next day about noon came a Secretary of the Mareschal <hi>de
Brissac</hi> call'd <hi>Verbin,</hi> with letters to all the Princes, wherein he excus'd himself, assuring
them that this command of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> did not proceed from him: And the said
<hi>Verbin</hi> told me from the Mareschal, that he earnestly entreated me to speak to all the
Princes, that they might not entertain that opinion of him; which I did, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
I had not that credit with them that several others had: but I know not how it came
to pass, I have ever had more than I could hope for. Now you shall hear what was made of
one word onely that I said to this <hi>Verbin,</hi> The thing I said to him was this, that Monsieur
<hi>de Gonnort, de Gourdon,</hi> and I conceiv'd the Mareschal might do well to write to the King,
that his Majesty would please for a few dayes to defer the coming of Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi>
being that perhaps these Princes would make a difficulty of obeying a Gentleman (the said
Sieur <hi>de Termes</hi> having as yet no other title) which might perhaps cause them to leave the
Army, a thing they could not do without drawing so many people along with them, as
might be prejudicial to his service.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

honest man went, and told the Mareschal, that I had flatly told him, that I would not
obey Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> which God knows was the furthest end of my thought; for I
had formery obeyed him, and was not now so high in the instep as to play the Prince. He
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105656:97"/>
was ever a very great friend both to me and to all my Brothers, and has as great an esteem
for me, if not greater, than any Gentleman of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and we have ever liv'd together at
this rate.</p>
            <p>This past after this manner, and we marched straight to <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> expecting the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of <hi>Monsieur de Termes,</hi> who came to the Siege, and behav'd himself with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty:
for he was very discreet, and would never take upon him to command. We laid
Siege to the Castle (for the Town was carried at the first, neither indeed was it strong) and
batter'd by the base of a Bastion on the right hand the Gate: but it was impossible to do
any good by making a breach there, forasmuch as we must have storm'd it with Ladders,
so that our people having made an attempt were repuls'd.<note place="margin">

                  </hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> I went then in the night to
discover the Ditch, and went so far as under the very Draw-bridge, which was close under
the Wall, to see if there were not a Flancker that defended the Gate, and found that
there was one below, which played all along the Ditch: the Enemy threw down fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
upon me, and there hurt me a Serjeant of the Company of Monsieur <hi>de Lieux</hi> my
Brother; and yet we were no more than three that entred into the Ditch.</p>
            <p>At my return I consulted with Monsieur <hi>de Caillac</hi> to place two pieces of Canon upon
the Counterscarp, just overagainst the Gate, to the end that we might shoor directly against
the beams to which the chains were fastned, that the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aw-bridge might fall down, after
which we should soon beat down the Gate on the inside. We told all this to Monsieur
<hi>d' Aumale,</hi> who gave us leave to do as we thought fit. The night following we lodg'd
the Gabions, and three pieces of Canon, which was done by one of the clock at night.
All the Princes came to see our work, and Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> taking me about the middle
said to me, <hi>You have formerly been my Soldier, I will now be yours. Sir,</hi> said I, <hi>you are very
welcome, neither ought a Prince disdain to play the Pioneer in time of need; here is work for
you.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cossé</hi> came presently after, whom I took by the hand, and led him to
see all that we had done, when after these Princes and Lords had seen all, they retir'd
themselves to repose till day, and I remain'd upon the place. In the morning when the
Captain of the Castle saw himself cooped up after this manner, he began to found a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and surrendred upon free quarter,<note place="margin">

a little piece of Artillery to save his honor. The Capitulation being signed, he presently
march'd, and went straight to <hi>Pont d' Asteure,</hi> where their Camp-Master Don <hi>Arbro</hi> lay, who
gave him no leisure to enter any ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hang'd him up, as he deserv'd; for at least he ought to have endur'd an assault, which if he
had, upon my word he had found us enough to do.</p>
            <p>You who put your selves into places, beware never so soon to enter into fear, and though
your enemy may have playd his game very well, and that you have reason to suspect your
own condition to be dangerous enough; yet if there be never so little possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
your selves, rouse up your spirits, and do the best you can, entrench your selves
within, and consider that your enemy is more afraid to attaque you, than you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
your selves; for it must be a very ill place indeed, if you have not some means to
withstand an Assault, seeing you durst hold out a Battery. Do not think to save your
honors by carrying away a Flag, or some small piece of Artillery, as this Captain did: for
all this is of very little moment, and he who lies before you will easily grant such trifles
as these, provided he has his end, and you the loss and shame. Do but think what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and repentance this poor Captain, who so easily surrendred himself, had upon the
Gallows, and if then he would not rather have chosen to have died in the Breach. When
you have done all that men of honor can do, there is then no remedy, you must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</p>

Army staid there seven or eight daies, during which time news was brought to the Princes,
and to Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> that the King was something dissatisfied at the disobedience I
made mention of before. I also was put into the fine story, some honest man having
done me that good office,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the King.</note> as to affirm that I was the Incendiary, and the greatest Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
of all, which (how false soever) was so far believ'd, that the Constable sent me a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein he writ, that the King had commanded him to send me word, that I should
forthwith retire to my own house, and that he would not I should any more intermeddle
in this expedition. This did not much astonish me, for I knew the King would do me
the honor to hear my justification: but the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

send his Brother Monsieur <hi>de Cossé</hi> to Court, by whom he assur'd his Majesty of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105656:97"/>
acquitted me at my arrival: (for this occasion'd me a Journey to Court) where his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
received me with as much favour as ever,<note place="margin">A caution for such as have the privilege to talk with their Princes.</note> particularly enforming himself from me of
the affairs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and especially about the Princes in our Army, with whom he was not

the Constable, or Madam <hi>de Valentinois</hi> would have known it, and so from hand to hand
it would have been carried about, that <hi>Montluc</hi> had been the Author.</p>

me that I spoke discreetly of him; for both the Queen and he took it very kindly at my
hands: if you know any thing of importance to your Masters safety, or his service, you
are obliged in fidelity and duty to give him notice of it; but to go and tat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are not to be talk'd of at that rate; and he that told the King I was the occasion of the
disorder in the Army, was no better than a Rascal, for there was no such thing: but it
is no wonder people should make such stories of me who am but a poor Gentleman, when
they dare to slander Princes and others the greatest Nobility of the Nation. These are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

            <p>After I had staid some time at Court I took leave of his Majesty, and retir'd home to
my own house, where I remained five or six moneths in repose, and when I was busie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ordering the affairs of my Family (which I never had leisure to look into,) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
dispatched away a Courrier to command me to come post away to him, writing to
me to send away my Train straight to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> without giving me the least intimation
whither he intended to send me. I forthwith obeyed his command, for I was never resty,
and being come to Court, I there found two Gentlemen of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Siennois</hi> send again to the King for Monsieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> to command them.</note> who were come in
the behalf of their whole Country, to beseech his Majesty to send me to command them,
making great complaints of Monsieur <hi>de Soubize;</hi> not that he any way tyrannized over
them, or did them any injury, but by reason he had lost some places belonging to their
State, though I believe Monsieur <hi>de Soubize</hi> had done all that in him lay, but no one takes
any loss whatever in good part, and all the world judges of things by the event. At my
arrival the King told me that I must return to <hi>Montalsin</hi> to be his Lieutenant General there.
I contested a great while not to go,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Soubizade.</note> not that the command was not highly honorable: but
I was afraid I should <hi>embark without Biscuit,</hi> and to speak the truth, whoever would do
his business well, must not go so far from home; for a man is never remembred at that
distance. If any thing presents it self for your advancement, you are sure never to hear of
it: but for the acquiring honor and renown '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s often better to be further off, than near
at hand. Your fame shall more encrease, and you will be more honored and esteemed by
Strangers than your own Countrey-men. On the other side I had more mind to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Wars of <hi>France</hi> near to his Majesties person: but no excuses would be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
neither indeed could I heartily deny my good Master. The <hi>Siennois</hi> so soon as they
saw that I was come, were again importunate with his Majesty to send me away, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much more in my commendation than I could any way deserve: without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
then I departed, and took my way to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where I found seven Ensigns of foot
the King was sending away to <hi>Rome</hi> under the command of Monsieur <hi>de la Molle,</hi> in
which Regiment my eldest Son <hi>Marc Antoine</hi> had a Company, and Captain <hi>Charry</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

opinion that we should march out into the Field, ten miles from the City, and there to

                        <p>since the time that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> is approached something near unto
your City, it appears to us <hi>French</hi> that you have conceiv'd some new apprehension, and
without any great cause, insomuch that upon the least Alarm you enter into an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fear and astonishment; so that should the Enemy approach your walls whilst you
are in this confusion, they might enter at pleasure without any great opposition;
forasmuch as when you ought to keep silence in your City, especially in the night, and
that you ought rather to run to your walls, than to shuffle your selves into the strange
disorder you do; you on the contrary run some to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> others to the Churches, and
others to the Palaces of the Spanish Cardinals, with the greatest confusion in the world.
This must of necessity proceed from one of two causes, either from want of courage, or
from a defect in your conduct, in that you do not strictly command such order as your
people ought to observe both by day and by night in a time of danger. If you do it
for want of courage, it is then a sign you have not well consider'd what people your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are: and what can they be other than men as you are? do not we bear the same
arms they do, and are they not as good as theirs are? are not they as vulnerable and as
subject to die by our blows as we are by theirs? Is not the Pope's quarrel holy and just,
and better than theirs? This ought to make us hope that God is on our side. And

reputation of your famous Ancestors in discovering your selves to be afraid of people
who are no other than men as you are? And you do your enemies the greatest kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imaginable, in giving them occasion to boast, that they are terrible to those
who formerly made all the Nations of the world to tremble at their arms. If this fear
proceed from the evil order you have hitherto established, there is nothing so far amiss,
that in one day may not easily be remedied, for by entring into present consultation
from whence this default proceeds, the business is done: and so you shall manifest to
all the world, that it is not want of bravery, but of good discipline; and your people
shall recover heart, seeing themselves secur'd by the good orders you shall give. Do not
think it strange if I declare that I am asham'd of what I see in your City, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Happy are those <hi>Siennois</hi> who have manifested themselves to be extracted from, and
the true legitimate Sons of your ancient Fathers, who founded these walls and theirs

although their City be lost, their valour and renown is not for all that buried nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scur'd,

<hi>Rome</hi> with the best <hi>Romans</hi> you have. Pardon me (I beseech you) if I tell you the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for I do it not for any advantage I expect should accrue either to the King my Master
or to my self; but for your own good, and to prevent the total ruine of your City,
which if it shall be assaulted by your enemies, will be miserably sack'd, and worse
handled, then it was in the dayes of Monsieur <hi>de Bourbon.</hi> You may be confident,
Gentlemen, that could I take any pleasure in your ruine, I should not now make you
this remonstrance in the presence of these honorable persons: but being sorry, as your
servant (you being good friends and confederates of the King my Master) and desiring
to die with you for your conservation, I am constrain'd to be thus plain, and to say
this to you I have done; these Gentlemen the Kings Ministers having also assur'd me,
that you would take it better from me, than any other, for the esteem you have of me
since the Siege of <hi>Sienna.</hi> I beseech you therefore take my advice, and if in any thing
I may be assisting to you, upon the least summons I will immediately attend you in
your counsel. 'Tis possible the remembrance of the Sack of your City by the Seigneur
<hi>de Bourbon</hi> may have put you into some apprehension; but you are to consider that you
were then surpriz'd; but you have now your weapons in your hands. Doubt nothing,
fear not your enemies, but divide your City, and appoint every one his place to repair
unto upon occasion, to the end that your own confusion do not deprive us of the means
to relieve you, if the enemy present himself to the assault: dispossess your Citizens of
their fear, if they be afraid, that there may be no confusion, and for the rest trouble
not your selves; for knowing the good order you have taken, you shall soon see your
enemies forc'd to retire.</p>

            <p>They all return'd me very many thanks, and so departed, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
us that they were going to give such orders, that the accidents which had hapned
before should never be again, earnestly intreating me to come the next morning to their
Councel, and that there they would shew me the order they were going to take, to receive
thereupon my opinion and advice. Which was accordingly done, and we altogether
provided so well for their affairs, that there was no more mention of fear, nor sign of
disorder. I went to the heads of the people, and shewed them what they were to do,
whom I found chearful enough in the business: yet this great multitude is composed of
divers humors, but a man may reduce them all to one, when they see it is for their own
good and safety. In short, all things were very much better, which the Pope also took
exceeding well at my hands.</p>
            <p>Now a few dayes after the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> remov'd his Camp,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> retires.</note> and took his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Tivoly</hi> twelve miles distant from <hi>Rome.</hi> I know not whether because he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the City stood better upon its Guard than before, and that the order of things was
changed there, or that his intention was not to approach any nearer to the City. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in <hi>Tivoly</hi> was Signior <hi>Francisco Vrsino</hi> with five Italian Ensignes, and that the
Town was not strong, the Mareschal, the Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Palliano</hi>
were afraid that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was gone to take <hi>Tivoly,</hi> and cut all those in pieces
within it, which was the reason that they entreated me to march all night to go fetch off
the said Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> giving me the two Troops of light horse of the Popes Guards,
two Troops of horse of the Duke <hi>de Paliano,</hi> commanded by the Captains, <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> and
<hi>Ambrosio,</hi> and four hundred Harquebuzeers under the command of my Son <hi>Marc Antony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marc Antony,</hi> eldest Son to Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note>
and Captain <hi>Charry.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> had assur'd me upon his honor, that the Enemy
could not pass the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and that I might make my retreat at pleasure, having evermore
the <hi>Tiber</hi> betwixt the Enemy and me. By Sun-rise I was at <hi>Tivoly</hi> with the Horse, and the
Foot arriv'd two hours after, where I found that Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> had heard no manner
of news of the enemies, and after I had told him, I was in no small doubt what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us; for I very well knew before I set out from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had
taken the way of <hi>Tivoly,</hi> and now perfectly understood, that he came privately to surprize
Signior <hi>Francisco,</hi> forasmuch as he had had no intelligence of his motion. I therefore eating
only a snap or two, causing the horses to be baited, and the foot to have a little refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ordered Signior Francisco to cause the Drums to beat, that we might presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge,
and put our selves into the field, entreating him to lend me a Troop or two of his
people who were acquainted with the Countrey, for that my self would go play the Scout,
whilst every one was making himself ready to depart: and it was well for me I did so;
for Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> having sent out two of his men to discover, they return'd as we sate
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105656:99"/>
at dinner, and had brought word that there was no news of any Enemy in all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
but I would not trust to that, and therefore went with my two Troopers, when so
soon as I was out of <hi>Tivoly</hi> upon a ridge of a hill, I plac'd my self under a Tree, for
it began to be very hot, when presently all along a little Copse, I perceived a great number
of horse ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ching straight down to the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and others in a valley, who came directly
towards me, and in the midst of a plain on this side the little Copse, I saw something
which I could not discern what it should be; I then presently sent word to Signior
<hi>Francisco,</hi> that I had discover'd the Camp, and that he should in all diligence get his

whom I had sent to carry him this intelligence was scarce got into the City, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
eighteen or twenty <hi>Spanish</hi> Ensigns, who were laid down in the Plain, got up, and put
themselves upon their march. I then gallopped away my self, where I found, that as yet
not so much as one man was got out of the City, and hasted the <hi>Italian</hi> Ensigns with all
diligence to march away, causing the gate of the City to be shut, and there I played a
very cunning trick, for I carried the keys along with me, thinking the enemy could not
of a long time break down the ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es; for the <hi>Tiber</hi> passed through the middle of the
Town, where there is a Bridge, and very fair and good Mills in the City it self, which
I had caused to be begun to be broken from my first arrival; but that work could not be
finisht.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s diligence.</note> I left Captain <hi>Charry</hi> at the Gate, and my Son <hi>Marc Antony</hi> at the Bridge to
sustain him, and I went and came running to and fro to hasten the <hi>Italians</hi> to march,
when so soon as they were all out of the Gate <hi>I</hi> went to draw off Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> and we
began to break the Bridge, which was of wood, and immediately the Enemy was in the
City. I placed Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quebuzeers all along in the houses that looked into the street, the
Soldiers using extraordinary diligence to break the Bridge, after which I marched directly
to the Gate. I had placed the Cavalry before the <hi>Italians,</hi> and we were inevitably to pass
through the streight of the Rocks, where we could only pass one by one. Till we came
to the going out of the Gate we had the Enemy continually upon us, and it is no more than
fifty paces from the Gate to that straight; so that seeing they could not themselves get to
us, but one by one, they gave us over, and returned to risle the City. Their <hi>Italian</hi> foot
came after the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and thought to have entred the City to have had their share of
the spoil, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never let them in, but held them in talk at the Gate
whilst they were busie at their plunder. So soon as we came to the Pein I made my Son
and Captain <hi>Charry</hi> with the four hundred Harquebuzeers turn on the right hand along
the ridge of a Hill, about a thousand paces distant from us, and the two Companies of
the Duke <hi>de Paliano,</hi> telling them the mysterie, that in case the Enemy should pass the
<hi>Tiler,</hi> they should still make forwards along the ridg towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and take no care for
me. And indeed we had as good have lost all the Ensigns Monsieur <hi>de la Mole</hi> had, as
these four hundred Harquebuzeers, for they were the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lower of all the Companies.
I was not got half a mile into the Plain, when behold all the Cavalry upon the
banks of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and their <hi>Germans,</hi> who began to pass, and particularly some horse by
the Mill, where they could onely pass one by one. I then gave all for lost, for I was to
retire twelve miles before the whole Army, and made no question but that the Cavalry
would carry over a great many of Foot behind them: but if I lost the one, I would not
lose the other.<note place="margin">The Retrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Now Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> marched still at a good round rate, at about a
Harquebuz shot distance from the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and the others along the ridg over against us.
When fifty or threescore of the Enemies Horse came up to us, I then took one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Guard with his Cornet, whilst the other still march'd on in the rear of the Foot,
causing them to mend their pace, and faced about upon the Enemy; who thereon made
a halt; and so soon as I made a shew as if I would charge them, turn'd their backs to
retreat, though I cannot imagine why, and I turn'd about to pursue my way. After that
they never offer'd to come towards me, though more of their own people came continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
up to them, but it was only three or four at a time: so that seeing me a good way
advanc'd, they turn'd back again and fell to taking Cattle that were grazing in the fields.
Now you must know what my deliberation was, by which you may see whether I had a
mind to lose my self with these people, or to escape with our own. The Duke <hi>de Palliano</hi> had
given me a grey Turk, that flew upon the ground, and was an extraordinary fleet one;
my design therefore was to engage the Enemy with this Troop, and in case I should see
no possibility of saving that party,<note place="margin">The Sieur de <hi>Montluc</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</note> I would then retire to our own people, who were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
directly to a Castle that held for the Pope, and in which there was a Garrison, where
I made account to secure most of the horse, it being not above five miles to that Castle.
Two dayes after a Trumper told us that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> would never permit Signior<note place="margin">Ascanio de la Corne.</note>
               <hi>Ascanio de la Corne</hi> to pass the <hi>Tiber,</hi> forasmuch as he had not one Harquebuzeer, but <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:105656:99"/>
all the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Foot being at <hi>Tivoly.</hi> And thus I retreated straight
to <hi>Rome,</hi> sending to our people to come to us, and we rallyed at the Bridg nearest to <hi>Rome,</hi>
over which we passed, it being three hours within night when we came to <hi>Rome.</hi> This is
the fortune I had in this Retrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>When ever (Captains my Companions) you shall be in any place where you are the
least in doubt, never trust to the report of others: for it is evermore the custom at your
first coming for every one to caress you, and to entreat you to repose your self: but do
not do it; examine the place where you are, and discover it very well. One of the greatest
Captains the Emperor ever had (which was Signior <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scaro</hi>) for trusting to the report of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Signior</hi> Pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caro.</note>
others at his arrival in a City of <hi>Italy,</hi> was taken; yet he had no less than four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men with him, which was a great dishonor to so great a Captain: though he laid
the fault to another, as himself told me. Had I done so, Signior <hi>Francisco</hi> had made me
suffer a great disgrace, and perhaps to have lost my life.</p>
            <p>Two nights after the said Signiors gave me two Companies of <hi>Italians</hi> to conduct them
to the Duke <hi>de Somma</hi> at <hi>Balistra,</hi> which stands by the Sea-side, six or seven miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<hi>Marino.</hi> I marched all night, having with me the two Companies of the Duke of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e should be baited, and ready
in an hour and a half to return. The Duke <hi>de Somma</hi> would by all means have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
me to stay that night, but he could by no means perswade me to it; for I well
imagain'd, that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was not without spies at <hi>Rome,</hi> considering there were
so many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and others of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Faction in the City; and therefore
having eaten a bit or two, put my self upon my way, which coming and going was five or
six and forty miles, and arrived three hours within night at <hi>Rome.</hi> It was well for me I
did so; for two hours before day there came six hundred horse, and five hund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
on horseback to <hi>Mariano,</hi> where they heard news that I was return'd. This
was another good fortune that befel me, wherein there was no need that I should have
left my understanding at home. And I will now tell you of another that befel me six
dayes after, though it is onely to make such laugh as shall vouchsafe to read this Book, and
the story of my life.</p>
            <p>Five or six dayes after this rencounter, the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Camp lying still at <hi>Tivoly,</hi>
The Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> sent word from <hi>Civita Vechia</hi> to the Mareschal <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> that if
he would send him four hundred Harquebuzeers, he would embark them in his Galleys,
and land them at <hi>Neptuno,</hi> a very strong place upon the Margent of the Sea, which flows
into the ditches of it, and that there they might burn the Boats the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had
brought thither wherewith to make a Bridg at <hi>Ostia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marc Anthony</hi> and Captain <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> to pass over to this side of the <hi>Tiber,</hi>
as he afterwards did. The Mareschal therefore leaving this affair wholly to my direction,
I sent thither my Son <hi>Marc Anthony,</hi> and Captain <hi>Charry</hi> with the four hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers,
who went in emulation of one another, and so soon as they came to <hi>Civita
Vechia</hi> the Baron took them aboard, and accordingly went to land them at the said
<hi>Neptuno:</hi> but they could not possibly burn the Boats, forasmuch as they had moved them
into the Ditch, which was defended by the Fortress. Now (as the affairs of War depend
upon od accidents) it fell out that the same day they arrived at <hi>Neptuno,</hi> where they stayd
two dayes. I went in the Evening to walk without the Gate that leads towards <hi>Marino,</hi>
where I met a man that came from thence, and ask'd him what he was; to which he
made answer that he was a Beadsman belonging to the Hospital of <hi>Marino.</hi> I discover'd
by his tongue that he was no <hi>Italian,</hi> which he also confest to me, telling me that he
was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> but so poor that he was reduc'd to the Hospital of <hi>Marino.</hi> I then
asked him who was at <hi>Marino,</hi> to which he answer'd,<note place="margin">Marc Antoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Duke of <hi>Paliano,</hi> though he did not long enjoy that title, the other recovering it again
not long after.</p>

and with those of Signior <hi>Aurelio</hi> would go place my self in Ambush under the Vines a

I would then send six Launces to give the Alarm a little before day to the City; upon
which I made account that Signior <hi>Marc Antonio</hi> being young, and full of mettle, would
not fail to sally out, but would precisely sally by break of day, when my six Launc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would make him pursue me a main seeing a Colours, which he would be eager to take for
the greater honor of his victory.</p>

as if I had already had him in my hands, and thereupon returning into the City, spoke
to Signior <hi>Aurelio,</hi> who lent me his Lieutenant and his Cornet, with the five and thirty
Launces,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Alexis</hi> is a Grecian.</note> I spoke to Monsieur <hi>de la Molle,</hi> and to Captain <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> and the Lieutenant

of the night at the Gate of the City: but I would discover nothing of my design either
to the Mareschal, or to any of those I took along with me, till first we were got into the
fields, and then I took aside Monsieur <hi>de la Molle,</hi> and the Captains <hi>Ambrosio</hi> and <hi>Alexis,</hi>
and acquainted them with the Enterprize, which they all three approved of, wherein we
were one as wise as another. So that we thought the time long till we was there, they
making the business wonderful easie, all of them affirming that they knew him, and were
confident he would not fail to sally. Thus then we set forwards, each Company apart,
and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Ensigne to be one of the six that were to give the Alarm, and delivered the Colours
to another: For which use I lent him a Gentleman of mine, and we clapt our selves down
in a Marish (where in Winter there was alwaies water, but in Summer none at all) there
being no other place where we could conceal our selves; and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of his Quarters, or else that he was gone back.</p>
            <p>Now on the right hand of us there was a great valley,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the further side of the valley, three or four horsemen, who one while mov'd, and
another while stood still. I shew'd them to Captain <hi>Alexis,</hi> who was lower then I, and
who thereupon sent out two Launces all along by the Vines, upon the edge of the descent
of the valley. I had not as yet cast my eye into the valley, forasmuch as the day but
just began to break; but look'd always towards the mountain where these three or four
horse appear'd, about fifty paces distant from us: but when I turn'd my eye that way,
I there saw three great parties of horse, in the first whereof there might be a hundred
or more, in the second two or three hundred, and in the third seven or eight hundred
horse. Now you are to understand upon what account these came to be here, which was
thus. As the Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> landed our people at <hi>Neptuno,</hi> those of the Town dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
away two Horsemen post to the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> at <hi>Tivoly,</hi> who thereupon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

had made a halt till Signior <hi>Antonio</hi> could make himself ready, to whom he had sent five
and twenty Launces to make him mount to horse, who coming to the Gate of the City,
they there met with our six Soldie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it was not possible but that I must be taken, and all those lost who were with

he came out from behind the Chappel, seeing which I cried out to our people <hi>volse

to speak with them upon their word, whilst I in the mean time made Monsieur <hi>de

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that the Enemy could no more
see what we did: when I order'd them to make towards the pillars of an Aqueduct, by
which the <hi>Romans</hi> in former times conveyed their water to <hi>Rome,</hi> commanding the Horse
to keep still in their Rear, at a good round trot, and all them to march as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Now so soon as the two Troops were clos'd up together, and had made a halt, the great
party behind did the same, and the Foot likewise halted, Captain <hi>Alexis</hi> still talking
with them. I could all this while from the place where I stood see our people, when so

               </gap>g to him
<hi>Retiriamo si, Capitano, retiriamo si,</hi> upon which the Enemy asked him who it was that

laugh at them; when seeing him turn his horse to go away, several of them call'd out to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, and went directly to <hi>Marino,</hi> where they heard news that the Baron <hi>de la

me back three Launce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs I had lost by the way, but not their horses; for as their horses
stumbled they fell down, when I leaping into the way with my Turk, stroke them upon
the buttocks with the flat of my sword, and made them close up to the Party. He sent
them back by a Trumpet of his, who made us laugh, when speaking of his Master, he said,
that had he known I had been of the Party, he would have accompanied me to the
Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> to have taken me prisoner: but never by the way asked his Prisoners who
commanded them till after we were got off. And the Trumpet moreover had told me,
that had I been taken, I had not needed to fear that any one would have offer'd me the
least injury or offence; for I should have been as much made on, and used with as much
honor and respect, as in our own Camp. Neither indeed can it be said, that ever any
Prisoner went out of my hands, or any place where I had to do, discontented, or dissatisfied
with my behaviour to him, and it is a great baseness to flea men to the bones, when they
are persons of honor, and bear arms; especially in a War betwixt Prince and Prince, which
is rather out of sport than unkindness to one another.</p>
            <p>After this manner I made my retreat to <hi>Rome,</hi> where after I had put off my Arms,
I went to seek out the Mareschal, the Cardinal <hi>de Caraffa,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Paliano,</hi> whom
I found in a house of the Town altogether, being newly return'd from the Palace of <hi>St.
Peters,</hi> who all of them fell upon me, saying, that it seem'd as if I had a mind to lose my
self out of wantonness, and that had they known of my design, they would have stopt my
journey. They would then needs know the occasion of my Enterprise, which I recoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to them from point to point, telling them that all the way as I went, I accounted <hi>Marc

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105656:101"/>
Crowns, which had not been unreasonable, being no more than one years revenue of

Captains and Soldiers, and the other fourty thousand I meant to keep to my self, to purchase
me an Estate in <hi>France</hi> somewhere near to the King, for <hi>Gascony</hi> was too remote from
Court, and that I already fancied I had a house near <hi>Paris,</hi> of which <hi>I</hi> was so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
perswaded, that it would not out of my head of all night. At which account of
my project they all burst out a laughing to that excess, that I think they never laugh'd
so much at one time in their lives, to think that I had made my self so sure of my prize,
the ransome, and purchasing of Lands and Castles in the Isle of <hi>France;</hi> whereupon the

            <p>They were at this time busie about sending a dispatch to the King, and sent Monsieur
<hi>de Porrieres</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> to his Majesty, who had his share of laughing, and all the rest
that were with them. And as there are a sort of people, who are prone to do more hurt
than good, some honest man sent news by the way of the Bank of <hi>Lions,</hi> that I had lost all
the Pope Cavalry in the <hi>Roman</hi> Plain, and was my self run away no body knew whither,
nor could any one hear what was become of me. I do believe these men are hir'd and
suborn'd to disperse ill news, only to discourage those of our party. This was writ by
the Post from Lions to the Constable, and by him told the King, who was very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the news: and Monsieur <hi>de Porrieres</hi> being to pass through the <hi>Grisons</hi> Countrey,
could not arrive so soon at Court, but that the news was got thither four dayes before him,
insomuch that whereas the Mareschal and the rest had laughed at my folly,<note place="margin">A false report spread at Court of the Sieur de <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucs</hi> defeat.</note> the King
was very much offended with me, saying that it was the most ridiculous and senseless piece
of folly that ever was committed by man; adding moreover that I had hitherto been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
but that now I had lost my fortune, and my reputation, which he was very sorry
for; especially that such a disgrace should befall me at the Gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> This news was
not kept so secret at Court, but that it was presently carried into <hi>Gascony,</hi> where I leave
you to judg how I was dissected by them that did not love me: for one must be a God to
have no Enemies, nor emulators, or else must take upon him to meddle with nothing
but his Garden or his Orchard: But so soon as Monsieur <hi>de Porrieres</hi> arriv'd the King
sent for him into his Cabinet, where after he had read his letters of Credence, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dispatches, finding therein no syllable of this affair, and Monsieur <hi>de Porrieres</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no mention of it neither, his Majesty said to him, <hi>And what Monsieur</hi> de Porrieres,
<hi>is</hi> Montluc <hi>heard of yet? he has made a pretty piece of work on't.</hi> To which he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he had left me at <hi>Rome;</hi> whereupon the King proceeded and said, that he
knew that I had lost all the Popes Cavalry, and was my self run away. Monsieur <hi>de
Porrieres</hi> was very much astonish'd at this news, and replied, that if this had hapned after
his departure, it might be so, and yet he had been no more than nine dayes in coming.
His Majesty then made them look how long it was since this news came, which they did,
and found it to be four dayes, at which the King said he thought it was only a lye, and
<hi>Banker</hi>'s news, enquiring of Monsieur <hi>de Porrieres</hi> what piece of folly it was I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
who thereupon made answer (as he has himself told me since;) <hi>Sir I will tell you,<note place="margin">Monsieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>de Porrieres</hi> gives the King an account of the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi>'s Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</note>
and I make no doubt but your Majesty will laugh at it at much as we did.</hi> after which he
related to him the whole story, and what I had said at my return to the Mareschal <hi>de
Strozzy,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Paliano,</hi> at which I do assure you I have
been told his Majesty laughed very heartily, and more than he had been seen to do of a
great while before, as also did the Constable, and all the rest that were present, insomuch
that I was told the King above eight dayes after, seeing Monsieur <hi>de Porrieres,</hi> said to
him, <hi>Well</hi> Porrieres, <hi>has</hi> Montluc <hi>purchased those places about</hi> Paris? and never call'd the
story to mind but he laughed. And as to what I say in my Book, that for these hundred
years never any man was more fortunate in War than I have been, I pray examine and
see if you will not acknowledge me to be so in these three occasions, which in eight or nine
dayes time befell me, one after another (besides several others you will meet with in this
life of mine) to have escaped without loss, three such dangers, which were no little
ones.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> understood that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> was coming
into <hi>Italy</hi> to succour the Pope, which made him to retire his Camp a little nearer to the sea,
and afterwards he came and sate down before <hi>Ostia.</hi> The Mareschal then march'd out of
<hi>Rome</hi> with some Ensigns of <hi>Italians,</hi> two of <hi>Germans,</hi> and five or six of <hi>French;</hi> but the
Pope would by all means that he should leave him for his defence, my Son <hi>Marc Anthony</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:105656:101"/>
and Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> with their Companies. The Mareschal went then and encamp'd

<hi>Alva</hi> before his arrival had made his bridge, and erected a Fort above <hi>Ostia,</hi> on the same
side where the Mareschal was encamp'd. I then sent to him to know if he would have
me come to him with five or six <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ensigns, but he would not permit
me so to do, for fear left the enterprize of <hi>Montalsin</hi> might not as yet be fully sifted to
the bottom. And because the said Mareschal, with those <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
he had with him, had not been able to discover the Enemies Fort, to see if there
was water in the ditch or no, he was in the greatest perplexity imaginable (for the Duke

Fathers to commend their own children, yet being he is dead, and so many witnesses of

pardon'd.</p>
            <p>Now to execute the command the King had given me in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> I ask'd leave of the
Pope to go to <hi>Montalsin,</hi> who after great importunity, would permit me but for fifteen
days only, making me leave my great horses, and all my baggage behind, which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Strozzy</hi> was fain to send out after me, saying they were his own, and by his own
servants. The Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac</hi> also sent me out my Sumpter Mules, cover'd with
his own Sumpter-cloths, pretending to send them to the house of another Cardinal,
where he us'd to stay sometimes twelve or fifteen days together; by which means I got
all my things out of <hi>Rome.</hi> During the time of my stay in those parts, his Holiness did
me the honor evidently to manifest to all the world, that he repos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon my coming to <hi>Montalsin,</hi> Monsieur <hi>do Soubize</hi> departed and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> I

the King and the Emperor, yet continued: The affairs of these two Princes being so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105656:102"/>
and confus'd, that it had not been possible to conclude a peace, which was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that all Treaties of accommodation ended in a Truce only: but I had heard that
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had taken his leave of the King, and was coming for <hi>Italy,</hi> which
made me think, that although the succours he brought along with him, were design'd
for the Pope, yet that the Truce would nevertheless by that means be broken on the
King's part, and therefore laid a design to go give a Scalado to the <hi>Germans</hi> at S. <hi>Cricou,</hi>
a little Town four miles from <hi>Montalsin,</hi> intending from thence to go and surprize all
the other foremention'd places. I know not whether or not the <hi>Germans</hi> had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of my design, or whether they were not commanded away from thence, but
so soon as I was got out of the City two hours within night, a Gentleman of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
who had his house in <hi>Cricou,</hi> and whom I had sent thither, came and brought me word
that they were gone away in the beginning of the night. I sent then to enquire news of
those at the Inn and the Palace, and found that all were march'd away at the same time,
by which means we had liberty to go out a little more at large, as far as <hi>Altesse,</hi> a pretty
strong Castle about three miles from <hi>Montalsin,</hi> and near unto the road of <hi>Sienna.</hi> I went

acknowledge the Seigneury, and not him who was not to take upon him any Authority
in that Countrey, that the King would not pretend to for himself: And thus in a few
days all things were chang'd to the great satisfaction of those of <hi>Sienna.</hi>

soon as it was known at <hi>Sienna</hi> that Captain <hi>Mantillou</hi> was taken, it began to disclose it
self, and so far, that a Gentleman of <hi>Sienna</hi> sent his servant to me, to give me notice of
the place by which they intended to give an assault; who came to the gate of the City,
but would not come in, only he desired to speak with me. I then went out to him,
taking <hi>Messer Hieronimo Espanos</hi> along with me, where he told us all, and that there
were some <hi>French</hi> Soldiers of the Garrison of the plot, and that if we search'd well in
the houses nearest that place, we might peradventure find the Ladders. We gave the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ten Crowns, and so he returned. <hi>Messer Hieronimo Espanos</hi> then and I went secretly
to view the place, and as I remember we took Monsieur <hi>de B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssoonpierre</hi> along with us, and
observ'd that part of the wall to be very low, but that there was a Turret wherein were
continually two Centinels, who being of the Conspiracy, the taking of the place was easie,
and more than easie. <hi>Messer Hieronimo</hi> then, who was at that time of the Magistracy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
appointed two men to search the houses nearest to the place, who staid not three
hours before he brought us above a horse-load of Ladders of ropes, the best and the fineliest
made of any I had ever seen. In the house where these were found, no body had liv'd of
a great while; but we knew very well, that people commonly went in and out, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we could not discover. I then took order with the Serjeant Major, that he should
every night set four Centinels in the Turret, which also were continually to be chosen by
lot. I do think, that would they have made an attempt by day, they might have done
their business, and much better by day, than by night, being that from the great Palace,
which was not above three Harquebuz shot from the Town, they might come all along
thorough a little Valley, shaded with Copse, close up to the very wall.</p>
            <p>About a month after A <hi>Siennois</hi> call'd <hi>Phebus Turk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phebus Turk.</note> came and addrest himself to me,
desiring that he might tell me something in private, whom I sent for into my Wardrobe.</p>
            <p>I had nothing but a Dagger by my side, and when he came in, I perceiv'd him arm'd
with a Coat of Mail; in my life I never saw so fierce a countenance of a man, so that
I was once about to call some body in to me: When he still telling me, that no one should
hear his business but my self, I took heart at last, thinking my self strong enough to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with him, should he attempt any thing against me. Where he told me, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Burgos</hi> had often sought to him to be assisting in an Enterprize he had upon <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talsin,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:105656:102"/>
which at his importunity he had at last consented unto, and that he had been
himself twice to speak with him in disguise; having with him three Soldiers, who were
also of the Plot, which he was to name to him a day before the said execution, which also he
was to execute before Don <hi>Arbro de Cenda</hi> should arive who was coming to <hi>Sienna</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Souldiery, and that if I would, he would order the business so, as to put them all
three into my hands. In conclusion, we agreed it should be within four days, and
that he should that very night return to <hi>Sienna</hi> to conclude the business with the Cardinal

               </note> which being concluded betwixt us, I put him out of the Town over the wall,

<hi>Charemond</hi> at <hi>Grossette,</hi> that he should come the next day to <hi>Pagamegura,</hi> half way
betwixt <hi>Grossette</hi> and <hi>Montalsin;</hi> and the same day that I sent away to the Colonel, I
call'd in the Captains who were at <hi>Chuze, Montizel,</hi> and the Hospitallet by <hi>Piance,</hi> whom
I swore upon the Crucifix to discover nothing of the Enterprize, and so sent them back to
make themselves ready against I should send for them: I then sent away my light horse
to <hi>la Rocque de Baldoc</hi> under pretence of keeping Garrison there, and the next day went
to meet the Colonel at <hi>Pagamegura,</hi> with whom I concluded that he should have four

Scalado, Colonel <hi>Charemond</hi> should come behind them, and the Garrisons of <hi>Chuze</hi> and
<hi>Montizal</hi> should step betwixt them and the Palace, and my Company also; and so soon
as they should be repulsed I was to sally out upon them with four hundred men from
the City. At my return from <hi>Pagamegura</hi> I found the said <hi>Phebus</hi> return'd, but he said
not a word to me of all night, which gave me a little suspicion of him. In the morning
he came to tell me, that the Cardinal would not put the business in execution yet a few
days,<note place="margin">

and to compel him to discover the truth, he being no other than a crafty R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent purposely to betray me: which I accordingly did, and clapt him into a close Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of the Castle, where by misfortune he found some piece of wood, or iron. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was a <hi>Siennois,</hi> I was willing to try if the <hi>Siennois</hi> themselves could win him by

the mean time with this piece of iron he broke through the wall, and fled away to <hi>Sienna;</hi>
by reason of which accident I could do nothing considerable in this Enterprize. He was
too cunning for me. I have nevertheless this obligation to him, that he has taught me in
an affair of this importance, never to spare a Prisoner again, but to squeez out the sudden
truth: for without doubt this fellow was a Traytor,</p>

and the remainder of his men escap'd and made head at the pass of a little River, by that
means giving Captain <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> time to come in to relieve him; (for it was within sight
of <hi>Montizel</hi>) as also Signior <hi>Marioul</hi> who was yet retreating before the Enemies Horse.
This a man gets by skirmishing at the head of an Army (as I have said before) and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating

            <p>Don <hi>Arbro</hi> having staid three dayes at <hi>Piance,</hi> he parted thence in the beginning of the
night, and with torches took his way thorough a valley that leads towards <hi>La Rocque de
Baldoc.</hi> Signior <hi>Marioul</hi> was gone post to <hi>Rome</hi> to fetch some Launceers that had been
promis'd him to repair his Company, but the Prior was with me the night that Don <hi>Arbro</hi>
departed. The Prior and I had been abroad on horseback to take the Air without the
Gates of <hi>Montalsin,</hi> when night coming on we turn'd about to go home, discoursing by
the way what Don <hi>Arbro</hi> intended to do with this great Artillery: upon which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
it presently came into my head, that it was to go assault <hi>La Rocque de Baldoc,</hi> in
which place there was a <hi>Florentine</hi> Captain, Monsieur <hi>de Soubize</hi> had placed Governor
there, whom I had in some suspicion, forasmuch as the Gentlemen of <hi>Sienna</hi> who were
with me, had told me that they had heard he had sent twice to <hi>Florence.</hi> So soon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we came near to the Gates of <hi>Montalsin,</hi> I commanded two light-horse of my
Company to go and scout all along upon the Hills betwixt <hi>Piance</hi> and <hi>la Rocque,</hi> and not
to stir from thence till break of day, unless they should discover the Enemy upon motion.
Now some dayes before this,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>

him two Gentlemen of <hi>Sienna</hi> to be his Guides. In the mean time, and an hour before day

the Guides taken, who had led me the way, as they were upon their return, together

my self into it. I then dispatcht away two Pesants through the woods to <hi>la Grossette,</hi> by

or that part: if I were in his stead I would do this thing or that, and often consult your
Captains; for it may fall out, that he of whom perhaps you have the least opinion, may
often give you the best advice. But in the end <hi>Don Arbro</hi> return'd, and went to quarter
his Army at <hi>Altesse,</hi> which is no more than three miles from <hi>Montalsin,</hi> where seeing his

without breaking with the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> which I would by no means do, that the

I had ever been upon very good terms with the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> without creating
any thing of a Quarrel. In affairs of this tickle nature we must go warily and discreetly

hole in the wall on that side toward <hi>Montalsin,</hi> by which the filth of the Town was
evacuated, and that in this place, where there were two walls, the outer wall was above
the reach of a Ladder, and that within some fourteen or fifteen staves high; and that so
soon as one should be past thorough the hole, which must be upon his belly, and in the
dirt, he should find himself betwixt these two walls. Upon this information I had
caus'd a Ladder to be made of the height requir'd for the inner wall, but it was so very
weak and slender, that it might pass thorough this hole, that a man could very uneasily
support himself upon it. In this part of the wall there was a Bastion at the corner of the
Town, that Don <hi>Arbro</hi> had caus'd to be perfected, which was of a sufficient height,<note place="margin">An Enterprize of the Sieur de <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> and
betwixt the hole and the Bastion was a gate the enemy had wall'd up with brick and clay
only, not caring to make it of better matter, forasmuch as they had cast up a Rampier of
earth within.</p>
            <p>I order'd that Captain <hi>Blacon</hi> with his own Company, and another of <hi>Italians</hi> that I
had caus'd to come from <hi>Grossette,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Clermont</hi> my Nephew with my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

I had also caus'd three hundred men to come from <hi>Chusi,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Somme</hi> had
sent me, who was return'd from the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his Camp, upon some words that had
past betwixt Cardinal <hi>Carassa</hi> and him, and those were to storm by a corner of the
Town on that side by which they came; Captain <hi>Bartolomeo de 'Pesero,</hi> was to fall on
by the Gate, that on his side look'd towards <hi>Montizel,</hi> which the Enemy kept open for

being gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Prior his Brother upon some business of his own to
their own house. To be short, I might have on my side four hundred men in all, three
hundred that came from <hi>Chusi,</hi> and an hundred men that Captain <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> had, which
was all the Forces I had at this assault. We had altogether concluded, that the Duke
of <hi>Somma's</hi> Italians should be of the party, who also himself very much desir'd to be
there: But I would not send for him, forasmuch as <hi>Chusi,</hi> of which he was Governor,
was a place of very great importance, and should I chance to be kill'd, I would not that
the Garrisons should be left without some good Chief to provide for their defence, till
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> could send some sufficient person to command the Countrey. We must
provide for all adventures, as well in case we be beaten, as if we overcome, by which means
in going to execute an Enterprize, we shall do nothing unadvisedly, and for which we
may reasonably be condemn'd. We had appointed to be every one of us two hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day at the place where he was to fall on, where those of the Duke of <hi>Somma</hi> and
Captain <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> were to fall on first, to the end they might divert the Enemies Forces
from that side by which I was to attaque the place, that side I was to undertake, being
by much the strongest, by reason of the Bastion, and the Flankers over the Gate, the wall
where the hole was, making a part of the corner. I gave the charge of carrying the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

him, all chosen men, who were to mount the Ladder, after mine should be gotten up.
The said Captain, and another of his own Company were first to pass thorough the
hole, and draw in the Ladder, because they knevv the place, vvhich none of my people
did.</p>
            <p>I arriv'd then vvithin a quarter of a mile of the Tovvn, vvhere I made a halt, vvhilst

to the Bastion, where, at our first approach they gave us a great Volley of Harquebuz

be provided of great horses and arms (for these people have always money) which
I always took with me under my own Cornet to Troop up and make a shew, to deceive
the Enemy. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had sent Monsieur <hi>Malassise</hi> (who is now Lord of <hi>Roissi)</hi>
to be chief Treasurer. I gave this man a Turkish horse, if I had now such a one, I would
not take for him five hundred Crowns, a courtesie that he very scurvily repaid, and as ill
return'd my friendship, for he brought me into disgrace with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as he
does now with the Queen, as much as in him lies, as I am inform'd from Court; and
I have my self also perceiv'd it, and wish God would do me the favour, as to put her
Majesty in mind, how much I am her Servant, and have formerly been where occasions
have presented themselves, which have perhaps been greater than ever Queen was involv'd
in, that her Majesty might take notice, she ought not lightly to give credit to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to my prejudice, especially such as never have done, nor never will do, so many
and faithful services as I have done. But I shall have patience in God, having my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
clean, both as to that and all other affairs concerning the service of the King and
his Crown. I had at this time discover'd nothing of the practises of the said Sieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lassise,</hi>
who prevail'd so far, that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> call'd me to his own person, and
gave my command to Monsieur <hi>de la Molle,</hi> for he had an opinion that they two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could manage affairs better, and more to their own advantage than I. I shall not
here set down the Reasons, forasmuch as it might be said, I did it in revenge of the ill
will he bears me, and consequently that I bear him, being a little impatient of injury
as I am, and who would willingly bear in my device, if I had not one already, what one
of the House of <hi>Candale</hi> gave for his <hi>Motto Qui m'aimera, ie l'aimerai.</hi> But there are
many worthy persons yet living who very well know the occasion, which if they please to
tell it, the story will not be much to his advantage.</p>
            <p>But to leave this discourse (not much caring whether he wish me well or ill;) I left
him with Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> though the Captain had been very importunate to go along:
but I made account that he being in the Town, if I happened to die, would be much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
to the Citizens in encouraging them, whilst in expectation of him the Duke of
<hi>Guise</hi> should send, for he was man of understanding, and very eloquent to perswade.
To return then to my Treasurers and Commissaries, I made them gallop round about the
Town (they being fitter to put people in fear, than to do any execution) by this means
to divert the Inhabitants from one place to another.</p>
            <p>We gave the Scalado then almost all at once, and our men were three times beaten off,
and our Ladders all broken saving one or two. Now I must tell you to what use serv'd
the taking of this hole. All of them entred into it one after another, and so soon as they
had set the Ladder to the lower wall to enter the Town, my Gentlmen all mounted, and
from the top of the wall leapt down upon a Dunghil into the Town; when so soon as

in doing which they so overcharg'd the Ladder that it broke. These inconsiderate ardours
oftentimes occasion the miscarriage of brave Enterprizes. The hole was within four or five
paces of the gate that was walled up, and the Enemy over it minded nothing but shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at our people, who were storming the Bastion, and having their backs towards the
hole, knew nothing of our people being entred in. The <hi>Italians</hi> tried to piece the Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the same hole by which they had entred,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> repuls'd.</note> and Captain <hi>Faustino</hi> came to tell me the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortue

that were there, when at the same time Captain <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> sent me word that they were
all beaten off on his side also. I then leapt from my horse to the ground, for I was not
yet alighted, and call'd all the Captains together <hi>(Avanson</hi> Son to Monsieur <hi>d' Avanson,</hi>
who was Ambassador at <hi>Rome</hi> excepted, who was hurt in the hand with a Harquebuz
shot) where I began to remonstrate to them, that I was come to no other end, but to
take the Town or to lose my life, and that if they would follow me, I would lead them
the way: but withal that I was resolv'd to turn back upon those who should be resty,
and would kill every man that did not behave himself as he ought to do upon so brave
an occasion.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc's</hi> Speech to his men.</note> 
               <hi>Let us go on then friends,</hi> said I, <hi>follow your Captain, and you shall see we will
acquire honor.</hi> Which having said, with my sword in my hand, and a Page with my Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t
close by me, I went directly up to the Gate. I had twelve <hi>Swiss</hi> of my Guard that
follow'd me, and also did all the rest, where I observ'd, as I had done at other times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what the example of a Leader can do when he goes on in the head of his men, and
leads them the way.<note place="margin">A Captain can do much by his example.</note> I presently put my self under the Gate, where three or four men
might stand unseen from the Flanks of the Bastion, whilst the Enemy who were over the
Gate plyed our people with a tempest of shot and stone. The <hi>Swiss</hi> in the mean time
with their Halberts did their endeavour against this Wall of Brick. I had my sword in
my left hand, and my dagger in my right, with which I broke and cut the bricks, when
having made a hole wide enough to put in my arm, I gave my sword and dagger to the
Captain of my <hi>Swiss,</hi> and thrust both my arms into it. The Wall was the thickness of
one brick only, and there was but very little clay, for it was in a manner a dry Wall:
when having found the inner rim of the Wall, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thickness of it, I pull'd the Wall
towards me with such force, that all the upper part fell upon me, and cover'd me all over,
insomuch that the Captain of my Guard was fain to draw me out from under the bricks
and the rubbish, which he did, and again set me upon my feet; after which with our
Halberts we presently beat it totally down to the ground. The Enemy had not finisht
the Terrass they had cast up behind this Gate, of which there wanted about two foot to
the top of the Arch, and there I had two <hi>Swiss</hi> kill'd, and the Captain wounded with
a Harquebuz shot in his thigh, and fourteen or fifteen Soldiers slain or wounded. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
made the Ensignes by the two Ladders renew the Assault to the Bastion,<note place="margin">The Bastion assaulted.</note> but for all
that they ceased not to shoot from the Flancks of the Bastion. Now from the Bastion
to the Gate where I fought, it was no more than thirty paces only: I then call'd out to
the Soldiers, to go fetch me the Ladders that had been broken against the Bastion, telling
them that the shortest were the best; for the height of the Terrass was not above two
yards; I think hardly so much; and so soon as the Ladders were brought I clapt them
side to side, and put a Harquebuzeer upon the one Ladder, and my self upon the other,
and three one in the heels of another, after the first Soldier, and two of my <hi>Swiss</hi> after
those three. I then spoke to him who was foremost, and went up first, that he should
presently get up, and discharge his Harquebuz amongst them within, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
did, and as he fir'd I took him by the breeches, and pusht him in, making him
take a leap he never intended, for our two Ladders toucht; and then I began to cry out
to those who were upon the other Ladder, and to push them forwards, saying, <hi>leap Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and I will leap in after you;</hi> which said I pusht that fellow in, another after him, and
the other after him; and when they were all tumbled in, he that could first rise clapt
hand to his sword, my two <hi>Swiss</hi> leapt in after; seeing which I leapt down on our own
side,<note place="margin">The Town ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and again began to cry <hi>fall on Captains, fall on, the Town's our own, our men are in;</hi>
whereupon they one after another threw themselves headlong into the place. Those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of mine who were entred by the hole had been perceiv'd at break of day, and being
charg'd by the Enemy had recover'd a house, the door of which they stoutly defended;
which did me a great deal of good, part of those who defended the Gate being run thither,
not thinking it possible I should enter there; and so soon as the Enemies who assaulted
the Gentlemen heard the cry of <hi>France, France,</hi> behind them, they forsook the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and would have return'd to the Gate; when the Gentlmen sallying out after them,
and hearing the same cry of <hi>France, France,</hi> they knew our people were entred the Town,
so that by fortune they were engag'd betwixt our two parties, and there all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to pieces.
Now immediately upon the killing of these, an Ensign of theirs who was in the place
came running directly towards the Gate, but my Gentlemen being joyned with those that
entred last, the said Ensign found whom to talk withal, and they handled him as they
had done the rest. At the same time that our people entred, I cried out to them, that
they should assault the Bastion on the inside within the Town, which they did; but they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105656:106"/>
there found a very great resistance, by reason that the greatest part of the Company of Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'arms
was there, who fought it to a miracle.</p>
            <p>Now (as the courages of men encrease when they see themselves in hopes of victory) to
forget nothing of that they ought to do in well and furiously assaulting; having encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
my people, I left the Gate, and ran to the Ensigns who were upon the Ladders of
the Bastion, crying out to them, that all our men were got in, and that therefore they
should throw themselves headlong into the Bastion, which they did, without meeting
the opposition they expected, forasmuch as our men held them so short, that they were
not able to answer us both within and without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so soon as I saw our Ensigns got in,
I remounted to horse, and with the Commissaries and Treasurers rode all along by the
walls, where all those that leapt over the walls to escape away I caused to be slain.</p>
            <p>Now to return to our first Prisoners, our people followed their execution, till they came
to the place where they found Signior <hi>Bartolomeo de Lesteffa,</hi> with the remainder of his
Company, who made no great defence, for already our people ran all along the streets
of the Town, and even along the very Walls of it. The <hi>Italians</hi> came to enter by the
Wall, that was not too high, and helped one another up; Captain <hi>Bartolomeo de Pezero</hi>
had also set fire to the Gate, as he had promised to do, but was there hurt with a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz
shot through the buttocks, and could not possibly enter there, by reason of the
furious fire that flam'd in the said Gate. They had placed eighteen or twenty <hi>Spaniards</hi>
for the Guard of the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isoners that were in the Palace, fifty or three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ore in number, and
had tied them two and two together, as they told me after, who so soon as ever they
heard the Cry of <hi>France, France,</hi> in the great place adjoyning to the Palace,<note place="margin">The Prisoners free themselves</note> they began to
justle one another, particularly Captain <hi>Gourgues,</hi> who was the first that got his arms at
liberty, when being all freed from their bonds, they flew upon their Guard with such
fury, that what with their own weapons, and what with stones, they kill'd the greatest
part of them upon the place, and the remainder kept prisoners, and brought them out with
them. And this was the fortunate and unexpected deliverance of our Prisoners.</p>
            <p>It now remains to know what succeeded upon the command I had given to the Baron
<hi>de Cleremont,</hi> and Captain <hi>Blacon.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his Companies both of horse and
foot had set out of <hi>Montepulsiano,</hi> and were coming towards <hi>Piance,</hi> it being no more
than three miles from the one to the other, when being in the midway, and hearing
such Volleys of <hi>Harquebuz</hi> shot, they sent out six horse before to see what the matter was.
Of these, three fell into our Ambuscado, and were taken, the other three got away, and
made their people return faster than they came: so that the Baron could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not possibly
come to fight them. In the foremention'd action of the taking of <hi>Piance,</hi> Signior <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolomeo
Lestepha</hi> his Lieutenant and Ensign were all taken, and the Governor who was a
<hi>Spaniard</hi> also, but his Ensign was slain. Captain <hi>Pistoye</hi> (so called for being a Native of <hi>Pistoye</hi>) his Lieutenant and Ensign were likewise taken, together with the Lieutenant
and Ensign of an <hi>Italian</hi> Captain, call'd <hi>Aldetto Placito,</hi> a <hi>Siennois,</hi> who two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was gone out to solicit for their pay before they departed the Town.</p>
            <p>This was the success of the Scalado of <hi>Piance,</hi> which hapned upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> Eve, an
action highly reputed throughout all <hi>Italy.</hi> All the Captains and Soldiers, as well <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
as <hi>French,</hi> said I had taken the Town my self alone, and not they, and that had I
not done as I did, and had they not seen me so couragious and resolute, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more have come near the Walls, having been three times so smartly repuls'd. Had it
been Gods will that those the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> sent from <hi>Montepulsiano</hi> to <hi>Piance</hi> had set
out but an hour sooner, they had not heard our Harquebuz shot by the way, and had fallen
into the Baron <hi>de Cleremont,</hi> and Captain <hi>Blacon</hi>'s Ambuscado, who lay so ready and well
planted for them, that they would easily have been defeated and cut to pieces; for they
no sooner heard the report of the three horse that escaped, but that they immediately all
faced about, and in disorder sled away towards <hi>Montepulsiano.</hi> I left in <hi>Piance</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
there Captain <hi>Faustino,</hi> vvho had been there before, and had yet fifty or threescore
of his Company left, which Captain <hi>Bartolomeo Pezero</hi> had ever kept for him, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
now lent him his Lieutenant with a hundred Soldiers of his own Company:
and about noon as I vvas about to mount to horse to return to <hi>Montalsin,</hi> and sending
every one avvay to his ovvn Garrison, the Captains vvith their Lieutenants and Ensigns
brought me a hundred or sixscore horses of service, vvhich had been taken in this action,
besides Pad-nags and Mule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the most beautiful and the best horse in all <hi>Italy,</hi> though I accepted none of all those
they offer'd me, but that of Captain <hi>Trape</hi> only, vvhich Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> aftervvards
sent to entreat of me, and I gave him to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:105656:107"/>I came back to <hi>Montalsin</hi> vvith no more than the three half Companies I had taken<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talsin.</hi>

thence vvith me, after vvhich I order'd to march all the Captains vve had taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and some fevv Soldiers vvho vvere prisoners also, for there vvere not many sav'd:
Next after the Prisoners I march'd my self, and all my Captains vvith their Colours flying,
and behind me the Gentlmen of my Train carried the horse Cornet, and the three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
vve had taken: and in the rear of all the foot marched the Baron <hi>de Cleremont</hi> vvith
my Troop, and the Gentleman of <hi>Sienna</hi> all on horseback in the rear of all. I do believe
there was not a man nor a vvoman left in the vvhole City, for they vvere all come out to
see me enter, excepting the Captain of the people, the Council, and Magistracy, to vvhom
I had sent a Gentlemen before to entreat them not to stir from the Palace, at vvhich
I vvent and alighted, and entred in arm'd as I vvas, vvith the foresaid Ensigns vve had
taken carried before me, where first in few words I gave them an account of the means
I had used to bring about so hazardous an Enterprize, and after what manner the Town
had been taken, not without observing by their looks, that they had so great a performance
in high admiration: After which I exhorted them to continue the fidelity they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to the King my Master, and not to abandon the hopes of recovering their liberty
and Capital City, God having manifested to them by so great and so happy a victory, that
he would neither forsake them, nor any who fought in their Quarrel. And to shew them
that I bore arms in order to their service only, and for the recovery of their Countrey, I
presented the horse-Corner, and the three Ensigns I had taken; which having received
with the greatest acknowledgements, and the highest applause that could to man be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,
they upon the instant caused to be set up in the great Hall of the Palace display'd,
a thing that did no whit lesson the reputation I had acquir'd either with them at <hi>Rome</hi>

            <p>After this no occasion presented it self worth speaking of saving two,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Chuzy.</hi>
               </note> of which this was
one. Don <hi>Arbro</hi> went to besiege <hi>Chuzy,</hi> which Captain <hi>Moretto Calabras,</hi> who was at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tepescayo,</hi>
had by practice surpriz'd from the Enemy. The said Don <hi>Arbro</hi> had thirty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of foot before it, three pieces of Canon, and six hundred horse. I departed then a
little after noon from <hi>Montalsin</hi> with five Ensigns of foot, and about forescore or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
horse, and by break of day came to <hi>Montepescayo,</hi> where I caused little sacks to
be made to carry powder in, to the number of twenty, which all of them might contain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
three hundred pound of powder. From <hi>Montepescayo</hi> to <hi>Chuzy</hi> it is six miles. Their
Artillery was not yet arriv'd, but it came the same morning that I came away, and about
noon I departed from <hi>Montepescayo,</hi> and went to encamp my self just over against the
Enemies Camp, at the distance of a quarter of a mile, and about as far from the Town,
for they were already encamped before it, and never so much as once sent to discover me.
The place was worth nothing, for we had not had time to fortifie it, and in the beginning
of the night I took the Lieutenant of Captain <hi>Avanson,</hi> call'd <hi>St. Genies,</hi> with thirty
Pikes and thirty Harquebuzeers, which I meant to venture to try if there might be any
means to preserve it; and being that there was a little Rivolet not above three paces broad
betwixt them and me, I sent the said <hi>St. Genies</hi> and Captain <hi>Charry</hi> with a hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
to accompany him, whilst I with the Horse and a hundred Harquebuzeers
went to give them an Alarm in their Camp. St. <hi>Genies</hi> got in with the powder, and all the
Soldiers, four or five Pikes excepted, and all night long I kept them in Alarm to make them
think that I would repose my self in the morning: when having discover'd me they would
come to fight me, considering I had no more Forces but five foot Ensigns only; wherein
I deceiv'd them, for without taking any rest at all, and without sound of Trumpet or
beat of Drum I began to retreat through the Woods, and to take my way directly for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talsin,</hi>
marchingtwelve miles without stop or stay; and then upon the banks of a small Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I made a halt, where all both horse and foot baited upon some provision I had caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be brought upon Asses; where neverthless I did not stay above an hour and a half,
but went on straight to <hi>Montalsin.</hi> Now the same day that I departed from <hi>Chuzy,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
noon they had planted their Artillery without being able nevertheless to make a
breach till the next morning.</p>
            <p>The same day that I departed from <hi>Chuzy</hi> I arriv'd in the Evening at <hi>Montalsin,</hi> which
was thirty miles, and after I came home made them to work all night to make ready a

whereupon I went to view it, and caused Gabions speedily to be made before it, making
shew as if I intended a Siege; though it was only to divert <hi>Don Arbro</hi> from making any
further attempts, fearing lest after he had taken <hi>Chuzy</hi> (which I made no question but
he would do) he might go and sit down before <hi>Montepescaillo,</hi> where Captain <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi>
was, and two or three other places, which only subsisted under the protection of
<hi>Montepescaillo;</hi> and the same day that I made a shew of besieging <hi>Bonconvent,</hi> I sent
Signior <hi>Marioul de Santa Fiere,</hi> Captain <hi>Serres</hi> my Lieutenant, and the Baron <hi>de Clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
my Ensign to scour the field as far as the walls of <hi>Sienna,</hi> where they had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

in three dayes, reckoning from the day that I departed from before <hi>Chuzy.</hi> The Alarm
of this defeat was so great at <hi>Sienna,</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Burgos</hi> sent in all haste to Don <hi>Arbro</hi>
to leave all and return to <hi>Sienna,</hi> for that he greatly feared the <hi>Siennois</hi> would revolt and
receive me into <hi>Sienna,</hi> considering the violent affection they had for me in the City. So

the second day having made a very great Breach, for the wall was a very weak one, and
there being but few men within it, they were forc'd to surrender. The Lieutenant of
Captain <hi>Moretto Calabres</hi> was in it with part of the Company of the said <hi>Moretto,</hi> and
about five and fifty that entred with St. <hi>Genies</hi> only, so that there was not above a hundred
men in all. The next day after Signior <hi>Marioul</hi> had defeated this foot Company, all the
Captains who were with me were of opinion that I should go and batter <hi>Bonconvent;</hi> but I
said to them these words. <hi>You know Gentlmen that since yesterday two of clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
we have not heard the Artillery play at</hi> Chuzy, <hi>which we heard plainly from</hi> Altesse, <hi>by
which you may conclude, either that they are surrendred, or taken by force. If they be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
Don</hi> Arbro <hi>will not stay an hour there, to try if he can snap us in the field, for there
is no qustion to be made, but that he has receiv'd the Alarm of the foot Company you defeated
yesterday by</hi> Sienna; <hi>and that thereupon Cardinal</hi> Burgos <hi>has sent to him to come back to save
the rest of the Castles which are nearest to</hi> Sienna (for as I took the other Castles I immediately
dismantled and pulled them down, (as I also did by <hi>Altesse.) Let us therefore consider
things a little; if our people be surrendred the Camp will not tarry above two hours before</hi>
Chuzy: <hi>if they be taken by assault, the Town is so poor that the Soldiers would need but this
last night only to sack it, and will be this morning two hours before day upon their march,
which though it be thirty miles off, yet will the Artillery be here before noon: for Don</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro
<hi>knows very well, that I have not a hundred horse in all I can make, nor above six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men in these five Ensigns, wherefore the reason of War requires you should do as I say.
Let me intreat you therefore that we presently fall to drawing off our Canon, and our foot,
and if things do not fall out as I have said, let me bear the blame.</hi> Captain <hi>Moretto</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
and <hi>St. Genies</hi> had what conditions they desir'd, for the haste Don <hi>Arbro</hi> was
in to return; for they march'd out with Bag and Baggage, and Ensign they had none.
I then set fire to the remainder of <hi>Altesse</hi> that could not so suddenly be pulled down, and
left Captain <hi>Serres</hi> with twenty horse upon a little eminence by <hi>Altesse,</hi> from whence
they might discover as far as a Wood, which was Don <hi>Arbro</hi>'s way to return; and when I
was got within a mile of <hi>Montalsin</hi> Captain <hi>Serres</hi> sent two Troopers full speed to tell me,
that he began to discover their Caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foot Captains with ropes, and the strength of the Soldiers to help the Oxen away with
the Artillery, and Signior <hi>Marioul</hi> and I with the horse return'd back to Captain
<hi>Serres.</hi> But so soon as we came to Captain <hi>Serres,</hi> we from another little hill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the Body of their Cavalry already in the Plain, which I suppose had halted
to stay for another Troop that was coming out of the Wood. I left Signior <hi>Marioul</hi>
there to sustein Captain <hi>Serres,</hi> and sent to Captain <hi>Serres</hi> by no means to engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a charge, nor suffer the Enemy to come near him, but begin by little and little
to retire; and having left the same order with Signior <hi>Marioul,</hi>

made them still lug the Artillery up the hill, and could not get it within fifty paces of the

come to fight you, and be diligent in your retreat, whether by day or by night, by which

Enemy to be as diligent to surprize you, as you are to prevent being surpriz'd. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of war requir'd that I should do as I did, and men must evermore be at watch when
they are near an Enemy, so that if he be three hours march distant from you double your
speed, and if it be possible do that in two hours which he may do in three: by which
means having the start, without an infamous flight, you shall leave him nothing but the
empty Nest. I but (a man may object and say) perhaps he will never come near me at
all, and in the mean time I retreat without seeing an Enemy: but let me tell you, if you
stay for that, you will be defeated and lost, especially if you have Canon to draw off

so soon as Monsieur <hi>de la Montjoye</hi> had discover'd by break of day in the morning, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
a man post away to me to give me notice, who made so good haste, that he came
to <hi>Montalsin</hi> by four of clock in the afternoon, though it be no less than five and thirty
miles. Without staying an hour therefore after I heard the news, I departed with four
hundred Harquebuzeers, and my own Troop of horse, marching all night without stop or
stay, until I came to a Village within three miles of <hi>Grossette,</hi> which was seven and twenty
miles, and I came thither by Sun rise, where I made the Soldiers eat something, and
bait their horses, whilst I gallopped away to <hi>Grossette,</hi> where I heard that the Enemy
were all about <hi>Tallamon,</hi> which made me suddenly to cause three hundred Harquebuzeers
of those of the Garrison of <hi>Grossette</hi> to pass a River half a mile from thence, upon Asses
and Horses; so that by that time my own men whom I had left baiting were come to the
River, the three hundred men were pass'd over, and upon their march<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I then sent
two Troopers to the said Sieur <hi>de Montjoye,</hi> to bid him stand firm, for that I was there
to relieve him, though he could scarce believe the news, not thinking it possible I could
be there so soon, but that some body had sent him such word only to put him in heart.</p>
            <p>The Enemy had landed three or four hundred men, and two Gallies came and plyed
him with a great number of Canon shot, the thunder of which I no sooner heard, but that I
advanc'd with my Horse, and the three hundred Foot, that were already got over, and
lest Captain <hi>Charry</hi> to pass over those that I had brought from <hi>Montalsin;</hi> when, so soon
as the Enemy saw so long a Train of men, and that I advanc'd with the three hundred
Foot and the Horse, they all cast themselves into the water; so easily were they perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
out of their fury. It was excessively hot, and many of them were in the water to
the armpits: I had made account to have fought them, let them be what number they
would, for I was very sure they had no Horse: but I found that part of the Gallies were
reimbarking the Soldiers about <hi>Tallamon,</hi> and at the old Port, so that before I could get to
them they were all aboard, and put out to sea toward <hi>Mount-Argentan,</hi> where the rest
of the Gallies lay. I believe they thought that Monsieur <hi>de Montjoye</hi> would surrender upon
the Canon shot they playd from the Gallies, but he was too brave a Gentleman to be so
easily frighted as they imagin'd. He was since slain in the late troubles at <hi>Aubeterre</hi> under
Monsieur <hi>de Causeus,</hi> who can give testimony of hisvalour.</p>
            <p>Captains (my Camrades) you ought not to think it strange that I have never been defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor surpriz'd where I have commanded in chief, as you shall never be, if you carry your
selves with the same vigilance and diligence that throughout my whole life I have ever
done. I perhaps have made my Soldiers do that never any one made men do before;
for I ever had my tongue at command to remonstrate to them (when I have been in place
where diligence was requir'd) their own honor, and the service of the King; and also
that by diligence only we were to save our own lives. 'Tis that both adds wings to
their feet, and inspires them with resolution when the one or the other is necessary. Which
remonstrances of mine never fail'd of their effect; and when a long march was to be
perform'd, I caus'd bread and wine to be carried along wherewith to refresh them; for it
you will have your Soldiers make a long march, and take nothing wherewith to refresh
them, humane bodies are not made of iron, you must either leave them by the way, or
at least when you shall come to fight they will be so weak, that they will be able to do
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105656:108"/>
you very little service, but taking provisions along with you to refresh them, together
with remonstrances, you shall not only make them go, but run also, if you desire them;
so that a man must never think to excuse himself upon the Soldier, for no man in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
has had more experience of it than my self, and I never saw any defect on their
side, but alwayes in the Officers: for a good and prudent Captain will make good and
discreet Soldiers; amongst a great many good men ten or a dozen Poltrons and Cowards
will grow hardy, and become valiant; but a cowardly, imprudent and improvident Captain
loses and spoils all. This in gross was all that was done whilst I stayd at <hi>Montalsin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> having been enform'd that I was like to have been surpriz'd at

               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> is angry with the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> he writ me a very angry letter, wherein he told me, that it seem'd I had a mind
to lose my self, the Country, and all, to go out after this manner upon every occasion
into the field, and that if I should chance to be defeated the whole Country would be lost,
he being already so weak in men, that he should not be able upon any disaster to relieve
it; that this way of proceeding was commendable enough in a private Captain, but not
in a Kings Lieutenant, who ought not to expose his own person but upon very great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
To which I writ in answer,<note place="margin">He excuses himself.</note> that I had been necessitated to do as I did, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Don <hi>Arbro</hi> would foot by foot deprive me of the whole Country, that on the other
side he might assure himself I should rise so early, and use such diligence, that I would
look well enough to my self for being at any time surpriz'd, and that therefore he should
not take any thought concerning me; for although Don <hi>Arbro</hi> had evermore thirty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in the field, and I but five or six to answer him withall, I would nevertheless so well
look to his water, that I would well enough prevent him from bringing about his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
After this I re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from <hi>Montalsin</hi> towards <hi>Rome.</hi> About a mile distant from the <hi>Roman</hi> Way there is a little

with Flower-de-Luces, and the foundation recorded in Parchment; the Religious
of this place are very holy men.</p>
            <p>Being there I receiv'd a letter from the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
               <note place="margin">News of the loss of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of <hi>St. Quentin.</hi>
               </note> (who was at this time
at <hi>Ferrara</hi>) wherein he writ me the sad news of the Constables being defeated at St.
<hi>Quentin,</hi> and that it was more than necessary I should now more than ever intend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
affairs, and that if God did not assist the King, all was gone in <hi>France,</hi> all the
Forces his Majesty had being lost at this defeat. Immediately upon this Letter I return'd
back to <hi>Montalsin,</hi> for fear lest the <hi>Siennois</hi> hearing the news, should be totally dismayd,
where, by remonstrances and perswasions I comforted them the best I could, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
tried to comfort my self. I had need so to do, for I gave the Kingdom for lost,
and it was only sav'd by the good pleasure of God, and nothing else, God miraculously
blinding the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s understandings, so as not to pursue
their victory directly to <hi>Paris:</hi> for they had men enow to have left at the Siege of St.
<hi>Quentin</hi> against the Admiral, and to have followed their victory too; or after they had
taken St. <hi>Quentin</hi> they had as much time as ever, and yet knew not how to do that any
simple Captain would have done.<note place="margin">Discourse upon this defeat.</note> So that we must all acknowledge it to be the bounty
of Almighty God, who loves our King, and would not suffer his Kingdom to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
However I did not to the <hi>Siennois</hi> make the matter altogether so bad as it was,
but told them that the Letters I had from <hi>France,</hi> assur'd me the loss was but small, and
that the King was setting an Army on foot, which he would command in his own
person.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> by reason the King had call'd him home to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
sent for me to come to him, which I did post; where being come, he there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of me what it would be necessary for him to leave me wherewith to maintain
what we had in <hi>Tuscany;</hi> to which I made answer that I had need of that which it was
not in his power to give me; for he had no money to leave me, nor-many men, that would
not be more serviceable in <hi>France</hi> than in <hi>Tuscany:</hi> but that nevertheless I would do as
God should direct me, in whom I repos'd a confidence, that he would no more forsake
me now, than hitherto he had done; and that I humbly begg'd of him to make all
the haste he possibly could into <hi>France;</hi> for if God did not preserve the Kingdom men
could do very little towards it, all the Forces of the Nation being defeated and lost. The
Mareschal <hi>de Strozzy,</hi> who was present, very much approv'd of my answer, and as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commended me, forasmuch as others would have demanded men and money, of both
which I had in truth very great need: but <hi>France</hi> was of greater concern to the King than

               <hi>France,</hi> to help to defend the Kingdom; for I had nothing to lose in <hi>Tuscany;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he promised me to deal so effectually with the King, that his Majesty should send
for me, but upon this condition, that so soon as I should be return'd into <hi>France,</hi> I
should promise forthwith to repair to him. He had not given credit to all the false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
had been made of me, he knew me too well, and ever lov'd me so long as he liv'd.
I engag'd my word to him, that I would do so, and so he went to embark himself at
<hi>Civita Vechia,</hi> and carried back his Forces entire into <hi>France,</hi> wherein he manifested
himself to be a great and prudent Captain. As for me I return'd back to <hi>Montalsin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before my licence came to return for <hi>France,</hi> at the request of Captain <hi>Carbayrac,</hi>
that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had sent Governor to <hi>Grossette</hi> (for he had taken out Monsieur <hi>de

sent me Monsieur <hi>de Giury</hi> with thirteen Ensigns of Foot in his stead, wherein I lost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the change) I went in all haste to <hi>Grossette,</hi> to see to a disorder was faln out there;
which was, that all the Ammunition of Corn that I had laid in there (which was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for above a year) was so embezzel'd, that there was not above a hundred Sacks in
all to be found. There was a Commissary, whose name was <hi>Louberiac,</hi> who laid the blame
of this business upon Monsieur <hi>de la Molle;</hi> whereupon I sent post after Monsieur <hi>de la
Molle,</hi> to acquaint him with what this fellow had deposed against him; and Monsieur
<hi>de la Molle</hi> on the contrary charg'd the fault upon the said <hi>Louberiac.</hi> I lay that night
in a pair of damp sheets, and it was in Winter, not having at that time brought my
field-bed along with me,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> falls sick.</note> because I would let my Mules rest in order to my Jurney into
<hi>France,</hi> by which means I got a continued fever, that in ten dayes depriv'd me of all

<hi>Louberiac</hi> for ever robbing the Kings Ammunitions again, as I did another at <hi>Sienna</hi> who
had done the same.</p>
            <p>So soon as I began a little to recover my senses, and to know people, my dismission
came, his Majesty writing to me withal, that I should go to <hi>Ferrara</hi> there to remain
some time with the Duke to advise him in his affairs, he being at that time engag'd in a
War. The great joy of this dismission put me into so much heart,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> has leave to return into <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> that four dayes after
I departed, causing my self to be carried in a Chair by six men to <hi>Montizel,</hi> where Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Bartolomeo de Pezero</hi> was, and where I stayd three dayes in expectation of a Litter,
which Signior <hi>Marioul de Santa Fiore</hi> was to send me. In which I departed thence, not
being able for all that to travel above five or six miles a day, and came to <hi>Pezero,</hi> where I
found the Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> who sent out five or six Gentlmen to meet me, to conduct me
to lodge in his Castle: to which returning my very humble thanks, I sent the Duke an
excuse, that I begg'd his pardon, for I was of necessity to alight at Captain <hi>Bartolomeo de
Pezero</hi>'s house, who had writ to his Mother to receive me, and where I was consequently
expected. I then went thither, where I found his Mother to be an extraordinary civil
person, and as well esteem'd in the City as any Gentlewoman whatever. So soon as
ever I alighted they immediately put me to bed, for I was so worn, that I was nothing
but skin and bone, and continually dying for cold, what Furrs soever they could put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me. The Duke did me the honor presently to come see me, and seeing me so ill,
compell'd me to stay four dayes there, not suffering me to spend a penny, but caused
me every day to be serv'd with two dishes from his own Table, after which I fancied my
self so much better, that I sent back the Litter. The Duke at parting would needs make

that Monsieur <hi>de Giury</hi> gave me at my departure from <hi>Montalsin</hi> (where he commanded
till the arrival of Don <hi>Francisco d' Est,</hi> whom the King made his Lieutenant General as

for there was not so much as any one Bulwark cover'd, and the Courtines very low, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Spurrs, being but half terrassed, nor yet half fill'd, and all the Flancks open. The
Duke sent the Prince his Son, who lay with his Army at <hi>Reges,</hi> word of all this, bidding

he should not know what to do with the Army, the said Signior alwayes commanding
in his absence. and he having no ease but by him, and therefore humbly entreated he would
please to make choice of some other. The Duke then immediately sent away to Monsieur
<hi>de la Molle,</hi> who was with the Prince in his Camp, entreating that he would go to defend
the place: but Monsieur <hi>de la Molle</hi> return'd answer back, that the King had given him
no order to shut himself up in any place, but only to perform his office in the field: and
therefore desir'd to be excus'd. The Duke was exceedingly troubled, (as also was the
Cardinal his Brother that now is) that they had not a man in so great an exigency, whom
they could entrust with the defence of this place.</p>
            <p>I now began to gather a little strength, and these dispatches to and again were carried
so privately, that I knew nothing of all this, till in the end a Gentleman of the Dukes,
(whom he had commanded to be continually about me, to see that I wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed nothing)
discover'd it all to me one night very late,<note place="margin">The anxiety of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </note> and told me moreover, that the Duke had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
given over the place for lost, forasmuch as he who was Governor in it was no Soldier,
nor had ever born arms in any action of consequence: but that he was nevertheless a very,
honest man; so that the Duke did not in the least suspect his fidelity, but only his want
of experience, and which was worst of all, there was no one in a time of so great need,
who would make an offer of his person, to put himself into the place. Having heard this
story, I all night consulted with my health about this affair; for as for inclination I had
but too much, and in the morning finding my self indifferently lusty, I thereupon went
immediately to wait upon the Duke, whom I found abed, for he alwayes rose very late.
He had given order to his people, that at what time soever I came to his Chamber door,
although he was in bed, they should let me in; wherefore I no sooner knockt, but that
one of the Gentlemen of his Chamber presenty open'd the door, where I found the Duke
in Bed, and two Secretaries writing upon a little Table by his Bed-side. So soon as I had
given him the good morrow, I gave him an account of what had been told me over night,
but withal naming the Gentleman. Whereupon he repeated to me the same things I had
heard before, together with the great trouble he was in, but would not mention the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
of <hi>Mantua</hi> to me, from whom he had the most certain intelligence untill my return,
when so soon as he had made an end, I spoke to him after this manner. <hi>Sir,</hi>

his arms, and clasping me fast about the neck, held my face close to his bosom, bidding
one of his Gentlmen run for the Cardinal his Brother, who lay in his own Palace, a great

               </note> the next day I din'd at <hi>Modena,</hi> and arriv'd
in the evening at <hi>Reges,</hi> where the Prince with his Army lay, who gave me the Baron

               <hi>d' Aurade,</hi> (the same who was after slain at Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> his Chamber window
at <hi>Vienna</hi>) with his Company and a Troop of Horse for my Convoy. In this equipage
at one of the clock in the afternoon we arriv'd at <hi>Versel,</hi> where there was one Company
of <hi>Swiss,</hi> five of <hi>Italians,</hi> and now that of the Baron <hi>d' Aurade,</hi> who was glad to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, and made the seventh. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> from the time of his being
reconcil'd to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had call'd back his two Companies of Light-horse, which
had been with us at <hi>Rome,</hi> commanded by the Captain <hi>Bartolomieo,</hi> and <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> and
seven or eight dayes before this Captain <hi>Ambrosio</hi> had been taken, and brought prisoner
into the Castle of <hi>Versel,</hi> where I found him just going away, the Prince having exchang'd
him for another. He was amaz'd to see me there, and I told him, <hi>that not long agoe we
had worn the white Cross together, but that I now saw him with a red one;</hi> to which he
<hi>made answer, quae besognava far le commandamento del s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I had there:</hi> In answer to which I merrily told him, <hi>that I was come thither to serve
them in the quality of</hi> Mareschal de Camp, <hi>where I would provide them Quarters to lodge
their Army in at their ease:</hi> But Captain <hi>Pietro Gentilis</hi> told and assur'd him, that I
was come to defend the place, who thereupon said, <hi>O questi non sono baye donque a la fede
che, io portero cative nove al mio padrone,</hi> and so bad me farewell.</p>
            <p>Now the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> at this same time held another place of the Duke of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi>
besieg'd belonging to <hi>Reges.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The defects of <hi>Versel.</hi>
               </note> For five or six miles round about <hi>Versel</hi> I found nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hay nor Straw, nor any other thing for the horses to eat, neither was there any
meat at all, and within few utensils to work withal, nor wine, but a little they had for
the <hi>Swiss,</hi> and very little either meal, or corn to make meal of: A defect that I believe
more tempted Don <hi>Ferrand</hi> to besiege it, than any other thing. Methought I was once
more got into <hi>Sienna,</hi> where I was in the greatest necessity of all things; and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Troop of Horse would needs be gone, their horses not having any one bit of any
thing of all that night to eat. Now there were three great Bourgs upon the Road to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Parma</hi> (which as I remember they told me appertain'd to the Sieur <hi>de St. Surin,</hi>
whom I have seen in a round Bonnet at Court) half a mile distant the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and two miles from <hi>Versel,</hi> where there lay some <hi>Italian</hi> Soldiers in Garrison, to
hinder those of <hi>Versel</hi> from drawing any relief from thence. I therefore sallied out with
the <hi>Swiss</hi> Company, that of the Baron <hi>d' Aurade,</hi> and three hundred <hi>Italian</hi> Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeers,
ordering Signior <hi>Pietro Gentili's</hi> to command all the men, women, and children to
follow after me, together with all the horse in the Town, and a great number of Ropes
and Sacks, and so marched directly to the first Village. The Enemy who were quarter'd
there, upon my coming presently abandon'd the Bourg, and retir'd to the next, and I
still follow'd after, till at last they forsook them all, and retir'd in all haste towards <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>

and left the Baron <hi>d' Aurade</hi> with the Troop of Horse at the furthermost Village
towards <hi>Parma,</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Harquebuzeers at the second, and the <hi>Swiss</hi> at the third near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to <hi>Versel,</hi> giving them all in charge to suffer nothing to pass, but victual only, whilst
I rid up and down from Bourg to Bourg to hasten them in their work; for I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to go off without fighting. The Bourgs were none of them all enclosed, and there
was great plenty of provisions, insomuch that some made five or six journeys to carry
victual into <hi>Versel,</hi> so that in the end there was not one who did not come to seek for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
and the wines we embark'd upon Boats, and convey'd them by a little River there
was (I think an Arm of the <hi>Po</hi>) landing them about half a mile from <hi>Versel,</hi> the River
coming no nearer to the Town. This work continued from Sun-rise to Sun-set, so that I
dare be bold to say there was but a very little provision, of all sorts put together, left in
all the Villages, the men and women whereof were very much astonisht at this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but I promised them satisfaction; and so the day past, wherein so much provision
both for men and horses was conveyed into the Town, that for three months we could not
possibly want, and then the Captain of the horse was content to stay with me a few days
longer. The next day Signior <hi>Pietro Gentilis</hi> sallied out with all the men, women, and
children of eight years old and upwards, and went to fall upon a Copse about half a mile
from <hi>Versel,</hi>

               </note> to cause Bavins to be made and brought before the Town. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were by no means unwilling to go, and he also took the <hi>Swiss,</hi> and almost all the
<hi>Italian</hi> foot along with him, whilst I with the Baron <hi>d' Aurade,</hi> and the Troop of horse
went along to guard him, where they plyed their work as well at the Copse, as they had
done at the Villages the day before, and came to throw down their Bavins within a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz
shot of the Town; neither till the night took us up did we ever cease, and for
two dayes after did the same, insomuch that I am confident there were above threescore
thousand Bavins made in three dayes, which afterwards we went with Colours flying to

fetch home,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> carries a Basket at the Fortifications.</note> and bestowed them in the Town, filling the Church, and several vacant
places in the Walls, and then fell to fortifying, none being excepted from the work, Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Pietro</hi> and I carrying Baskets to give example to the rest. I can say nothing but very
well of that Gentleman, for I perceived in him no want either of courage or industry,
but only of a little experience, which is not to be acquir'd without being employed, which
he had never been; and how can one judge of a man until he be tried? 'Tis possible if he
had been attaqu'd he would have acquitted himself very well: though men who have
never seen a Siege are apt to be astonisht when they hear such a rattle about their cars,
and if a Governor be once daunted, all is lost. So soon as we had got our Bavins into
the Town I resolv'd upon another Enterprise, wich was to go and sweep away the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of two Villages near <hi>Grastalda,</hi> which belongs to Don <hi>Ferrand,</hi> in which there
were two Companies of <hi>Germans,</hi> and one of <hi>Italians.</hi> To this end I sent the Captain
of the Horse, and all the Gentlemen who were with me, to ride up to <hi>Grastalda,</hi> and
with them all along by a Hedge the Baron <hi>d'Aurade</hi> to second them, whilst I with the
<hi>Swiss,</hi> and four hundred <hi>Italians</hi> was busie loading away the victuals. They sent then
twelve horse up to the very Gates of <hi>Grastalda,</hi> and the rest were plac'd in Ambush in
a little Wood hard by. Whereupon the <hi>German</hi> Captains, and a great many people with
them sallied out, and pursued out Avant Coureurs. Our Ambuscado discover'd it
self too soon, otherwise all the Captains had been taken; but we pursued them up to
the very gates, where fourty or threescore <hi>Germans</hi> were slain (for the Baron <hi>d'Aurade</hi>
was got in amongst them (the Ambuscado's both of foot and horse being planted close by
one another) and a <hi>German</hi> Ensign with twenty or four and twenty <hi>Germans</hi> taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners;
and so we return'd home with the provisions we had loaded, and the next day
I dismissed the Horse to return back to the Prince, who I was afraid would be displeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they staid so long, though the men themselves were very willing to have staid
longer with me, which if they had I should often have engag'd them with the Enemy;
for I have ever taken care that my Soldiers, whether horse or foot, should not grow resty
for want of employment, and stronger or weaker, have ever set them together by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ars
with the Enemy, to see what they could do. 'Tis true a man ought to go discreetly to
work not to lose them, but on the other side, he that stands over much upon caution,
saying I will not throw away my men, or I will not do this or that to endanger the loss
of my Company, shall in the end find, that he has perform'd no great matters. A man
must both give and take.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> lay still before the foremention'd place, which he batter'd, and
in the mean time I did my business; Captain <hi>Balferniere</hi> and another <hi>French</hi> Company
were in it' who behaved themselves so well, that they for ten or twelve dayes held the
Enemy in play.<note place="margin">Don <hi>Ferrand</hi> in suspence what to do.</note> Don <hi>Ferrand</hi> who was at <hi>Cremona</hi> having intelligence of the victual
and Bavins we had put into <hi>Versel,</hi> and of the great diligence we used in all our affairs,
began to cool in his design: for (as I have said before) I had made head against him at
<hi>Cassal,</hi> and he knew very well what order and diligence I had observ'd in my Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there: he also remembred how I had serv'd him at <hi>Benne,</hi> and at <hi>St. Damian,</hi> all
which together made him imagine he should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>asily carry this place, and therefore he
withdrew his Ammunitions and Artillery, which were upon the banks of <hi>Po</hi> ready to be
shipt aboard, and dismist the Boats he had prest whereon to embark the Canon, and the
Foot; for the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Camp was to have joyned with him before <hi>Versel.</hi> And
although it be in my own commendation, yet shall I not forbear to tell you, that the
Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> said in publick, and gave me that glory, that my presence had diverted
the Enemies designs, who would not attempt the Enterprise, knowing (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
what I could do for the defence of a place. 'Tis a great deal to acquire such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as to make a man's self fear'd and esteem'd by his Enemy. The said Don
<hi>Ferrand</hi> was an old wary Soldier, and would not attempt a place where I had broken
ground; and also if he had, having wherewithal to eat I should have baffled him.</p>
            <p>About this time the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> procur'd the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s peace with the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> a good Frenchman.</note> but it was with the knowledge and consent of the King, otherwise the
said Duke would not have done it to have sav'd his Dukedom, he was so good a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
and when the peace came, which was five and twenty dayes after I entred into
<hi>Versel,</hi> I took my leave of the Prince, and return'd to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where it is not to be asked
if I was welcome to the Duke, the Dutchess, and the Cardinal; for I do not think they
ever caressed any man of what condition soever he was, or could be, more than they did
me; and when he died I might well say, as I now do, I lost one of the best friends I
had in the world: and when I departed from <hi>Ferrara</hi> to go to <hi>Versel,</hi> the Duke exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
a Secret ray of mine what store of money I had, and he telling him I had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

two hundred Crowns,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> he sent five hundred Crowns to my said Secretary, who had
the ordering of my expence; and when three dayes after my return I took my leave of
him, the Dutchess and the Cardinal, the said Duke seeing me have a great many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Quality in my Train, and knowing I could not have money enough to defray
my Journey, he sent me five hundred more. And thus I return'd rich from my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in <hi>Tuscany.</hi> This money carried me to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where I found two thousand and four
hundred Francks, which the King had caused to be paid for two years Salary of my place
of Gentleman of the Chamber, and that <hi>Martineau</hi> had there deposited for me in the
hands of <hi>Cathelin Iean</hi> the Post-master,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at Court.</note> which brought me to <hi>Paris.</hi> Immediately upon
my coming to <hi>Paris</hi> I went to kiss his Majesties hand, he being then at <hi>Cressy,</hi> where I
was as well receiv'd by his Majesty as at my return from <hi>Sienna,</hi> and he was very well
satisfied with what I had done for the Duke of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> who had
not seen me before, embrac't me three or four times in the presence of the King himself,
and his Majesty commanded the said Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> to cause a thousand Crowns to
be given me, wherewith to return and to sojourn some time at <hi>Paris,</hi> which he presently
did. And thus was my return out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>France;</hi> the last time that I was in those
parts, and the services I did there, wherein I cannot lie; there being so many yet living
who can bear testimony of what I have deliver'd.</p>
            <p>By this (Captains) you may see, and take notice what a thing reputation is, which also
having once acquir'd, you ought rather to die than to lose; neither must you do like men
of the world, who so soon as they have got a little repute are content with it, and think
that what ever they shall do afterwards, the world will still repute them valiant. Do
not fancy any such thing; for by performing from time to time still more and braver
things, young men rise to greatness, have fire in their pates, and fight like Devils; who
when they shall see you do nothing worth taking notice of, will be apt to say that the
world has bestowed the title of valiant upon you without desert, will set less value upon
you, use you with less respect, and behind your back talk of you at their pleasure, and
with good reason; for if you will not still continue to do well, and still attempt new
and greater things, it were much safer for your honor to retire home to your own house,
with the reputation you have already got, than by still following arms to lose it again,
and to be scouting at distance when others are laying about them. If you desire to
mount to the highest step of the stairs of honor, do not stop in the mid-vvay, but step by
step strive to get up to the top vvithout imagining that your renovvn vvill continue the
same as vvhen it vvas obtein'd at first. You deceive your selves, some nevv commer vvill
carry avvay the prize, if you do not look vvell about you, and strive to do still better and
better.</p>
            <p>The same day that I vvent from <hi>Cressy</hi> back to <hi>Paris,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> departed also
to go to <hi>Metz</hi> to execute the Enterprize of <hi>Thionville.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> created Lieutenant General of <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> The King from the time of his

that he vvas novv upon the Siege of <hi>Thionville.</hi> Tvvo dayes had not past before the King
sent for me to come to him to <hi>Cressy,</hi> vvithout giving me notice vvhat it vvas about, and

<hi>d' Andelot</hi> to be arrested about some ansvver he had made him concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So soon as I vvas come the King sent for me into his Chamber,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Andelot</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested.</note> vvhere he had vvith
him the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and tvvo or three others (vvhom I have forgor, but I think

me that I must go to <hi>Metz</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> there to command the Foot, of which
Monsieur <hi>d' Andelot</hi> vvas Colonel. I most humbly besought his Majesty not to make me to
intermeddle vvith another mans Command, vvhich rather than I vvould do, I vvould go
serve his Majesty under the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> in the quality of a private Soldier, or else
vvould command his Pioneers, rather than take upon me this employment. The King
then told me, that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> so soon as he had heard of <hi>Andelots</hi> imprisonment,
had himself sent to demand me to exercise the said command. Seeing then I could get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by excuses, I told his Majesty that I was not yet cur'd of a Dyssentery my disease
had left me, and that this was a command which requir'd health and disposition of body
to perform it; which were neither of them in me; whereupon his Majesty told me,<note place="margin">What an opinion King <hi>

               </note> that
he should think this Command better discharg'd by me in a Litter, than by another in
perfect health, and that he did not give it me to exercise for another, but that he intended
I should have it for ever; to which I made answer, that I gave his Majesty most humble
thanks for the honor he design'd me herein, and made it my most humble request, that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105656:111"/>
he would not be displeased, if I could not accept it. Whereupon his Majesty said to me
these words, <hi>Let me entreat you to accept it for my sake,</hi> and with that the Cardinal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
me, saying, <hi>You dispute it too long with his Majesty, 'tis too much contested with
your Master,</hi> to which I replyed, that I did not dispute it out of any disaffection to
his Majesties service, nor that I was unwilling to serve under the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> I having
upon my first coming to <hi>Paris</hi> laid out money to buy me some Tents, and other Equipage,
in order to my attendance upon him, having engag'd my self before at <hi>Rome</hi> so to do;
but only upon the account of my incapacity in that posture of health wherein I then was.
His Majesty then told me, that there was no more to be said, and that I must go; after
which I had no more to say. And I fancy the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier</hi>
both fell upon me to perswade me to accept of this Command, forasmuch as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the King said to me, there is no more excuse, for you see all the world is against
you, and thereupon commanded the Cardinal to order me another thousand Crowns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Equipage, which he presently did. I then return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I stayd
but two dayes to provide my self of such things as I wanted, and so went away to the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to <hi>Metz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry.</note> I found him just mounting to horse to go to discover <hi>Thion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
but he would not suffer me to go along with him, by reason of my long Journey,
and to speak the truth I was not very well; and the same night he return'd, and told
me, that if God would permit us to take that place, there was honor to be got. He was
alwaies wont when dispos'd to be merry to call me, his heart, and smiling, then said to
me, <hi>Courage my heart, I hope we shall carry it.</hi> And in the morning we departed, for he had
all his tackle ready. I must needs say one thing with truth, and without flattery, that
he was one of the most diligent Generals that I had serv'd of eighteen, under whom I had
the honor to bear arms for his Majesties service; and yet he had one fault, which was, that
he would write almost every thing with his own hand, and would not trust to any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
he had. I will not say this was ill done, but it rendred him a little slow, and
affairs of war require so prompt a diligence, that a quarter of an hours delay sometimes
endangers the success of the greatest Enterprize. One day I came from the Trenches to
demand of him four German Ensigns to reinforce our Guards, for we began to approach
very near to the Town; and because the Artillery from the walls had forced him from his
first Quarter, he was lodg'd in a little low house, which had one little Chamber only,
the window whereof was just over the door: I there met with Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi>
who was since Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> whom I asked where the Duke was; he told me he
was writing; <hi>the Devil,</hi> said I, <hi>take all these writings for me, it seems he has a mind to
save his Secretaries a labour, 'tis pitty he was not a Clerk of the Parliament of</hi> Paris, <hi>for he
would have got more money than</hi> du Tillot, <hi>and all the rest of them put together.</hi> Monsieur

the Duke heard every word I said, and therefore egg'd me on still to descant more upon
this Clerk: when presently Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> came out laughing, and said, <hi>How now
my heart, what do you think I should have made a good Clerk?</hi> but in my life I was never so
out of countenance, and was furiously angry with Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> for having
made me talk at that rate, though the Duke laught at it only, and gave me Count <hi>Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendolf</hi>
with four Ensigns.<note place="margin">The laudable qualities of the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
               </note> But to return to what I was saying of his diligence, there
was not any one who did not acknowledge him for one of the most vigilant and diligent
Generals of our times, and withal a man of so great judgment in deliberation, that he
having deliver'd his opinion and advice, a better was not to be expected. As to the rest,
a Prince so discreet, affable, and familiar, that there was not a man in his Army, who
would not cheerfully run all hazards for the least word of his mouth; so great a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
he had in gaining hearts. Onely his dispatches took up a little too much of his time,
I think because he durst not trust his Secretaries, a sort of men that do us a great deal

            <p>He besieg'd the Town then on that side beyond the River, the River being between,
which he caus'd to be sounded,<note place="margin">The <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Thionville.</hi>
               </note> to try if it was not very deep, by five or six Soldiers
that I brought with me: we were not above five or six with him, of which number were
Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Cire;</hi> and we found that some of the Soldiers
had water up to the Codpiece, and others to the Girdle. I then told him, that in case
this was the weakest side, he ought not to deferre making his Battery; for I doubted not
to make the Soldiers pass over to the assault, and that I my self would lead them the
way. The night following we planted Gabions upon the bank of the River, and in the
morning by break of day the Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

open'd on the left hand towards a Ravelin that flanckt the said Tower, as also was a
little Turrer betwixt the great Tower and the Ravelin. This was all that could be done
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105656:112"/>
at that place. The Enemy planted ten or twelve great pieces of Canon, just over against
our Artillery;<note place="margin">A Counter Battery.</note> and about eleven of the clock in the morning began to make a Counter-battery,
with which before two a clock in the afternoon they had beaten all our Gabions
to pieces, excepting one, and the half of another, behind which ten or a dozen of us that
were there squat with our bellies close to the ground; for all the Soldiers and Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
were constrain'd to quit the post, and to go throw themselves behind another Trench
above sixscore paces behind us; so that durst the Enemy have ventur'd over the water, they
might have taken our Artillery, and at great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase have thrown them into the River: for
the Soldiers that were retired to the other Trench could not have come up to relieve us,
but at the mercy of their Canon, and smaller shot, forasmuch as the River was not above
threescore and ten paces over, and ran within four foot of the Wall. Monsieur <hi>le</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>d' Elloeuf,</hi> with fourteen or fifteen Gentlemen of the Dukes Train, never forsook me
of all the while, and so we lay till dark night, that we planted new Gabions, and double
the number, but it was all to no purpose, for we could do no good with our Battery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wall, forasmuch as they had cast up great Terrasses within, so broad that two
or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee Coaches might have gone upon them abreast both in that place, and elsewhere quite
round the Town; in my life I never saw a Fortress better fortified than that was. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Guise</hi> then call'd a Council, where every one was of opinion that he should draw
off his Artillery from that place, and lodge all our Infantry and <hi>Germans</hi> on the other
side the River, and there to begin his Trenches as near as he could to the Wall. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
resolv'd upon, the said Duke caused a Bridg in extreme diligence to be presently made,
and we passed the River over it, though the plancks were not as yet nail'd, and encampt
in a Village about five or six hundred paces distant from the City, situate upon a Plain,
and so open,<note place="margin">A furious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-battery.</note> that a bird could not stir without being seen, and there they plyed us with
their Canon till they had not left a house standing in the whole Village, insomuch that
we were constrain'd to secure our selves in the Cellars under ground. I had pitch'd my
Pavillions very cunningly betwixt two Walls, but they beat down both Walls and Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions;
in my life I never saw a more furious Counter-battery. The night following the
Mareschal <hi>de Strozzy</hi> past the River with Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> and we began to cast up our
Trenches along this Plain, where we lay seven or eight dayes before we could approach
within two hundred paces of the City, by reason the nights were short, and by day they did
so thunder the Trenches, that there was no working but by night. The Mareschal never
stirr'd from us, unless he went sometimes to his Tents, (which yet remain'd on the other
side of the water) to shift his clothes,<note place="margin">The Trenches.</note> and that not above once in three dayes. He gave
me leave to make the Trenches according to my own fancy, for we had at first begun them
a little two narrow through the wisdom of an Engineer. At every twenty paces I made
a back corner, or return, winding sometimes to the left hand, and sometimes to the right,
which I made so large that there was room for twelve or fifteen Soldiers with their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzes
and Halberts; and this I did to the end, that should the Enemy gain the head of
the Trench, and should leap into it, those in the back corner might fight them, they being
much more Masters of the Trench than they who were in the straight line, an invention
that both the Mareschal and the Duke did very well approve of.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> then told me, that I must send to discover what effect our Artillery
had wrought against the Tower, and that I must do it by valiant persons. In order
whereunto I took with me Captain <hi>Sarlabous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thionville</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.</note> the younger <hi>Millac, St. Estephe, Cipiere,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> my Son, and went. So soon as we came near unto the Tower we
were to pass over certain little Bridges the Enemy had made, by which to pass over the
Marish to the Tower; and being come to the Tower we found a Pallisado of posts as
thick as a man's thigh, that from the Tower went seven or eight paces into the River, and
we were to go all along by the Pallisado in water to the end of it, and afterwards on the
other side of the Pallisado to return to the Tower. We had made two Soldiers bring
two Pikes along with us; I for my part did not go into the water, but all the rest past the
Pallisado after this manner, and one after another view'd the breach that had been made
in the Tower, and they put a Soldier into it by a Pike, and found that within the Tower
there was water up to the arm-pits, and being the River made a great noise at this place
by reason of the Pallisado, their Centinels never heard us, though the Tower was no more
than four paces distant from the Wall of the Town. This being done we return'd,<note place="margin">The Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the discovery made by the Sieur <hi>de Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and
went to give Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> an account of what we had seen, who would not give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to our discovery, but told me he was certain there was no Pallisado, and that people
who came lately from thence had assur'd him to the contrary; and that therefore the
night following we must discover it better. I was vext to the blood at this answer: but
said no more to him but only this, <hi>that I conceiv'd the testimony of those Captains was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:105656:112"/>

better,</hi> to which he made-answer, that he did not mean I should go my self, <hi>neither</hi> said
I, <hi>do I intend it.</hi> The Mareschal knew very well that I was angry, and said to the Sieur

Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and you shall see if he do not go this night to discover after a terrible
manner, for I know the complexion of the man.</p>
            <p>This night Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> detein'd the Mareschal with him in his Quarters, and
so soon as it was night I took four hundred Pikes, Corslets all, and four hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers,
and went to lay the Corslets upon their bellies upon the ground within a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

angry at the answer Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had given them, as I, and themselves first passed
the Pallisado. Now I believe the Enemy had in the morning perceiv'd that people had
past by the end of the Pallisado, for we there found a Court of Guard of twenty or five
and twenty men, of which the most part were kill'd, and the rest escap'd into the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
where our people pursued and entred after them; but the door of the Ravelin that
went into the Town was so narrow, that one man only could pass at a time, which was
the reason that our men stopt short, for the Enemy defended the door. Nevertheless they
made shift to dismount, and tumble a Bastard from the Ravelin on our side down to the
ground, and being that by the Tower our Artillery from the other side of the water had
beaten down part of the Wall, so that it was pretty low; we with some Pikes that came
along with us, came to dispute it with them, where the fight continued for above a long
hour. Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> who saw all from the other side of the River, was stark mad
at what he saw, but the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

the Count <hi>de Theophile</hi> saying, <hi>did I not tell you he would make one?</hi> I had made the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to carry five or six hatchets along with them, with which during the time of the fight,
I caused all the Pallisado to be cut, and pulled up, so that we needed no more to wade
the water at our return. Captain St. <hi>Estephe</hi> was there slain with the Ensign of <hi>Cipierre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Estephe <hi>slain.</hi>
               </note>
and another Ensign (but they had not their Colours with them, for I had brought
none) together with ten or twelve Soldiers kill'd, and wounded. Captain <hi>Sarlabous</hi> is
yet living, and several others who can witness, that had we taken with us five or six Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
seven or eight foot high only, we had entred the place, for they kept very ill guard
on that side, and in that place, relying upon the Guard they had left without, so that it
was a long time before they came to the defence of this Post, whilst in the mean time five
or six of our Soldiers helping one another mounted upon the Wall; so that had we had
Ladders to reach from the top of the breach in the Wall up to the Terrass, I think fortune
would have smil'd upon us, for they say she favours the bold.</p>
            <p>In the morning I sent Captain <hi>Sarlabous</hi> to give the Duke an account of what we had
seen, for I would not go my self, being certain he was very angry. The Mareschal was still
with him, who laughing said, <hi>would you have a Breach better discover'd than by giving an
assault? This was a Gascon trick you was not aware of.</hi> The thing that most troubled the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was, that word would be sent to the King, that we had given an Assault,
and were repuls'd, otherwise he had not cared so much. His incredulity and my despite
were the loss of a great many good men. When we had brought up our Trench within
fifty paces of the Tower, one morning by break of day the Mareschal would retire to his
Tent to shift himself, and I also would do the same. Now as our approaches came nearer
to the Town, I still made my back returns a little longer, to the end that two of them
might receive a whole Company. I had evemore an opinion that the Enemy would make
a Sally upon us, but it would never sink into the Mareschal's head, for he would always
say, <hi>Would you have them such mad men as to make a Sally to lose their Soldiers, never any
men of sense did such a ridiculous thing;</hi> to which I made answer, <hi>why should they not
sally? for in the first place they are able from the walls to secure their mens retreat, on the
other side they are in the Town twelve Ensigns of Foot, four hundred Spaniards choice men
pick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> out of all the Spanish Companies, and a good Chief to head them, which is</hi> Joanne Gaye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano,
<hi>a man they esteem above all the Captains they have, and a hundred Horse besides, and
the Town would be sufficiently defended with half the forces they are within.</hi> I could not
for all this make him understand it. I know not why, for the reason of war I am sure
was on my side.</p>
            <p>This very morning I had plac'd Captain <hi>Lago</hi> the elder, and his Company in two of the
long back returns on the right hand, whom I caus'd to enter before day, that the Enemy
might not perceive them, so that it was, as a man may say, a kind of Ambuscado. The
Captains who mounted the Guard, had in charge, that in case the Enemy should make a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105656:113"/>
salley, and attaque the head of the Trenches, they should put themselves into the Field
and run to charge them in the Flank, and those at the head of the Trench had likewise
order, that in case they should attaque the returns, they should likewise leap out of the
Trench to assault them in their flank also. We had every night four German Ensigns
quarter'd there where we began our Trench, to assist us in time of need, but what Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it was that was that night upon the Guard, I cannot remember, and before the
Mareschal and I were got to the end of the Trenches, it began to be fair broad day. The
Mareschal trifled the time a little talking with a German Captain, and also to stay for a
horse, which I had sent for to lend him to pass over the bridge to his Tents, being at a
stone Cross close by the village, the horse I had lent him came, when, as my footman was
alighting,<note place="margin">A Sally of the besieged.</note> on a sudden we heard a mighty noise, and saw the Enemy fighting with our
men at the head of the Trench, and leaping headlong into the Trenches, and had it not
been for those back returns, had doubtless gain'd them from us. With them there sallied
out also fifty or threescore horse. Captain <hi>Lago</hi> did there approve himself to be a valiant
and a prudent man, for he cried to his Lieutenant in the return behind him, to run
with his Pikes charg'd full drive upon the horse, whilst he himself ran upon the Enemies
Flanck, who were disputing the head of the Trenches. Seeing this, I mounted upon the
horse, whilst the Mareschal remain'd at the Cross, spectator of the whole action, nor ever
staid till I came up to our own men who were at it pell-mell with the Enemy; who so
soon as <hi>Lago</hi> came up to them would have retir'd,<note place="margin">They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed.</note> when our people leapt out of the
Trenches, and flew upon them, and so we pursued them wounding and killing up to the
very Tower on the right hand. I then presently sent back the horse to the Mareschal,
who found Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> and all the Gentlemen that were quartered near him on
horseback coming to relieve us: but he told them there was no need, for that he had seen
all the fight, and the victory was ours. As we retir'd from the pursuit, all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of their Harquebuzeers were upon the Walls, and fir'd so round upon our retreat, that
it seem'd as if it had been only a Volley in complement to us. I was alone on horseback
in the middle of our men, and therefore let any one judge whether God did not by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
preserve me in such a showre of Harquebuz shot, considering what a fair mark they
had of me. The Captains cried out to me to gallop off, though I would never leave them,
but came along with them to the edge of the Trenches, where I alighted, and presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverd
the horse to my Lacquey to carry him to the Mareschal as I said before, and with
the rest threw my self into the Trenches, where I found a Captain and a Lieutenant of
ours left dead upon the place: I do not remember their names (for they were <hi>French,</hi>
and I was but lately come to command in the Army) with twelve or fourteen, what of
theirs and ours dead in the Trenches. And yet notwithstanding the brave Volley they
gave us from the Walls, we had not above ten men hurt; and thus their sally did not so
much endammage us by a great deal, as it did themselves.</p>
            <p>You may here Captains take a good example concerning Trenches, and the order I took
for the sally the Enemy might make, with the advantage we had by it. For never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it, the Defendants have need of men, and therefore will be loath to attempt to force
your Trenches: 'tis true if you sleep in them you will be surpriz'd. Take notice also
when you make your Trenches, to make them high and sloping, and that they have back
returns, or corners capable of lodging men; for they are as Forts to repel an Enemy. There
was now no more talk of Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> his being angry with me, the Mareschal and
he holding no other discourse all dinner time, but of the fight, and principally of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and circumspection wherewith I had proceeded, saying, that it would be a hard
thing ever to surprize me. And also in truth I walk'd whilst others slept, without fearing
either heat or cold. I was inur'd to hardship, which all young Gentlemen who will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
themselves by arms, ought to study betimes, and learn to suffer, that when they
shall wax old, it may not be altogether intollerable; but old age being once wholly come,
<hi>Goodnight Godson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within two or three nights after we brought up our Trench to the foot of the great
Tower, whereupon Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> brought his Miners to try if the Tower was to be
min'd, and therefore fell to piercing the Wall within two or three foot of the ground,
when so soon as the Enemy heard what we were about, they began to make Casemats
within the Tower, so that their Casemats answer'd to our Hole. We were three nights
about piercing the Wall; and at the same time that our Miners were picking without the
Enemy were picking within at their loop-holes. Every night Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> sent us
four Gentlemen to help us to watch, and I remember that one night Monsieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezat,</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>de Randan</hi> came to lie there. So soon as the hole was almost thorough,
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> caused a Canon to be brought me to help to pierce the Wall, for he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105656:113"/>
knew very well that the picking we heard was about Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the wall should be pierc'd through, they would shoot at us from them. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Canon was brought, the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> from the time that the Miners began to work at the Wall, caus'd a
great many Pioneers to come, and to begin a Traverse of Earth and Bavins close adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to the Tower, making them to leave a little path, at which they wrought so hard,
that as the hole was pierced, the Trave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se was also brought to perfection. The Enemy had
laid a great number of planks upon the Tower in manner of a Trench, and the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we gave the assault, going up by the little path of the Traverse, and with the help of
some Ladder, we took away the planks of their Trench from the top of the Tower, which
did us more harm than good; for when the planks were taken away, the great Platform

and it was drawn with a little cord, which so cover'd the mussel of the Canon, that
no Harquebuz shot could pierce it. After this manner we made twenty shot at this
Hole, which we broke thorough, and made so wide, that a man might easily pass thorough;
but the Canon could do no hurt to their Casemats, forasmuch as they were a little on
the right hand, and no man could approach the Hole, without being kill'd or wounded.
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> then sent me order, that I should try to lodge three or four hundred
men betwixt the Tower and the Ravelin, and that he would to that purpose send me Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions
and Pioneers. He had caus'd Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the River, which might be some seven or eight paces, and from thence our Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzeers
shot at those who appear'd upon the Courtine; our Ensigns planting themselves
all along by the wall, from the Tower to the Raveline. Those upon the Platform saw all
along by the Courtine, and ours who were by this Raveline on that side by the Hole,

               </gap>'d at them, whilst I made them shoot from behind the Mantelets. Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi>
the Father of these three daughters now living, was come thither, and stood by our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
that was at the foot of the Great Tower, and Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> was on the other
side of the River, by the Artillery. <hi>Poton Seneschal</hi> of <hi>Agenois</hi> commanded one of the
four Culverines, who made very brave shots, and did us great service, for he play'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
upon the top of the Courtine and the Platform, at those who shew'd themselves to
shoot at our people below, and this continued four or five hours at least. Monsieur <hi>de
Guise</hi> then sent to me by Monsieur <hi>de Cipierre</hi> to try if we could by any means place the
Gabions he had sent me, betwixt the wall and the Hole, but all those who presented
themselves to plant the Gabions, were either kill'd or hurt. I then bethought my self to
put a hundred or sixscore Pioneers into the water, under the bank of the River, to cast
up a Trench all along by the water side towards the <hi>Ravaline.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cipierre</hi> saw
the great difficulty and impossibility there was in executing the Dukes command, and
found Captain <hi>Bordeziere</hi> dead, and his Ensign wounded who dyed after. You could

               </gap>er'd
all to pieces with stones, so that we lay all open shooting at one another as one
shoots at a mark. I had order'd our affairs pertty well; for I had plac'd most of the
Harquebuzeers by hundreds, so that as one hundred had spent all their powder, another
hundred came to supply their rooms, and still all the danger and mischief fell where
I was; for as well the Culverines that plaid from the other side of the River, as those
men of ours that shot openly, and without shelter, kept the Enemy in such aw, that not
one durst pop up his head to shoot at our people who were under the wall below, but
plaid continually upon us, who were almost in a level right over against them. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Bourdillon</hi> then at the bidding of Monsieur <hi>de Nevers,</hi> came and caught me by
the arms behind, and hal'd me above six paces backwards, saying, <hi>What will you do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> and the Enemy will kill all those that are under the wall? for then they
will stand up at their case, and shoot plum down upon them.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> then
call'd to me also from the other side of the hole, to make me retire, which nevertheless I
would not do, but said to Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> these words, <hi>What God will do with
me this day is already determin'd, I cannot avoid it, and if this place be appointed for my
grave, it is in vain to shun my destiny,</hi> and so, without saying any more to him, return'd
back to the place from whence he had drawn me, when on a sudden I bethought my
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:105656:114"/>
self of an Enterprize, bidding Captain <hi>Volumat</hi> to take six Harquebuzeers, and two Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts,
and go place himself behind a Canton of the Wall, that remain'd of the Tower
when it was beaten down, and there trie if suddenly leaping out from behind this Wall,
he could not throw himself headlong upon the Casemats, a design grounded upon my
belief that they could not be cover'd with any thing but plancks, for they made them after
the same manner that we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> le the Hole, or else that they were totally open. But be it
how it would, I intreated him without dispute to throw himself upon them, assuring
him, that I would go make another Captain fall on by the path of the Traverse, which
lead up to the top of the Tower, and that both of them at the same time should throw
themselves headlong upon the Casemates. I then call'd to me a <hi>French</hi> Captain (I do
not remember his name) and said to him in the presence of Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> the same things I had said to Captain <hi>Volumat,</hi> and that so soon as ever
he should be up, without pawsing upon the matter, he should throw himself upon the
Casemats, desiring Monsieur <hi>de Nevers, and</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> to encourage the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to follow this Captain, whilst I went to Captain <hi>Volumat</hi> to do the same. But so
soon as ever this poor Captain thrust up his head, he was kill'd by those of the great Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and another after him, so that they fell dead betwixt the legs of Monsieur <hi>de Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon.</hi> I then cried out to Captain <hi>Volumat,</hi> being some fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
paces from one another, that the Captain who fell on by the Traverse was already
upon the top of the Tower (to beget in him an emulation, which ordinarily sharpens
the noblest courages) whereupon the said Captain <hi>Volumat</hi> start up, for before he was
kneel'd down behind the Canton, and ran up to the brink of the Wall. Now there was
another Wall betwixt the Casemats and the Corner of the Tower; so that although he
should leap into the first only, he was never the nearer; yet so it was, that this very thing
was cause of the winning of the place, for the Casemat was all open and very low; so that so
soon as ever they saw Captain <hi>Volumat</hi> upon the top, making shew as if he would leap in
betwixt the two Walls, they acquitted the Casemats, and fled away along by the Curtain
of the Wall and the Terrass, betwixt which and the Wall five or six men might march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breast,
and then a Soldier of Captain <hi>Volumats</hi> at two leaps was with me, telling me in
great haste that the Enemy had abandon'd the Casemat. Whereupon I immediately ran
up to the side of the hole, and taking the Soldier by the arm cried to him,<note place="margin">The Enemy quit the Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.</note>

it, for that he should certainly be kill'd, and thereupon struggled with all the force he
had to get away from me. My Son Captain <hi>Montluc,</hi> and those Captains I nam'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who alwayes us'd to bear me company, were behind me, at Whom I began to swear
and curse, that they did not help me to truss this Gallant, when immediately we thrust
him in with his head forwards, and made him bold in spite of his teeth, and seeing they
shot no more from the Casemats we put in two Harquebuzeers more, partly with their
consent, and partly by force, first taking from them their Flasks and their Matches, for
there was water within up to the armpits, and immediately after Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> leapt

and as Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> came to the door of the said Casemats he met with the
Enemy, who would have re-entred into it, but a Harquebuzeer of ours kill'd the Chief
of them, who was arm'd with a Mail cover'd over with green velvet, a gilt Morion upon
his head, and a damaskt Halbert in his hand. Two others were also kill'd by hand,
and then our people leapt into the Casemat, and call'd out to me thorough the hole, <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,

               </note> they took them again in their hands, and past over
throwing themselves into the Casemats, and ever after that time Monsieur <hi>de Nevers</hi> call'd
me his Captain so long as he liv'd, saying he had there serv'd under me in the quality of a
private Soldier.</p>
            <p>We had there two Captains of the Garrison of <hi>Metz</hi> called <hi>le Baron d' Anglure,</hi> and
<hi>Valon-Ville,</hi> who at my request had obtein'd leave of Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> to be at the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
with five and twenty Harquebuzeers each, whom I had all this while kept under
the Traverse, so that as yet they had not spent one shot. I call'd them, and they
were with me at a leap, and threw themselves into the hole, and their Soldiers followed
after, when as fast as they entred I made them run to the door of the Casemat, and to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:105656:115"/>
enter into it. The door was little and very low, and the Enemy durst not deliver their
shot plum down, because our men who were all along by the Wall would see them as
soon as they put up their heads, as also would those who were there where I had been:
but they tumbled down a great quantity of stones, for all which our people desisted not
from going in and out of the Casemat as occasion requir'd; and as the Soldiers of the
Baron <hi>d' Anglure</hi> and <hi>Valon-Ville</hi> entred the Casemat, I made those come out who had
gain'd it before, the place not being capable to contain above forty or fifty persons. Now
as God would have it,<note place="margin">Division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Defendants.</note> and to our great good fortune, the Defendants could not agree
amongst themselves about the defence of the Casemats; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were in

would that some of his own Company should defend them; for which he lay a long time
in prison, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would have put him to death, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> accusing
him that he had put in corrupted people purposely to lose the place. The Governor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
himself, saying, that he had seen <hi>Ioanne Gayetano</hi> and his <hi>Spaniards</hi> behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so ill, that he durst not trust them with the defence of the Casemat, and so they
accused one another; all which we knew from the Constable, and the Mareschal <hi>de St.

            <p>But to return to our Siege, Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> being vvith the Culverins, and making

Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> seeing to run after this manner, and seeing the others that were by the

mounted a bay Curtal he had ready by him, and ran full speed to pass the Bridg, gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to look that no more entred into the Tower, telling him, that he would see that
they should ply their work in the Casemats, as they also did, and so well, that in less than
half an hour all the Casemats was overturned into the water that was in the Tower, the
ruines whereof drank it all up, and then we had room enough, and every one entred that
would, and then Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> came out, as he also made the <hi>Germans</hi> to do, and
to return to their Post; and then I drew off Captain <hi>Sarlabous</hi> and all his Companions,

to pass. The Tower was taken betwixt four and five a clock in the afternoon, and we
had disputed it from ten of the clock in the morning, so that we made account the Fight lasted betwixt six and seven hours. This fight, and that of the Fort <hi>Camoglia</hi> at <hi>Sienna</hi>
were the longest, and the most dangerous wherein Battail or no Battail I have ever been; for
upon my word it was very hot, and many were left dead upon the place. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the night the Miners came, and I my self went with them to see them begin; of
all night long I never slept, because seeing them ply their work so well, I vvould not that
any thing should be vvanting, but immediately be brought them, that they might not lose a
quarter of an hour for vvant of materials; so that by break of day they had perfected tvvo
Mines, and charg'd them vvith povvder ready to be sprung, and the third they made

news. The Duke then sent away a Trumpet of his own, by whom they sent word, that
if Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> would please to send four Gentlemen to parley, they would deliver
him four others in hostage. Whereupon the Duke sent thither Monsieur <hi>de la Brosse,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> or else Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes, Esclabolle,</hi> and another, but whom
I have forgot. They capitulated to march out with what money they could carry about
them,<note place="margin">The Surrender of <hi>Thionville<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

much to trouble my self with these scrible scrawls, having enough to do to provide that
no body might be unseasonably slain during the time of the Treaty, as it oft falls out. But
the next day they marched out, and I dare boldly say, that of four parts three were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and almost all in the head, which was done when they stood up to shoot at us there,
where I had planted my Harquebuzeers; for they could not shoot at those who were under
the Wall, but they must discover themselves from the girdle upwards, and all their harm
came from those of ours who were under the Ravelin, and those that I commanded
where we shot point-blank. The same night that the Capitulation was sign'd, Monsieur
<hi>de Guise</hi> dispatched away Monsieur <hi>de la Fresne,</hi> who before he went came to take his leave
of me on horseback, asking me if I would command him any service to the King, to

               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise envy</hi>'d.</note> where there were none but rascally people to oppose him, it went
in Rhyme, though I remember nothing of it; but it must be contriv'd by the envy some
unworthy people bare to this brave and valiant Prince, for the honorable command the
King had conferr'd upon him, which I have nothing to do to treat of, neither do I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to trouble my self with such trumpery. Envy has ever reign'd upon the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were born, and will do after we are dead and gone, unless God would please to
mold us anew. There were some who were ready to burst for spite that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi>
had so good success; for there are some, and too many of such a vertuous disposition,
that they had rather see the ruine of their King and Countrey, than behold the Triumph
not only of their Enemy, but of their Friend and Companion, and if any disgrace befal
him (for men are not Gods) they laugh, rejoyce, and make an Elephant of a Gnat.
Let us leave such to swell with their own poysonous envy till they burst. In the mean
time <hi>Thionville</hi> was ours with a great deal of honor. The night before the Enemy
march'd away, Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> put Monsieur <hi>de Vielle-Ville</hi> into the City, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to enter, unless I went along with him, because he should not, he said, be master
of the Souldiers, but they would enter by force over the walls: I therefore took two or
three hundred Souldiers, and three Captains, and went in with him, he having his own
Company of <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> where we were fain to play the Centinels all night, to watch
that the Souldiers did not climb over the walls, and never slept one wink. I wonder at
what we read in the Roman Histories, of those who before the day of a pitcht Battel,
slept as profoundly, as it had been the day of their wedding. I have never, I confess
been so indifferent and inapprehensive: but on the contrary, have past three days and
nights without sleeping, or so much as having any great inclination to it. The next day
I advis'd Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> to remove his Camp from thence, for otherwise it had been
impossible to govern the Souldiers, and to speak the truth, they very well deserv'd to have
had the sack of the Town given them, for it is to discourage Souldiers, not to give them
some reward, and the least thing they gain from the Enemy gives them better contene
than four pays. But Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> would by no means permit it, saying, that the
Town must be preserv'd for his Majesties Service, being that thorough the Vicinity of this
City to <hi>Germany,</hi> he might at all times draw what forces he pleas'd from thence; and that
moreover, <hi>Iohn William</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> being to pass that way, the provisions must be
preserv'd, and so sent away the Army to encamp about half a mile from thence, and
Monsieur <hi>de Veille-Ville,</hi> with three or four Ensigns of Foot, and his own Company of
<hi>Gens d' armes</hi> was left Governor there.</p>
            <p>Here (Captains my Companions) you have an example, if you please to take notice of
it, by which you may see of what use promptitude is; this place being won by the great
haste I made, immediately upon Captain <hi>Volumat's</hi> Souldiers telling me, that the Enemy
had quitted the Casemats; I had not patience to put in above nine or ten men, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
I put in my Son the first, and after him the Gentlemen that had follow'd me at
the siege of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and at <hi>Montalsin,</hi> and it stood me upon to make haste, and to make
them go speedily to the fight; for had I stay'd till there had been as many in the Tower,
as in appearance were necessary for such a service, the Enemy had re-entred into it, and
been suddenly re-inforc'd, so that it had been impossible ever to have taken it. I have
been at many Sieges, but never without some hopes of taking the place, excepting at this;
for having discover'd and consider'd all that was to be done for the taking of it, I found
my self as far off, as Heaven is from Earth, and in plain truth the glory of it is due
to Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> alone, who was so obstinately bent upon it, that the fight lasted six
or seven hours,<note place="margin">The honor of this Victory due to the Duke of <hi>Guise.</hi>
               </note> and I do verily believe, that without the continual solicitation I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every moment from him, we had all retir'd, knowing that we might to as much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
have invaded Heaven; and we ought to believe, that through his good fortune, and
the assistance of God who would have it so, this siege was brought to a good issue, and
not by the power of men; being certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there was more Canon shot fir'd from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than we spent from without.</p>
            <p>When (Camrades) then you see an opportunity, hasten the execution, and never give
your Enemy leisure to recollect himself, take that advice from me. I have three qualities
that are not common to all, one whereof is, to be good at numbring of men, wherein I
never met with any Serjeant Major or other that surpass'd me, and provided the Enemy
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:105656:116"/>
was not divided part sloping, and part in plain, let the Body be never so great, I could
number them to fifty men, at the distance of almost a mile. The second is, to know
by an Enemies behaviour, whether or no they be in fear, either by their motion, their
order, or their manner of firing, a thing from which you may derive very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages:
So soon as ever I perceiv'd my Enemy never so little in doubt, I concluded him
presently for lost. And the third, a readiness I always had to fight them in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
whether stronger or weaker; for if you know not how to make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of your enemies fear, you can never hope to derive any from your own, and I have
ever had <hi>Alexanders</hi> device in my head, though I never wore it any where else, which
is, <hi>Defer not till to morrow what thou canst do to day;</hi> and am of opinion; that next to the
Divine assistance, all the successes I have had, have proceeded from these three things.
If you have not the judgement, seeing your opportunity, to press and solicite your men,
and without further deliberation, to fall roundly to your work, you will never perform
any thing of moment, either for your selves, or for him you serve: Fear not in a peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
leap to hazard the life of a Souldier. (There is no remedy, some must be sacrific'd
to the Publick, the world would otherwise be over peopled) provided it be in a place
from whence he cannot retire, as I did to the Souldiers I thrust into the Casemats, for
then they take courage, seeing themselves lost, and make a virtue of necessity. Had I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
then when Monsieur <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> pull'd me back by the arms, I think our enterprize
had been deferr'd till another time. I have seen such as are glad when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
after that manner to retire, especially in a place of danger, and yet will keep a great
clutter at other times. I know those men by their looks, Camrades, Friends, after
having said your <hi>in manus,</hi> never think of any thing more, but of doing well; if your
hour be come, 'tis to much purpose to hide your heads, since you must once dye, 'tis best
to dye like men of honor, and to leave a good name behind you.</p>
            <p>I lost, by the relation of the Captains, above five hundred Souldiers, kill'd and hurt,

of the Hospital the Admiral founded there, which has been the preservation of a

more willing to hazard their persons. And doubtless your own souls will one day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

and execute your passions, and if God be not merciful both to you, and to us, we
are in a sad condition. For the honor of God then, Sir, provide for your poor Souldiers,
that lose their arms and legs in your service; it is not you that gave them their limbs, but
God, and can you then do less than maintain them, when they are lam'd in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Do you think that God will not hear the Maledictions they curse us withal, who
have made them miserable all their lives? I have heard the Grand Signior has a very
good order, as to that particular, and accordingly he is the best serv'd of any P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Three days after the taking of <hi>Thionville,</hi> the Army march'd directly to <hi>Arlon,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Town, but a very near one for its circuit. 'Tis a great fault in a General to lie still
after the taking of a place, as I have known them often do. This both encourages your
Enemy, and gives your own men opportunity to steal away; whereas their honor will
oblige them to stay, when they see themselves employ'd: I mean, if the Army be not
totally broken or ruin'd, for then necessity compels you so to do: but otherwise to repose
after a Conquest, and to lose never so little time, is very prejudicial to his Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I with our foot quarter'd round about the Town, Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> lay a quarter
of a League behind, and told me he was almost moap'd for want of sleep; for that since
the beginning of the siege of <hi>Thionville</hi> till now, he had not had so much sleep in all, as
he was wont to have in one night at other times (and I had had less than he) entreating me
to make the approaches that night, that he would send me the Commissaries of the
Artillery with four pieces of Canon, to consult where they should be planted, and
that he would give the sack of this Town to the Souldiers, in recompence of that of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:105656:117"/>
               <hi>Thionville:</hi> Which having said, he re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>use, where he
was to lie.</p>
            <p>There was in the Town a hundred and fifty <hi>Germans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Forces in <hi>Arlon.</hi>
               </note> and four hundred Walloons,
the <hi>Germans</hi> kept one Gate, and the Walloons another; when (so soon as I had placed the
Centinels, and the Courts of Guard very near to one another (because it was said that
some succours would enter in that night) they within set a very good face on the matter,
which made us think that they lookt for some relief) I began to make the Esplanade by
the Gardens of the Town, to bring up the Artillery, resolving to make my Battery a little on
the left hand the Gate, to assist my self at the assault with the Ladders of a little Breach
they had made themselves, thorough which to carry up earth to the Terrass they were
making in that place; which to do they had made steps in the very earth it self, both at
the descent into the Graffe, and likewise in the ascent on the other side up to the Terrass.
I came up close to the Ditch of the Town, and to another little Ditch there was near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the way, which I caused to be discover'd by a Soldier; and I had three or four Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
with me in this little Ditch. The Soldier found the steps, by which he went down,
and afterwards mounted three or four of those that went up to the Terrass, and there
stayd without being perceiv'd: when having stayed a while he return'd to me, and told
me, that there was no Centinel upon the Terrass; so that he thought if we should throw
our selves desperately upon the Terrass we should carry the Town. Hearing this, I caused
a Court of Guard (that was much stronger than the rest, it being design'd to guard the
Artillery) to come up to me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arlon</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</note> making the Soldiers to creep on their hands and knees, and
to put themselves into the Ditch. I then made the Soldier return to the Ditch, with three
or four Harquebuzeers, and two Captains with Targets, of which Monsieur <hi>de Goas</hi> was
one. The night was so very dark, that a man could not see a step from him, and this
Soldier was a Fleming. He goes down into the Ditch, the Captains after him, and the
three or four Harquebuzeers after them; and so soon as they were in the Ditch they plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves on that side of it towards the Town, and as near as they could to the steps.
The Enemy hearing the noise began to cry <hi>who goes there?</hi> and the Soldier answer'd them
in their own language, <hi>a friend, a friend;</hi> they then demanded of him what he was, to
which he made answer, that he was a <hi>Fleming,</hi> and that being their Countryman, he very
much lamented their ruine, for that all the Artillery Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had would be
planted in battery by morning, and that they were not to trust to the <hi>Germans</hi> who were
with them in the Town, for they were assur'd to have no harm, nor the least offence from
our people, they having already made them that promise by a <hi>German</hi> Soldier, who stole out
in the close of the evening to speak with us; so that all the slaughter would fall upon them
if they did not surrender, which also would be too late after the Canon had once playd.
Upon this they sent immediately to the <hi>Germans Quarters,</hi> and found that a Soldier of
ours who spake Dutch was talking to them; so that so soon as their Messenger return'd,
this Souldier heard them all in a hurly-burly within, and began to ask them, if they
would make him drink, to which they answered they would, and bad him come up boldl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
upon their word and faith. I heard every word, for I was not above six paces from the brin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
of the Graffe, and made the other two Captains go one after another into it, and three or
four Serjeants with Halberts after them. The Soldier then mounted the steps till he came
to the edge of the Terrass, where he again spoke to them, saying that Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi>
had made fair War with those of <hi>Thionville,</hi> and would do the same by them, still amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them with fair speeches, and they fetcht him some drink. Monsieur <hi>de Goas</hi> was
just behind the Soldier, and three Harquebuzeers one after another (for they could mount
but one by one) in heels of him whom this first Soldier so shaded with his body, that
they could not see down the steps. The other Captain followed in the rear of the three
Harquebuzeers, and the Serjeants after him, insomuch that all the steps were full from
the top to the bottom; which when Monsieur <hi>de Goas</hi> saw, he pusht the Soldier that was
before him upon the Terrass, and the other Captain the other three Harquebuzeers, and
and then the Soldier began to cry <hi>goot Krich,</hi> which is to say, <hi>good Quarter, good Quarter,</hi>
the Harquebuzeers gave fire,<note place="margin">

and every body after them, and these poor people fled to their Quarters, the Soldiers
chasing them thorough the streets. I then leapt into the Ditch with the rest of my men,
mounting the Souldiers as fast as I could one after another. The <hi>Germans</hi> who saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
surpriz'd behind, at the request of the Soldier that spoke Dutch very courteously
open'd a Postern, and gave themselves up to the discretion of the Soldiers, wherein our
men did an act worthy the highest commendation, and by which they shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be old Soldiers, for there was not four men kill'd in the whole Town: but on the
contrary they themselves led our people to the houses where the best booty was to be had:

after they had drawn the Army up in Battalia; but they could not come, by reason that
part of the Cavalry, who were quarter'd a great way off, were not yet come up; and on
the other side, I had one of the best Providores in the Army. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> then
went to find out the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and his Captains, and I sent in all haste to my Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
to get all things ready. My people had made a Cellar in the earth, where the wine
and the water was as cool as ice; and by good fortune I had got a great many Partridges,
Quirles, Turkies, Leverets, and all that could be defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, wherewith to make a noble
Feast, with bak'd-meats and Tarts: for I knew that Messieurs <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> and <hi>de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannes</hi>
would not come alone, and I had a mind to entertain them very well, they being
both of them very good friends of mine. They were so well treated that Monsieur <hi>de
Guise</hi> asking the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> by his Interpreter, what he thought of the French Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and whether or no he had not treated them well, and given them good wine? the
Duke made answer, <hi>that if the King himself had treated them, he could not have done it
better, nor have given them better, nor co ler wine.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Captains spared
it not, but drank freely to our <hi>French</hi> Captains, that I had brought along with me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
though Messieurs <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> and <hi>de Tavannes</hi> had also come had I been surpriz'd,
for next to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his own Table, there was not one in the whole Army longer,
or better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urnisht than mine. A way that I have alwayes used in what command soever
I had been, being willing thereby to honor the Employments I have had from my Masters,
to encrease my expence; and have alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:105656:118"/>
and of a good family, that sometimes knows not where to dine, and knowing where a good
Table is kept, will be glad to be there, who if he follow you at your Table, will follow
you any where else, if he have never so little good blood or breeding in him. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to my Guests, so soon as they rose from Table Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> asked me, what
Laundress I had that kept my Table-linnen so white, to which I made answer, that they
were two men I had that did it; <hi>believe me,</hi> said he, <hi>you are serv'd like a Prince;</hi> and
thereupon entertain'd the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> upon that subject, speaking better things of
me than I deserv'd; whereupon I took occasion to tell him, <hi>that he would do well to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the King to give me money to buy silver Vessel, that another time, when he and the
Duke of</hi> Saxony <hi>would do me the honor to come eat in my Pavillions, I might serve them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their quality.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> told the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> what I said, who
made answer, <hi>that he would tell the King;</hi> when being about to mount to horse to
return to the Camp, word was brought that the King was upon his way from Marches,
and coming to the Camp; whereupon they two went out to meet him, and we return'd
every one to his place, all of us I assure you very well drunk, and our pates full. About
a quarter of a league from the Battalions they met the King, where his Majesty asked
them, if they had din'd, to which Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> made answer, that they had, and as
well as they had done of a year before: <hi>why,</hi> said his majesty (seeing them come from wards
the Battalions) <hi>you did not dine at</hi> Pierre-pont, <hi>no sir,</hi> said Monsieur <hi>de Guise, neither can
your Majesty guess where we din'd, nor by whom so well entertain'd; I pray by whom</hi> said the
King; <hi>Marry Sir,</hi> replyed Monsieur <hi>de Guise, by</hi> Montluc; <hi>I believe then,</hi> said the King,
<hi>he feasted you with his own Countrey diet, Garlick and Onions, and Wine as warm as milk:</hi>
whereupon Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> up and told him how I had entertain'd them, when the
King asking the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> by his Interpreter if it were true, the Duke made answer,
<hi>that if his Majesty himself had treated them,<note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> entreats silver vessel of the King for the Sieur <hi>de Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> they could not have had better meat, nor cooler
wine; and that since I was so good a fellow, his Majesty might do well to give me money to
buy Plate, nothing having been wanting but that, and that Monsieur</hi> de Guise <hi>and he had
both promised me to make that request to his Majesty in my behalf;</hi> which the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
them to do, and that since <hi>I</hi> was so honorable in my expence, he would give me
means to do it, more than hitherto he had ever done.</p>
            <p>Though this passage be not much to the purpose, yet I thought fit to insert it here, to
the end every one may know, that Avarice had never so great a dominion over me,
as to hinder me from honoring the Employments I have had from my Kings and Masters;
and I would advise you, fellow Captains, who command over a great many men, to do
the same, and never to suffer avarice to be predominant over you; the little you spend will
procure you several and considerable advantages. A Captains handsome Table invites
worthy men, especially that of a Lieutenant of the King, to which the Nobility and
Gentry repair,<note place="margin">Every one avoids an ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> either for want of commodious Quarter, or sometimes perhaps upon the account of other inconveniences, where if the said Lieutenant be miserable and narrow
soul'd, they will look upon him as a man unworthy to be follow'd. I never did so, but on
the contrary alwayes spent more than I had, and have found that it has done me more good
than harm: yet was not this my only way of spending; but I had a trick of giving Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Arms also, and oftentimes to men that were better able than my self. If the
King or the Prince you serve under know you to be of this humour, he ought also to be
open-handed to you, knowing you to be of a liberal nature, and that you reserve nothing
to your self.</p>
            <p>Now, as I was standing at the head of our Battalion, and every one of our Captains
in his place, the Prince of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> who is now Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> came up to me, together
with the Son of Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> both little boyes, and delicately handsome, having
their Governors and three or four Gentlemen attending on them. They were mounted
upon two little Pad Nags, to whom I said, <hi>Go to, little Princes, alight from your horses;
for I have been bred up in the family from whence you are descended,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> puts the first arms into the hands of the Prince of <hi>Ioinville,</hi> and the Son of the Duke of <hi>Aumale.</hi>
                  </note> which is the house of</hi>
Lorrain, <hi>where I was a Page, and I will be the first who shall lay a Pike upon your shoulders.</hi>
Upon which their Governors presently alighting, caused them also to alight: they had
little Taffata Ribbons over their shoulders, which I took off, laying each of them a Pike
upon his neck, and saying to them, <hi>I hope God will give you the grace to resemble your
Ancestors, and that I shall bring you good fortune, for being the first that has laid arms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your shoulders. They have hitherto been favourable to me, and God make you as vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
as you are handsome,<note place="margin">His speech to them.</note> and the Sons of brave and generous Fathers:</hi> And so I made them
march side by side at the head of, and before the Battalions, and return againto the same
place. Their Governors and all the Captains were so ravisht to see these pretty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
march so gracefully as they did, that there was not one who did not look upon that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105656:118"/>
action as a happy presage: But I fail'd in one, which was that of Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi> for
he dy'd presently after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet as I have been told, this little Prince was as sound within
as any child could possibly be: but I think Physicians kill Princes, with keeping too
much clutter about them in their sickness; they are men as we are, and yet they will have
them to have something particular from others. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> is yet living, and I hope
will accomplish the good fortune we that day wish'd him. The beginning is good and
hopeful, I hope the end will crown it; that so since God has been pleas'd to take one
he may remain sole Heir to that happiness, that at that time we joyntly wish'd to his
Cousin and to him. I have ever conceiv'd great hopes, from the little knowledge I have
had of this young Prince, neither was there ever Poltron of that brave Race, which is rarely
seen in a numerous Family. In brief, our Army was a very brave one, and the King was
very much pleas'd with the sight of it.</p>
            <p>A few days after, his Majesty was advertis'd, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had taken the
Field, and was marching his Army in all diligence towards the borders, which made
his Majesty doubt, that he was going to surprize either <hi>Corbie</hi> or <hi>Dourlans,</hi> or else <hi>Amiens,</hi>
never a one of which having above two Foot Companies in Garison. The night that this
news was brought, they did nothing but dispute upon the means to relieve these places,
but concluded it impossible in the end, considering that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was so far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd.
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> upon this occasion, staid that night at <hi>Marches,</hi> and sent back
Messieurs <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> and <hi>de Tavannes</hi> to <hi>Pierre-pont.</hi> It was my constant custom to go
every day to give Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> the good morrow, and thence to return back to my
Tent, not stirring of all day after from my command, neither did I use to spend much
time in Courtship. That has never been my Trade, for which both the King, the Duke
of <hi>Guise,</hi> and all the Princes of the Army, lik'd me the better, and were pleas'd to say,
that no disorder could happen on our side. The next morning I went to give the good
morrow to Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> believing that he had return'd overnight to <hi>Pierre-pont,</hi>
but at my entring into the Town, I met Messieurs <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> and <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> and
<hi>d' Estree</hi> on horseback going out, and ask'd them whither they were going; to which they
made answer, that they were returning to the Council at <hi>Marches,</hi> being that over night
they had not been able to resolve upon the means to relieve <hi>Corbie,</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
was marching in all diligence that way, and that Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieur <hi>de Guise</hi> had staid all night
at <hi>Marches.</hi> I then ask'd him how far it might be from thence to <hi>Corbie,</hi> and I think
they told me thirty Leagues or more: Whereupon I said to them, <hi>I pray gallop away full
speed, and tell the King, that it is not now a time to insist upon Councils and Consultations,
and that perhaps whilst he is in debate what to do, the Enemy is upon his march: but that
he must suddenly resolve, and that if he please, I will take seven Ensigns, and march
night and day to put my self into it: and tell him that no grass shall grow under my
feet, but that I will make such haste, that I will be there before the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>or any
part of his Army. And tell Monsieur</hi> de Guise, <hi>that I will only ask him five and twenty
Mules laden with bread, for I will carry along four Wagons of wine of the Merchants Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers
of our Regiments, to make our Souldiers eat and drink upon their march, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into either Town or Village, and that therefore he give present order to Monsieur</hi> de
Serres, <hi>speedily to send me the Mules loaden with bread. In the mean time I will run to
the Regiment, to choose out the seven Ensigns, so that at your return you shall find me ready
to depart; but you must make very great haste, and the King must suddenly resolve, for if
they do not immediately conclude, without further delay, I will not undertake it.</hi> Monsieur
<hi>de Bourdillon</hi> then began to say that the King would think it a matter of great difficulty,
that the relief could be there so soon as the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> at which I flew out into
a rage, and said swearing, <hi>I see very well, that when you come there, you will spend all
the day in disputes: but in despite of disputes and consultations, let the King but leave it to
me, and I will relieve it, or break my heart for haste.</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Estree</hi> then said, <hi>Let
us go, let us go, the King cannot but like of it,</hi> and so they spur'd away directly to
<hi>Marches,</hi> and I streight to my own Regiment. So soon as I came thither, I suddenly
made choice of my seven Ensigns, bidding them presently to take some repast, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, that without baggage they must immediately depart to perform a good piece
of Service. I gave them not half an hour to eat in, but drew them out presently into
the Field, one part of the Harquebuzeers before, and another in the rear of the Pikes. I
then took four Wagons loaden with wine, of those that had the best Horses, which I
plac'd in the head of the Captains, commanding the Waggoners to take two or three sacks
of Oats, and to throw them upon the Punchions, and a little hay: Which being done,
I ran to my own Tents, which were behind the Regiment, and fell to eat, taking the
Captains of the seven Ensigns to dinner with me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:105656:119"/>Messieurs <hi>de Tavannes, de Bourdillon</hi> and <hi>d' Estree</hi> made so good haste, that they found
the King but newly risen out of his Bed, where they presently propos'd the business to
him: Whereupon the King would have call'd all the Council, at which Monsieur <hi>d' Estree</hi>
began to curse and swear, as he told me afterwards (and he is as good at it as I) saying,
<hi>Sir,</hi> Montluc <hi>told us true, when he said you would still delay time in debates and consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whether it be to be done or no, whereas if your Majesty had resolv'd last night, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
had by this time been ten Leagues upon their way; and he says moreover, that if he have
not what he demands immediately sent him, he will not stand to his word, for the</hi> Spaniards
<hi>shall not triumph over him.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> then prosecuted the affair with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency
and vigour, and Messieurs <hi>de Bourdillon</hi> and <hi>de Tavannes</hi> did the same, when
upon the instant, without further deliberation, it was concluded, and Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi>
sent to Monsieur <hi>de Serres</hi> immediately to send the five and twenty Mules loaden with
bread. The King then sent me word by Monsieur <hi>de Broilly</hi> (a Gentleman belonging
to the Duke of <hi>Guise) that he had approv'd of my opinion, saving that he could not consent
I should go, because he had no other person to command the Regiments, in case he should be
put to the necessity of a Battel</hi> (for no body knew whether or no the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was
not coming with a resolution to present it, he making a shew of attempting great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
<hi>but that he was going to make choice of one to lead the succours, and that I should make
all things ready in the mean time.</hi> The said <hi>Broilly</hi> return'd in all haste to the King, to
tell his Majesty that he had seen the seven Ensigns drawn out into the Field ready to
march,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and that I staid for nothing but the Bread; and at the same time that <hi>Broilly</hi> was
return'd towards the King, the Mules arriv'd, and by the way he met with Captain <hi>Brueil</hi>
Governor of <hi>Rue,</hi> and Brother in Law to <hi>Salcede,</hi> who told him that the King had made
choice of him to conduct the relief to <hi>Corbie.</hi> Captain <hi>Brueil</hi> staid to eat four or five bits
only, whilst waiting for two servants he had sent for, who presently came, and so they
began to march. I accompanied them above a long League on their way, still talking to
him and the rest of the Captains, representing to them, that God had given them a fair
opportunity, which also they ought to have purchas'd at the price of half their estates,
wherein to manifest to the King the affection they bore to his service, and also to give a
testimony of their own valour, in the sight, as it were, of the King himself, who would
be ready to relieve them, and to fight a Battel rather than suffer them to be lost. I found
by their answers that they went with great chearfulness, which made me leave them, to
go through the files of the Souldiers, and to remonstrate to them, that it was their own
faults, if they did not signalize themselves for ever, that the King so long as he liv'd
would acknowledge their service, and that I had done them a great honor in choosing
out them from the rest of the Regiment, entreating them not deceive the good opinion
I had of them, and that I would deliver to the King the names of those who should best
acquit themselves of their duty, in obeying what should be impos'd upon them, after
which I made them all lift up their hands and swear, that they would march day and
night: which being done, I return'd to the van to embrace Captain <hi>Brueil,</hi> and the rest
of the Captains and Lieutenants, promising them immediately to go to the King, and to
acquaint his Majesty with the election I had made of their persons above all others of the
Regiment, for this service, and so left both Officers and Souldiers chearful, and very well
resolv'd upon this long march, saying to them at parting, <hi>Remember Fellow Souldiers, the
diligences you have formerly seen me make in both</hi> Piedmont, <hi>and in</hi> Italy (for many of them
had serv'd under me in those expeditions) <hi>and believe that upon your diligence now depend
both your lives and honors.</hi> Now being I am not of that Countrey, nor was ever there,
but at this time, I am not able to make any judgement of their diligence: but the King
and all those who were acquainted with the Countrey, said, that never Foot before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
such a prodigious march; neither did they ever enter into either Town or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
but when by day they met with a little River, they made a halt, and refresh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
two hours at most, taking a little nap and away again, but march'd continually all
night. They were out but two nights, and arriv'd by Sun-rise within a quarter of a
League of <hi>Corbie,</hi> where they met a Gentleman who was riding post to the King, to give
him notice that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Camp was just coming before the Town; and who
moreover told them, they must run full speed if they intended to get in, for that the
Cavalry already began to arrive. They then began to mend their pace, the Gentleman
returning back with them almost to the Town, that he might be able to give the
King an account that they were entred; when so soon as they came within two or three
hundred paces of the walls, the Enemies Cavalry began to appear, and our men run full
carreer to throw themselves before the gate, and upon the edges of the Graft where they
made head. The Enemy kill'd seven or eight Souldiers in the rear, who were not able
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105656:119"/>
to keep pace with the rest, and so all our people got safe into the City, without losing any
of their Mules or Waggo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, for they had made an end of all their bread and wine four
Leagues from thence, and had sent them back. I had also given them one of my six
Chests, that I had con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>v'd to carry powder in, which was drawn by three horses, and
that arriv'd at the Gates as soon as the Souldiers. There are yet living several Princes and
Lords, who were then of the Kings Council, that can bear witness whether I speak the
truth or no, especially Messieurs <hi>de Tavannes</hi> and <hi>d' Estree,</hi> who carried my deliberation
to the King.</p>
            <p>When ever (Camrades) the King or his Lieutenant shall put you upon a design, that
requires extraordinary diligence for the relieving of a place, you ought not to lose so much
as a quarter of an hour, and you had much better work your body and your legs to the
utmost of what you are able to perform, and enter into the place with safety, than walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at your case to be kill'd, and not to enter into it; wherein your selves will be the cause
of your own death, and the loss of the place; and where you might by your d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
together: and never excuse your selves upon the Souldiers, nor make the Enterprize seem
difficult unto them, but always easie; and above all things be sure to carry provision along
with you, especially bread and wine, wherewith to refresh them by the way (for as I
have said before, humane bodies are not made of iron) always speaking chearfully to them
by the way, and encouraging them to go on, representing to them the great honor they
will acquire to themselves, and the signal service they shall perform for the King, and
doubt not, but (proceeding after that manner) men will go as far and farther than horses.
I advise you to nothing that I have not often done my self,<note place="margin">Foot will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

will find in the reading my Book; for after horses are once tir'd, you shall not make them
budge a step with all the spurs you have; but men are supported by their courage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not so much time for refreshing, they eat as they go, and chear one another upon
their march. It will therefore (Fellow Captains) stick only at you; do then as I have
often done; forsake your horses, and fairly on foot at the head of your men, shew them
that you will undergo the same labour they do, by which means you will make them do
any thing you will, and your example will enflame the courages, and redouble the Forces
of the most tir'd and overspent of all the Company.</p>
            <p>Two or three days after the King mov'd with all his Army directly towards <hi>Amiens,</hi>
and in his first or second days march, arriv'd the Gentleman from the Governor of <hi>Corbie,</hi>
who found his Majesty marching his Army in the field, where he brought him news, that
Captain <hi>Brueil</hi> was entred safe into <hi>Corbie,</hi> which was a great satisfaction both to his said
Majesty,<note place="margin">News brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and the whole Army, to know that this place was secured; whereupon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
merrily said to Monsieur <hi>de Guise, Who shall be the first to tell</hi> Montluc <hi>this news?
for I for my part will not be he; Nor I neither,</hi> said <hi>Monsieur de Guise, for so soon as he
shall hear it, he will so crow, there will be no dealing with him:</hi> which they said, because
they had all of them been of opinion, that it was impossible for foot to perform so long a
a journey. The next day his Majesty was advertised, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had made
a halt a little League from <hi>Corbie,</hi> and made no shew of having any intention to besiege
that place; which made the King think, that by reason of the succours it had receiv'd,
he would make no attempt against it, and thereupon it presently came into his head, that
he would march directly to <hi>Amiens,</hi> which having no more than one or two foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies

               </note> he immediately sent away the Marquis <hi>de Villars,</hi> who is yet living,
with three hundred men at arms, to go in extreme diligence, and put himself into it,
commanding me to send away other seven Ensigns to follow after him, with all the
haste they possibly could make; which I accordingly did, and gave the charge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
them to Captain <hi>Forces,</hi> who is yet living, and being the Captains and Souldiers
had all heard what commendations both the King and all the Army had given Captain
<hi>Brueil</hi> for the haste he had made in going to relieve <hi>Corbie,</hi> they would do the same,
and arriv'd as soon as the said Marquis at <hi>Amiens;</hi> for nothing so much excites men of
our Trade, as glory, and the desire to do as well, or better, than another. Two or
three days before this his Majesty had sent three Companies also into <hi>Dourlans,</hi> and so
with all great ease provided for the safety of these three important places.</p>
            <p>So soon as the King was come to <hi>Amiens,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Army also arriv'd and

set on foot, of which the Constable and the Mareschal <hi>de S. Andre</hi> had made the first
overtures, during the time of their imprisonment in <hi>Spain;</hi> in order to which I think
there was a truce from the beginning, because nothing of action past on either side, at
least that I remember: for I fell very sick of a double Tertian Ague, which I got not by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105656:120"/>
excess of revelling and dancing, but by passing the nights without sleep, sometimes in the
cold, sometimes in the heat, always in action, and never at rest. It was well for me
that God gave me an able body, and a strong constitution; for I have put this carcass of
mine as much to the proof as any Souldier whatsoever of my time.<note place="margin">The mischiefs that ensu'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this peace.</note> After all the going to
and again, that lasted for above two months, the peace was in the end concluded, to the
great misfortune principally of the King, and generally of the whole Kingdom. This
peace being cause of the surrender of all the Countreys conquer'd, and the Conquests
made both by King <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> which were not so inconsiderable, but that they
were computed to be as much as a third part of the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> and I have read
in a Book writ in Spanish, that upon this accomodation, the King deliver'd up an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
fourscore and eighteen Fortresses wherein he kept Garison, by which I leave any
one to judge how many more were in dependance, and under the obedience of these. All
we who bear Arms may affirm with truth,<note place="margin">The praises of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second.</note> that God had given us the best King for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that ever Reign'd in this Kingdom; and as for his people, they were so affectionate
to him, that not one of them ever repin'd to lay out his substance to assist him in the
carrying on of so many Wars, as he had continually upon his hands. I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those who were the Authors of this peace, for every one must needs believe they

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to good intent, and that had they foreseen the mischiefs that ensu'd upon it, they
would never have put a hand to the work: for they were so good servants of the Kings,
and lov'd him so well, as they had good and just reason to do, that they would rather
have dy'd in Captivity than have done it; which I say, because the Constable and the
Mareschal <hi>de S. Andre</hi> were the first movers and promoters of it, who themselves have
seen the death of the King, and themselves shar'd in the mishaps that have since befallen
this miserable Kingdom, wherein they both dyed with their swords in their hands, who
otherwise might yet perhaps have been alive, by which any one may conclude, that they
did not make this peace, foreseeing the mischiefs it has since produc'd, which rightly to
comprehend, let us consider the happiness wherewith God was pleas'd to bless this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in giving it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o brave and magnanimous a King, his Kingdom rich, and his people so
affectionately obedient, that they would deny him nothing to assist him in his Conquests,
together with so many great and brave Captains, most of which had been yet alive, had
they not devour'd one another in these late civil Wars. Oh had this good King but liv'd
or this unlucky peace never been made, he would have sent the <hi>Lutherans</hi> packing into
<hi>Germany</hi> with a vengeance. As to the rest, our good Master had four Sons, all Princes
of great hope and singular expectation, and such, as from whom his Majesty in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
years, might expect the repose, and comfort of his old Age, and consider them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,
proper instruments for the execution of his high and generous designs. The other Kings
his neighbours could not boast of this, for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had one Son only, of which
never any one conceiv'd any great hopes, and he prov'd accordingly; the Kingdom of
<hi>England</hi> was in the Government of a Woman, the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> neighbour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

judge, that had not this unlucky peace been concluded, the Father or his Sons had
sway'd all <hi>Europe. Piedmont,</hi> the Nursery of brave men had been ours, by which we
had a door into <hi>Italy,</hi> and perhaps a good step into it, and we had seen all things turn'd

               </gap>urvy: Then those who have so brav'd and harassed this Kingdom, durst not have
shew'd their heads, have stirr'd, nor so much as projected or thought of what they have
executed since. But 'tis done and past, without any possible remedy, and nothing remains
to us but sorrow and affliction, for the loss of so good, and so valiant a King, and to me of
so gracious and liberal a Master, with the mishaps that have since befallen this miserable
Kingdom, well may we call it so, in comparison of what it was before, when we stil'd it
the most great and opulent Kingdom in Arms, good Captains, the obedience of the people,
and in riches, that was in the whole world.</p>
            <p>After this unhappy and unfortunate peace the King retir'd himself to <hi>Beauvais,</hi> but
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> still remain'd in the Camp to dismiss the Army. Before his Majesties
departure, I surrendred up the Commission he had made me to accept by force: Neither
ought it to appear strange, that I disputed it so long, before I would take that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon me; for I doubted well that would befal me, which afterwards did, which
was to incur the perpetual disgrace of the House of <hi>Montmorency</hi> more than that of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> not much belov'd by the House of <hi>Montmoren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
               </note> which was more nearly concern'd in the affair than the other. But there is no
remedy, a man cannot live in this world, without contracting some Enemies, unless he
were a God. I accompanied Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> as far as <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to <hi>Paris,</hi> he having first promis'd to obtain me leave to go into <hi>Gascony,</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
to cause money to be given me to defray my journey thither; for he knew very well
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:105656:120"/>
I had not one peny. Both which I am confident he would have perform'd: but so soon
as he came to <hi>Beauvais,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Kings favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> he found a new face of affairs, others having slept in betwixt
him and home, and undermined him in his credit with the King. Thus goes the world,
but it was a very sudden change, and much wondred at by those who had follow'd him
in the Conquests he had made, he having repair'd all the disasters of others, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that neither the loss of the Battel of S. <hi>Quintine,</hi> nor that of
<hi>Graveline,</hi> had reduc'd the King to such a condition, but that he had yet one or two
Armies stronger than those, having as to the rest, taken almost impregnable places. But
let them deal it out. These are things that very often fall out in the Courts of Princes,
and I wonder not that I have had my share, since far greater than I, have run the same
fortune, and will do for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Now the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had been driving on some enterprize or another in <hi>Bis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, for that he was resolv'd to execute it in his own person, having an opinion that

without any other advantages from Court, than bare promises only, and the good will of

               </gap>ed from his liberalities both to me and to others, who
deserv'd it as well, and perhaps better than I. We went then to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> where we
found that he who was entrusted to carry on this affair, and whose name was <hi>Gamure,</hi>
plaid double, and intended to have caused the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> himself to be taken; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he sent back Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> with the <hi>Legionnaries,</hi> and also the <hi>Bearnois</hi> he
had caus'd to advance thither in order to his design. I had brought with me three force
and five Gentlemen all arm'd, and bravely mounted, who were come thither for the love
they bore to me, and being return'd home to my own house, within a very few days after
came the gift the King had been pleas'd to give me of the Company of <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vacant by the death of Monsieur <hi>de la Guiche,</hi> wherein his Majesty had no little to
do, to be as good as his word, and to disengage himself from the several Traverses and
obstacles my Enemies strew'd in his way, to hinder me from having that command; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the King carried it against them all, more by anger than otherwise, he being in
the end constrained to tell them, <hi>that he had made me a promise of the first vacancy, and
would be as good as his word; and that therefore no man was to speak a word more to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi>
I made my first muster at <hi>Beaumont de Loumaigne,</hi> one <hi>la Peyrie</hi> being Muster-Master.</p>
            <p>At this time those unhappy<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Sister and Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the second.</note> Marriages were solemniz'd, and those unfortunate Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
and Tiltings held at Court. The joy whereof was very short, and lasted but a
very little space, the death of the King ensuing upon it, running against that accursed
<hi>Montgomery,</hi> who I would to God had never been born, for his whole life was nothing
but mischief, and he made as miserable an end. Being one day at <hi>Nerac,</hi> the King of

him notice of the days of Tilting, in which the King himself was to be in person, his
Majesty with the Dukes <hi>de Guise, de Ferrara,</hi> and <hi>de Nemours,</hi> being Challengers. I
shall never forget a word I said to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which also I had often heard
spoken before, <hi>That when a man thinks himself to be out of his affairs, and dreams of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but how to pass his time well, 'tis then that the greatest misfortunes befal him, and
that I fear'd the issue of this Tilting.</hi> It was now but just three days, reckoning by the
date of the Letter to the Tilting, and the next day I return'd home to my own house, and
the very night before the day of the Tilting,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc's</hi> dream.</note> as I was in my first sleep, I dream'd, that

<hi rend="margQuotes">I saw the King sitting in a chair, with his face cover'd all over with drops of blood, and
methought it was just as they paint Jesus Christ, when the Jews put the Crown of
Thorns upon his head, and that he held his hands joyn'd together, I look'd methought
earnestly upon him, and could discover no hurt he had, but only drops of blood trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down his face. I heard methought some say, he is dead, and others, he is not
dead yet, and saw the Physicians and Chirurgeons go in and out of the Chamber; and I
do believe my dream continued a great while, for when I awak'd, I found a thing I
could have never believ'd, which is, that a man can cry in his sleep; for I found my face
all blubber'd with tears, and my eyes still springing new, and was fain to let them take
their course, for I could not give over weeping of a long time after.</hi>

My wife, who
was then living, said all she could to comfort me, but all in vain, for I could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

that this is no fain'd story, for I told it them so soon as ever I awak'd. Four days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to deliver up <hi>Guienne</hi> into his hands, Rapes of Wives and Virgins, Depredations, Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the whole Countrey was ready to dye of famine; and the Chancellor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
said, that having for three days sojourned in that Province, in all those three days time
his Clerk of his Kitchin could furnish him with no more than one Pullet only, which he
spoke openly at Table, at an entertainment he made for some Presidents and Councellors;
upon which the first President took occasion to say, that notwithstanding he would find
<hi>Guienne</hi> to abound with all sorts of provisions. <hi>Yes</hi> answer'd the Chancellor, <hi>but how comes

the good wine I gave him, that he dream'd in the night I had told him, that I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up <hi>Guienne</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> Messieurs <hi>de Terride,
de Negrepelice</hi> and several others were of the plot, and that if he would be one, I would make
him the greatest man of his Race, and so went with his night-cap to tell this fine story
to Monsieur <hi>de Marchastel,</hi> who immediately dispatch'd away <hi>Rappin</hi> to Court, to carry
this news to the King, where it was believ'd for some days; for the Queen sent <hi>du Plessis</hi>
to me post, to bid me fear nothing, for that nothing was believ'd: but I had had notice of it
before, though I made no great matter of it, having so great a confidence in the Queen,
that she would not lightly be induc'd to believe any such thing. <hi>Du Plessis</hi> (who was of
the Bed-Chamber to the King) found me at <hi>Agen</hi> dancing (for we must make merry some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)

thus my Treason was found to be true. We demanded satisfaction of their Majesties,
but could never obtain any, and that's it, that nourishes so many Tale-Carriers and
Slanderers in the Kingdom, for they are never punish'd, no more than false witnesses in
the Courts of Parliament. But I hope God will one day make them all known to the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105656:121"/>
King, and make him cut off so many heads, that he will cleanse the Kingdom of this
Vermine.</p>
            <p>Though all things that have been forg'd against me have been prov'd utterly false, and
without any colour of truth, my actions as well of the past as present time, having clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifested the contrary, yet could I not nevertheless so purge my self, but that the
Queen believ'd something, or at least retain'd some jealousie of me, and I have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt it, though I believe however it was only to hinder the King from giving me any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
for the services I have perform'd for his Majesty and his Crown, which what
they have been she very well knows; and knows very well also, that I am no <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
nor have any practices either out of the Kingdom, or within it, but what point at his
Majesties service. She had no such opinion of me, when sitting upon a chest betwixt the
Cardinals of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and of <hi>Guise,</hi> she entertain'd me at <hi>Tholouse</hi> with tears in her eyes.
Her Majesty may call it to mind if she please, for though she have a great many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to trouble her head withal, she has a very good memory. It was she her self who
told me, that having received news of the loss of the Battail of <hi>Dreaux</hi> (for some brave
Cavalier had run away at the beginning, and carried this lying report) she entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
with her self, what she was best to do, and in the end took a resolution, if cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
news should be brought of this defeat, to steal away with a small Train, with the King
and the Monsieur, and try to recover <hi>Guienne</hi> by the way of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> both out of the
confidence she repos'd me (and indeed <hi>Guienne</hi> was clear and entire) as also because the
King and she might there at great ease, have call'd in succours from other places. God be
prais'd there Majesties came not thither, but this will appear better hereafter. In the mean
time, her Majesty may please to take notice, that hitherto I have not much importun'd her
with demands, neither have they much troubled themselves with finding out something
to give me, having refus'd me the County of <hi>Gaure</hi> (which is not worth above twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Livers a year) after the first troubles. Every one knows what services I did the King,
and particularly in the conservation of <hi>Guienne,</hi> not that I complain of his Majesty, for both
his Father and he have confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d more honor and advantages upon me than I deserve,
neither did I ever hope for any recompence for the services I had done, or could do, after
I was answer'd by a person who is yet living, when some friends spoke in my behalf, <hi>that
I was already too great in</hi> Guienne. Which I do confess I was, not in Riches, but in the
friendship of oll the three Estates of the Province, both for the loyalty and fidelity they
knew I had ever born to the service of the King and his Crown, as also for having ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
endeavour'd to ease the Country of Garisons, and all other Subsides, when I had
the power to do it. And I hope at the return of the Commissioners who are now come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these parts, the truth will appear. I have not corrupted them, for I would not so much
as see them, let them do their worst; and as to my estate, it is now fifty years that I have
serv'd in command, having been three times the Kings Lieutenant, thrice Camp-Master,
Governor of places, and Captain both of Horse and Foot, and yet with all these employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I could never do more than purchase three Farms, and redeem a Mill that ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong'd to my house,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> well belov'd in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
               </note> all which amount to no more than betwixt fourteen and fifteen
thousand Francks, which is all the wealth and purchases that I have ever made; and all the
Estate that I now possess could not be farm'd out to above four thousand, five hundred
Francks a year. I should have been glad that any one could have reproach'd me, that I
was too great, for the great riches the King had given me, and not for having had nothing,
but remaining poor as I am. God be praised for all, in that he has made me an honest
man, and ever maintain'd me in an integrity fit to walk with my face erect amongst men.
I fear no man upon earth, I have done nothing unworthy a man of honor, and a loyal
Subject; neither have I ever serv'd my Prince in a Vizor, or with dissimulation, for my
words and my actions have evermore gone hand in hand; neither had I ever any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or friendship with the Enemies of my King and Master, and whoever is mangy, let
him scratch a Gods name, for I neither itch within nor without, having always kept my
nails so short, that I had never any use of them: for which I praise God, and most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thank him, who has hitherto guided my life so as to preserve it from any manner of
reproach, and hope he will do me the grace, that as hitherto he has gone along with my
fortune in arms, he will also accompany my renown to my grave, so that after my death,
my Relations and Friends shall not be asham'd to have been my Kinsmen or my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and I doubt not but with this fair Robe of Fidelity and Loyalty to signalize my
self, in despite of those who have ever been envious of my success, and emulous of my honor.
So it is, that had King <hi>Henry</hi> my good Master liv'd, these misfortunes had never befaln me,
nor which is worse, the Kingdom: But I shall leave this discourse, growing perhaps into too
much passion for the death and loss of the best King that <hi>France</hi> ever had, or shall ever have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:105656:122"/>
I shall not meddle with the Factions and Rebellions that have discovered themselves
since the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, though I could say something of them, as having
liv'd in that time, and been an eye witness of many things: for I pretend not to be an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
nor to write in the method of a History, but only to give the world an account, that
I did not bear arms for nothing;<note place="margin">Why the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> has written.</note> as also that my Companions and Friends may take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by my actions, of which there are many that may be useful to them, when they
shall be engaged upon the like occasions; and moreover, that by reason of my writing, my
memory may not so soon perish: Which is all that men who live in the world, bearing arms
like men of Honor, and without reproach, ought to desire; for all the rest is nothing. I
do believe, that so long as the world shall endure, men will talk of those brave and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant

and several others, who have flourish'd since King <hi>Francis</hi> the first came to the Crown,
amongst whose better names that of <hi>Montluc</hi> may perhaps have some place: And since God
has depriv'd me of my Sons, who all dyed in the service of the Kings my Masters, the young
<hi>Montluc</hi>'s who are descended from them, shall endeavour to exceed their Grandsire. I will
therefore write nothing of the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the second, nor of the Factions at Court;
neither were they other than Sed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as having been very intimate with the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> but as I
have already said, I leave those affairs to the Historians, to finish the rest of my own life;
wherein I shall proceed to give an account of the fights in which I have been engag'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

to use not only severity, but even sometimes to be cruel.</p>

of this Religion (the nature of man being greedy of Novelty) and the worst of all, and

my Son Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> with me, whom I sent with all sorts of fair language (for I had
no more than ten or twelve horse in my company) to try to perswade them to desist.
Wherein he prevail'd so far, that he overcame the <hi>Brimonts,</hi> the principal heads of this

Magistrates of <hi>La Plume</hi> had for some disorders committed.) My son having promised
them, that if they would retire, I would cause them to be deliver'd; they took his word,
and drew off from before the Town. The next day accordingly I went to speak with the
Officers of the said City, to whom having remonstrated, that for these two Prisoners they
ought not to suffer a sedition to be set on foot, they brought them out to me, and let

               </note> who at this time in the absence of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> commanded
in <hi>Guienne,</hi> was at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he had as much work cutting out for him, as in any
other part of the Province; but I did not hear that he made any great stir, and I believe
he was very much astonisht: for my part I had command of nothing but my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
nevertheless I would once take upon me to meddle at the request of the Court Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidial,
and the Consuls of <hi>Agen,</hi> about the concern of a Minister the Magistrates had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to prison, which set the whole City in commotion one against another; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Consuls came to entreat me to come to <hi>Agen,</hi> for that otherwise the Inhabitants
would cut one anothers throats. Which I accordingly did, where, upon my coming, the
Hugonots were of themselves possest with so great a terror,<note place="margin">The Hugonots dread the name of <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> that some of them hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Cellars, and others leapt over the walls; not that I gave them any occasion so to
do, for I had as yet done them no harm; neither did I do any more now, but only take
the Minister out of a House to deliver him into the hands of Justice; but these people
have ever fear'd my name in <hi>Guienne,</hi> as they have that of Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
But how little soever the thing I did was, the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> took it so highly ill at my
hands, that he mortally ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed me for it, and writ to the King that I had dispossest him
of his Lieutenancy, entreating to know if his Majesty had given me authority so to do,
whilst in the mean time he meditated his revenge at what price soever. This hapned in
the time when King <hi>Francis</hi> was yet living: for in those times these new people began
their innovations. Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> sent me word by my Son Captain <hi>Montluc,</hi> that I
should use all the means I could to restore my self to his favour, for although the King was
satisfied with what I had done, he could not nevertheless make any shew of it, it being
requisite for him to proceed after this manner. This letter might very well have been the
cause of my ruine, for without this private advice from Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> I had never
reconciled my self to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> as having much rather have chosen to have stood
upon my Guard, and in my own defence, than to have any tampering with the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> in any thing but what should be by his Majesties command; but I conceiv'd I
could not erre in following the advice of Monsieur <hi>de Guise;</hi> for he absolutely govern'd all
things at Court.</p>
            <p>But to return to my first subject, having heard and seen all these affairs and novelties
which still much more disclosed themselves after my return, and after the death of the
King (for they now explain'd themselves in down-right Terms) than before; I delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to return to Court, no more to stir from the Queen and her Children, but to die at
their feet in opposition to all such as should present themselves against them, according to
the promise I had made to the Queen, and put my self upon my way in order to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105656:124"/>
The Court was then at <hi>St. German en l' Aye.</hi> I staid but two dayes at <hi>Paris,</hi>
and at my coming to <hi>St. Germains,</hi> found not one person of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> nor any
other, but the Queen, the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Cardinal of

would not be long before they would break into open arms.<note place="margin">The Hugonots r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> I staid there but five dayes,
in which time news came that the Hugonots were risen at <hi>Marmanda,</hi> and had kill'd all
the Religious of the Order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and burnt their Monastery: immediately came
other news of the Massacre the Catholics had made of the Hugonots at <hi>Cahors,</hi> with that of
<hi>Grenade</hi> near unto <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Fumel</hi> but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher'd by his own Tenants.</note> After that came news of the death of Monsieur <hi>de Fumel,</hi>
barbarously massacred by his own Tenants who were Hugonots; which troubled the
Queen more than all the rest, and then it was that her Majesty saw, that what I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
to her, that they would not long abstain from arms, was very true. They were
six dayes before they could resolve at which end to begin to extinguish this fire. The
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> would that the Queen should write to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to take order
in those affairs; but the Queen said, that if none but he put their hands to the work,
there would be no great matters done, by which she implied some jealousie of him; and I
know what he said to me, <hi>A little thing will serve to render us suspected.</hi> I perceiv'd also
that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was not so kind to me as formerly; which I believe proceeded
from my own behaviour, I being not so observant to him as at other times, and never stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from the Queen.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montlucs</hi> large Commission.</note> In the end they resolved to send me into <hi>Guienne</hi> with a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to raise Horse and Foot, and to fall upon all such as should appear in arms. I defended
my self the best I could from this Employment, knowing very well that it was not a work
done, but a work that was only about to begin, and such as requir'd a great Master to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it as it ought to be; and therefore remain'd at this bout constant not to take it upon me.
The next morning the Queen and the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> sent for me, and the Queen had in
the interval commanded Monsieur <hi>de V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Commission, for I would have him have his part of the Cake. But the Queen
would by no means hear of it, alledging but too many reasons (Princes may say what
they please) till in the end I was forc'd to tell her Majesty plainly, that in case he was
not comprehended in the Commission, he being the Kings Lieutenant as he was, would

gave Monsieur <hi>de Cursol</hi> for the Province of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> giving us both in charge, that which

should stand in need. Monsieur <hi>de Cursol</hi> was no more of this new Religion than I, and
without all doubt afterward turn'd to it more out of some discontent, than for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
for he was no great Divine, no more than I was: but I have known many turn

together took our leaves of the Queen and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> with us. I demanded two Counsellors of that part of <hi>France</hi> to sit
upon life and death (fearing that those of the Country would do no good, being that
some of them would encline to the Catholicks, and others to the Hugonots) and had given
me two of the damnedst Rogues in the whole Kingdom, one whereof was <hi>Compain</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
of the great Council, and the other <hi>Gerard</hi> Lieutenant to the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

demanded them; but I thought I did well in it, and so I came into <hi>Gascony</hi> in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
            <p>I found Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where I deliver'd him the Patent, and where
all the City was divided against one another, and the Parliament also, because the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
would that they might preach openly in the City, alledging that by the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at <hi>Poisey</hi> it was permitted them so to do; and the Catholicks affirm'd the countrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> and I had for a whole day together enough to do to keep them
from falling together by the ears; and thereupon agreed to raise some men, and that so
soon as our Commissioners should be come, we would march directly to <hi>Fumel,</hi> our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
expressing that we should begin thero. Now the power of raising Forces, and of
commanding them was in me, wherefore we concluded together to raise two hundred

Harquebuzeers, and a hundred<note n="*" place="margin">Light-horse.</note> Argoulets, the command of which I gave to the younger
<hi>Tilladet,</hi> the same who is now Lord of <hi>Sainctorens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had scarce been four or five days in my house <hi>Estillac,</hi>

               </note> when a Minister call'd <hi>la Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relle</hi>
came to me in the behalf of their Churches, telling me, that the Churches were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

obtain Justice against those that had Massacred their Brethren. To which I made answer,
that he might be confident all such as should appear in fault, should be certainly punish'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He then told me, that he had in Commission from the Churches to make me a handsome
present, and such a one as therewith I should have reason to be well satisfied. I told him,
that there was no need of any presents to me, forasmuch as my integrity would oblige me
to do my duty, and that for all the presents in the world, I was never to be made to do
any thing contrary to it. He then told me, that the Catholicks had declar'd, they would
never endure to have Justice executed upon them, and that therefore he had in Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from all the Churches, to present me with four thousand foot in good equipage, and
paid. This word began to put me into fury, and made me angerly demand of him, what
men, and of what Nation must those Four thousand Foot be? to which he made answer,
of this very Country,<note place="margin">The offers of the Churches.</note> and of the Churches; whereupon I ask'd him, if he had power to
present the Kings Subjects, and to put men into the Field, without the command of the
King, or the Queen, who was at this time Regent of the Kingdom, and so declar'd by
the Estates held at <hi>Orleans. O you c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at, it is to set divisions in the Kingdom, and 'tis you Ministers that are the Authors of this
godly work, under colour of the Gospel;</hi> and thereupon tell to swearing, and seizing him
by the collar, said these words, <hi>I know not Rascal, what should hinder me, that I do not my
self hang thee at this window, for I have with my own hands, strangled twenty honester men
than thou.</hi> Who then trembling, said to me, <hi>Sir I beseech you let me go to Monsieur</hi> de
Burie, <hi>for I have order from the Churches to go speak with him, and be not offended with
me, who only come to deliver a message, neither do we do it for any other end, but only to
defend our selves.</hi> Whereupon I bade him <hi>go and be hang'd to all the Devils in Hell, both
he, and all the rest of his fellow Ministers,</hi> and so he departed from me, as sufficiently
frighted as ever he was in his life. This action got me a very ill repute amongst the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
for it was no less than high Treason to touch one of them.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless a few days after came another Minister call'd <hi>Boenormant,</hi> alias <hi>la P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent in the behalf of their Churches (as he said) to entreat me to accept the present and
offer that <hi>Barelle</hi> had made me, saying, that it was not for the intention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>imagin'd, and
that without costing the King so much as a<note n="*" place="margin">A farthing English, or the fourth part of a peny, a Liard containing three Deniers, whereof twelve go to a penny.</note> Liard, I might render equal Justice both
to the one party and the other. At this I was almost ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ose all manner of patience,
and with great vehemency reproach'd him with the levying of money, and the listing of
men, but he deny'd it all. Whereupon I said to him, <hi>But what if I prove to you, that

made answer, <hi>That if it was so, it was more than he knew.</hi> Now he had a Souldier with

had shew'd him when he was in my Company; forbidding them ever again to come to

               <note place="margin">The Sedition of <hi>Agen.</hi>

me to go to <hi>Agen,</hi> and that all obedience should be paid me there; there came a Minister
also along with him, who would engage his honor to me in the business, but I did not
take that for good Security. The Seneschal proceeded with integrity, and I believe it
would have cost him his life as well as me mine, had I gone thither, for he would have
defended me the best he could; and it came so near it, that at their importunity, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to be there the next morning. But the Sieurs <hi>de la Lande</hi> and <hi>de Nort</hi> in the mean
time dispatch'd away a Messenger in private to me,<note place="margin">A plot upon the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc's</hi> life.</note> to give me warning <hi>not to come, if I had
any care of my life, for if I did, I was a dead man;</hi> which made me send them word,
that I would not pass over the River, but if they would come to a House at the Ferry, I
was content to give them the meeting there. When they saw they could not inveigle me into
their power, they consented to come to the place appointed, whither I accordingly went to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105656:125"/>
meet them with five and twenty Souldiers, whom I order'd not to stir from the water side,
and there we din'd together. After dinner we fell to debate what was best to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where I told them, <q>that in the first place, and before we proceeded to any further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
they were to content themselves with the Church, that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
them for their meetings, which was a Parish Church, and that they must quit the
Jacobins, and permit the Religious to re-enter, to perform their offices there; that they
must lay down their arms, and receive the one half of the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> Company
into their City for a Garison, and the other half should remain at <hi>Condom.</hi>
               </q> I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perswade them to condescend to this; wherefore taking the Seneschal of <hi>Agen</hi> aside,
I said to him, <hi>Do you not evidently see, that they aim at a subversion, and to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of Cities? I would not advise you to stay with these people; for you will be
necessitated, either to let them do what they will, or resolve to have your throat cut, we have
a fair example in Monsieur</hi> de Fumel: <hi>consider with your self what is best for to you do, and
so farewel:</hi> and so without any more words, I abruptly left them, and return'd to <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac,</hi>
where at my coming home I found a Farmer of mine of <hi>Puch de Gontaut</hi> call'd <hi>Labat,</hi>
who came to tell me in the behalf of their Churches, <hi>that I was too Cholerick, and had not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience

that he knew very well I had the knack on't, and therefore henceforward let neither he, nor

himself having made them a promise to be of their party, provided I did not take arms

while of the business, and when he saw he could no other way prevail with me to take their
money, he prest and advis'd me, to take it, and lend the money to the King, wherewith
to make war against them. To which I made answer,</hi> That I very well perceiv'd he did
not understand what it was to bring the reputation of an honest man in dispute: For in the
first place, <hi>said I,</hi> they will not give me this money, without first making me take an Oath not
to bear arms against them, which engagement they will have in writing to shew to their Churches,
to make them part with their money;<note place="margin">Considerations of the Sieur de <hi>Montluc</hi> upon the Proposals of Captain <hi>Sendat.</hi>
               </note> and besides, it is impossible but that this must come to
light, for fire can never be so cover'd and conceal'd, but that some smoak will issue out. The
Queen will wonder that I sit still in my own house and do nothing, she will solicite me to take
arms, which if I then refuse to do, will you not, that both she and all the world believe I
have taken money, and am a brib'd corrupted fellow? On the other side, should I give this
money to the King, his Council must needs take notice, that I have taken an Oath not to bear
arms, and yet they know, that upon my receiving the Order, I have sworn to do it, and to
defend his Person and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rown against all the world. How then can you imagine, that
either the Queen now, or the King when he grows up, can look upon me as an honest man,
when I have taken two Oaths expresly contrary to one another? Some will say, that I took
the money at first upon the account of infidelity; but that afterwards repenting, I would pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
my Knavery, by giving it to the King. Others will say, that the Queen ought no more

pray frequent these people no more, you have ever been brought up and born arms with
the <hi>Montluc</hi>'s, let me entreat you to take them up now for the service of the King, and
do not go over to that ridiculous Religion. Our Forefathers were honester men than they,
and I cannot believe that the Holy Ghost is amongst a people who rise in rebellion against

their King: Here is a hopeful beginning. <hi>He promis'd to follow my counsel, and so
departed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By my behaviour in this affair, I sufficiently manifested to all the world, that Avarice
could never make me abandon my honor, nor my conscience to falsifie the Oath I have
in the presence of God made to the King loyally, and faithfully to serve him, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Person and his Crown, and yet some have not been asham'd to accuse me of polling
from the Kings Treasury, and of imposing taxes upon the Country to enrich my self.
God and the truth are on my side, and the testimony of the Estates of <hi>Guienne,</hi> who will
make it known to all those, who have made all these false reports of me to their Majesties,
that I have never done any such thing. But letting this alone, I will return to the Justice
Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> and I did with our vertuous Commissioners <hi>Compain</hi> and <hi>Gerard,</hi> who
remain'd a long time without appearing in any place, or it being so much as known where
they were. Which made me solicite Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to let us speedily fall to our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that since our Commissioners did not come, we would make use of the Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
of <hi>Agen.</hi> Yet still we linger'd away the time in delays, whilst I had intelligence daily
brought me, that the Hugonots continued their damnable Conspiracies. There was at this
time a Lieutenant of the Tribunal of <hi>Condom,</hi> call'd <hi>du Franc,</hi> a very honest man, and a good
servant of the Kings, who was once half in mind to have gone over to this new Religion
(for he was not the Son of a good Mother, that was not one of them) this man was one
day call'd to a Council, in which there were some persons of very great quality, and where
he heard an accursed and execrable Proposition, which being once propos'd, he durst not

took no more company with me, but one Footman only, and he another, for so we had

where he told me all that had been said in the Council, and what had there been concluded,
which was such a Conspiracy, as (so God shall help me) made my hair stand an end, to
hear it. After he had ended his story, he made me the Remonstrance of an honest man,
telling me that now an occasion presented it self,<note place="margin">

and those who should descend from me for ever, which was with a couragious and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
heart to take arms, and to expose my life to all dangers, for the safeguard of
those poor children who were the sons of so good a King, and as yet in no better an age
to defend themselves, that if they were in their cradles, and that God would assist me,
seeing me take arms to protect the innocent, and those who were no way able to defend
themselves. To this, this good man added so many, and so powerful Remonstrances, that
(as I shall be sav'd) the tears came into my eyes, entreating me withal, not to discover him,
for if I should,<note place="margin">A design of the Hugonots to kill Monsieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> he was a dead man. He told me further, that as to what concern'd my
self, they had consulted about me, and determin'd to surprize me in one place or another,
and that if they could get me into their hands, they would deal worse by me, than they
had done by Monsieur <hi>de Fumel.</hi> Nothing of all their Conspiracies was conceal'd from
the said Lieutenant, because they thought him sure of their side, so dexterously did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself amongst them; but he afterwards shew'd them the contrary, several times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
his life in the City of <hi>Condom,</hi> with his Sword in his hand, in defence of the Kings
Authority: But however it came to pass, he was afterward either by poyson, or some other
violent means, dispatch'd out of the world for this very business. I thought he had never
discover'd himself but to me only, but I found that he had told the same thing to Monsieur
<hi>de Gondrin,</hi> who was a very intimate friend of his, and to Monsieur <hi>de Maillac,</hi> Receiver
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> for they were both as it were Brothers. For my part, I never open'd my lips
concerning it to any one living, but to the Queen at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> by the chimney of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
at which her Majesty was very much astonish'd, as she had very good reason to be,
for more horried and Diabolical designs were never heard of, and yet very great persons were
of the Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>Having heard all these abominable designs,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montlu's</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</note> I retir'd to my own house at <hi>Sampoy;</hi> where

determining to execute all the cruelty I could, and especially against those who spoke

me word of the day he intended to be at <hi>Clairac,</hi> that we might there together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
where we ought to begin our Circuit. He sent me also Letters the Commissioners
had writ to him, wherein they appointed us to come to <hi>Cahors,</hi> there to begin against the
Catholicks; in answer to which I writ to him back again, that he should well consider
the Patent, and that there he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Fumel.</hi> The Letters of these two honorable Gentlemen, were of so audacious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
a stile, as that by them they gave us to understand, that they were the principal
Commissioners, and that we had no authority, saving to justifie their proceedings, and to
be assisting in the execution of their Decrees.</p>
            <p>Now there was a Village two Leagues from <hi>Estillac,</hi> call'd S. <hi>Mezard,</hi> the greatest
part whereof belong'd to the Sieur <hi>de Rouillac</hi> a Gentleman of eight or ten thousand Livers
a year. Four or five days before I came thither, the Hugonots his Tenants were risen up
against him, because he offer'd to hinder them from breaking open the Church, and taking
away the Chalices, and kept him four and twenty hours besieg'd in his own house; so that
had it not been for a Brother of his call'd Monsieur <hi>de S. Aignan,</hi> and some other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
his neighbours, who came in to his relief, they had certainly cut his throat, as also
those of <hi>Ostfort</hi> would have done to the Sieurs <hi>de Cuq,</hi> and <hi>de la Montjoye,</hi> so that already

Now the said Advocate was he that fomented all the Sedition, and I had private word
sent me, that he would come that very <hi>Thursday</hi> to S. <hi>Mezard,</hi> for he had some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>state
there. I was resolv'd to begin with this fellows head, forasmuch as having advertiz'd the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> at Court, that the said <hi>Verdery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other of his Officers at <hi>Lectoure,</hi>
were the principal Incendiaries of Rebellion, and having writ as much to the Queen, of
the Kings Officers, she had writ back that I should begin with those people first, and the
King of <hi>Navarre</hi> had writ in his Letter, that if I hang'd the Kings Officers on the lower
branches of a Tree, I should hang his on the uppermost of all. But <hi>Verdery</hi> came not,
which was well for him, for if he had I had branch'd him. Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
a very long march, and came by break of day to S. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

away, there being not any one who knew the Houses, for there was not so much as any one
man at arms, or Archer who had any knowledge of the place. A Gentleman, call'd
Monsieur <hi>de Corde,</hi> who liv'd at the said place, had sent me word, that when in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Consuls he had remonstrated to them that they did ill, and that the King would

at it, and saw very well, that all this Language tended to what had been told
me by Lieutenant <hi>du Franc,</hi> which in sum, was to make another King. I had agreed

one Captain <hi>Morallet</hi> the chief Ringleader of them all, and that if he could take him,

the same day that I perform'd the execution, which was upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

presented the three Prisoners and the Deacon, all bound, in the Church-yard, in which
there was yet remaining the foot of a Cross of stone they had broken, that might be about
some too foot high. I presently call'd Monsieur <hi>de Corde</hi> and the Consuls, bidding them
upon pain of death to deliver truly, what words they heard these fellows speak against the
King. The Consuls were afraid, and durst say nothing; whereupon I told the said Sieur <hi>de

he maintain'd to their faces, that they had spoke the forementioned words, and then the
Consuls told the truth, and justified the same the Sieur <hi>de Corde</hi> had done. I had my two

to be so well whip'd by the Hangman, that, as I was told, he dyed within ten

            <p>The next day I parted from <hi>Estillac,</hi> and went to find out Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> at <hi>Clairac,</hi>
and there we fell to debate of the place where we should begin our business, whether a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

come thither, and had begun to try the Catholicks, without vouchsafing to lend an ear to
any thing whatever to the contrary. I then call'd for the Patent, where I shew'd him,
that it was the Queens intention we should begin at <hi>Fumel,</hi> which he knew not how to
contradict, shewing him moreover, that by virtue of that Patent, we were the true Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
and that <hi>Gerard</hi> and <hi>Campain</hi> were oblig'd to come to us, and not we to go to them;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lling him, that on the other side, I had been advertiz'd since my departure from Court,
that they were two of the greatest Hugonots in all the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and that we
ought to have an eye to them, and to our own reputations, that the world might not cast
a blur upon us, declaring us Hugonots; for as for my own part, I would not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>randed
with that mark: And to speak the truth, when I came to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> I thought I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
both by his carriage, and also by other advertisements had been given me, that
Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> enclin'd a little to that Religion.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> we went to <hi>Villeneufue,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>de Sanctorens</hi> with his Troop
of Light Horse, and two hundred Harquebuzeers came to meet us, bringing me along
with him Captain <hi>Mora'let,</hi> and other four, with two others that some Gentleman had
taken at S. <hi>Liurade,</hi> all which upon <hi>Tuesday,</hi> without holding them longer in suspence,
I caus'd to be hang'd, which strook a great fear into the whole party, saying, <hi>What! he
puts us to death without tryal!</hi> Now their opinion was, that in case they should be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
they must be proceeded against by witnesses, and that then there would not be
one who durst give evidence against them, for fear of their throats, and also that there was
no Judicature great nor small, but would have some of their own Religion amongst them,
who would set nothing down in writing, but what should be to their advantage, and in
order to their justification, Thus was Justice slubber'd over, without any punishment
inflicted upon them; and when they had murther'd any one, or broke Churches, these
wicked Officers (for so they may justly be called) would immediately present themselves
to take cognizance of the fact,<note place="margin">Justice corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> when the Informations being perfected, the Catholicks were
evermore found to be the beginners of the brawl <hi>(the beaten must bear the blame)</hi> and that
they themselves had broken the Churches by night, that it might be said the Hugonots had
done it. I do not think it is to be found in History, that ever such Rogueries, Cheats
and Machinations were invented or practiced in any Kingdom of the world; and had the
Queen delay'd sending me with this Commission but three months only, all the people
had been constrain'd to turn to this Religion, or have lost their lives, for every one was so
terrified with the severity that by the Judges was exercis'd upon the Catholicks, that there
was no other way left them, but either to abandon their habitations, to lose their lives, or
to turn to that party. The Ministers publickly preach'd, that if they would come over to
their Religion, they should neither pay duty to the Gentry, nor taxes to the King, but
what should be appointed by them; others preach'd, that Kings could have no power,
but what stood with the liking and consent of the people; and others, that the Gentry
were no better men than they, and in effect, when the Gentlemens Bailiffs went to demand
rent of the Tenants, they made answer, that they must shew them in the Bible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105656:127"/>
they ought to pay or no, and that if their Predecessors had been Slaves and Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs
they would be none.</p>
            <p>This insolence grew so high, that some of the Gentry began so far to give way to its
fury, as to enter into Composition with their Tenants, entreating them to let them live
in safety in their houses, and to enjoy their own Demeasns, and as to Rents and Chiefs
they would not ask th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m for any. No one was so bold as to dare to go out a hunting,

us the Law, and there was not a little Minister amongst them, who did not Lord it as if
he had been a Bishop; and these were the hopeful beginnings of this fine Religion, and
the manner after which she instructed men to live.</p>
            <p>At our departure from the said <hi>Villene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Madam <hi>de Fumel,</hi> with Monsieur <hi>de Cançon</hi> her Brother, and some other Gentlemen of
the Family, had put themselves into the field, upon the news of our being come thither, and
had taken five and twenty or thirty of those who had massacred the Sieur <hi>de Fumel.</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Burie</hi> then sent to the Commissioners to come, and to fall in hand with their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,

I had intelligence sent me by a friend, that they had said, that since I proceeded to
execution without Form or Indictment, they would make bold to bring me my self
to my tryal, after they had done with the rest, by which I saw that I was to try with
them a better or a worse; for otherwise we should fall into the greatest misfortune that
we could possibly fall into, and if we did not uphold our Authority, and keep the people
in aw of us, without suffering them to be in fear of these Commissioners, all would go on
the side of the new Religion. Neither did I fail to represent this danger to Monsieur <hi>de
Burie;</hi> but I found by his answers, that he was either in fear of doing amiss or (as I said
before) that he a little enclin'd to that side; but his end has clear'd that point to us. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore that we could not have our own Commissioners, we sent for Counsellors from
the Tribunal of <hi>Agen,</hi> who presently fell to trying these people, whom they found so
guilty,<note place="margin">The Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de <hi>Fumel.</hi> executed.</note> that they confest themselves to have been Actors in the Massacre of their Lord;

him out of the Hall to save him, for every one had his sword drawn, and he had not a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

entreated me, that I would further the execution of the Commissioners Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and that in return of so good an office, I should not fail of Ten thousand Francs.
He made me this offer in the presence of a Merchant that sold pistolers, which he
himself chose out for me, telling me, that he was privy to the affair, and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
disburse the sum. I told him, <hi>He did me a very great pleasure, but that I
would leave them in his hands, being to go to Monsieur</hi> de Burie <hi>to supper, whose lodging
was hard by.</hi> By the way as I went, I began to consider with my self from whence these
Ten thousand Francs should come; but could not possibly imagine, though I was satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there must be malice and knavery in the case. After supper, when it grew late, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
to my Lodging at the Archdeacon <hi>Redouls</hi> house, where by the way I met Madam <hi>de
Longua,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Viole</hi> hard by the house, who passionately weeping, said to me
these words, <hi>O Sir, Monsieur</hi> de Viole <hi>is going to be put to death, if you do not stand his
friend, for sentence is past upon him, and this night there is order given to strangle him in
prison, and in the morning to present him dead upon the Scaffold.</hi> All the forementioned
Lords and Gentlemen had sent away post to the King about this business, but the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had return'd too late, if I had not been. I dismist them with the best comfort I
could, telling them that I would take care to prevent execution; to which end I appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certain <hi>Gens-d' armes</hi> of my own Company to ride the Patrouille before the prison,
and before the Commissioners Lodgings, and never put off my cloths my self of all that
night. It was very late before the Archdeacon <hi>Redoul</hi> came home, vvhen so soon as I

                  <hi>de</hi> Viole and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to dye.</note> I sent for him, to talk vvith him about the business.
He had been privately enquiring after the affairs of Monsieur <hi>de Viole,</hi> and the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
who vvere all people of good quality, and brought this account, that they vvere
all condemn'd to dye, and that for fear of scandal, and that no commotion might arise,
they were to be dispatch'd secretly in prison by torch-light, and that by their Process and
Judgement, they had divided the City into three distinct Corporations, to wit, the
Church into one, the Magistracy into another, and the third Estate into the last; all which
three distinct bodies, were sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enc'd to a fine of Sixscore thousand Francks: whereupon
it presently came into my head, that the Ten thousand Francs of which <hi>la Brun</hi> had made
me a tender, was certainly to come from hence; and the said Archdeacon wept, saying, that
the City of <hi>Cahors</hi> was ruin'd for ever, and that though all the goods of the City move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and immoveable should be sold, they could not make up that sum: Whereupon I
advised him not to afflict himself, but leave it to me, for that out of the love I bore to
Monsieur <hi>de Viole</hi> and the rest, I would keep so good watch, that I would trap them
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105656:128"/>
before they could do their execution, and as to the fines you speak of, said I, it is not
the Kings intention that your City should be destroy'd, for it is his, and assure your self
he will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have some hope that his Majesty would not see us destroy'd; but he is not to have one peny of
them. Why who then,</hi> said I? <hi>'Tis the Count</hi> Rhinegrave, said he, <hi>who lent the King Fifty
thousand Francs upon the County, and we have had a tryal with the said Count about the
fines of</hi> Tholouze, <hi>where he has cast us, it being prov'd, that he had as good title to the fines

no other remedy, but to abandon the City, to go live in some other place, and leave him all we
have.</hi>

               </gap> which, I was ready to run mad, to think that these two Rogues should

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uine one of the Kings Cities, for one particular man. I past over the whole night in
great anger and impatience, and in the morning Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> sent for me to hear the
judgement of the Process; but by the way, I thought to prevent them from pronouncing
sentence, which being once pronounc'd, there was no possible way to save the City, but
that the Count <hi>Rhinegrave</hi> would have had the Fines, who though he was stranger, yet
he was one the King had very often occasion to use. In this heat I came to Monsieur <hi>de
Burie's</hi> chamber, where I found them all already set, and the bags upon the Table. They
perceiv'd very well by my countenance, what I had in my stomach, but I said nothing,
but took a little stool, and plac'd my self at the end of the Table, for they had taken up
all the room round about it, and there the said <hi>Campain</hi> in a Learned Oration, began to
lay open the offence that had beeen committed in this City, enlarging himself upon the
hainousness of the Fact, and remonstrating to us, how many women and children had lost
their husbands and their fathers in this bloody Massacre, and that the King and Queen
had sent us thither to do this Justice, which was equitable and right (his Harangue lasted
for half an hour at least) and that those offenders they had already put to death, would
signifie nothing, if they did not also execute the principal Authors of this Sedition, which
would serve for an example to the whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> concluding that therefore
they would read the sentence befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e us, to have it afterwards executed in prison, entreating
us to lend our assistance in the seeing it accordingly perform'd, and thereupon began to
draw the Sentence out of the Bag. I look'd upon Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> to see if he would
speak, for it was for him to speak before me, but seeing he suffered him to proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption, and the other beginning to open the Sentence to read it, I said to him,
<hi>Hold Monsieur</hi> de Campain, <hi>proceed no further, till you have first answer'd what I have
to demand of you.</hi> To which he made answer, <hi>That after he had read the Sentence, he
would answer my questions, but that he would first read that, before he did any thing else.</hi>
Whereupon I said to Monsieur <hi>de Bury</hi> (rapping out a great Oath) <hi>Sir, at the first word
that comes out of his mouth, I will kill him, if he do not first satisfie me in such things as I
shall in your presence demand of him.</hi> At which Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> said to him, <hi>Monsieur</hi>
de Campain, <hi>you must hear what he has to say to you, for perhaps he may have heard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that I know not of,</hi> and then I perceiv'd my Gentleman to turn pale, and upon my
word he had good reason. I then ask'd him, <hi>Whose is the City of</hi> Cahors? To which
he answered, <hi>It is the Kings. And whose is the Iudicature?</hi> said I. <hi>The Kings,</hi> said he.
<hi>And whose is the Church?</hi> said I. To which he made answer, <hi>That he could not tell.</hi>
Whereupon I said to him, <hi>Do you deny that the Church is not the Kings as well as the rest?</hi>
To which he made answer, <hi>That he did not concern himself about it.</hi> I then said to him,
<hi>Have you divided the City into three Corporations, that is to say, the Church, the Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the City separate by it self, aud impos'd fines severally upon them all?</hi> To
which he made answer, <hi>That I should give ear to the Sentence, and that would inform
me, whether he had or no.</hi> Whereupon I began to thou him, saying, <hi>Thou shalt here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
before Monsieur</hi> de Bury <hi>and me, what I demand of thee, or I will hang thee with my
own hands, for I have hang'd twenty honester men than thy self, or those who have assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at thy Sentence;</hi> and thereupon start up from my stool, at which Monsieuer <hi>de Burie</hi>
said; <hi>Speak Monsieur</hi> de Campain, <hi>and say if you have done it or no. Yes Sir,</hi> answered
he, <hi>I have:</hi> Whereupon I said, <hi>O thou damned confounded Villain, Traytor to thy King,
thou wilt ruine a City belonging to the King, for the profit of one particular man; were it not
for the respect I bear to Monsieur</hi> de Burie, <hi>who is here the Kings Lieutenant, I would
hang both thee and thy Companions at the windows of this chamber;</hi> saying to Monsieur <hi>de

of their lives. They came in the evening one after another, I mean the Judges
Assistants, to excuse themselves to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> confessing to him, that they had not
foreseen the ruine this Sentence would have inevitably have brought upon the City, which
would also have been the undoing both of them and their posterity: but they durst never
speak a word to me, nor so much as come where I was. Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> told me all,
but whatsoever the matter was, not one of them durst come in my sight; which if they had,
upon my conscience I think I should have strangled one or another of them. About five
or six days after came the Courrier that the Relations and Friends of Monsieur <hi>de Viole</hi>
had sent to the King, who brought an Injunction to the Commissioners, not to proceed
any further in any manner whatsoever against the said Sieur <hi>de Viole,</hi> nor concerning this
Sedition, commanding them to set the said Sieur <hi>de Viole,</hi>

upon Bail to appear when and so often as they should be summoned so to do. It is
not to be wondred at if the City of <hi>Cahors</hi> have a kindness for me, as indeed they have, to
such a degree, that by the respect they pay me, and the entertainments they caress me
withal, it seems, as if the King himself, or some of his Brothers were come into their
City.</p>
            <p>This was the second time that they attempted to corrupt me with money, but it shall
never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound in History, that I ever had a hand in any such dirty practices; neither do
I fear any person living, not only in <hi>Guienne,</hi> but in <hi>Italy,</hi> where I have had great and
honorable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mployments, and where I might have got Two hundred thousand Francs
at least, would I have done as others did, who had no fault found with them for it,
and have had more thanks for their labour than I have. But I can say, and say truly,
that I never return'd from any of my Employments, that I was not necessitated to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
money to carry me to my own house, and have ever been willing to beggar my self,
and to suffer all sorts of inconvenience, only to spare the Kings purse, and not to enrich
my self: Neither was I alone the sufferer, but moreover all those who were under my
Command; as for example, the Treasurer <hi>Brancher,</hi> the Comptroller <hi>la Molliers,</hi> and
others, who return'd as very Rogues as <hi>I.</hi> And if at any time any City has presented me
during these troubles, it was only to maintain the great expence I must of necessity be at
to entertain the Gentlemen and people of the Countrey, and was done openly, and not in
private. This was the end of the strange proceedings at <hi>Cahors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Monsieur <hi>de Brurie</hi> having himself seen, that these two brave Commissioners did not
go franckly to work, and that their only drift was to execute Justice upon the Catholic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

only, and not upon the Hugonots also, he sent in all haste to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for Messieur
<hi>d' Alesm</hi> the elder, and <hi>Ferron,</hi> Counsellors in the Court of Parliament, and men that
very well understood their business, that he might joyn them to these Commissioners of
ours for a Counter-poise to ballance their wicked inclinations, and so we went streight to
<hi>Ville-Franche de Rouergue,</hi> when hearing by the way, that the Hugonots from all parts,

Monsieur <hi>de Ferron</hi>'s Wife and Family were of that Religion, he nevertheless affirm'd with
Monsieur <hi>d' Alesme,</hi> that they ought to dye. The Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac</hi> and all the
Officers were despair, to see that Justice was not executed, expecting nothing but all
sorts of violence so soon as our backs should be turn'd, if some example were not made. In

put the business out of dispute, and without that there is no hope that Iustice shall be done.
Are you both of you of this opinion,</hi> said I. They answered me they were. Enough was said, I
call'd to me Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi>'s Serjeant, saying to him in their presence, <hi>Go fetch
me the Goaler hither;</hi> which he did, to whom I said, <hi>Deliver thy Prisoners to this man;
and you Serjeant, take my two Hangmen, and go hang them presently at the windows of the
Town-hall.</hi> Whereupon he immediately departed, and in less than a quarter of an hour,
we saw them hang'd at the windows. The Commissioners were furiously enrag'd at this
action, and endeavour'd to make Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> disapprove of it, which the next day
I reproach'd them with, telling them in the presence of the said Sieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Burie</hi> and I should agree well enough, in despite of all their endeavours to divide
us; <hi>And I doubt not,</hi> said I, <hi>but to make you hang your selves, before the game be done, and
that we go out of this Commission. There is a rumour that the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>has tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

arms and possest himself of the City of</hi> Orleans, <hi>which if it prove true, hope for no other,
but that I will be as good as my word.</hi> It was not two hours before <hi>Rance,</hi> the King of
<hi>Navarres</hi> Secretary arriv'd, and brought news to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> that the Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> was in arms, and had seiz'd of <hi>Orleans,</hi> telling wonders of the prodigious Forces
the said Prince had with him, in comparison of those of the King, and that the King of
of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Constable, Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> and the Mareschal de S. <hi>Andre</hi> were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who could not all raise so much as one man, with a thousand other fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m-flam stories.
Whereupon the said Sieur <hi>de Burie</hi> expresly forbad him to speak a word to any one else,
telling him it would be as much as his life was worth, should <hi>I</hi> come to hear the least whisper
of it: He sent also privately to the Commissioners to get away before the news should
be publish'd, for otherwise it would not be in his power to save them from being put to
death; and he was in the right, for I would infallibly have done their business. They
needed not to be bid twice, but immediately sneak'd away in great secrecy, so that I
know nothing of their departure till the next day, and search'd very diligently for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Rance,</hi> who had he fallen into my hands, I think I should have taught him to carry
news.</p>
            <p>Upon this untoward news, we were of opinion to go directly to <hi>Montauban,</hi>

our selves into the Town, before it revolted, for we understood that the City of <hi>Agen</hi>
was revolted, and had seiz'd upon their Catholick Officers, Consuls and Canons, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
that night went to S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> thinking the next day to enter into <hi>Montauban,</hi>
but before we were got half way, we heard that the Town was revolted, which made
us turn directly towards <hi>Ville Neufue d' Agenois,</hi> and found that all was revolted. We
then came to a Village call'd <hi>Gallapian,</hi> near unto <hi>Port</hi> S. <hi>Marie,</hi> and found that <hi>Port</hi>
S. <hi>Marie</hi> was also revolted, for those people had laid their design long before hand,
and had carried their business very close. And there we concluded, that Monsieur <hi>de
Burie</hi> with the four Companies of <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> should go put himself into <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
and that I with that of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which was at <hi>Condom,</hi> that of the Mareschal
<hi>de Termes,</hi> and my own, should pass over the <hi>Garonne</hi> towards <hi>Gascony,</hi> and keep my

For <hi>Lectoure,</hi> another strong place, was also revolted, by which means the Gentry of
<hi>Gascony</hi> had no place to retire unto for safety, but were enforc'd to fly to me; so that
they concluded among themselves, that in case I should resolve to go away to the King,
as his Majesty had commanded, and offer to leave them without a Head, that they
must be fain to detain me in the nature of a Prisoner, and not suffer me to depart. In
the Evening I assembled all these Gentlemen together, where I remonstrated to them,
that it would be necessary I should send away in all diligence to the King, to acquaint
his Majesty with the revolt of all <hi>Guienne, Tholouze,</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> excepted, which
also if they were not suddenly reliev'd, would be in great danger to be lost, as well as the

to take this resolution, for otherwise they had determin'd amongst themselves to detain
me by force. In the morning we past the River at two or three Ferries, with danger enough,
for <hi>Leyrac</hi> was revolted, as also was the whole Country of <hi>Bazadois, la Reolle</hi> excepted,
and all as far as the very Gates of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> excepting <hi>Avillar</hi> and <hi>Condom,</hi> where Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

had taken Arms to defend the Kings Authority, and got the upperhand, nevereheless in
the end he would not have been able to have kept it, without the said Company that I
sent into it. I quarter'd my own Company at <hi>la Sauvetat de Gaure,</hi> and Monsieur

                  <p>TO day about noon at this place, and by great journeys, is arriv'd a Gentleman from
Court, who having enquir'd at the Inn, if there was any one that knew you, the Host
told him that I was in the Town, and was related to you; whereupon he sent the said Host im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
for me, and so soon as I came to the house, he bad the Host go in. I then offer'd to
embrace him, but he made me a sign not to touch him; when he and I being left alone, he told
me that he was of the County of <hi>Foix,</hi> and belonging to the King of Navarre, and that at

discover'd himself to me, of which I thought fit to give you speedy notice, that if possible,
you may prevent his design. For the Reasons that Monsieur <hi>de la Rocque</hi> will write you

            <p>These were the contents of the two Letters, which having read, I took aside the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Gentleman,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Enterprize of <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
               </note> to whom having communicated the said Letters, I immediately
sent them by an express Messenger post to the first President <hi>Mansencal,</hi> and writ upon
the instant three dispatches to the three Captains <hi>Bazordan,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Clermont,</hi> and
<hi>Arne,</hi> wherein I sent them word to labour day and night to get the foot Companies I had
given them Commissions for to gather, and approach as near as they could to <hi>Tholouze,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> return'd in all diligence to make ready his Gens d'armes, and the
Sieurs <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> and <hi>de Fimarcon</hi> return'd in all haste to gather together the Gentlemen
of the Country. Now the Messenger could not get to <hi>Tholouze</hi> till it was three hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
night, so that the President was gone to bed, by which means he could not deliver his
Letters till the next morning,<note place="margin">The error of the President <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
               </note> which was the twelfth of <hi>May.</hi> And there the President
committed an Error, forasmuch as in the morning he assembled all the Chambers, and
there in the presence of them all caus'd the Letters to be publickly read: and I committed
another, having been so wise, as not to give him caution to communicate them but to few:
which was the cause that those of their Society who were of the new Religion, and also of
the plot, at their return from the Palace, gave notice to all the rest of the Conspirators,
that they must make haste to seize the Town house, and the Artillery, and not to deferre
it till the eighteenth day of the said Month: For I had also writ in my Letter, that I was
sending away in all diligence to Captain <hi>Bazordan,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Clermont,</hi> that in
raising their Companies, they should approach continually nearer and nearer towards the
said City of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> which eight days before was enter'd into great suspicion, those of
the Town seeing every day strangers that no body knew, enter into the City; and the
said Letters unluckily came just in the nick of this jealousie. I had (not as yet knowing
any thing of all this) sent away my own Company to <hi>Montjoye,</hi> near unto <hi>la Plume,</hi> and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105656:131"/>
the very next day, which was the eighteenth, being return'd to <hi>Sampoy,</hi> I receiv'd two

in one of which was, <hi>Sir, Four Ensigns of foot are arriv'd at</hi> Montauban, <hi>who come
fromwards the</hi> Sevennes, <hi>and entred about break of day, having march'd all night;</hi> and in
the other was, <hi>That a black Ensign had past over the Bridge</hi> de Buza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tholouze, <hi>wearing a white Scarf, and held the way towards</hi> Montauban. Monsieur <hi>de
Terride</hi> sending me word, that I might take both these Advertisements for certain. At the
same instant I received another Letter from the Vicar of <hi>Auch,</hi> and the Consuls of the said
City, wherein they entreated me to come in all diligence to <hi>Auch,</hi> or that otherwise they
would cut one another to pieces. I writ in the open street for haste four lines to Monsieur
<hi>de Terride,</hi> entreating him to make his Company ready, and to get together the most men
he possibly could, which having done, I mounted to horse, having Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi>
with me, and went in all haste directly to <hi>Auch,</hi> though I was neither the Kings Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
nor had any power to command, but all I did was out of the particular affection,
and good will I bore to his Majesties service, being assur'd that doing well, all would be
well interpreted by those of the Kings party, and as for the rest I did not much care, having
evermore rather have them for enemies than friends.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Sezan</hi> a league from <hi>Sampoy,</hi> there came a man to me from <hi>Tholouze,</hi> sent

others to bid them march away immediately to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> which being done, and having
sent to my own Company to return in all diligence to <hi>la Sauvetat,</hi> I gallopt away full
speed to <hi>Auch,</hi> where being arriv'd fasting at one of the clock in the afternoon, I dispatcht
two Letters as I sat at dinner, one to Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> it being no more than two
leagues from thence to his house, and the other to Captain Masses, who was within half a
league,<note place="margin">The Sieur de <hi>Montluc's</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Tholouze.</hi>
               </note> sending to Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> immediately to take post, and go put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tholouze,</hi> to command the Soldiery there, causing his great horses and arms day and
night to follow after. Monsieur <hi>de Masses,</hi> so soon as he had spoke with me immediately
departed, and never stopt nor staid till he was in <hi>Tholouze</hi> the next morning by break of
day, and Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> got thither two hours after midnight. The Baron <hi>de
Clermont</hi> entred the same morning, and at the same instant that the Soldiers entred, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell to fighting, which was from the place <hi>St. George</hi> even to the two Gates of the City that
lookt towards <hi>Montauban,</hi> which two Gates were possest by the Enemy. Captain <hi>Arne</hi>
entred about two of the clock in the afternoon, as also did Captain <hi>Bazordan</hi> at the same
time, and so soon as I had pacified them at <hi>Auch,</hi> I unbethought my self of the Letters
Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> had sent me, and concluded that those Ensigns which were come to
<hi>Montauban,</hi> were come thither for no other end, but only to to relieve their people who
were engaged at <hi>Tholouze.</hi> Whereupon I immediately dispatch't away a Soldier upon a
good Horse, commanding him to ride directly to <hi>Laudecoste,</hi> and that he should pass the
River at <hi>la Peyres,</hi> by whom I writ a Letter to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> that immediately upon
the receipt thereof he should march day and night directly to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and should make
a halt at <hi>Fronton.</hi> In like manner I dispatcht away another to Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> to pass
over his Company at <hi>Borret,</hi> sending him word also to halt at <hi>Fronton,</hi> and keep continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
on horseback day and night, and whilst he waited for Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> to take care
that such as should come from <hi>Montauban</hi> might not recover <hi>Tholouze.</hi> An hour after I
had made these two dispatches, it came into my head, that in case the Soldier could not
pass the River at <hi>la Peyre,</hi> or that he should chance to be taken, Captain <hi>Charry</hi> could not
be advertiz'd what to do, and the City by that means might be in danger to be lost, which
made me immediately dispatch away another, whom I order'd to go by the way of <hi>la

been pursu'd for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bove three leagues together. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> upon the Messengers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
immediately marcht away, causing bread and wine to be carried along with him, as
I had writ to him to do, and as he had learnt under me, that the Soldiers might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into any house by the way.<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Captain <hi>Charry.</hi>
               </note> He understood as well as any man in <hi>France,</hi> how such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences

men, arriv'd at <hi>Fronton.</hi> where he met with Monsieur <hi>de Terrides</hi> Company, and so, that
before they knew one another, they were like to have gone together by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ars. Now
as Captain <hi>Charry</hi> was got within a league of <hi>Fronton,</hi> two or three Hugonot horse belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Vicount <hi>de Bourniquel</hi> fell accidentally and undiscover'd amongst them in the
night, when understanding them to be our people, they took their way straight to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi>
and met the five Ensigns already advanc't the midway betwixt <hi>Montauban</hi> and
<hi>Fronton,</hi> and not being able to number our men by reason of the obscurity of the night,
told them, that ours were three times as many as they were, and that it was Captain <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
who commanded them; which was the reason that they return'd back again to <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban;</hi>
and I marcht away with my Company. Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er <hi>de Gondrin</hi> came to me to <hi>Faudouas,</hi>
and the next morning we advanc'd within two leagues of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> to a village called <hi>Daux,</hi>
where we stayd for the Gentlemen who were coming post after us, and where the Sieur
<hi>de Terride</hi> came not up to us till night, by reason he could no sooner get to us with his
Company. I sent word to the first President and Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> of our arrival,
and that in the morning by Sun-rise we would be with them, but that in the mean time
they should be sure to keep the Gate <hi>St. Subran</hi> free, and let them take care for nothing
else, but only that I might get in. The haste wherein I was, made me forget to write
them word, that I had sent to <hi>Fronton</hi> upon the road from <hi>Montauban</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight any relief
that might come from that side; and they having heard as well as we of the arrival of the
five Ensigns that were at <hi>Montauban,</hi> fearing they would that night enter by the two
Gates the Enemy were possessed of, were once in mind to enter into composition, and were
advanced so far towards it, that in order thereunto <hi>Rapin</hi> was deputed for the Enemy,
and Monsieur <hi>de Masses</hi> for the City; during the Treaty the skirmishes ceased for three
or four hours, and in the interim of these transactions came the Letters that I had sent to
the President, and Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> from <hi>Auch.</hi> But by fortune the President sent
his Letter to Monsieur <hi>du Masses,</hi> to the end that he might shew it them, to encline
them the more to an accommodation, so that unknown to Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> the said
Sieur <hi>de Masses,</hi> who was already parted from <hi>Rapin,</hi> having seen my letter, turn'd back
to him to shew him what I had writ, who upon the reading of it grew sodainly very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
saying to Captain <hi>Masses</hi> that they gave themselves for lost seeing I was so near
(for they had heard that their succours were return'd back to <hi>Monta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>an,</hi> though
our people knew nothing of it.) In the end they concluded to talk further of it the
next morning, but he never intended it, for at the same instant he went to prepare his
party, without giving any notice to those of the Town, in all haste to be gone, so that in
the close of the Evening they began to quit the <hi>Barricadoes</hi> they had made at the corners
of the streets, and to steal away, which our Captains perceiving began to charge them from
street to street, but they were hindred by the night from seeing their issue out of the Gates,
so that in rout and confusion they recover'd the Vines, and got away; but lost five of their
Ensigus. Now we had concluded to fight after this manner, to wit, that Messieurs <hi>de
Terride,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rout of the Hugonots.</note> and <hi>de Gondrin</hi> should march on without staying in the Town, taking my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and the Gentlemen Volunteers along with them, and plant themselves before the

as we began to march an hour before day, there came to us a Capitoul of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> called
Maistre <hi>Dourdes,</hi> who brought me a letter from the President, and Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi>
wherein they sent me word of the departure and slight of the Enemy; for which I was

               </gap>tle, that the City was not sackt by our own people,
so: asmuch as so soon as ever the neighbouring Inhabitants heard that the City was reliev'd,
they all came running both Peasants and others to the spoil; neither would they be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with plundering the houses of the Hugonots only, but began to fall on upon those of
the Catholicks also, insomuch that the very house of President <hi>Paulo</hi> himself had like to
have been sackt, through a rumour that within it there was a Student a Kinsman of his
who was a Hugonot, though nevertheless there was no such person found; so that I was
forc't to run thither, and to remedy the disorder to cause Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> his Company,
and my own to mount to horse, the half of which continually from six hours to six hours
marcht arm'd, and mounted by six and six together up and down the streets of the City.</p>
            <p>The third day I had word brought me, that Monsieur <hi>de St. Paul</hi> of the County of
<hi>Foix</hi> was upon arrival, being come from the said <hi>Foix</hi> with three or four thousand
men, and Monsieur <hi>de Lamezan</hi> of <hi>Comenge</hi> with seven or eight hundred more, who
had they entred, it had been impossible both for me and all the rest of us who were
within to have saved the City from being sackt; to prevent which I sent in all haste to the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls to shut their Gates, and all night long we kept continually on horse-back in the
streets, and had the foot Companies upon Guard at the Gates, together with the whole
City in arms, after the same manner as before, when they had been in continual fight.
All this while Captain <hi>Charry</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Terrides</hi> Company never stirred from the
two Villages betwixt <hi>Fronton</hi> and <hi>Tholouze.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de St. Paul</hi> quarter'd himself and
his people in the Suburbs, and Monsieur <hi>de Lamezan</hi> also, very much displeased that they
might not be permitted to enter the City, threatning that another time they would not
come to relieve them, though their relief now did more harm then good, considering
that they came not when they ought to have come. The next day I sent out Monsieur
<hi>de Bellegarde</hi> to tell them, that they did but lose time in staying there, for they should
not enter, whereupon Monsieur <hi>de St. Paul</hi> return'd with his people, and Monsieur <hi>de
Lamezan</hi> sent away his, entring himself and his servants only. After this the Capitouls
and I concluded together to drive out all those who were come in from the neighbouring
places, and accordingly with the Trumpets of the City, and our Drums, Proclamation
was made for all strangers to depart, so that in the end we were absolute Masters of the
City. Nevertheless it was not possible so to govern our own people, but that there was
still some disorder, which made me send all the horse and foot out of the City, surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the whole power into the hands of the Magistrates. I gave a Company to Captain

            <p>Captains my Companions, consider I beseech you how narrowly this great and opulent
City, the second in <hi>France,</hi> escap'd being ruin'd and destroy'd for ever. There lives a
Gentleman at the Gates of <hi>Montauban,</hi> called Monsieur <hi>de la Serre,</hi> whose house was

then take notice of the great and extraordinary diligence I used, beginning from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
I had of the Capitouls promise to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to put the City into his
hands, and next the haste I made the Captains to make in compleating their Companies,
which were not half full, to put themselves into the City: then the diligence of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

diligence wherewith I caus'd notice to be given to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> and my foresight in
sending another M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssenger after the former, to bid Monsieur <hi>de Terrides</hi> Company cross
the River at <hi>Borret,</hi> besides my diligence wherewith I advertiz'd Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin</hi>
and others, all which was done in three dayes and three nights. Wherefore if you will
take notice of this ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mple, and retein it, it will serve you to so good use, that you will
never lose an hours time; and although I have writ in the beginning of my Book (and
as some may think with vanity enough) that my diligences and ready foresights have
procur'd me the reputation God has given me in point of a Soldier, as great as other men;
yet it is evidently true in this as well as upon other occasions: for had I fail'd but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
the City had been absolutely lost. You ought not then disdain to learn of me, who
am at this day the oldest Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain in <hi>France,</hi> and whom God has blest with as many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
as any man whatever of my time: but you ought to avoid learning of those who
have been continually beaten, and have eternally run away where ever they have
been engag'd; for if you go to school to such Masters you will hardly ever come to
be any great Doctors in Arms. If I had stood long considering, and consum'd the
time in consultations, to be satisfied whether before I intermeddled with these affairs, I
should not first send to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> who was the Kings Lieutenant, I leave you
to judge whether or no the Hugonots had not had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficient leisure wherein to do their
work. But whenever they heard of me, they presently fancied the Hangman at their
Breech; as also they ordinarily call'd me the Tyrant. When ever you shall be in place
to do a notable piece of service, never stay for a command if the occasion be pressing; for
in the mean time you lose your opportunity, therefore fall back fall edge try your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
it will afterwards be well interpreted. I know there are some who think it strange
that the City of <hi>Tholouze</hi> had so great a respect and kindness for me; but should they
have other, they would degenerate from all good nature; for they will confess that I
sav'd the City together with their lives and estates, and the honor of their wives, which
without my resolute and speedy succour had all been lost. Upon which account I hope
they will never be ungrateful to me, for the good office I did them upon this occasion:
and if any one will say, that what I did was all for the service of the King, I shall answer
to that, that at that time I had no Employment from his Majesty, excepting the command
of my own Company of <hi>Gens d'armes;</hi> for Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was the Kings Lieutenant
in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the Constable in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Yet shall I not deny, but that I was prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it out of an honest desire I have ever had to do my King service, and that not only
out of respect to the obligation I have to my Countreys preservation, but also out of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
affection I have ever had for his Majesties service; and moreover, out of the love and
friendship I have ever born, and do still bear to this famous City. For the dispair I was
in to see it in danger to be ruin'd, made me take the pains I did: It is not then to be
wondred at,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tholouze</hi> no friend to the Hugonots.</note> if this City have an animosity against those of this new Religion, for there
is not a City in <hi>France,</hi> who has run so great a haza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as this City has done, nor that has
ever manifested it self more affectionate to the King and his service, or stood sharper brunts
to maintain themselves in his Majesties obedience. <hi>Rouen</hi> suffer'd it self to be taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
striking a blow, <hi>Lyons, Bourges</hi> and <hi>Poicti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs</hi> did the same. <hi>Paris</hi> was never reduc'd
to that extremity, being also another kind of thing than the rest. <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> made no
defence at all, that being no other than a surprize they would make upon <hi>Chasteau Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pette,</hi>
which they also made themselves sure of, forasmuch as Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> was at
the same time at the Gates of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> We may all therefore confess with truth, that
no City whatever has fought so well, and run so great a hazard as this, having bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd
the Hugonots after they had seiz'd of the Magazine, and were possest of the gates, by
which they might introduce succours from <hi>Montauban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was then advis'd to go before <hi>Montauban,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Enterprize of <hi>Montauban.</hi>
               </note> but it was more to draw the Souldiers from

                  </gap>,</hi> and out of the City, and to live upon the Enemies Country, than out
of any hopes I had to take it; for I knew very well there were a great many men within it,
that were there assembled for the enterprize of <hi>Tholouze.</hi> I then march'd thither, having
no more than six Ensigns of Foot, which were those of Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens, de Bazor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
the Baron of <hi>Clermont, Arne</hi> and <hi>Charry;</hi> to which those of <hi>Tholouze</hi> gave me two
pieces of Canon, and one Culverine, bestowing moreover a civility upon the Souldiers,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105656:133"/>
they gave them one pay. So soon as I was come before <hi>Montaub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> I found that there was in
the Town two and twenty hundred Souldiers strangers, and a th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>usand or twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Townsmen, all very well arm'd. I might have about eight or nine hundred in all,
the most of which had never been in arms before; for all the good old Souldiers were gone
over to the Hugonots, after the unfortunate peace, and that upon meer necessity, for they
had no Trades, the Wars having continued long, and they having been all that while em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other of the Kings conquests. The godly Ministers promis'd them
not only riches, but as I have been told, even Paradice it self, as if they had kept the
Keys; and another inconvenience this peace brought after it was, that we had lain long
idle, without having any employment wherein to make good Souldiers. So that when I
came before <hi>Montauban,</hi> I was constrain'd to quarter all my Foot together in the Bourg <hi>de
l' Evesche,</hi> for to have separated them had been madness, the Enemy making so great sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
upon me, that they continually beat up my Foot to my body of <hi>Gens d' armes,</hi> without
which they had been stronger than I, and would have cut me to pieces: for for one that
I had they came out ten, so that the second day I was constrained to leave the <hi>Evesche,</hi> to
go relieve Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> whom I had left in the Suburbs on that side the Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Moissac,</hi> to whom I had given Monsieur <hi>de Bazordans</hi> Company, where I found
that the Enemy had beaten him out of the Bourg to a Brick-kill hard by, which made me
speak to the Souldiers to run full drive to recover the Bourg, and to charge them bravely,
so that being come running in so grat haste, and going on immediately to the charge, I had
no body with me but Captain <hi>Cabarret,</hi> who is yet living, M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beat them back, laying on in their rear, to the very wicket of the Gate of the City, most
of them not being able to get in, but were forc'd to take on the left hand directly to the
Bridge, and the others on the right, so that had the great Gate been open, we might have

thick with Harquebuzeers, and two horses were shot in our coming off, of those of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Terride</hi>'s Company, who had follow'd after us. The third day I took a resolution
to retire, for the <hi>Gens'd arms</hi> were no longer able to guard the Foot; and on the other side,
though I had made a Battery, I had not da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'d to give the assault to so many as they were
within, with so few as I had without. Wherefore I sent back the Artillery to <hi>Tholouze,</hi>
and the Captains to the places to which they desir'd to go to make an end of filling up their
Companies compleat. Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> went to <hi>Beaumont de Lomaigne,</hi> and the
places adjacent to his house, for the Enemy had quitted <hi>Beaumont</hi> so soon as they perceiv'd
us to approach. I repast the River at <hi>Moissac</hi> with the Mareschal <hi>de Termes</hi> his Company,
my own and that of Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> of Harquebuzeers both on horseback, and on
Foot, which I always kept about me for my Guard. I sent Captain <hi>Charry</hi> to <hi>Puymirol,</hi>
to compleat his two Companies, and to make War upon those who kept <hi>Agen;</hi> and so
soon as I had past the River on the side of <hi>Gascony,</hi> I sent back the Mareschal <hi>de Termes</hi> his
Company towards <hi>Auch,</hi> to keep that Quarter in aw, and Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin</hi> into <hi>Armag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi>
with the Gentry he had brought along with him, to see that nothing revolted there.</p>
            <p>Now I had left Captain <hi>Arne</hi> at <hi>Condom,</hi> to hold that Countrey in subjection, who
might have about fourscore Launces in his Company, and I had intelligence that Messieurs
<hi>de Duras</hi> and <hi>de Caumont</hi> held a consultation at <hi>Agen,</hi> and that Monsieur <hi>de Caumont</hi> would
come at night to lie at <hi>la Passage:</hi> Which having heard, I sent a man to Captain <hi>Arne</hi>
that he should not fail two hours after midnight to be at <hi>Astfort,</hi> and that he should not
enter the Town, but stay for me in Battalia till I came, which he accordingly did. And
as I was going away in the evening, Monsieur <hi>de S. Paul,</hi> to whose house I was retir'd
near unto <hi>Donac,</hi> asking me whether I was going, I told him in his ear, that I was going
to carry a clean shirt to Monsieur <hi>de Caumont</hi> at <hi>la Passage;</hi> whereupon he told and assur'd
me, that he was gone the day before, after they had concluded of their affairs, and given
Commissions to Captains to raise more men; which was the reason that I staid to give our
horses, and Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> his Company a little repose. But as this enterprize
fail'd, another presented it self; for the same morning that I would have given a Camisado
to Monsieur <hi>de Caumont,</hi> Six hundred men were come out of <hi>Nerac,</hi> to go give another
Camisado to Captain <hi>Molia,</hi> who had put himself into <hi>Franciscas</hi> with threescore or
fourscore men, and the people of the Town, and those of <hi>Nerac,</hi> had taken four hundred
Corslets out of the King of <hi>Navarres</hi> Magazine, and at break of day gave three assaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
one immediately after another, but were always repulst. By misfortune I staid there till
night, for had I gone away in the evening, as I had done but for what Monsieur <hi>de
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105656:133"/>
S. Paul</hi> told me concerning Monsieur <hi>de Caumont,</hi> I had come time enough to have fought
the six hundred men of <hi>Nerac.</hi> And there my diligence once fail'd me.</p>
            <p>By break of day Captain <hi>Arne</hi> and I met, and march'd together streight to <hi>Moyracs,</hi>
because he told me he had intelligence that this very morning those of <hi>Nerac</hi> would
come out, and had taken all the arms in the Castle, but he knew not whither they
were to go; so that yet we had met them, had it not been that Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi>
would needs stay to skirmish those of <hi>Layrac,</hi> who were come out a great way towards
the Vines, so that it cost me an hours time before I could get him away, because he had a
mind to have charg'd them up to the very gates of the City, could he have tempted them
out of the Vines; and when we came to <hi>Moiracs,</hi> we heard that the enemy was before
<hi>Franciscas,</hi> which made us put on to a good round trot, to hasten thither, sending six light
horse before to discover where they were, who sent me word that above an hour before,
they were retreated to <hi>Nerac,</hi> by reason they had had notice of Captain <hi>Arnes</hi> departure by
night from <hi>Condom;</hi> for they had heard nothing of me. I sent to the <hi>Avant</hi>-Coureurs
still to go on, and that I would follow after; which they did, and at last discover'd them
half a quarter of a League from <hi>Nerac,</hi> we still at a long trot following after, but in vain,
for they got safe into the Town. I had a great mind to have been fingering those arms, to
arm our new rais'd and naked men.</p>
            <p>This was the naughty beginning of our War in <hi>Guienne,</hi> wherein the Hugonots took
us at unawares, and unprovided; so that it is a miraculous thing how this Country could
save it self, considering the secret intelligences the Rebels had in all the Cities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince:
but they shew'd themselves Novices, and indeed they were guided by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
only: if before they had made so many Surprizes, they had attempted <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and
<hi>Tholouze,</hi> they had not fail'd of carrying the one or the other, and possibly both; but we
were already upon our Guards, and God preserv'd those two Forts, the Bulwarks of
<hi>Guienne,</hi> to save all the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st. I very much broke their designs, by sending people every
where, and never resting long in a place, for by so doing, a Kings Lieutenant shall hold
all the world in suspence, because they cannot guess at his design, every one imagining that
he is coming upon him; whereas should he always lie still in one Quarter, he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
against all accidents, nor come in time, where there is immediate and pressing need;
and also your being se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tled in one place, gives a great advantage to your Enemy, who by
that means has his arms at liberty to do what he will; but I was not only my self in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
motion, but also with Letters and Messages was perpetually soliciting and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Friends we had. Believe me, you who have the honor to be Governors of
Provinces, it is a very good thing, and of great utility to your Prince, to keep a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
by Letters with those you know have never so little interest in the Country, and
I am certain, that had I not done so, the greatest part would have sided with these new
people, who have made all this fine work in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Soon after Captain <hi>Cosseil</hi> return'd with Letters from the King and Queen, wherein
they commanded me to stay in <hi>Guienne,</hi> there to do them the best service I could, for the
conservation of the Country, recommending to me the care of their affairs, in more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
expressions than I could any way deserve: By which I discern'd their Majesties were
in great anxiety, especially the Queen, who writ me a very pitiful Letter. The great ones
sometimes, when it pleases God, have need of the small, they must now and then be put
in mind, that they are men and women as the rest of the world are; for if all should go
as they would have it, they would not so much regard those that do them service, as

were some people who defended the place; whereupon I presently went thither, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
Captain <hi>Bardachin,</hi> that with a hundred of his Musketeers, he should go and
set fire to the gates, and give an assault, which he did, and we carried the place, when as
we were entring, there came an Alarm from <hi>Fougarolles,</hi> that the Enemy were fighting with
the Companies of Messieurs <hi>de Termes,</hi> and <hi>de Saint Salvy;</hi> whereupon I left the Castle,
and ran to <hi>Fougarolles,</hi> sending to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> who was quarter'd with his men close
by me, (I never suffer'd him to be very far off, for if it came to striking, he would always
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105656:134"/>
give the first blow) that he should advance with his men to come to the fight. I had
some Gentlemen with me, and but a few, forasmuch as they durst not as yet declare,
seeing the Enemy to have the upper hand, and amongst others the Governor <hi>de la Mothe-Rouge</hi>
Captain <hi>Poy,</hi> and fifteen or twenty others. I gave Captain <hi>Bardachin</hi> order to
make the Soldiers give over the sack, and follow after me as fast as he could, but he left
the charge thereof to his Lieutenant, and went along with me, with five or six horse more
of his.</p>

so soon as I came thither, I found Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> his Company in Battalia by the
Bourg, and that of Monsieur <hi>de Saint Salvy</hi> also close by one another. The Enemy were
at the other end of the Bourg, who saw us coming, and began to face about and retire.
Whereupon I bid Captain <hi>Masses</hi> take ten of his Launces, and that the rest should quarter
themselves with the Company of Monsieur <hi>de Saint Salvy,</hi> for we had made a long march

<hi>Charry</hi> also came up to me with five or six horse, and the rest were coming after as fast as
they could, for I put my self in the Rear of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Close by the Village on that side towards <hi>Nerac</hi> there is an ascent, and when we were
at the foot of the Hill, they were in the middle, and upon the top, and there they fac'd
about: I had no great mind to fight, because my design was to relieve <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and
therefore was unwilling to engage, fearing some disaster might happen, and that then I
could not relieve the City. Nevertheless seeing them upon the top of the Hill I followed
after, and when I came to the top, saw them in the great High-way betwixt two Copses
marching softly on, and in very good order, this Captain <hi>Douazan,</hi> with four or five horse,
and ten or twelve Harquebuzeers, bringing up the Rear. We might be in all with the ten
Launces some five and fifty horse good and bad: I made the Harquebuzeers alight, and to
put themselves in their Rear, whereupon I perceiv'd them to make a little more haste
than before, which made me cry to the Governor <hi>la Mothe Rouge,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Saincto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> and the rest of the Gentlemen, <hi>follow them close, for upon my life
these people are afraid, I see it by their march, they have a long retreat to make, and I will
second you with Captain</hi> Masses. Captain <hi>Bardachin</hi> then sent to his Musque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they should run as fast as ever they could, and we had not march'd after this manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

them, and our Harquebuzeers began to make a little more haste; when seeing their
horse pass thorough the files of the foot, to recover the Van (which was because <hi>Doua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans</hi>

horse gain'd the Front of their own people, either with intention to make them face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
and fight, or else they ran away for fear: <hi>But I rather think,</hi> said <hi>I, it is for fear,
for their foot also begin to mend their pace, let us charge them, but first let Captain</hi> Masses
<hi>come up to us,</hi> who might be about some two hundred paces behind, to whom I sent that
he should gallop away: but as soon as ever they saw our people coming upon the gallop,

let us fall on, for they are afraid,</hi> which we did, and without resistance charg'd them
through and through over the very bellies of them. Their horse fled full speed towards
<hi>Nerac,</hi> and the foot like cowardly rascals crept into the Copses, and squat in the ditches,
where our Musketteers sought them in the Woods, and shot at them as they shoot at
Birds. Part of those who escap'd threw themselves into the River <hi>Baise</hi> where some were
drown'd, the rest past through the Woods, and recover'd the Vines. We were so few
that we were not enow to kill them all: for in those times there was no talk of Prisoners,
and had the King paid his Companies,<note place="margin">The Ransoms of Prisoners maintain the Warre.</note> I should not have suffered Ransoms to have been
in use in this quarrel, which have only serv'd to maintain the War. But neither Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'arms
nor Soldier were paid, and therefore it could not possibly be avoided, though
indeed there were not many. It is not in this case as in a forreign War, where men fight
for love and honor; but in a Civil War, we must either be master or man, being we live
as it were all under a roof; and that's the reason why we must proceed with rigour and
cruelty, otherwise the temptation of gain is such, that men would rather desire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation,
than the end of a War. But to return to our Runaways, the Alarm ran
quite thorough our Camp, so that all of them came powdring in both Horse and Foot,

Monsieur <hi>de Courré,</hi> who at his return to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> had taken the rest of Monsieur <hi>de

Accordingly I began to pass the River, and by noon had got over all the Foot, and in a

over the rest of the men. He had caused four field-pieces to be made ready, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

to solicite Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to advance, who seeing them make so little hast, and
knowing that I was gone to attaque the Enemy (as I had sent him word) he took three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
light horse that he had of his own, and leaving the other Captains to wait upon
Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> and to guard the Artillery, came away after me.</p>
            <p>So soon as I came within sight of <hi>Targon,</hi> which is a Village (as I think belonging to
Monsieur <hi>de Candalle)</hi> Messieurs <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> and <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> went on before, where
at some scatter'd houses, they fell upon the Enemies Quarters, and kill'd fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
men, by reason whereof the Alarm in their Camp was so great, as made them draw
all their Foot into Battalia in a great field, and their Cavalry all along by a little River
there is in that place, whom I could not discover by reason of a Wood betwixt them and
me, and they were also in a Valley. The field where their Foot was drawn up, was a
little more advanc'd than the River, and when Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> fell into their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it might be about seven of the clock in the morning, after which they never stir'd
from this field where they were first drawn up. I was upon a little Eminence at three or
four houses that were there, from whence I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de Burie</hi> to entreat him to make haste, for that I was at the head of the Enemy, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was near at hand. The Count <hi>de Candalle</hi> who was then very young, and full
of spirit, came to me to this place, with ten or twelve Gentlemen in company with him,
and amongst others the Sieur <hi>de Seignan,</hi> who had been a Captain of Foot with me in
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> at which time we call'd him Captain <hi>Montlaur,</hi> who also brought
two of his Sons along with him, all three very brave Gentlemen. There the Count told
me of the promise the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> had compell'd him to make, without which
he could not have escap'd out of her hands; in answer to which I merrily told him, <hi>that
I would cause the Bishop of Bourdeaux to absolve him from that Engagement, neither could
that promise any way bind him, forasmuch as he was not a prisoner of Warre, and besides,
it was made to the Queen of</hi> Navarre, <hi>who profest her self to be a most humble servant of
the Kings, and very passionate for his Majesties service.</hi>

and brought me word, that they could not be past over the River till after noon, and
that the Company of Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> only was already landed on this side. I had
sent back all our Horse to <hi>la Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hedge, with the bridles in our hands. The Enemy saw me, and I saw them, and our
men having got some victuals came back to me, just as the Enemy began to remove and
to take the way directly towards me. We observ'd that they march'd off by Companies,
by which we very well understood, that they meant to take some other way than to
come to us, and thereupon fell to consult whether we should fight them, or no. In which
Consultation the greatest part of the Company said, <q>That in case we should fight them,
we should put all <hi>Gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was better to stay for Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> than commit such an error, which would
neither be approved of by the King,<note place="margin">Dispute about the fight.</note> nor by any other person whatever. Whereupon
I granted them that what they said was very true: but that nevertheless we saw all the
Gentry in <hi>Guienne</hi> in fear, and though it be true, said I, that you are not here above
thirty Gentlmen, yet the whole Country is possest with so great a terror, that they dare
not rise against them to assist us, which when they shall hear, that we came to face them
without daring to fight, will be so augmented, that in eight dayes time we shall have
all the whole Country against us; therefore fall back, fall edge, it is my opinion, that
we ought rather to hazard the losing our selves by fighting, than by avoiding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
which is equally pernicious, especially considering that all things are in the hands
of God. I have already tasted these people, where I have had the fortune to meet them,
and have found them men of very little resolution; believe me they will never stand
us, and we shall certainly rout them; neither ought we to have come so near if we had
not intended to fight; and moreover you see that they are about to steal off, and to
escape away. As to what concerns our overthrow, should it so fall out, <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
will notwithstanding be in no more danger to be lost for that, Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> being
there, and a Court of Parliament to defend it.</q> Monsieur <hi>de Seignan</hi> then being the
oldest in the Company answered, and said, <hi>that it was very true, we should have all the
Country infallibly upon us, and therefore seeing we were reduc't to this necessity, and that
there was no hope of Monsieur</hi> de Burie's <hi>coming up to us,<note place="margin">The fight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd upon.</note> we ought to fight,</hi> whereupon
they all in general began to cry, <hi>let us fight, let us fight;</hi> when as we were mounting to
horse, the Mareschal <hi>de Termes</hi> his Quarter-master, called <hi>Moncorneil,</hi> came up to us,
and told me, that their Company having been on horseback from the beginning of the
night, they had been necessitated to stay, and bait at <hi>Seuve,</hi> at which news I was almost
fit to despair. The two foot Companies were marching as fast as they could; but it was so
excessively hot that we scorcht as we stood, however <hi>Moncorneil</hi> seeing us going to fight,
gallop't away to <hi>la Seuve</hi> to make Captain <hi>Masses</hi> mount to horse.</p>
            <p>We then marcht on the left hand of the Enemy, when being come within two Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuze
shot of them, I divided my horse into two Troops: we might in all be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a hundred and sixscore Light-horse; for I had not above thirty Launces in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
it having been that of Monsieur <hi>de la Guiche,</hi> and the Soldiers being almost all gone
home to their own houses, excepting a very few, and I could not supply their places with
others.<note place="margin">The order of the Fight.</note> The Enemy still by little and little mounted this Hill, sending most of their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

down into the Copse below, which was there very thick, and to come to them
we were to march thorough a great high-way enclos'd on both sides with Vines. I made
Captain <hi>Charry</hi> follow in their Rear, and gave one of my Troops to my Son Captain <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi>
and <hi>Fontenilles</hi> with the Cornet of Guidons, and kept to my self the other Cornet of
Gens-d'armes, which was carried by Monsieur <hi>de Berdusan</hi> the Seneschal of <hi>Bazadois.</hi>
When we came to the Vines I saw we could not pass them to come to fight, and therefore
took on the left hand under the Vineyards. Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> was about two hundred
paces before me, who seeing us take on the left hand, they marcht on by the higher way
before us, and when we were got clear of the Vines, and some ditches that were there,
we saw Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> still making on to gain the top of the Hill, to whom I then
joyn'd Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> with his Harquebuzeers on horseback, and kept with me

Though being we had no Foot to do execution (for every one knows, that Horse do not
stay to kill, but pursue the victory) there was not many men slain, yet though their
loss was not very great, the reputation of the Victory was of as great advantage to us, as
the shame of the defeat was prejudicial to them, and every one on our side began to take
heart, as they, and those of their Religion began to lose it; bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that were wounded died after of their wounds.<note place="margin">The Enemy retires.</note> From the top of this Hill we discover'd

was not a horse of mine to be found to remount me; so that had an hundred horse only

had such a malice to me above all others.</p>
            <p>This was the Engagement of <hi>Targon,</hi> which was very shameful for the Hugonots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that they suffered themselves to be beaten by a handful of men; and as we were
returning back, the two Foot Companies arriv'd, who all day had run as fast as they
could, and were ready to faint with excessive heat. Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> his Company,
though they came at a good round trot, yet could they not possibly come up in time, for
before <hi>Moncorneil</hi> could get to <hi>Seuve,</hi> which was a long league from the place where he
left us, and they mount to horse and march another league and a half, which they must
do to the place where we were, we had done our business, at which they were all very
much concern'd, especially Captain <hi>Masses:</hi> I never saw man in so furious a passion, so
that I was fain to ent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where we found Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> who was but just come, and yet it was betwixt
four and five a clock in the afternoon. He was glad to hear of our Victory, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
had made all the haste he could; but he was old, and old men cannot be so diligent
as young. We cannot have it twice, I know it by my self.</p>
            <p>We here concluded that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> should return to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to bring from
thence three pieces of Canon, with which to go and batter <hi>Montsegur,</hi> and the other
places the Enemy held upon the River of <hi>Garonne,</hi> to clear the River, that provisions
might come into <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for they were in a manner reduc't to famine, and carry

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105656:137"/>
to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> that we were to run a dangerous fortune, and that therefore it
would be convenient for him to take the Castle of <hi>Blanquefort,</hi> which belonged to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Duras,</hi> and was his habitation, and retreat, and that in the mean time I would
go seize upon the Castle of <hi>Caumont,</hi> which we did, and I garrison'd <hi>Caumont</hi> by the way.
A thing that Monsieur <hi>de Caumont</hi> was by no means pleased withal, being afraid that I
would make pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as I made it evidently appear; for though there were in it goods to the value of above
an hundred thousand Francs, yet did he not lose the worth of one single penny, saving
that the Count <hi>de Candalle,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> took some Chaple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Warden of the Castle, and those with a receipt and an obligation to make them good.
And yet if I would I might have taken all the goods in the house, and it had been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

a Sally upon our people coming from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where Captain <hi>Sendat</hi> had his horse

Enemy.</p>
            <p>At the same time we had intelligence brought us that the Enemy had abandoned <hi>Bazas,</hi>

since. Both I and mine have ever been most faithful servants to her and her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but it was then when the Kings interest was not in question.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> being come to <hi>Reolle</hi> with the Canon, we went to besiege <hi>Montsegur,</hi>
and lay one night at <hi>Sauveterre,</hi> where I took fifteen or sixteen whom I hang'd every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son, without the expence of paper or ink, or without vouchsafing to hear them
speak; for these people would promise mighty matters, which they never intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Now in <hi>Monsegur</hi> there was betwixt seven and eight hundred men. The Town
is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le, but fortified with walls as good as good can be, and of a very advantageous situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
We besieg'd it on that side by the Tannery, where they drest their Leather. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Burie</hi> quarter'd himself in the Houses before the Gate which looks towards <hi>la Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetat,</hi>
where there are great Towers, and I hard by him. Monsieur <hi>d' Ortobie</hi> and <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
Commissaries of the Artillery would needs go view the Town in open day, where
we wanted for no Harquebuz shot, and after the discovery had been made, we concluded
to attaque it by the said Tannery. There was on that side a Gate of the Town, which
they had lately covered with a Wall, and had let down the Portcullice, which the Wall
cover'd, and within had cast up a Rampire of earth and rubbish. I made the approches
by night, and lodg'd <hi>Bardachins</hi> Company in the Tannery. We let Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi>
take his rest, and presently after midnight our Artillery was planted upon a little Emmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
overagainst, and within a hundred and fifty paces of the said Gate. Against the
opinion of the said Commissaries I would try to see what was behind this Wall that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Gate, and to that end caused some Fagots to be set on fire hard by the Gate; by
the light whereof I caused five or six Canon shot to be made at the said Gate, which beat
down all this new Wall; whereupon I sent Captain <hi>Bardachins</hi> Ensign all alone to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the place.</p>
            <p>The Tannery was betwixt the Artillery and the Gate, and betwixt the Gate and the
said Tannery there was a great Walnut Tree, behind which Captain <hi>Bardachin</hi> and I
planted our selves, it being no more than five or six paces from the Gate, where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
came and brought us word that the thing we saw that look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> white was the Portcullice.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105656:137"/>
We thereupon made him to return back again, and to climb up the Portcullice; which
he did, and at his return told us, that over the top of the Portcullice he had perceiv'd
a Terrass within, but that it was but low, and a man might pass betwixt the Arch of
the Gate and the Portcullice, creeping upon his belly. The Enemy could not see him, by
reason of the fire, but we could who stood behind the Tree, and yet they made above
twenty Harquebuz shot. I then sent in all haste to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> to bring all the
Companies without beat of drum, or making any noise, whom so soon as they came I
made to squat close upon their bellies behind the Artillerie, bidding Monsieur <hi>d' Ortobie</hi>
begin to shoot, though it was not yet day, and try to make a Battery hard by the Gate;
when so soon as he had made two volleys, I sent away the said <hi>Bardachins</hi> Ensigne called
Captain <hi>Vines,</hi> who had a Target upon his arm, a Morion upon his head, and a Coat of
Mail with sleeves of the same; and after him two Harquebuzeers without Morions, who
all went creeping with their bellies almost to the ground. Captain <hi>Vines</hi> began to mount
the Portcullice, and <hi>Bardachin</hi> and I were again advanc't behind the Tree. The dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the day began to appear, and Monsieur <hi>d' Ortobie</hi> still continued firing at the Wall,
and the Enemy advanced to entrench behind the Battery, which was on one side of the
Gate, taking no heed at all to the Gate it self, as not suspecting the Wall which cover'd
it was beaten down.<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Vines</hi> enters the first into <hi>Montsegur.</hi>
               </note> So soon as Captain <hi>Vines</hi> was got to the top of the Portcullice he
gave his Target to one of the Harquebuzeers, and mounted upon the Rampire, after
which taking his Target again, he drew in first one of the Harquebuzeers, and then the
other, when seeing three to be got in, taking the advantage of the Thunder of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
I ran to the Tannery, making <hi>Bardachins</hi> Harquebuzeers one after another to
march straight up to the Walnut Tree, and again my self return'd immediately behind it.
At the next Volley I made <hi>Bardachin</hi> approach the Portcullice, having a Target and a
Morion, and the Harquebuzeers one after another concealing their matches, when so soon
as <hi>Bardachin</hi> had got five or six men about him he mounted the Portcullice where at the
top his Ensign drew him in, and the Harquebuzeers one after another as they came: and
still as the Harquebuzeers came behind the Tree I made them slip in, when seeing there was
already twenty got into the Town, I my self drew up to the Portcullice. They within
entred into a little Chamber of the Tower, to which there was two little doors, which
open'd upon two pair of stone stairs on the right hand, and on the left, by which they
went up and down on the inside of the Town to the said Tower. In the mean time I
still put in more men, one after another, till <hi>Bardachin</hi> sent me word, that he began to
be strong enough to be Master of the Tower, and that he was not as yet discover'd.
Whereupon I sent to Captain <hi>Charry</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Clermont,</hi> that they should rise
and come running all along a high-way there was that came directly up to the Gate;
which they did, but before they could come up <hi>Bardachin</hi> was discover'd, where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fight, and to defend the stairs. Immediately upon which came the Ensigns of
Captain <hi>Charry</hi> and <hi>Clermont,</hi> and mounted with all their men after them. The Enemy
made good those stairs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Montsegur</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by assault.</note> but our people gain'd the top of the Tower, by the help of a little
hand ladder they met withal, and were Masters of the inside of the Gate, when the
Captains on the right and left ran desperately down the stairs, and came to dispute it
hand to hand in the Streets. The Enemy once repuls'd our men, but in the end being
overpower'd by numbers they retir'd, the Assailants falling in pell mell amongst them, till
they came to the Market-place, where they found three hundred men in Battalia, who
made head and disputed it for a time, but in the end were put to rout, and fled every
man to shift for himself. I sent an account of all to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> but he had heard
of it before, and he must needs know also by the Harquebuz shot that they were fighting;
whereupon he sent some Gens-d'armes about the Town; but they could do nothing there.
I took fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>score or a hundred Soldiers, and with them marcht round the Walls, so that
as many as leapt over were dispatcht. The slaughter continued till ten of the clock, or after,
because they were fain to ferret them out of the houses, and there was not above fifteen or
twenty taken prisoners, whom we presently hang'd up, and amongst the rest all the Kings
Officers, and the Consuls with their hoods about their necks. There was no talking of
Ransoms unless for the Hangmen. The Captain who commanded there, was called Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Heraud,</hi> who had formerly been of my Company at <hi>Montcallier,</hi> as brave a Soldier
as any was in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and was taken alive. There were many who would fain have
sav'd him for his valour, but I said, that if he should escape here he would make head
against us at every Village, for I very well knew his courage, which made me hang him.
Nevertheless he still thought I would save him, because I knew him to be valiant: but
that made me the rather put him to death; for I was very well assur'd that he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
return to our side, as knowing him to be a stubborn obstinate fellow, and moreover

and found them to be above seven hundred, all the Streets and the Walls were cover'd
over with dead bodies, and yet I am sure a great many died without, of those who leapt
over the Walls, whom I caused to be slain.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Montsegur</hi> taken; but I believe it would have been a hard dispute, had we
been put to have entred by the breach we were about to make, and yet it would have cost
us above five hundred Canon shot before we could have made a Gap wide enough for
two men to enter a breast only: for the Walls were built of admirable good stone, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
thick, as strong as any whatever in the whole Province; and withal it had been
a matter of great difficulty to enter, though the breach had been never so sufficient, they
having means to entrench themselves within, and I do believe they would have found us
work, and it would have been a Mart of honor both for them and us; but it was better
as it was.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, we went to besiege the Town and Castle of <hi>Duras,</hi> in which there was
a hundred and fifty men. All night long I never rested to lodge the Artillery to batter the
Town; for to batter the Castle was a thing of extraordinary difficulty, unless on that side
of the Garden behind it, and there also it was very hard to bring up the Artillery: which
made us conclude, that it was better to attaque the Town, and afterwards from within
to batter the Gate of the Castle; when so soon as I had made all things ready, they call'd
to us to know if Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was there, to which they were answered, that he was
quarter'd at the Farms two or three Harquebuz shot distant from the Town: but that I
was at the Artillery; whereupon they desir'd to know if I would give them leave to come

had left there, intending to have carried them to their Camp, but that he was afraid of
being snapt by the way. We caused them to be divided amongst the Captains to arm the
Soldiers; and from thence Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> went to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and I with the Army
marched down tovvards <hi>Marmanda</hi> and <hi>Thoneins.</hi> Every one quitted the places they held

before the said Town, because there were three or four thousand men in <hi>Agen,</hi> and I
would go to environ them to trap them within it. Having then reimbarkt the three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

in the Front of it, for we could batter it in no other place, it being very strong both in
structure and situation; and there we made above three hundred Canon shot. They had
here a great Terrass cast up within, and in the Terrass had made a Trench where the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
lay to defend the Breach, which also was of very difficult access, because we were to
mount by ladders from the Breach up to the Terrass. Novv vve had the first night taken
the Town, for Captain <hi>Charry</hi> and his Companions had set fire to the Gates, which the
besieged having long and bravely defended in vain, they all retir'd into the Castle. They
might be within it about three hundred men; and I went to discover the Breach by the
Houses on the right hand, which I caused to be pierc'd thorough, passing from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the way betwixt them; from whence I perceived an out-jut of stone at the flanck on the
right hand in the Wall, and sent a Soldier creeping on all four to discover this place.
He went up the half-way, and found that it was made, as if they had purposely left steps
to go up by in that place; which having done, he came back to me, and upon his report
I went immediately to Monsieur <hi>d' Ortoble,</hi> where we drew a piece of Canon a little on the
right hand this place. We had enough to do to lodg it there, by reason that it was a
very great Precipice that went down to the River; and from thence we shot side-wayes at
this Wall, which being not very strong, was in four shots pierc'd quite thorough, so that
one might see thorough the hole into their Trenches; whereupon I immediately went
down,<note place="margin">The Breac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> discover'd.</note> and made the same Soldier climb up by those steps so far as to discover if the hole
was over against the Trench, bidding him in no wise to discover himself; which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did, and brought me word, that they stood all in Battalia in the Trench, and
that there was a great number of Corslets, as it was true. I then caused the Ladders to
be brought, which I had made to be sought for in every place, and which might be some
twelve or fifteen in all. Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was with the Artillery, whither I went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Assault before him, entreating him that the <hi>Gascons</hi> might go on first, and the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> after: but Don <hi>Lewis</hi> desir'd they might fall on together, which was also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the mean time I made choice of four Harquebuzeers to mount these steps, for
more could not stand upon the top to shoot thorough the hole into the Trench, when ours
should give the assault to the Front of the Castle, and so I committed to them the assault.
The Soldiers themselves took the Ladders, and I went to the forementioned steps with my
four Harquebuzeers, when as the one were rearing their Ladders, the four went up by
the steps, and at the same instant that the <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Gascon</hi> Foot mounted the Ladder,
the four Harquebuzeers fir'd into the Trench. They kill'd one of them, who tumbled
down dead at my feet, and I sent up another in his room: but when the Enemy saw
themselves kill'd thorough this hole,<note place="margin">The Assailan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> repulsed.</note> they retir'd into another Fortress, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themselves above three long hours, and twice repuls'd our people to the very Breach.
Where I perceiv'd two things, though I had very well observ'd them before, the one that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not more valiant than the <hi>Gascons;</hi> and the other, that the brisk di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
are alwayes made by the Gentlemen, for above five hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gascons</hi>
were overturn'd either upon the Ladders, or down to the ground, yet must we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
those of their due honor, who worthily atchieved it; for though the <hi>Gascon</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and the Gentlemen of their Companies, all day bore the brunt of the fight, I will
not say but that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Captains very bravely behav'd themselves, but in truth their
Soldiers did very little. In the end I encourag'd our people, making them again to mount
the Ladders, encouraging some, and threatning others, for I had my sword drawn in my
hand, ready to have given them a cast of my Office, had I perceived any Pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rons. But
they all now began to do better both <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gascons,</hi> insomuch that they gain'd
the second Fort. The Enemy then divided themselves into two other Forts, namely the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:105656:140"/>
great Tower, and another quarter of the house on the left hand. Now we were to go up
a pair of stone steps into a base Court, betwixt the said Tower and the other Fort, so that
our people were constrain'd to set fire to the Gate of the said Base-Court. On the top of
these steps, and close by the Gate there was a corner on the left hand, where fifteen o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sixteen men had room to stand. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Clermont</hi> were in this
place encouraging the men to shoot thorough the Gate into the Base-Court, and so soon as
the Gate was burnt it fell down just in the Passage. I was upon the middle of the steps,
when seeing the Gate fall'n down,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Charry</hi> leaps thorough the fire.</note> I call'd to Captain <hi>Charry,</hi> that they should leap in
thorough the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which they did without disputing the business, a man needed not to bid
him twice, he fear'd not death. I pusht forwards those who were upon the steps before
me, whether they would or no, and so we all entred in fury, but found no body in the
Base-Court save Women and Maids, of which it was all full, even to the very Stables.
Those of the Tower of the other Fort on the left hand shot at us in the Court, and kill'd
five or six Soldiers. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> was there a little hurt, and the Sieur <hi>de Bardachin</hi>
also. We made the Women go down by those stone steps, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were
at the foot of the stairs in the great Base-Court below, kill'd them saying they were Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans
disguis'd. We redoubled the assault upon this Fort on the left hand both by a
door, and by two windows that went into it, which we carried, putting all we found
within it to the Sword. Now we were afterwards to assault the great Tower, and the
Gate that was between. I there left the Captains who were not hurt in this Fort on the
left had, and in the Stables to keep them penn'd in, and as fortune would have it, they
had all their provisions in this Fort on the left hand, and none at all in the great Tower;
and that was the reason that in the close of the Evening they surrendred themselves to the
Captains upon Quarter for lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were lodg'd in the Town, who knew they
were surrendred, and that in the morning our Captains were to bring them to Monsieur
<hi>de Burie</hi> and me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were quarter'd in the House of Monsieur <hi>de Cathus</hi> a Harquebuz
shot from the Castle. Monsieur <hi>de Pons</hi> lay there also, being come with Monsieur <hi>de Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
and so soon as the Prisoners came, who might be forty or fifty in number, we deliver'd
them to fifteen or twenty Soldiers in guard; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came and took them from
those fifteen or twenty Soldiers, and kill'd them all excepting two servants of Madam <hi>la
Mareschalle de St. Andre,</hi> that I had kept at my lodging; so that of all these three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men there was not a man escaped, saving these two that I sav'd, and another that
went dowe the Wall of the Castle by a Rope, and swam the River, who had also a great
many Soldiers at his heels plying him all the way with their Harquebuz shot, but he mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
escap't in despight of them all. His hour was not come, for he had an infinite
number of shots made at him, but none of them had the fortune to hit. I here perceiv'd that
Don <hi>Lewis</hi> his men were for the most part raw rascals; for old Soldiers do not use to kill
Women, and these kill'd above fourty, at which I was furiously angry. Their Captains
were sorry for and asham'd of the action, but they could not help it, for they said they
were Lutherans in disguise, because having been fumbling with one of them to lye with
her, they had found that it was a beardless Deacon, who had disguis'd himself in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
clothes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pene</hi> taken by assault.</note> This was the taking of <hi>Pene,</hi> which was of no little importance, as being
an extraordinary strong place, and in a good Country upon the River, where a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that was in the Castle. It may truly be said, that every one here play'd his part, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
did Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> who never stirr'd from the Canon, but took as much pains as
any man of his age could possibly do,</p>
            <p>Now so soon as Captain <hi>Bordet</hi> was joyn'd with Monsieur <hi>de Duras,</hi> their Army began
very much to encrease, forasmuch as those who before had forborn to declare themselves
in expectation of the said <hi>Bordets</hi> coming, now that they saw he was come, conceiving a
better opinion of their affairs, they repair'd boldly to the Army. The Enemy then being
in this condition, we were one night afraid that they would take from us <hi>Moissac,</hi> or
else <hi>Cahors,</hi> by reason that the Rivers were so low, that they were almost every where to

very great haste without either stop or stay, unless to eat a little bread, and drink a little
wine, he had caus'd to be carried along with him for the Soldiers by the way; and also it
stood him upon to lose no time. He was to go very near to their Camp, and as he marcht
by night, the Enemy at the same time did the same, so that in the morning by sun-rise,
just as he was got over the River, the Enemy came to the water side, so little had he the
start of them, and so narrowly they mist of him. At his coming to the Town he found all
the people in so great a terror and confusion, that they were forsaking the Town to fly to
the mountains for safety; but at his coming they took courage; and immediately without
entring into any house, Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> went out to skirmish, and put himself
upon the passage of the River to defend it, for he had very good men, and it was also the
first Company that had been rais'd. All day the Enemy was hovering about the River,
making a shew as if they intended to pass it, and I believe staid for the rest of the Army,
who were marching after them; but made no attempt to pass. At last the night drawing
on, Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> fortified himself with Barrels, logs, and stones, and such
materials as he could find; wherein the whole City were employed at work, and plied it
so well, that in the morning the Enemy saw there would be no good to be done; so that
the remainder of their Army coming up to them, they all quarte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Villages nearest to the River, and there some dayes remain'd without making any further
attempt. In the mean time we went to <hi>Moissac,</hi> to which place Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> had
caused two great Culverins, and two Field-pieces to be brought from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and
where we left the three pieces of Canon, and marcht toward <hi>Caussade, Mirabel,</hi> and

escape out of our hands, insomuch that he stood highly suspected to many, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this supineness and remiss way of proceeding, and also for that almost all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
especially a Secretary of his, whom he extremely lov'd, were Hugonots. A Servant
of his a Basque, whose name was <hi>Hactsé,</hi> told us, that would Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ear to him he should have chang'd his Servants, knowing very well that they rendred
him suspected, especially to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and in truth it was intollerable, by reason of the
jealousie we all had, that the Enemy had perpetual intelligence of our designs; for I never
knew any of that party, how moderate soever they might seem to be, that did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
desire the King's ruine. As for my own part I do really believe that never any ill
entred into his heart, and that which made him deferre things so, was only the continual
buzzing him in the ear, that I would make him lose himself.</p>
            <p>So soon as we came to <hi>Pecornet,</hi> which belongs to Monsieur <hi>de Thoneins,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
Burie</hi> vvould take up his Quarters there, and I with my own Company, and a good
Troop of Gentlemen marcht on straight to <hi>Mirabel,</hi> sending my Son upon the Forlorn
Hope before; who coming to <hi>Mirabel,</hi> found the Enemy newly risen from their Quarters,
and marching away towards <hi>Caussade,</hi> where he fell upon the Rear, and defeated a Troop,
the rest putting themselves into two or three houses, vvhich being near unto <hi>Caussade,</hi>
where their vvhole Army was, and he having no Foot vvith him, he was constrain'd to
let them alone, and to retire to <hi>Mirabel,</hi> where I staid to expect him. Now I had sent
to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to entreat him to come and quarter at <hi>Mirabel,</hi> it being no more
than a league only from <hi>Pecornet;</hi> to which he sent me answer back, that the greatest

Walls being of no strength, vve should not go vvith the two great Culverins, and assault
them in <hi>Caussade.</hi> To which proposition some said I, and others no; but in the end the
Negative voices carried it, which so soon as I perceiv'd, I made a motion, that after dinner
vve should descend into the Plain, and there draw up in Battalia, by which I said we
should produce two effects; the first, that we should by that means discover the strength
of the Enemy, and discern by their countenance whether they were in fear, or no; and
secondly we should order our men as if they were to fight, and separate our Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeers
from the Gens d'arms, so that every one might know his own place when we came to
fight, which we could not do where we were quartered; by reason that there was no even
ground. This in the end was concluded of, and agreed, that so soon as we had eaten a
little we should mount to horse. All the Gentry, which was a sprightly and brave Troop,
retir'd with me, and we soon dispatcht our dinner; after which I sent away a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to give him notice that I began to march to take my place in
the field; when presently there came Monsieur <hi>de Malicorne,</hi> who had been present at the
first deliberation to tell me, that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was resolved not to come down into the
Plain, nor to suffer the Army to do it, and told me moreover, that those whom I thought
to have been the most forward to have stood to the former resolution, were the first who
retreated, and were now of a quite contrary opinion; which is an abominable thing, that
men should out of respect to authority go contrary to their own sense. I entreated him
that he would go back again, and remonstrate to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> the great error he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in not ordering our men as they ought to fight, and that I would engage my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

of the River: but I had something else in my thoughts, and had I seen a fit opportunity,
vvould have come so near that it should not have been possible to have retir'd vvithout
fighting. Hovvever the said Sieur <hi>de Malicorne</hi> absolutely refused to go, saying that he
had already said all he could to perswade him, and vvould meddle nor make no more
in the business, and I perceiv'd vvas very angry, though he forbore to say all that he thought.
I therefore sent Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> but Monsieur <hi>de Malicorne</hi> staid vvith me, and
vvould no more return. We then march'd and pass'd before his Lodging, all of us ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that vvhen he savv us upon our march, his humour vvould come about, and that he
vvould come, and so soon as vve vvere come into the bottom vvere avvare of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Mareschal <hi>de Termes,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Arne,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Masses,</hi> vvho told me that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> had sent to protest against
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:105656:141"/>
them if they came dovvn to me, but they had return'd him ansvver that before dinner
they had concluded to descend into the Plain, and that for their parts they vvould stand
to the first resolution, that I vvas there already, and that should the Enemy come out to
fight me, they vvould share in the sport. He protested also against the other Captains
(I have heard since, that Don <hi>Lewis</hi> vvas one of those vvho alter'd his opinion) and
particularly against Captain <hi>Charry</hi> the Camp-master, vvho thereupon left him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and came himself alone to find me out, and to run the same fortune vvith me.
In short vve vvere all in divison, vvhich is an unruly Beast vvhen it once gets into an
Army; and therefore you, vvho have the command of Armies as much as you can oppose
its entrance, for if it once get a foot within the door, it is very hard to thrust him out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>The Enemy departed from <hi>Caussade,</hi> taking their way directly to <hi>Realville,</hi> to escape
tovvards <hi>Montauban,</hi> vvhen so soon as they came into their side of the Plain, they vvere
aware of me, and made a halt: after which they began to put themselves into Battalia,
and were above a long hour in doing it, by which I very vvell perceiv'd they were but
raw Soldiers, and that their orders were either not well given, or not well obeyed. They
durst not venture a step further upon their march, fearing lest I should charge them in the
Rear, and so we stood facing one another above four long hours with a little River betwixt
us. I would not suffer some Harquebuzeers on horseback that I had to make any attaque
upon them, to the end that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> might see that I had no mind to fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he himself was there, hoping that his knowing us to be so near would bring him out
into the field, but all signified nothing, and so we were constrain'd to retire from thence.
As we were retreating towards <hi>Mirabel</hi> some of their Cavalrly that was in <hi>Realville,</hi> and
that before had not dar'd to shew their heads pass'd the River (which were Captain <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dets</hi>
men) they had all white Cassocks, which were the first that I had ever seen, but so
soon as they saw us face about upon them, they turn'd back again to repass the River, and
in our sight crost the water above <hi>Realville,</hi> taking the way to <hi>Montauban.</hi> I then retir'd
to my Quarters as angry as ever I was in all my life, that we had lost so fair an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of fighting the Enemy, and what promise soever I had made to the contrary, had the
gross of our Army come down to us, we would have had a brush with them, and I would
(as I have already said) have approacht them so near, that it should not have been possible
for either side to have retir'd without fighting.</p>
            <p>In the Evening Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> sent to me to know if I would come to the Council,
which after many entreaties, with much ado I did, but they had much ado to perswade
me to it. Where being come, I remonstrated to him what a piece of cowardize we had
committed, who thereupon told me, that it had not stuck at him, we had not fought;
but he did not go without an answer. Messieurs <hi>de Malicorne</hi> and <hi>d' Argence</hi> are both of
them yet living, who I believe can better remember what I said than I; for I was scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
my self, I was so transported with passion. To be short, in this huffe I left him and
his Council, upon which occasion he shewed himself to be wiser than I, and more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to bear with my imperfections, and I do believe in his conscience knew himself to
be in fault. At night Captain <hi>Masses, Arne,</hi> and I, with my Company, and the
Gentlemen went out thinking to find the Enemy on this side the River <hi>Labeyron;</hi> not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
the passage being very dangerous and bad, that they would offer to venture over in
the night; but so soon as ever they came to the water side they hurried over in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and went to gain a Wood near unto <hi>Montauban</hi> call'd <hi>le Ramier.</hi> Captain <hi>Masses</hi>
and Captain <hi>Arne</hi> met with some who staid behind in the Farms on this side the River,
as being afraid to venture over, having seen some of their men drown'd in the passage, and
those they took an order withall for drowning, and so we return'd back without being able
to do any thing more; having resolv'd to have fought could we have met with them, though
it had cost us all our lives, and I do believe that the rage wherein we were, would have
redoubled our Forces to have fought them to some purpose; if but in spite to have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shame and reproach at their doors, whose gums were so tender they would not bite. The
Farmers assur'd us that they would neither stop nor stay till they came to <hi>Montauban,</hi>
which was the reason we did not pass the River, and they moreover affirm'd, that had a
hundred horse only come in, when they began to foard the River, they had defeated them

desperately into the River to escape away. And this was the fine piece of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
we committed, which never went off my heart till after the Battail of <hi>Ver,</hi> that
we fought a little while after. Me thought the very stones lookt upon us, and that the
Peasants pointed at us; for we had here a much better opportunity to have done their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
than we had afterwards at <hi>Ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:105656:142"/>I was in so great a rage, that I was very near going away from Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> in
the morning, and had it not been for the Captains and Gentlemen, who were with us,
and disswaded me from that resolution, I had done it, being very sure that the greatest
part of the Army would have gone along with me: but he that of all others most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
upon me to stay was Monsieur <hi>de Malicorne,</hi> who remonstrated to me, that the
King would take it highly ill at my hands, that all things would go amiss, and that
afterwards all the blame would be laid upon me, which would be sufficient to pull
down upon me the Queens hatred and indignation, and ruine me for ever. As for my
own part I had a minde to have pursued the Warre after my own way, wherein I fancied
at least I should succeed much better, the business of <hi>Targon</hi> evermore running in my
mind, where I had defeated them with so few men; and I had also an opinion that the
Sieurs <hi>d' Argence</hi> and <hi>de Carlus</hi> would go along with me, although they came with
him. Nevertheless I suffer'd my self to be govern'd by the said Sieur <hi>de Malicorne,</hi> and
the rest who reconcil'd me to him; for my anger though it be suddain and violent, is
none of the worst sort, and besides he was the Kings Lieutenant. He was pleased upon
our reconciliation to assure me, that upon the first occasion that should present it self he
would lay aside all fear of losing the Province, and resolutely fight them; and that which
made him bear with my rough humour was, that he knew all my heat proceeded from the
zeal I had to his Majesties service, which made me talk after that disrespective manner,
neither had any thing else restrain'd him but only the fear of disaster, being certain that the
King would lay all the fault to him with whom he had entrusted the Government and
care of the Province.</p>
            <p>Oh 'tis an ill thing when a Lieutenant of a Province is alwayes in fear of losing;<note place="margin">A fault in a Lieutenant of a Province.</note> in
the name of God be as cautious as you will when you are to keep a place, raise fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as high as Heaven if you can, watch, ward, and still be jealous of surprizes: but to
have sufficient Forces, and evermore to be in fear of losing, this favours of I know not
what, and believe me (Lord Lieutenants) 'tis an ill Omen. For my part I was of a quite
contrary humour; for I evermore saw that if the affairs of <hi>Guienne</hi> went well, those of
<hi>France</hi> would succeed the better, and if we defeated the Forces on this side, we might
afterwards go over into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and by that means frustrate the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> from
having either men or money out of those two Provinces.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after Monsieur <hi>de Malicorne</hi> return'd back to Court, and I believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the King with what he had seen, which I presume was the reason of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
sending Monsieur <hi>de Monpensier</hi> into these parts, having heard that there was no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good intelligence betwixt Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> and me. A thing very prejudicial to the
service of those we serve, and I should never advise that the supreme power be divided
betwixt two, for an indifferent Captain will do better alone, than two good ones in
joint Commission. It is true that I took more authority upon me than the King inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
me withall; and perhaps it was necessary so to do; there are enow that can witness it.
Would to God the King had taken the same course in this last War, he did here in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier,</hi> which if he had, there would perhaps have been a better
account given of his service in this Country; neither was I single in this opinion, for I
was very well accompanied, and with men of the best understandings. And I would
alwaies advise his Majestie, that when ever he shall hear of any division in an Army,
evermore to send away a Prince of the blood to command in chief, and the sooner
the better, before the division have got any great footing to endanger his affairs: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </gap>, and that the disorder is once hapned, it is never to be remedied
but with great difficulty and dammage; or by separating those who disagree, which also
is not to be done without great inconvenience, considering that both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must needs have many friends and servants depending upon them.</p>
            <p>A little while after Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> propos'd an Enterprize,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Montauban.</hi>
               </note> which was to goe and
lay Siege to <hi>Montauban</hi> on that side towards <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and that in order thereunto we
should return back to <hi>Moissac,</hi> and there pass over the River; and to this end he caused
another Canon and another Culve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in to be brought from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and took the way
directly to <hi>Moissac.</hi> I was resolv'd to let him alone without contradicting him in the least
(having made a vow not to speak a word) to see what he would do, though I was certain
beforehand that his Enterprize would vanish in smoke and come to nothing; for seeing
we had not dar'd to fight them in the field, what hopes could we have of doing any
good upon them in a Town, and such a one as that was? Nevertheless I followed as others
did, and we came to the Bourg, where we staid seven or eight daies, having spent some
Canon shot against the Tower of the Bridge where there was a Church the Enemy had
fortified. In short I know not at which end to begin to give a Narration of this brave Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:105656:142"/>
neither can I make of it either good Pottage, or good Broth, and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it better without saying any more to let it alone, and only to tell you, that after
these seven or eight days, it was resolved that we should retire to <hi>Montech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At our coming to <hi>Moissac,</hi> I had there intelligence, that those of <hi>Lectoure</hi> had taken
the Field, making prodigious havock, and committing infinite insolences upon the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and their Estates, in all places where they could get in, and that they expected Forces
out of <hi>Bearne,</hi> that Captain <hi>Mesmes</hi> was bringing into them, being five hundred men.
Their design was to make a flying Army, which was the reason that I sent back Captain
<hi>Montluc</hi> with part of my Company; upon which occasion the Count <hi>de Candalle,</hi> the
Sieurs <hi>de Cançon, de Montferran, Guitinieres,</hi> and some other Gentlemen would needs
bear him company; Captain <hi>Parron</hi> also went along, taking with him the Company of
the Baron <hi>de Pourdeac</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>la Rocque d' Orman,</hi> for the Baron himself
had some dayes before this been wounded in a skirmish Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Lectoure.</hi> So soon as they came to <hi>Florence</hi> they understood that the <hi>Begolles,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
to Monsieur <hi>d' Aussun,</hi> were the Heads of those who were gone out of <hi>Lectoure,</hi>
and that they had taken their way directly to <hi>Sampoy</hi> to go meet the said <hi>de Mesmes,</hi> who
was to be that morning at <hi>Aiguetint.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Baretnau,</hi> who was raising a Foot
Company hapning to be there, went to put himself betwixt <hi>Terraube</hi> and <hi>Lectoure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they there intended to fight them: but the Enemy having intelligence of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from <hi>Florence,</hi> thought to return back to <hi>Lectoure,</hi> and also because they had notice
that Captain <hi>Mesmes</hi> could not that day come to <hi>Aiguetint,</hi> when having passed <hi>Terraube</hi>
to return to <hi>Lectoure;</hi> they saw they must of necessity fight Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> by the way,
who had intercepted their retreat, which rather than do they would return to <hi>Terraube;</hi>
though they could not do that neither, but so as there was some skirmishing at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the Town, and had they had but five hundred paces further to go, Captain <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi>
had defeated them before they could have got in. He then dispatcht away to <hi>Auch,
Florence, la Sauvetat, la Sampoy,</hi> and as far as <hi>Condom</hi> for succours to come in to besiege
them, which every one did, so that there came in to him above two thousand men. He
dispatcht away a Courier to me also in all haste, giving me to understand, that if I would
come thither with the Artillery, we might take <hi>Lectoure,</hi> for that all the good men that
belong'd to it he kept shut up in <hi>Terraube</hi> to the number of four hundred men, together
with the two <hi>Begolles,</hi> Nephews to Monsieur <hi>d'Aussun,</hi> who were also coop't up with
the rest. I shewed the Letter to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> and we had some dispute upon it, he
being unwilling to suffer me to take any of the Foot Companies, but in the end he granted
me the Baron of <hi>Clermont</hi> my Nephew, to whom I had given a Company of recruit, and
Monsieur <hi>d'Ortobie,</hi> and <hi>de Fredeville</hi> immediately yoked three pieces of Canon; and
went before to <hi>Moissac</hi> to prepare the Boats, so that when the Canon came they found
the Boats all ready, and all night long we did nothing but pass the River. I then sent a
Quarter-Master from Village to Village to get Oxen ready to relieve the others, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, I gallop'd away before, and found that Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> had besieg'd the
Town, and that the four hundred men which were in <hi>Terraube</hi> had surrendred to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Quarter for life.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Mesmes</hi> advanc't as far as the River <hi>Baise</hi> within a <hi>League</hi> of the said <hi>Terraube,</hi>
when hearing the others were besieg'd, he went back the same way he came, and retir'd
himself into a little Village called <hi>Roquibrune</hi> near unto <hi>Viefezensac.</hi> My Nephew Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Gohas,</hi> who had been Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de la Moth-Gondrin</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and had married his Daughter, hearing of his motion, had taken the Field with some
Gentlemen his Neighbours, and some Country-fellows, whom he had call'd together by
the ringing of a Bell, and putting himself in his Rear had constrain'd him to take into <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebrune</hi>
for his safety: where the Peasants impatient of lying all night to besiege him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all of them stole away, so that Captain <hi>Mesmes</hi> went away in the morning towards
<hi>Bearn,</hi> from whence he was come, to tell his friends there the news of the fine frights he
had been in.</p>
            <p>Now Monsieur <hi>d' Ortobie</hi> made so good haste, that the next morning two hours before
day he was got over the River, and come before <hi>Lectoure.</hi> At break of day, he, Monsieur
<hi>de Fredeville,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lectoure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe-Rouge,</hi> and I went to view where we should plant the
Artillery, and concluded to plant it on a little Hill on that side by the River, where there
was a Windmill, to batter the Town on that side by the Fountain. And here we bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it all day long, and to so good effect, that a Breach was made betwixt seven and
eight paces wide. They had entrencht themselves within, and had Bastion'd the ends of
the Streets with the way that went all along by the Wall, and pierced two or three houses
that lookt into the Breach. In the interim that the Canon was batter<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

to hinder those that mann'd that Bulwark from shooting into the Breach: but being
they had environ'd the Bulwark with Pipes and Gabions fill'd with earth, and that also

after.</p>
            <p>The next morning I caused the Artillery to play upon these Pipes and Gabions, and to

as would go along with him, of which the Count <hi>de Candalle</hi> was one, a young Lord full of
noble courage, who also has since lost his life in a Breach in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as I have been told;
and as for me I was by the Ladders to storm the Bulwark, with the Sieur <hi>de Batternau</hi>'s
Company, and another with my own Company of Gens d'arms, whom I had dismount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that purpose. This order being concluded I caused them to take up the Ladders,
putting Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> and his men before, and marching my self in their Rear, to see
what would be the issue of their assault, and after me came the Ladders, and my fellows.
They carried the Breach with very great boldness and bravery, entred thorough it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to dispute the Rampires they had cast up in the streets, and were already almost
Masters of one.</p>
            <p>Now the Enemy the night before had made a Ditch betwixt the Breach and the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
and had put a very great train of powder into it, to which they were to give fire
from within a House in the Town. We set up our Ladders, and two Ensigns mounted
up to the very top of the Bastion: I was making the Soldiers still to mount, and to rear
the rest of the Ladders, when just as our people of the Breach were as good as Masters of
the Rampires, some of those who came after, clapping a foot into the ditch of the Train,
which was cover'd over with Bavins,<note place="margin">A mine sprung at <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> began to cry out <hi>we are in the Train,</hi> and took such

<hi>la Rocque</hi> was hurt, Lieutenant and Kinsman to the Baron <hi>de Pourdeac,</hi> who died
the next day, one of the bravest Gentlemen that these fifty years has come out of <hi>Gascony.</hi>
Others also were slain there, and some of those were hurt who storm'd by the Ladders;
when seeing those of the Breach retir'd, I also drew off mine, very glad to have escap'd
so good cheap; for had they sprung the Mine in time, they had made a terrible
Fricassee.</p>
            <p>The next day Monsieur <hi>d' Ortobie,</hi> the Governor of <hi>la Mothe-Rouge,</hi> and I went to view
the other side of the Town towards the little Bulwark; but could find no place where
we could convenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly plant any more than two pieces of Canon, for this Town (for a
Town of War is one of the best situated in all <hi>Guienne,</hi> and very strong) and there also
was the little Bulwark that flanckt the place where we had a mind to batter, which put
us to such a stand, that we could not resolve what to do; so that about noon Monsieur
<hi>d' Ortobie</hi> return'd to batter again by the Breach at some Flankers there were, because
the next morning I was resolv'd to give an assault in open day, where as he himself was
levelling a piece of Canon,<note place="margin">The Sieur d' Ortobie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded.</note> he was wounded in the thigh by a Faulconet shot from the
great Bulwark; which went very near to my heart, for he was a valiant Captain and an
admirable Engineer. He died two dayes after. 'Tis of all others of our Trade a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the most danger; nevertheless in all Sieges where I have been, I was ever by the
Canon, and fancied that all things did not go right, if I was not there. This Gentleman
very well understood his business, which is very rare, and (as I have said) exceeding
dangerous, and few escape of those who expose themselves too much. In the mean
time the Enemy parlied, where it was agreed, that they should give me three of those

            <p>I saw all this from behind a little Wall, and wondred that our Deputies were not kill'd,

another of Foot to <hi>Terraube,</hi> to kill and dispatch all those that were there, giving him with
him the Hangman to truss up the Chief, which he perform'd with a very good will (as
he had reason, considering the foul play those of <hi>Lectoure</hi> had twice practised upon him)

fared no better than the rest: they were within two fingers breadth of it, for I had once

I told them, that I would not give the assault unless they were there, which so tickled
their vain humour, and was taken so kindly by them, that they all resolved to turn back
to me; so that just as I had sign'd the Capitulation, they arriv'd at <hi>Florence</hi> a league from
<hi>Lectoure,</hi> which was upon a Friday. Into <hi>Lectoure</hi> I put the Baron <hi>de Pourdeac</hi> with his

he pleased; some whereof listed themselves into our Companies. They had never heard
any thing of the death of their fellows at <hi>Terraube,</hi> till I had taken possession of the
Town, and then expected to scape no better than the rest: but I kept my word with
them. I then immediately sent away the Baron of <hi>Clermont</hi> with the five Ensigns I had,
bidding him go and pass the River <hi>Garonne</hi> at <hi>Leyrac,</hi> and went my self to talk with the

            <p>All Sunday and Sunday night our people were continually ferrying over at <hi>Leyrac,</hi>
for there was but two Boats, so that they could not get over till near ten of the clock on
Monday morning, by which means I could that night march no further than <hi>Villeufue;</hi>
and there the Count <hi>de Candalle</hi> fell sick upon our hands, so that we were constrain'd to
send him home to his own House, and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> also, who had already had two
fits of an Ague. Upon Tuesday the Baron of <hi>Clermont</hi> sent me word, that upon Monday
he could march no more but two leagues, being hindred by the passage of the River, and
that he was making all the haste he possibly could to <hi>Belvé,</hi> to which place I had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Monsieur <hi>de Duras,</hi> who was encamped upon a little River called <hi>la Vezere,</hi> near unto
<hi>Fages.</hi> I writ to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to the same effect, that he might by break of day
pass the <hi>Dordogne,</hi> as I had already done: at which Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was strangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonisht
that I could be so soon there, considering that but two days before he had receiv'd

            <p>I had scarce made an end of my dispatches, when the Baron <hi>de Clermont</hi> arrived with
the five Ensigns, and the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, whom I made to pass the River in two great Boats,
and go to lye at Saint <hi>Subran</hi> near unto <hi>Fages,</hi> to which place they came not till two hours

eat; but she shewed her self to be the Wife of a brave Captain, which was the late Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Fages;</hi> for she not only gave them all the bread she had in the house, and seven or
eight puncions of wine, but moreover did nothing else but make her people bake bread all
night long, giving them all her Bacon, and other Provisions, without sleeping a wink of
all night, and was never at rest till they had all eaten enough.</p>
            <p>In the Morning, which was Thursday, I foarded the River <hi>Dordogne</hi> (for the River
was foardable here, and there in some certain places my Guides led me to) having with
me in all not above fourty or fifty Light-horse, and upon my departure from <hi>Ciurac</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

himself to go. Captain <hi>Charry</hi> according to his custom put himself before with his

went before. Now from <hi>Fages</hi> to the Ferry at <hi>Vezere,</hi> it is no more than a good league,
so that I was presently there, where I met with several Country people coming back from them,
who told me, that the Enemy were dislodging from two or three Villages where they had
lain that night, and that we were not above a league from thence. I passed the River, and
at night sent out Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> with two or three horse to scout. Messieurs <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi>
and <hi>de Courre</hi> had also sent out the Quartermaster of Monsieur <hi>de Randan,</hi> so that
Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> and he hapned to meet, where the Quartermaster assur'd him that
he had seen the Camp dislodg, and upon their march, and (as God when it pleases him
will sometimes assist some, and punish others) it was from the Quarters they rose from,
but two little leagues only to <hi>Ver,</hi> and from <hi>Ver</hi> but two little leagues more to the passage of
the River <hi>de l'Isle,</hi> where they had made account to pass over that day. But being they
saw Monsieur <hi>de Monpensier</hi> was at <hi>Bergerac</hi> with very small Forces, and Monsieur <hi>de

for them to have consulted their ease less, and their safety more.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> came having only two or three horse with him, and found me talking

their Camp; and that from thence they were going into <hi>France</hi> to joyn with the Prince
of <hi>Condé.</hi> I then told Monsieur <hi>de Burie, that it was necessary he should make haste and

take it ill if we did not stay for him:<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why they ought to fight.</note> but I replied again, that he was so far off,
it would hardly be possible for us to joyn that day, and that therefore we were not to
forbear to sight out of that consideration; for should we suffer them to pass the River,
and joyn with Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefaucaut,</hi> who waited with his Forces in expectation
of them about <hi>St. Iean d'Angely,</hi> the King and Queen would never more look upon us
as men of honor.</q> 
               <hi>I warrant you,</hi> said I, <hi>they are our own, my good genius tells me so.</hi> As we

               </gap>e would sight them. To which he made answer, <hi>that it should
not stick at him; but that if Monsieur</hi> de Montpensier <hi>should be displeased, or that matters
did not succeed well, he would lay the blame upon me.</hi> To which I replied in the presence

of a great many, <hi>Sir, Sir, let every one charge the fault upon me, and spare not, I will
bear the blame of all, my shoulders are broad enough, but I do assure you I will be loaden with
honor, and not with shame, or be left with my belly toasting against the Sun.</hi> Whereupon
Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> making a sign with his hand, said, <hi>let us go then in the name of God.</hi> In

seven or eight Battails besides this, but never saw the Captains and Soldiers both Horse and
Foot so chearful as at this time, which I lookt upon as a very good Omen. Now that I
might stay to give all the Army time to pass over, and be drawn up in order to fight, I
drew all my Horse along by the side of a Hedge, sending to a Farm hard by for a little
hay wherewith to bait them, for every one had brought a few Oats along with him, and
to say the truth,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Monsieur <hi>de Burie.</hi>
               </note> I never in my life saw Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> so pleasant as that day, which
gave me sufficiently to understand, that all his delays had proceeded more from his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of losing the Province, than from any defect in himself; and I dare answer for
him, that neither treachery nor cowardize ever entred into his heart; for he was an old
and a valiant Cavalier, and one that had ever given very brave testimonies of his worth and
valour; but he was afraid of failing. I sent Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> and the foremention'd
Quartermaster with thirty Horse to follow in the Rear of the Enemy: and my self, who
might have some fifteen Curasseers of my own Company, and about thirty Gentlemen
(betwixt forty and fifty Horse in all) marcht in the Rear of them, intreating Monsieur
<hi>de Burie</hi> to follow after; and so we set forwards.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> had not gone above half a league, before in some certain Farms
upon the way he met with some straglers of the Enemies Camp whom he cut to pieces.
They had three Corners of Horse in the Rear of their Army, who some of them sometimes
fac'd about upon Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> and now and then the whole Body made a halt.
I still follow'd after him, sending Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> continual notice of all that past,
and solliciting him withal to march as fast as he could, for that I was within sight of
their Army; and so I marcht continually in the Enemies Rear, till about two of the clock
in the afternoon, about which time there came to me Monsieur <hi>de St. Genies,</hi> the Father of
Monsieur <hi>d' Audax,</hi> whom Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> had sent to me to enquire of my news, and
to bring me an account of him; by which I found that he was still in the Plain of <hi>Vezere,</hi>
where I had left the Army in Battalia, and he told m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so many stories, that my joy was
soon turn'd into vexation. I entreated the said Sieur <hi>de St. Genies,</hi> that he would return
back to him, and entreat him to come away, which he refused to do, being resolved no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to leave me; seeing which I took him aside, where we concluded together to speak to
the Captains of Horse, and tell them plainly what we thought, which perhaps might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
them to come away, and then he return'd, and found them yet in the same place,
but after he had spoken to the Captains, and as a secret told Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> what had
been concluded betwixt him and me,<note place="margin">The Sieur de St. Genies cause of the Battel.</note> he was then resolv'd to set forwards. And I must
needs give Monsieur <hi>de St. Genies</hi> this due commendation, that he was the cause the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
was fought.</p>
            <p>Thus then Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> marcht after me, with an intention to quarter all his Army
at <hi>St. Alvare.</hi> About half a quarter of a league above the said <hi>St. Alvare,</hi> there were ten
or twelve Houses that kept entertainment for passengers, and chiefly for the trading Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
it being a great Road from <hi>Perigueux</hi> to <hi>Bergerac.</hi> So soon as I came to these
houses, I joyn'd my self with Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> who shewed me that the Enemies
Camp was taking up their Quarters on the further side of a little River in certain little
Villages that lay before us; wherefore we were of opinion to bait our horses, for we found
there Hay and Oats, but no people, saving some fevv poor vvomen, the Peasants being all
fled avvay upon the report of the Enemies approach; and so soon as our horses had baited
(vvhich they did vvith every man his bridle on his arm) there came a servant of Monsieur

might have with them twenty or five and twenty horse only; but that the Village where
the three Cornets lay was within less than two Harquebuz shot of the said house, and that
he had left the said <hi>Salign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hard by, having brought their Hawks along with them. You may judge whether this
was a time to hawk in, or no, and whether this was to march like Soldiers, when they
had an Enemy so near. I then askt the fellow if he would guide me thither, to which
having made answer that he would, we immediately mounted to horse. I gave half the
Troop to Monsieur <hi>de Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my self betwixt the House and the Village where the three Cornets lay: but I would not
give Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> who was quarter'd at an odd House at the end of the Village,
notice of my design, because I intended that the Company should remain all night on
horseback,<note place="margin">The Enemy have ill in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dreamt of an Enemy within two leagues of them. Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> flew sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into the Court of the House, and at his first coming took <hi>Salignac</hi> and <hi>Moncaut,</hi>
and forcing a lower room into which some of them had retir'd themselves, kill'd all they
found within it. Monsieur <hi>de Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

advised me to retire, telling me that the three Cornets in the Village were the best
horse in the whole Army, it being Monsieur <hi>de Tors</hi> his Troop, who was come with
Captain <hi>Bordet.</hi> I took his advice, and we retreated to the place from whence we came,
where at my coming I found that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was passed by, and was gone to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at <hi>St. Alvare,</hi> the Army going after in file. I staid the five Ensigns that had been
with me at <hi>Lectoure,</hi> and the mutinous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom I quarter'd promiscuously among
our Horse. Flesh, Wine, and Chesnuts we found store, and I got some great loaves of course
brown bread they make in that Country, which I gave to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which being
done without alighting, I went to wait upon Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> taking Monsieur <hi>de
Monferran</hi> only in my Company, who also carried Captain <hi>Salignac</hi> his Prisoner along
with him. I found him lodg'd in Monsieur <hi>d' Alvare</hi>'s Castle, where at my coming into
the room I said to him, <hi>Look you Sir, I have taken one who was once in times past a great
favourite of yours, Captain Salignac.</hi> He then demanded of we where I had taken him;
I made answer in the Enemies Camp. He thought their Camp had been three leagues
off towards the passage of the River <hi>de l' Isle,</hi> and askt me where their Camp was, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I told him it was close by, and that we were quarter'd promiscuously amongst one
another. At which news he seem'd to be something amaz'd, when I took occasion to say
these words to him, <hi>Sir you must now justifie the old Proverb to be true, That a good horse
will never tire. In like manner you must resolve to fight to morrow morning, and send order
to all the Gens-d'armes who are not yet alighted, that they must bait their horses with their
bridles in their hands, and not a man of them to unarm; for we are come so near, that it is
not possible to avoid fighting:</hi> In saying of which I was aware of Monsieur <hi>de St. Alvare,</hi>
whom I saluted, desiring him to call in his Servant, whom he had sent along with his
Nephews to conduct them to the Enemies Camp, who stood without, which he did, and
being come in I entreated him to tell Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> where the Enemies Camp lay,
which he accordingly did, place by place, and so exactly, that their own Quartermasters
could not have given a more perfect account. Whereupon Monsieur <hi>d' Alvare</hi> said, <hi>you
are quarter'd within four Harquebuz shot of one another, excepting the Infantry which lies at</hi>
Ver, <hi>from whence 'tis a league and a half to</hi> St. Andras, <hi>where Monsieur</hi> de Duras <hi>is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
and whose Quarters take up all the space betwixt</hi> St. Andras <hi>and this place. Well,</hi> said
Monsieur <hi>de Burie, I see we are engag'd to a Battel, and seeing it is so, we must fight it as
well as we can.</hi> Whereupon I saw joy sparkle in his eyes, which I was exceeding
glad of,<note place="margin">The Battel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd upon.</note> and taking him in my arms, said to him these words; <hi>Sir, if we must die, we
cannot honor our deaths more, than by dying in a Battel for the service of our Prince,</hi> to which
he made answer, and said, <hi>that is the least of my concern, 'tis no matter what becomes of me,
but I fear to loose the Country.</hi> I then entreated him that by break of day, every one might
be on horseback, and that we must say with the Italian, <hi>Qui assalta vince,</hi> and thereupon
bad him good night, and retir'd to my own Quarters, leaving him very well resolv'd
to fight.</p>
            <p>All night we remain'd in arms, and our horses sadled, their Centinels and ours being
so near, that they could hear one another talk, and by break of day we were on horseback,
when I sent to see if Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> was ready, and to tell him, that it was his way
to pass by my Quarters. He sent me word, that as soon as ever the Army could be got
ready to march, he would immediately come away, and in the mean time I marcht di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to <hi>St. Andras,</hi> where I found that Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> was already dislodg'd, and

and telling him that I would halt at a little Village four or five Harquebuz shots on this
side, till Monsieur <hi>de Buire</hi> should come up to me. Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> this while made
no haste at all, believing that our Camp was yet upon the <hi>Vezere,</hi> and that those who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
had taken <hi>Salignac</hi> were only some Avant-Coureurs of the Army. Monsieur <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had brought word back, that their Camp was drawn up in Battalia in the Meadow of <hi>Ver.</hi>
Whereupon I sent to Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> to make haste, and to hasten away four Field-pieces
he brought along with him, which he did, when so soon as I was advertised that he
was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> within half a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Companies of Gens d'arms, namely that of Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> and those of Messieurs <hi>de
Randan,</hi> and <hi>de la Vauguyon,</hi> advanced to come up, and joyn with me. But they mist
their way, and went by the Chesnut Trees directly into the view of <hi>Ver,</hi> thinking that I
was already at <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

having with them also a Company of Light-horse which Captain <hi>Pechié</hi> of <hi>Perigort</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
So soon as I came to the Wood I commanded Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
which he did, and it was well for us he did so, for he came just in the nick of a
charge that Captain <hi>Bordet</hi> made upon the Companies with a hundred or sixscore Horse,
Launceers all; which so soon as Captain <hi>Pechie</hi>'s Light-horse saw coming upon them,
they fac'd about, and fled a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>most into the three Companies. The Charge was so rude,
that all our three Companies were once disorde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then with only five and twenty Launces that he had with him, charg'd desperately
in amongst the Enemy, and so fortuna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely, that he made them retire three hundred paces,
where they made a halt as ours did also. Upon this I came in, seeing which the Enemy
clos'd up with the other Troops of horse. There were above twenty Launces broken in
this charge, and all the Enemies Camp made a halt. I then took Monsieur <hi>de Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
only, and went to discover the Enemy at my ease, where I saw that they began to

Harquebuzeers both on foot and on horseback, and in a little Wood on the right hand
Harquebuzeers on foot.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> arriv'd, where I acquainted him with all I had seen,
entreating him to cause his Field-pieces to advance to the brink of a Ditch, and to shoot
at those people in the Corner, which approving of my advice, he did; I then spoke to
Monsieur <hi>du Masses</hi> to place himself on the right hand by the side of a little hill there was
there, and placed the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Company, and my own on the left hand towards
that Corner, as I also did the three Companies of Messieurs <hi>de Burie, de Randan,</hi> and <hi>de

play, and so soon as we had put our selves into this posture, all our foot came up
together, the <hi>Gascons</hi> before, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after within fourscore or a hundred paces
of one another. I then rid up to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> where addressing my self to <hi>Don Lewis de

the time of the War I had learn't something of their language; and you Gentlemen
who have Estates to allow your Children a liberal education, take it from me, that it is a
very good thing to make them, if possible, acquainted with forreign Languages, which
will be of great use to them, both upon the account of Travel, Escapes, and Negotiations,
and also to gain the hearts of Strangers. I spoke to them then after this manner, which
I had been hammering in my head the night before, and God has given me a gift, though
I am no great Clerk, that I can express my self well enough upon occasion.</p>

God had done us the grace to bring us upon this occasion to fight a Battel under the

clearly our own. I am a <hi>Gascon,</hi> said I, but I will henceforth renounce my Country,

win the Prize, and gain the process of your adversaries, and you shall see I will be a

the Sun so brave as they; therefore (fellow Soldiers) let them see what you can do,
where they give one blow, give you four. You have more reason to fight than they;

and I commanded both the one and the other to move but a foot pace only, that they
might not put themselves out of breath; which order being given, I gallopt up to the
Gens-d'arms, entreating them to move gently forward, and saying to them, <hi>It is not to

may make you of the discovery of an Enemy, at least if you be able to do it your selves:
for you your selves ought to see and observe their order, countenance, and motion; and in
so doing shall ever be better able to command, than upon the report of another. Your own
eyes will better discern what is necessary to be done, than any other whoever you can send
to perform that service, you may take an old Captain or two along with you; but above
all things have a care of taking an old Captain out of any particular affection you have to
him, in company with you when you go to discover; for it is to be fear'd, that that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of yours may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make you take some swaggering insignificant Coxcomb, instead of a
good Soldier, who so soon as he shall discover the Enemy, will find a false friend about
his heart, which will be the cause, that out of the opinion you have of his judgment and
valour, and the friendship you have for him, he will make you commit so great an error,
and lose such an opportunity as perhaps you shall never again retrieve: but alwayes take
some old Captain, who in all places whereever he has been, shall not only have fought
but have been moreover the occasion of fighting; and although he may have been sometimes,
unfortunate, and beaten, provided it was not thorough default of courage or understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
do not forbear out of that consideration to take him about you. For all the world
are not so fortunate as <hi>Montluc,</hi> who was never defeated. Rather take such a one, than
one who has never either wonne or lost, and that has never serv'd in an Army otherwise
than as a looker on. I do not say this without experience, I have learnt these Lessons

the Enemy, he is more confident, and commands with greater boldness; and if before
he was in some apprehension (as no man living is without fear, when he sees his Enemy
make head against him) he will reassure himself, and forget his apprehension. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

reason on my side; but you will say, that this were to put the person of the Chief in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,
though it may be done without any such apparent danger. Let such as are afraid

            <p>Being come to <hi>Agen</hi> I there heard that Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> was gone to engage himself
before <hi>Montauban,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

that I had left to guard the Country, and seven or eight more that those of the City had
set on foot, which Siege he had undertaken immediately upon the news of the Battel being
won: and after I had been eight daies there the Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> who at that time
commanded <hi>Tholouze,</hi> sent to entreat me, with whom the Court of Parliament also joyn'd
in the request, that I would go to <hi>Montauban,</hi> they conceiving that matters there went
very slowly on, which put them out of all hope of any good account of that Enterprize.
I immediately then departed, and took the way directly to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> where I recieved a
Letter from a friend of mine, wherein he writ me word, that Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he writ, that he had heard they had sent for me to command at the Siege of <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
complaining that they did him great and manifest wrong, and invaded his honor;
for by that means after he had beaten the Bush another must come and take the Hare.
These were the contents of his Letters, which were brought by Captain <hi>Bidonnet.</hi> Being

Letters, that he made himself sure of the place; when seeing they could not prevail with
me, to take upon me the command of the Siege, they entreated me at least to go thither,
to see how matters went, which I did.</p>
            <p>At my coming thither Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> shewed me all he had done, by which I
found that in twelve dayes he had lain before it he had not done two dayes work, and
saw the beginning had not been very good, which made me doubt the end would be worse:
for I found that he had quitted the <hi>Fauxbourg St. Antoine,</hi> which is upon the way from
<hi>Caussade,</hi> by which they carried out, and brought into the Town whatever they would.
He had indeed been necessitated to do it, because the Soldiers had forsaken him after the
death of Captain <hi>Bazordan,</hi>

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:105656:149"/>
be old Soldiers, who in these commands (if they have been long in them) must necessarily
have seen much of that kind of service. All the rest understand nothing of it, nor the
General himself, if he have not learnt by being very much with them, but having us'd
to go with them, when they have gone to discover places, learns to know what belongs to
a Siege, but otherwise not: for the Captains of <hi>Gens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> d'armes</hi> never go to discover; nor
to the approaches, it being their business to be in a readiness to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight, and to watch that
no kind of relief enter into the place. How then should they be expert in Sieges, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that they have never assisted at discoveries, nor heard the debates that old Soldiers enter
into with one another upon that Subject; for there they argue upon what they themselves
have discover'd, and in sight of the strengths and defects of the place. 'Tis a thing of all
others in War of the greatest difficulty and importance, and by which many who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
great Captains are put to a stand: and it requires a long practice to understand
fortification, to observe and know the defects of a Bastion, a Spur, a Flanker, and to
guess what may be within it, by what you your selves would do if you were in the place.
Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> was a good Horse Officer, and very proper for fighting, but not for
beleaguering of places, no more than several others, who have never had other command
than those he had been trained up in; although in his Quarters every one will be giving
his vote, and spending his judgment upon a Carpet, or over a sheet of Paper. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
good to see the Map, but that very often deceives. I could wish, that when any
one, who has never been employed in any of the forementioned Commands, nor ever
follow'd the Kings Lieutenant when he went to view a place, nor heard the dispute of the
above named Officers upon their said discovery will be prating, and offering to put in
their Verdict: the Kings Lieutenant would bid him, first go hazard himself through the
Enemies shot at the discovery, and then deliver his advi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. 'Tis alwayes the tickliest
place, forasmuch as if the besieged be men of any metal, they will hinder as much
as in them lies, the assailant from discovering their Fort: and as much as they possibly
can will dispute all they have without, as much as to a hut, for if they suffer them to
make their approaches at first, they either discover themselves to be weak, or that they are
no Soldiers.</p>
            <p>I left then this hopeful Siege, and return'd to <hi>Agen,</hi> having told Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi>
my opinion, that he would have no better success, than what I had prophecied to him.

moreover there is a Court of Parliament, that will have a hand in every thing, and the
Gentry cannot go thither without great expence, and besides there is alwayes something
or other amiss, and some one or another question'd, which frights the Gentlemen from
going thither.</p>
            <p>Not long after the Cardinal of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> Court of Parliament of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and the

Monsieur <hi>de Novailles,</hi> all of them entreated me to make haste, or otherwise I would come
too late, for Monsieur <hi>de Novailles</hi> had already sent for all the Train'd-Bands to bring
them into the City by the Castle of <hi>Ha,</hi> that was in his possession, and some of those of
the Town possest themselves of the Gates, for part of the City sided with Monsieur <hi>de

               </gap>n their Levies and Preparations, that I might find all
things ready at my return; and so I put my self upon my way, for I was never a man
of delays; and being I had a great number of Gentlemen with me, I could not go by
water, but was constrain'd to make my journey by land, by reason of the armes and great
Horses we had, so that we were three dayes in going to <hi>Agen.</hi> I had dispatcht away <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tac,</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>de Novailles</hi> his Gentleman, to assure those of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but Monsieur <hi>de Het</hi> would not go away till he first saw me on horseback, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
rid so hard, that he fell sick, and had like to have died. Their arrival held
every one in suspence, both on the one side and the other. We staid but one night at
<hi>Agen,</hi> and went forwards, and in three dayes more I came to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where I found
a Patent the King had sent me, by which he made me his Lieutenant in the one half of
the Government of <hi>Guienne</hi> in the absence of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the other half to
remain to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> without making nevertheless any distinction as then, which
part should belong to Monsieur <hi>de Burie,</hi> and which to me.</p>
            <p>They believ'd that at my coming I would presently have had recourse to arms, and
have kill'd all those of the Presidents Party, and out of that beliefe many were fled away:
but I knew very well that that had been to ruine the City, and that the King would be a
great loser by it; for had I gone that way to work the Earth could not have saved the City
from being sacked. I went by <hi>Cadi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

me company, and we shipt our selves in his Galion, and other Vessels, for there was a

               </note> and by the way met news, that Monsieur <hi>de Novailles</hi> died
that night, having lain only two dayes sick, which gave occasion to some afterwards to
say that he died of poison, how true it was I know not, but it was great pity, for he was
a prudent honest Gentleman, and a good Subject.</p>
            <p>The next morning after my arrival I went to the Palace, and there propounded to the
Court what I had retein'd from the Siege of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and after what manner we ought
to proceed in a great City, either in Warre or in Sedition; telling them <q>that should
we put our hands to blood, the City would be totally destroyed, wherein both parties
would suffer alike, laying before them the example of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> where had I permitted
those who came from the Mountains, and <hi>Comenge,</hi> to enter the City, it had not been in
the power of man to have preserv'd it from being sackt, which would also befall them,
if we once proceeded to blood, and gave reins to the peoples fury, especially those from
without, bidding them remember what hapned when Monsieur <hi>de Monens</hi> was slain,
that the people took the Authority upon them. That they were therefore to begin with
a good reconciliation and union, without engaging in any disorders or trouble, after
which they might proceed to punish the Delinquents by the way of justice.</q> All the
Assembly approv'd of my advice, and return'd me infinite thanks. At my departure
from thence, so soon as I had din'd I went to the Town Hall, where I had appointed the
Jurats and all the Council to meet me, and made them the same remonstrance, where
though there were some who had a mind to blow the coals, nevertheless I laid so many
exemples and good reasons before them, that they all al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

four of the clock I went to the Arch Bishoprick, where I had assign'd all the Clergy to
expect me, and there made them also a Remonstrance touching the Estate of the Church,
as I had done to the other two concerning theirs: so that that very day I appeas'd the
City, and the next day we fell to consult of the order was to be observ'd, that the pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might endure, wherein I so bestirr'd my self, that in three dayes all tumults

of <hi>Rourdeaux</hi> to witness it, that had I proceeded otherwise the City had been destroyed;
neither ought we to have recourse to violence, where there is any other way left open, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
considering, that it was a division amongst the Catholicks, or at least those who
professed themselves to be such, for I am not God Almighty to dive into mens
hearts.</p>
            <p>Oh that the King ought well to consider to whom he entrusts the Government of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and above all things to make choice of such as have formerly been Governors of
places; for if by a long experience he be not intelligent in such employments, the Country
or City where such Tumults shall arise, run a manifest danger. I had been Governor of

I had taken the way of execution,<note place="margin">The Nature of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>

speeches: but my discretion govern'd me upon this occasion; neither ought a man to
suffer himself to be hurried away by his own inclination, or transported by his passion,
forasmuch as his Masters affairs will suffer by it. There were enow in the City that would
have been glad to have cut out work enough, in hatred to the chief President, who was
never much belov'd amongst them: but whether he were hated with reason, or otherwise
I referre to others to determine. Monsieur <hi>de Bourdeaux</hi> who is yet living, knows very
well what intelligence a certain person brought me as I was walking with him in his
Garden.</p>
            <p>I was then solicited by all the Court of Parliament, all the Gentry, and the whole City,
to accept the Charge the King had conferr'd upon me, which nevertheless I would by no
means be perswaded to do, and had sent away a dispatch to the King and Queen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
their Majesties my most humble thanks, and to excuse my self from that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for I still fancied to my self that that would happen which has since befaln me,
and that this Government would bring upon me the envy and hatred which peradventure
I might otherwise avoid: neither did I ever prophesie any thing of my self that has not
come to pass. Let any one ask President <hi>Lag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Counsellors yet living, who heard my reasons, and who I am confident can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
if the Predictions I then made of my self be come to pass. So it was that at that
time I did not accept it, nor of two dayes after; not that the King did not herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
a greater honor upon me than I deserv'd; nor that I would not have been glad of so
good a fortune; but I had evermore a thousand niceties before my eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier
President <hi>Lagebaston,</hi> the other Presidents his Brethren, and the antient Councellors,
came to my lodging, and gave me very many arguments to perswade me, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side Monsieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Escars</hi> (whom I found there) Monsieur <hi>de
Lieux</hi>
my Brother, Messieurs <hi>de Barsac, d'Vza,</hi> and all the Gentlemen who were with me,
were very pressing upon me, saying that I ought to accept it; and the Jurats, together with
the whole Body of the City did the same; by which means being left single in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I was constrain'd to pass the Wicket, like a man that is thrust into the Gaol; for
so I may say I was forc'd in, and had I been left at liberty, I would have lost my life, or
have perform'd some services that should have been acceptable to the King, and from which
I would have deriv'd some recompence, whereas by the services I have perform'd in my
administration in these parts, I have reapt no other advantage than reproaches and
disgrace. And yet I will be bold to say that no man under heaven could have behav'd
himself better than I did, by the testimony of all the three Estates of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and had
I done such services in the life time of either of the late Kings, <hi>Francis,</hi> or <hi>Henry,</hi> there
had not been a Gentleman in <hi>France</hi> under the Title of a Prince, who had been higher
preferr'd, or in greater esteem than I had been. But God be praised for all; all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence

have been more advantageous to me, to have gone further off from my own Dunghil. And
I would ever advise any friend of mine rather to accept a remote Command, than one

and one Troop of Lighthorse, to the King; the Sieur <hi>de Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> his Ensign. The City of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> had sent him two pieces of
Canon, and one Culverine, which the said Captain <hi>Fleurdelis</hi> met two leagues from <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidan:</hi>
but Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> would not stop his March till first he heard from me. The
Peace being publisht, every one was of opinion that I should countermand him, which I
therefore did, brought back the Artillery, and disbanded all the Foot and Horse, that
the people might no longer be eaten up: sending in like manner to <hi>Tholouze</hi> to do the
same: so that in eight dayes time every one was retir'd to his own home, I making no
question of securing <hi>Guienne</hi> without Garison either of Horse or Foot: which I did, and
so well, that for the space of five years neither Trooper nor Foot Soldier eat so much as a
Hen throughout the whole Province upon the account of arms. I had three pieces of
Canon at <hi>Agen,</hi> and with threats and bravadoes kept all the world in awe, making every
one lay aside his arms, especially fire arms, so that not a man was seen to wear any arms,
the Gentlemen excepted, who were allow'd their Swords and Stillettoes. And for two
Catholick Souldiers that I caused to be hang'd for transgressing the Edict, I stroke so great
a terror into the whole Countrey, that no one dar'd any more to lay hand to his arms.
The Hugonots thinking to escape better cheap, and that I would not offer to punish them;
two other Soldiers of the Religion also transgressed the Edict, whom I likewise immediately
truss'd up to bear company with the others; so that the two Religions seeing there was
no impunity for either of them, and that neither the one nor the other could promise to
themselves any assurance of me if they should offend, they began to love one another, and
to frequent one anothers houses. Thus did I maintain the Peace for the space of five
years betwixt both parties in this Country of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and do believe that if every one
would have taken the same course, without partiality to the one side, or the other, and
have executed justice indifferently upon those who deserv'd it, we had never seen so many
troubles in this Kingdom. And it was no little thing that I perform'd, for I had to do
with as capricious and fanatick head-pieces as any in the whole Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> or
peradventure in all <hi>Europe;</hi> and who governs a <hi>Gascon</hi> may assure himself he has done a
Masterpiece,<note place="margin">The Nature of the <hi>Gasco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nevertheless by playing one while the gentle, and another the austere, I subjected all to me,
without any one so much as once daring to lift up his head. In brief the King was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd,
and his Laws obey'd.</p>
            <p>This was the end of the first Civil War, and the first troubles in those places where I
was, with the account of what I did in them, which is in summe, that if God had not
inspir'd me with courage to oppose the Hugonots in due time, they would have been so
establisht, that it had not been in the power of the King of a long time to have remov'd
them: for I am not of the opinion of those, who say it had signified nothing, and that
though they had been canton'd here, one might have shut them up: It is a rich and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Country as any in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> abounding in Navigable Rivers, strong
Holds, and very good Harbours; how then should such a Country be shut up, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>English,</hi> and other forreign Nations may at all times come to it by Sea? The
King has set but two little value upon it; 'tis well if he do not one day repent it. But
provided these fine talking Gentlemen, who prate at their ease, may have their own arms
at liberty, they care not for any body else, and when one comes to demand of them assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of money (for of every thing else we have but too much) they cry, <hi>let them raise
it upon the Country,</hi> and so the Soldier, not being paid, is necessitated to plunder, and rob,
and the King's Lieutenant to endure it. 'Tis all one say they, <hi>a Country spoiled is not lost.</hi>
O lewd expression, and unworthy of a Counsellor of the Kings, who has the management
of affairs of State! He has not the trouble of it, nor does he bear the reproach; but he
who has the charge of the Province, and whom the people load with continual exerca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Behold then our <hi>Guienne</hi> thus lost, and recover'd, and since maintain'd in peace for the
good of the people; and to my particular and great misfortune: for my Son Captain

by a brave number of Gentlemen Volunteers (for he had above three hundred with him)
and by a great many of the best Officers and Soldiers he could cull out, he embarkt at
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in a Fleet of six Men of War, as well equipt as Vessels could possibly be. I
shall not insist upon the design of this unfortunate Expedition,<note place="margin">He is slain.</note> wherein he lost his life,
being slain with a Musket shot in the Island of <hi>Maderas</hi> going ashore to water, and where
being the Islanders would not peaceably permit him to refresh his Ships, he was constrain'd
to have recourse to violence, to their loss and ruine; but much more to mine, who there
lost my right hand. Had it pleased God to have preserv'd him to me, they had not done
me those charitable Offices at Court they have since done. In short I lost him in the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his age, and then when I expected he should have been both the prop of mine, and
the support of his Country; which has very much miss't him since. I had lost the brave

and prudence. He could not have fail'd of being a good Captain, had God
been pleased to preserve him; but he disposes of us all, as seems best to his own wisdom.
I think this little <hi>Montluc</hi> that he has left me will endeavour to imitate him both in valour
and loyalty to his Prince, which all the <hi>Montluc</hi>'s have ever been eminent for, and if he
prove not such, I disclaim him. Every one knows, and the Queen more than any other,
that I was never the Author of this unfortunate Voyage; and the Admiral knows very
well how much I endeavour'd to break the design; not that I had a mind to keep him

two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which though I might perhaps in my own bosom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
to remove the War from our own doors, I would also have wisht that some other
might have been the occasion of the rupture. My sons design was not to break any
Truce with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> but I saw very well that it was impossible, but he must do it
there, either with him or the King of <hi>Portugal:</hi> For to hear these people talk, a man
would think that the Sea was their own. The Admiral lov'd and esteem'd this poor Son
of mine but too much, having told the King, that never a Prince nor Lord in <hi>France,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

have made ready so great an Equipage. And he said true, for he won the hearts of all
that knew him, and that were enamour'd of the practice of arms; and I was so wise as
to think that fortune was oblig'd to be as favourable to him as she had been to me. For an
old Soldier as I am, I confess I committed a great error, that I did not discover the design
to some other (considering that the Vicount <hi>d'Vza,</hi> and <hi>de Pampadour,</hi> and my young
Son were of the party) who might have tried their fortune, and pursued the Enterprize
projected; which nevertheless I shall not here discover, because the Queen may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture

things, that the night news was brought her of the loss of the Battel of <hi>Dreux</hi> (for some
brave fellow who had not leisure to stay to see what Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> did after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable

with the said Cardinals, to consult what course she should take to save the King; where
in the end it was resolv'd, that if in the morning the news should be confirm'd, she should
try to retire into <hi>Guienne,</hi> though the Journey was very long, accounting that she should
be safer there than in any other part of the Kingdom. May God for ever refuse to assist
me, if hearing this sad story, the tears did not start into my eyes, saying to her these very
words; <hi>Good God! Madam was your Majesty reduc'd to that necessity?</hi> which she assur'd
me, and swore upon her soul. she was, as also did both the Cardinals, and to speak the
truth had this Battel been lost, her Majesty had been in a very deplorable condition, and
I do believe there had been an end of <hi>France;</hi> for the whole State and Religion had been
turn'd topsie turvy, and with a young King every body does what they will.</p>
            <p>Now their Majesties having passed thorough <hi>Guienne,</hi> found all things in a better po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture

               </gap>h kind of doings, who seem'd to be very much astonisht at it, telling me
it was the first syllable she had ever heard of any such thing; and commanding me to
enquire further into the business, which I did, but could get nothing more out of my
Gentleman; for he now lay upon his Guard.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty then was pleased to ask my advice,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Monluc's</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Queen.</note> how she should behave her self in
this business, whereupon I gave her counsel to order it so, that the King himself should
say in publick, that he had heard of a League that was forming in his Kingdom, which
no one could do without giving him some jealousie and offence: and that therefore he
must require every one without exception to break off this League, and that he would
make an association in his Kingdom, of which he himself would be the Head; for so for
some time it was call'd, though they afterwards chang'd the name, and call'd it the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation
of the King. The Queen at the time that I gave her this advice did by no
means approve of it, objecting, that should the King make one, it was to be feared that
others would make another; but I made answer and said, that the King must engage in
his own all such as were in any capacity of doing the contrary, which however was a
thing that could not be conceal'd, and might well enough be provided against. Two dayes
after her Majesty being at Supper called me to her, and told me, that she had consider'd
better of the affair I had spoke to her about, and found my counsel to be very good, and
that the next day, without further delay, she would make the King propound the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his Council; which she accordingly did, and sent to enquire for me at my lodging,
but I was not within. In the Evening she askt me why I did not come to her, and
commanded me not to fail to come the next day, because there were several great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the Council, of which they had not been able to determine. I came according to
her command,<note place="margin">The advice of Messieurs de <hi>Nemours,</hi> and de <hi>Montpensier.</hi>
               </note> and there were several disputes. Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> made very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Speech, remonstrating <q>That it would be very convenient to make a League and Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
for the good of the King and his Kingdom, to the end, that if affairs should so
require, every one with one and the same will might repair to his Majesties person, to
stake their lives and fortunes for his service, and also in case any one of what Religion
soever, should offer to invade or assault them, or raise any commotion in the State, that
they might with one accord unite, and expose their lives in their common defence.</q> The
Duke of <hi>Montpensier</hi> was of the same opinion, and several others, saying, that this could
not choose but so much the more secure the peace of the Kingdom when it should be
known, that all the Nobility were thus united for the defence of the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Queen then did me the honor to command me to speak;<note place="margin">The advice of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> whereupon I began, and
said, <q>That the League propos'd could be no wayes prejudicial to the King, being that
it tended to a good end for his Majesties service, the good of his Kingdom, and the
peace and security of his People; but that one which should be form'd in private could
produce nothing but disorder and mischief: for the good could not answer for the
evil dispos'd; and should the Cards once be shuffled betwixt League and League, it
would be a hard matter to make of it a good game; that being the most infallible way
to open a door to let Strangers into the Kingdom, and to expose all things to spoil and
ruine; but that all of us in general, both Princes and others, ought to make an Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
which should bear the Title of the League, or the Confederation of the King,
and to take a great and solemn Oath, not to decline or swerve from it upon penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
declar'd such as the Oath should import: and that his Majesty having so concluded,
ought to dispatch Messsengers to all parts of the Kingdom, with Commission to take the
Oathes of such as were not there present, by which means it would be known, who were
willing to live and die in the service of the King and State. And should any one be
so foolish or impudent, as to offer to take arms, let us all Sir swear to fall upon them;
I warrant your Majesty I will take such order in these parts, that nothing shall stirre to
the prejudice of your royal Authority. And in like manner let us engage by the faith
we owe to God, that if any Counter-League shall disclose it self, we will give your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
immediate notice of it: and let your Majestie's be subscrib'd by all the great men
of your Kingdom. The Feast will not be right without them, and they also are easie

            </p>
            <p>This was my Proposition, upon which several disputes ensued; but in the end the
King's Association was concluded on, and it was agreed, that all the Princes, great Lords,
Governors of Provinces, and Captains of Gens d' arms should renounce all Leagues and
Confederacies whatsoever, as well without as within the Kingdom, excepting that of the
King, and should take the Oath upon pain of being declar'd Rebels to the Crown; to
which there were also other obligations added, which I do not remember. There arose
several difficulties about couching the Articles, some saying they were to be couch'd after
one manner, and others after another; for in these great, as well as in our inferior
Councils there is black and white, and obstinacy and dissimulation, and some perhaps
there were, who though they set a good face on the matter, were elsewhere engag'd. So
goes the World. O '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is a miserable thing when a Kingdom falls to a King in minority,
had he then had the knowledge that he has had since, I do believe he would have made
some people speak good <hi>French.</hi> In the end all was past and concluded, and the Princes
began to take the Oath, and to sign the Articles, where though I was but a poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the King would also that I should sign with them, by reason of the charge I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, and it was also sent to the Constable at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> who sign'd it there. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side they sent to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> to the Admiral, Monsieur <hi>d' Andelot,</hi> and other
Lords and Gover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ors of <hi>France;</hi> and at the return of the Messengers the King (as I was
told) caus'd an Instrument to be ingrost of all, and put amongst the Records of the Crown.
I do believe it cannot be lost, and that there a man may see in black and white some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
forsworn to some purpose. I know not who was the beginning of the War <hi>a la St.
Michel;</hi> but whoever it was I know he went contrary to his Oath, and that the King, if
he so pleased, might justly declare him perjur'd, forasmuch as he stands obliged by his
Oath, and his own hand and seal are against him: neither would he have any wrong
done him, because he was consenting to the conditions. And although there was no fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
work in this affair, I do nevertheless conceive, that I did the King and Queen a good
piece of service in discovering this practice, which had it not been discover'd, matters
might peradventure have gone worse than they did.</p>
            <p>The King at his return from <hi>Bayonne</hi> took his way towards <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and <hi>Rochelle,</hi> to
which place I attended him, and there he commanded me to return, giving me instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to cause the Edicts of Pacification to be inviolably observ'd; which I have ever done;
neither can it be said that the War began in my Government: and also if they had begun
with me, they would have had no great match on't, neither could they have taken me
unprovided: but their design was at the head. The Queen who is yet living may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what I said to her concerning <hi>Rochelle;</hi> for had this feather been pluckt from the
Hugonots wing; and secur'd to his Majesties devotion, as I advis'd her it ought to be,
<hi>France</hi> had never seen those many mischiefs that have follow'd since.<note place="margin">The timerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Queen Mother</note> But she was so ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and fearful of giving any occasion of new trouble, that she durst attempt to alter
nothing, and I know very well, that she one night entertein'd me above two hours, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of nothing but things that had past during the life-time of the King her Husband my
good Master. And yet one, who was none of the least, went and reported that I was
contriving something to the prejudice of the Peace. Would to God her Majesty had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
my advice, <hi>Rochelle</hi> should never have dar'd to have mutter'd.</p>
            <p>Now as the King was going out of <hi>Brittany,</hi> to take his way to <hi>Blois,</hi> I had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seen to go up and down with great horses in small parties, carrying Sumpters along with
them, wherein 'twas said they carried their Arms and Pistols. Three or four times I gave
the Queen notice of it, but she would never give credit to my intelligence. In the end
I sent to her <hi>Martineau,</hi> the same who at this present is<note n="*" place="margin">A kind of Secretary who is to give an account of the charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Warre.</note> Comptroller of the Wars, who
was not very welcome to bring such news, and three dayes after his arrival at Court <hi>Boery</hi>
a Secretary of mine arriv'd also with other intelligence from me to the Queen, that they
all march't openly day and night, though I think she would hardly have believ'd it,
had it not been, that at the same time her Majesty had advertisements from all the other
Governments of the Kingdom, which made the King go in all diligence directly to <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins.</hi>
I know not to what this tended, nor why they march'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

after that manner, but it ought to have been known, and it was a sign of no good: for
without the knowledge of the King, or his Lieutenant, no one ought to have attempted
any such thing: and had it not been that I was afraid of being accused for breaking the
Peace, I would soon have sent them to their own houses with a vengeance: for I did not
sleep. I went however very well accompanied with a good number of Gentlemen, and

intelligence. And now I will begin the War <hi>de la St. Michel,</hi> which were the second
Troubles.</p>
            <p>Though it has been said, and I know it also to be true, that the Hugonots did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

now as in the former troubles, our Cards were so shuffled, and confused, as nothing could
be more, and these people were not now so hot in their Religion, as they had formerly
been; many either out of fear, or for good will, came to us, so that we began to be soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and to converse with one another. The fear also they were in of me made some few
my friends, or at least seem to be. About two Moneths and a half before <hi>la Sainct Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi>
I had notice by a Gentleman, and another rich man in the Country, who knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of one another, that the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> and the Admiral, had sent to them all to
make themselves ready, with horses and arms, as many as had wherewithal to procure
them, and that those who had not, should arm themselves as well as they could; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that they should lay in great store of Corn and other provisions of Victual at <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an.</hi>
I judg'd this intelligence to be very probable, forasmuch as there was not a horse to
be bought for money in the whole Country, and some there were who sent to the Passes of
<hi>Spain</hi> to furnish themselves from thence, and nothing was too dear, young nor old. I
therefore dispatcht away the Sieur <hi>de Lussan</hi> post to the Queen, to give her an account of
all these things, but her Majesty would believe nothing, sending me word that I was not
to give credit to such informations, and was only to take care, that the Edicts were duly
observ'd.<note place="margin">The Hugonots begin to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

practise still continued, and that they had a private Assembly at <hi>Montauban,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at <hi>Tholouze</hi> in the House of <hi>Dacetat.</hi> I again sent the Queen word of all I had heard;
but her Majesty would never be induc'd to believe any thing, though I sent three or four
Messengers one after another. In the end she grew so angry at my frequent and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Advertisements, that she commanded <hi>Araignes Sindic</hi> of <hi>Condommois,</hi> to bid me s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd
her no more, for that she knew the contrary of what I sent her intelligence, and said
moreover, it seem'd as if I was afraid, and I had word also sent me by others, that they
laught and jeer'd at me in the Council, calling me Trompe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter and make-war, they might
have said more because I did not hear them; but had I been within a Pikes length, I
should have made some of them silent that spoke very loud. I except those that ought
to be excepted: but these Countiers, who never handle other Iron than a knife and fork,
prate at their own pleasure, and play the Demi-Gods, and keep a clutter, as if nothing
could be well but what passes through their learned Coxcombs. Nothing of this kind is
strange from such people as those; but I could not but wonder that the Queen being a
woman of so great understanding, and knowing what she said to me, should use me so.
There was no remedy; for I was so far off I could make no reply.</p>
            <p>About fifteen or twenty dayes before <hi>la Sainct Michel,</hi> I went to dine at a Gentlemans
house a friend of mine, to which place also came one of those who used to give me intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
who told me, that but two dayes before one of the Admiral's Gentlemen passed by
<hi>Montauban,</hi> and that he was going post from Church to Church, to give them notice to
be all in a readiness to rise at the time, when another Gentleman from the said Admiral,
or the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> should come to call them out, which at the furthest would be within
fifteen or twenty dayes. I thereupon entreated him, that if he should be in <hi>Montau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an</hi> at
the time when the Gentleman should come thither, that he would save all the Catholicks
that were in it, which he promised he would do; and so I departed thence and came to
<hi>Cassaigne,</hi> where I met with a Letter from a Gentleman, who was at that time at <hi>Tholouze,</hi>
wherein he gave me the same advice: but being the Letter was not sign'd, I would not
send it to the Queen, doubting she should not believe it. The next day there came to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

was going post to Court to obtein her Majesties Letters in the behalf of his Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
concerning a Suit they had depending in the Parliament of <hi>Tholouze.</hi> I gave credit
to those who gave me intelligence, and they were faithful to me; forasmuch as of three
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105656:153"/>
they were, two of them had occasion to use me, in the concern of some Estates they were
in suit about, and upon that occasion it was, that I knew by their complexion they were not
so zealous in their Religion, but that they had a greater kindness for worldly concerns,
and would forsake Religion, Ministers, and all, to gain that for which they were in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.
(I believe this Religion is nothing but a meer cheat) and without me they could not
do their business: neither was I wanting to assist them all I could, that I might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
intelligence from them:<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Kings service.</note> for I had some interest, and was well belov'd in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments

               </gap>te their kindness, forasmuch as I ever found them very affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to the Kings service. I then intreated the Baron <hi>de Gondrin</hi> 
               <q>to present my most
humble and obedient service to the Queen, and to desire her Majesty to remember, that
she had never been pleased to give any credit to the several advertisements I had continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given her upon all occasions; and to tell her that her own eyes would shortly weep for
her unbelief; that her Majesty had sent me word <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he thought I was afraid; and that in
the Kings Council they had been pleased to call me Trompetter, and Make-war; but
that I did most humbly beseech her Majesty to believe, that I had no other apprechensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for my self, who God be thanked was born without fear, and knew not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to any other than what an honest man ought to have: But that I was afraid of
the King, and of her, they being threatned with no less than death, or imprisonment;
and that therefore she should look to her self for a few dayes, and detein the King from
going so often a hunting, and appearing so much in publick as he used to do; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if she had a mind to save his life and his Crown.</q> The Baron <hi>de Gondrin</hi> acquitted
himself faithfully of his Commission, and told me her Majesty had made answer, that
she would give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar to no intelligence I should send her, and that she better knew the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots

               </gap> and that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
nothing but peace. These people pursued their practises with great cunning, and a
far off, and she was certainly charm'd by some of their Agents. The said Sieur <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tespan</hi>
made so great haste, that he return'd ten or twelve dayes before <hi>la St. Michel,</hi> and
told me what answer her Majesty had given him. It is impossible, but that as I have said,
she was either gull'd or bewitch'd by some one or other she had about her, who did it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of malice or ignorance: but it was however a most strange thing, that she should
be so deluded, it being a thing so notoriously publick with us, that so much as the very
Pages and Footmen knew of the Preparation the Hugonots made to rise, and before the
said Baron <hi>de Gondrin</hi> return'd, I had inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ligence, that eight dayes before or eight dayes
after <hi>la Sainct Michel,</hi> the Admirals Gentleman was certainly to come. Upon these slight
answers of the Queens I had like to have committed a very great error, in laying aside all
suspicion, believing that her Majesty was better enform'd than I, and that therefore I
ought no more to give credit to those who gave me these daily advertisements. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

and sometimes to another, till at length I was surpriz'd in a house, and carried before the
new King, who was walking betwixt two great men in a Church. He was low of stature,
but gross, and well knit, and had on his head a square velvet Cap, such a one as they
wore in former times. The Archers of his Guard were clad in yellow, red, and black,

would by and by talk to me again. They then set me by a Chest that stood hard by
the Church door, and those who were to look to me fell to talking with the Archers of
the Guard. As I was there standing by this Chest, I began to think of the king, and
repented me of the oath of Fidelity I had taken; for that peradventure the King might
not be yet dead, and that if I could escape away, I would rather wander alone, and
on foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, throughout the world to seek the King if he were yet alive; and thereupon took
a resolution to run away. Thus resolv'd I went out of the Church, and being got into
the Street began to run, and never thought of my hip, for me-thought I ran faster than
I would, when on a sudden I heard a cry behind me, <hi>stop the villain;</hi> whereupon some
came out of their houses to take me, and others stood in my way; but still I escap'd both
from the one, and the other, and recover'd a pair of stone stairs that went up to the
Wall of the Town, where coming to the top, I lookt down, and methought the Precipice
was so great, thet I could hardly see to the bottom. They mounted the stairs after me, and
I had nothing wherewith to defend my self, but three or four stones that I threw at them,
and had a great mind to make them kill me; for me-thought they would put me to a
cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l death; when having nothing left to defend my self withall, I threw my self head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the Battlements, and in falling awaked, and found my self all on a water, as
if I had come out of a River, my Shir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who presently made a fire, took off my wet shirt, and gave me another. They went also
to Madam <hi>de Panias,</hi> who commanded another pair of Sheets to be given them, and her
self rose and came into my Chamber, and saw the Sheets, Blankets, and Counterpain
all wet, and never departed the room till all was dried; which whilst they were in doing,
I told her my dream, and the fright I had been in, which had put me into this sweat;
She remembers it as well as <hi>I.</hi> The Dream <hi>I</hi> dreamt of the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> my good
Master, and this put me into a greater weakness than if <hi>I</hi> had had a continued Fever for
a whole week together. The Physitians told me that it was nothing but force of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
my mind being wholly taken up with these thoughts: And <hi>I</hi> do believe it was so;
for <hi>I</hi> have fancied my self in the night fighting with the Enemy, dreaming of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
and the successes also <hi>I</hi> afterwards saw come to pass. <hi>I</hi> have had that misfortune
all my life, that sleeping and waking <hi>I</hi> have never been at rest, and was alwayes sure
when <hi>I</hi> had any thing working in my head that <hi>I</hi> was to do, not to fail to dream all that
night; which is very troublesome.</p>
            <p>The next day being Sunday they would needs have had me away to the Baths; but <hi>I</hi>
would never be perswaded to go; for it still ran in my mind, that some disaster would
befall the King, ever remembring my dream about King <hi>Henry;</hi> so that for all they could
say upon Monday we return'd.<note place="margin">Intelligence of the design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lectoure.</hi>
               </note> Upon Thursday came a Consul from <hi>Lectoure,</hi> who told
me that Monsieur <hi>de Fonterailles,</hi> Seneschal of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> kept himself shut up in his Castle,
and stirr'd not out, and that all night they heard a knocking within against some Wall,
or Wood, and that the Hugonots of the City were secretly providing arms. <hi>I</hi> made
him to return, assuring him, that the Sieur <hi>de Fonterailles</hi> would never do any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Kings service, which <hi>I</hi> said, relying upon his word, and a promise he had
made me in my House at <hi>Agen.</hi> But the said Consul would not take this for current
pay: wherefore <hi>I</hi> bad him to pry more narrowly into what the Seneschal was doing.
Upon Friday there came to me two Consuls from <hi>Moissac,</hi> who came to tell me, that two
of the Kings Officers of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and several others were fled to <hi>Moissac,</hi> upon some
apparences they had seen in the said <hi>Montauban</hi> of the taking of Arms. <hi>I</hi> made these also
to return, giving them in charge that without any bustle, or raising of arms, they should
be careful of the preservation of their Town, and that if they should hear, that the others

Monsieur <hi>de St. Laurence,</hi> it presently came into my fancy, that these might be some of
the said <hi>St. Laurence</hi> his people, who were going to execute some distress for Costs against
the said Marquis, and made no other account of it. About break of day I arose, and
looking out of the window whilst my man was trussing me, to see if Monsieur <hi>de Saincto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi>
came, there comes in a man on horseback, who came from a place upon the River
<hi>Garonne,</hi> whom I will not name, for fear he should be kill'd; for the man that sent him
to me is yet living; and as I was opening the Letter my <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> saw a Ticket fall
down upon the floor. I fell to reading the Letter, the contents whereof were, <hi>that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
me to give him leave to sell a Quintal of Pepper to a Portuguese,</hi> which made me in
a rage tear the Letter to pieces, cursing all the Portuguese to the pit of Hell; for it put me
in mind of the death of my Son at the <hi>Maderas.</hi> This Letter was only purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
to enclose the Ticket, and my <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> began to gather up the Ticket, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me it fell out as I open'd the Letter. I then fell to reading the Ticket, where it was
thus written,<note place="margin">Advertisement to the Sieur <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and</hi> Montluc <hi>dead.</hi> These were the very words of the Ticket; which put me quite out
of the humour of Hawking, and reconcil'd me to the Portugal; so that I immediately
sent away Captain <hi>Mauries,</hi> who had been Lieutenant to the late Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
Captain <hi>Iean</hi> of <hi>Agen,</hi> and <hi>Tibanville</hi> Commissaries of the Artillery, commanding
them to go directly towards Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> his house, whom they would meet
by the way, and bid him return home, and send notice to Monsieur <hi>de Tilladet</hi> his Brother,
and the Gentlemen his Neighbours, to come by ten of the clock to <hi>Sampoy</hi> (a Town in
the Kings possession, where I have a house) with their horses and arms, without any noise
at all; for we were within a league of one another. I gave them also in charge, that so soon
as they had spoke with Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens,</hi> they should gallop away to <hi>Lectoure,</hi>
which was three leagues from <hi>Cassaigne</hi> (for what the Consul had told me came into my
head, and it was very probable, that to cut out work in <hi>Gascony</hi> they would begin with
this strong place) giving them instructions withal, that so soon as they should come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
sight of the Castle, to ride softly, pretending to be Merchants, and enter in by the
Gate of the Bulwark (doubting the Seneschal might have taken some people into the Castle
by the Postern Gate, who if they perceiv'd themselves once to be suspected, might presently
seize upon the Town by the help of the Hugonots who were in it) but that so soon as
they should be got in, they should talk privately with the Consul, possessing themselves
of the said Gate of the Bulwark, and that dead or alive I might find them within it; for
I would soon be with them; which they accordingly did. I sent Dispatches also to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

Company call'd <hi>Seridos,</hi> and two Sons of Monsieur <hi>de Beraud,</hi> who were also of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
their Father being sick, and a Kinsman of mine call'd Monsieur <hi>de la Vit.</hi> I staid
there for Monsieur <hi>de Verduzan</hi> till twelve a clock, when seeing no body come, I resolv'd
to go to <hi>Lectoure</hi> without expecting any longer, where also I doubted I should come with
the latest. Those who were in my company remonstrated to me, that if the Seneschal
was crafty, and that he had men in the Castle he would easily defeat me in the Town;
to which I made answer, that should I longer deferre going, he would have notice of the
three Gentlemen I had sent before, and would so secure the Gates, that I should not be
able to enter, and that it was better for us to venture our lives in the Town, than to keep
out, and suffer the Town to be lost. We then mounted to horse, being no more than six
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:105656:155"/>
Light-horse, and we might be in all (the Servants compriz'd) thirty horse. I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fourteen Harquebuzeers to follow after me, under the conduct of a Priest called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laubaere,</hi>
commanding them to follow at a good shog trot, and so we marcht with these
mighty Forces. When we came near unto <hi>Terraube,</hi> a little league from <hi>Lectoure,</hi> there
came a man on horseback, dispatcht away by the Consul and Captain <hi>Mauriez,</hi> by whom
they sent me word, that they had possessed themselves of the Gates, and that the City
was all in arms, desiring to know by which Gate I would enter, I told him by the Gate
of the Castle; whereupon he return'd upon the spur as he came. By good fortune

               </note> and so we entred into the Town. So soon as we were come into
Monsieur <hi>de Poisegurs</hi> house, I entreated the Sieur <hi>de Lussan</hi> to go bid Monsieur <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terailles</hi>
come and speak with me, for I had something to say to him that concerned his
Majesties service. He sent me word back, <hi>that he would not come, and that he was in the
Castle in the behalf of the Queen of</hi> Navarre, <hi>Lady and Mistress of the said Castle and

Castle, and at the ringing of the Tocquesaint call in all the neighbouring Towns to my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi>

have the Castle to put people into it, who were of the Religion of the King, and a Gentleman
to command them, till I should see to what the beginning of this Commotian tended;</hi> to which
he made answer, <hi>that he was a faithful Servant of the Kings, and that he would rather die
than do any thing contrary to his Majesties pleasure.</hi> To which I replied again, <hi>that I did
believe him to be so, but that notwithstanding I would in the mean time s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that I had a greater confidence in my self than in him;</hi> and after some disputes Monsieur
<hi>de Sainctorens</hi> put in, and said something, to which the other replied briskly upon him:
but he did not go without his answer; and had he not suddenly resolv'd, I was about to
have taken him prisoner. Monsieur <hi>de Lussan</hi> then took him aside, remonstrating to him,
<hi>that he was highly too blame not to obey, and that it was as much as his life was worth; for I
would die there but I would have it, and that he himself knew well enough what a kind a man
I was.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Fonterailles</hi> thereupon came to me, and told me, <hi>that he was ready to
deliver up the Castle into my hands, but that he earnestly begg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of me, that I would permit
him to reenter into it, and sleep there that night, that he might pack up all the goods he had
there, ready to go away in the morning.</hi> I desir'd him on the contrary, <hi>that he would not

                  </gap>er to stir out of the Town, and that I would deliver the Guard of the Castle to such Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Gentlemen as he should name.</hi> He therefore nam'd several, but I would like of none
of them, when seeing I would not put in those he desir'd, he nam'd Monsieur <hi>de Cassaigne</hi>
(a neighbour to the Town, who since has been Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>d' Arnes</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
with whom I was content, and sent presently for him. However I plaid the Novice
in one thing, for I let the said Sieur <hi>de Fonterailles</hi> go in again upon his word into the
Castle, which was not discreetly done; for a man should alwayes in such cases take all
things at the worst.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Verduzan</hi> arriv'd with four or five Gentlemen in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with him, and presently after Monsieur <hi>de Maignas,</hi> and every hour some or other
came in to us. After Supper we went out of the Castle, where I fell to view and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Postern of the false Bray, and began to remonstrate to those friends who were with
me, that in case the Seneschal should have made an appointment for those of his Party
to come that night to the Portal, the Guards and Centinels of the Town could not possibly
hinder him from letting in whom he pleased, wherefore I was resolv'd to lodge <hi>Thean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
Commissary of the Artillery, and the Priest with the fourteen Harquebuzeers in the
false Bray, betwixt the two Portals; and it was well for me I did so, for otherwise they had
trapp'd us, and cut all our throats that night. See how a man may fall into danger
thorough his own fault: for I thought my self wonderful wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e and circumspect; and
yet notwithstanding I put a place of so great importance, together with the whole Country
in danger to be lost. I was not yet satisfied with this Guard, but I moreover order'd all
the Gentlemen and their Servants to lie down in their Cloaths,<note place="margin">Order given to the Captains.</note> and sent a command to all
those of the Town to do the same. In the morning by Sun-rise the said Seneschal came
to me again,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Fonterailles</hi> delivers up the Castle of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoure</hi> to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>

that honor was to be attributed to</hi> Potton, <hi>and</hi> la Hire, <hi>of whose valour all the Chronicles are full.
For</hi> la Hire <hi>and</hi> Potton, <hi>two</hi> Gascon <hi>Gentlemen, were indeed cause of the recovery of the
Kingdom of</hi> France: <hi>yet would I not deny but that his Grand father was a great and valiant
Captain,<note n="*" place="margin">The ordinary men at arms in <hi>France</hi> first reduc'd by <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th in the year 1444 into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular orders, one whereof was that the Gen-d'arm must at the youngest be twenty, and one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, and must have been one year at least an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, which no man was to be but a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man born, or one that had been a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Lieut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant, Ensign, or Serjeant-Major of a Foot Company six years. Who was also by the order of his admission to keep three Horses, two for service, and one for his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, in regard whereof he had 400 Livers <hi>Tournon</hi> yearly entertainment.

In recompence whereof the King also married him to the Inheritrix of</hi> Chattillon, <hi>by whom
he had seven or eight thousand Livers yearly revenue: but that the House from which his
Father descended, which was that of</hi> Fonterailles, <hi>was as mean a Family as mine;</hi> At which
he broke out into a sudden passion, saying, <hi>would to God, would to God I might die at this

have you to wish your own death for the Prince of</hi> Navarre, <hi>seeing that neither you, nor any
of your Race, have ever receiv'd any benefit or honor from the House of</hi> Navarre, <hi>nor other,
than from the King?</hi> to which he replied, <hi>that it was true, but that he did so love the
Prince of</hi> Navarre, <hi>that he would be content to die upon that condition.</hi> I then began to
suspect there was some knavery in the wind, and so he bad me farewel. Monsieur <hi>de la
Cassaigne,</hi> who was present at all this discourse, waited upon him to his Horse, where,
as he was going to put foot in the stirrup, he cried out like a man in dispair, <hi>O unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

blame to complain of me, who had treated him with all the civility h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or desire,</hi> and that perhaps another would not have used him with so great respect, as I
had done; to which he replied in these words, <hi>but you do not know all; this day the
Kingdom is set to sail, farewell</hi> France; and so mounting to horse, he went directly <hi>to
la Garde,</hi> the House of Monsieur <hi>de Firmacon</hi> his Uncle.</p>
            <p>Before the Sieur <hi>de la Cassaigne</hi> could return back to me there came fifteen or sixteen
Peasants loaden with Harquebuzes, Halberts, and Cross-bows, leading a boy prisoner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them, whom they brought into my Chamber, in the presence of all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that were there, telling me they were of <hi>la Masquere,</hi> within a quarter of a league
of <hi>Lectoure</hi> (which is a little Hamlet consisting of seven or eight Tenements) and that at
midnight there came a great company of armed men, both horse and foot, and drew
themselves into a great Meadow close by the houses, where they laid them down upon
the ground. The poor people saw them, and durst not stir out of their houses: but they
saw them send six horse-men as far as the Suburbs of <hi>Lectoure,</hi> where they met intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that I with a great number of Gentlemen was entred into the Town; and had also
sent to discover those whom I had planted without to hinder the relief: by which seeing
their enterprise was defeated, and concluding that the Seneschal was taken prisoner, they
return'd full speed to their Troops, telling them that I was entred into the Town, and
had taken the Senescal prisoner, wherefore they must retire before it was day, that they
might not be known. And (as the night has no shame) they took so great a fright at the
news, that they began to throw away their arms in flying, and by break of day passed by
<hi>Plieux,</hi> where the common people began to pursue them, and they running away to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
their arms, which the Inhabitants of <hi>Plieux</hi> had almost all, excepting some
few that fell into the hands of those of <hi>la Maquere.</hi> The horse ran straight to their
other Troop that had made a halt at <hi>St. Rose,</hi> till they should be commanded to march;
who also took a terrible fright in retiring, running every man as fast as his horse would
carry him to his own house. The chief Leaders of these two Parties of Horse and Foot
were the Sieur <hi>de Montamat,</hi> brother to the Seneschal, the Sieurs <hi>de Castelnau, d' Audax,
de Popas,</hi> and <hi>de Peyrecave.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Hugonots come too late to relieve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoure.</note> I knew nothing as yet of the Troop at <hi>St. Rose,</hi> for neither
the Boy nor the Boors of <hi>la Masquere</hi> had heard of any other than that they had seen.
All the Gentlemen hereupon advis'd me to go take the Seneschal, and clap him up priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which nevertheless I would not do out of respect to the House of <hi>Firmacon,</hi> to which
he was a Nephew, remonstrating to them, that should I take him prisoner, the Court
of Parliament of <hi>Tholouze</hi> would immediately send to demand him of me, whom I could
not justly deny, and if they once got him, he would not be two hours alive, and I would
by no means be the occasion of his ruine.</p>

               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:105656:156"/>Whilst we were in these disputes, Monsieur <hi>de la Cassaigne</hi> came, and told me the words
he had said to him at his going away, no body being by; whereupon I entreated him
to go into the Town to seek out some Hugonot, who was a friend to the Seneschal, and
to give him all as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he would reveal the Enterprize. He went then to speak with one who was a very
intimate friend of his, telling him what words the Seneschal had cast out at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that it was as much as his life was worth, if he did not discover all he knew:
who after he had given him all the assurance he desir'd, made him this reply. <hi>What did

and take care, that we may have no harm done us; for there is not a person of the Religion,
who knows any thing of the Enterprize of</hi> France, <hi>and of this Town, but those who are gone

Queen shall be taken or dead, and all the whole Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>revolted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray consider a little how closely these people could carry on such an Enterprize as
this: I was told that in their Consistory they made them swear to renounce Paradice, if
they ever reveal'd any thing. Monsieur <hi>de la Cassaigne</hi> returned presently to me, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
me aside told me all that the other had said to him, and then I remembred my self
of the Advertisements in the Ticket, and of my unfortunate Dream, and began with
tears in my eyes to declare all I had heard to Messieurs the Seneschal of <hi>Bazadois, de
Sainctorens,</hi> and to all the Gentlemen who were present, who all began to cry out, <hi>that we
ought to mount presently to horse; and gallop after the Seneschal,</hi> which nevertheless I
would not do for the aforementioned reasons, remonstrating to them, <hi>that though he
should be taken, the evil would not be prevented by the sei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mischief was sufficiently discover'd by the words he had cast out to Monsieur</hi> de la Cassaigne:
<hi>which also this other had confirm'd to him: but that I would presently send away to all the
Gentlemen, to give notice to all the other Gentry, and their Neighbours, to assemble together
for the common safety,</hi> which I did, and was very glad within my self, in this ill aspect of
affairs, to have pluckt so considerable a feather from their wing.</p>
            <p>I sent immediately post to <hi>Tholouze</hi> to advertize the Court and the Capitouls, that they
must forthwith betake themselves to arms, and employ all they could wrap and wring,
either to succour the King, if he was living; or to revenge his death, if he were dead. I
caused some provisions immediately to be put into the Castle, and left the fourteen Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
with Monsieur <hi>de la Cassaigne,</hi> sending to the Soldiers of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillac</hi>
forthwith to come, and put themselves into the Town, and that they were to obey
Monsieur <hi>de la Cassaigne.</hi> Whilst I was about these dispatches there arriv'd Monsieur <hi>de
la Chappelle,</hi> Vice-Senescal, and Monsieur <hi>de Romegas</hi> (the same who has so signaliz'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
against the Turk at <hi>Malta)</hi> who had both of them been all night on horse-back,
by reason that a Hugonot (whose life Monsieur <hi>de la Chapelle</hi> had sav'd) came ad midnight
to give them notice that we were marching directly to <hi>Lectoure,</hi> where the Seneschal was
by the Postern to let them in. Upon this intelligence they had mounted to horse (for
they were near Neighbours) and put themselves into a little Wood, where they discover'd
these people, who were retiring in great fear, but durst not stir out of the Wood, having
no more than seven or eight horse; but so soon as it was day took their way towards <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoure,</hi>
though they fear'd it was already taken, and as they came to the Town were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that I was within it, where they told me of the disorder they had seen in the
Troop of <hi>St. Rose,</hi> and then we knew that they had been in two Troops. Monsieur <hi>de la
Chappelle</hi> then beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> to enform himself on his part, and the Court of Parliament sent in
all dilligence to enform themselves on theirs. The Indictment was drawn up, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or more Witnesses examin'd, the most of which were of the new Religion, and who
had actually been in those forenamed Troops, who all depos'd one and the same thing,
of a Conspiracy plotted against the King and State.</p>
            <p>In the progress of the Tryal the Witnesses gave evidence of the Enterprize, which was,
That that very night <hi>de la St. Michel</hi> the Seneschal was to let in the two Companies of
Foot into the Town by the Postern of the False-Bray, and afterwards into the Castle by
the Postern belonging to it. Of these the Consuls of the Town kept one key, and the
Seneschal another, and so soon as he was gone the Enterprize being discover'd, they went
to examine the two Locks, and found that those of the Consuls were broke open, and put
again into their place, with nails that were not clencht. (All this is couch'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess)
and that after the two Foot Companies should be Masters of the Town, the Horse
were to come at a good round trot before <hi>Cassaigne</hi> where I was, which was but three
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:105656:156"/>
leagues from <hi>Lectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and shut me up in the Castle; and that at the same time all their
Churches of <hi>Nerac, Castelgeloux, Thoneins, Cleirac, Mourejau, Condom, Moncrabeau,</hi> and
other adjacent places were to come flocking about the Castle. These were the fruits of the
good prayers of their Godly Ministers; and being the Castle had no Flanckers, they made
sure to have me in four and twenty hours by sapping. <hi>Rapin</hi> the same day came with
four hundred men to <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nade,</hi> being come from <hi>Montauban,</hi> who so soon as ever he
should have notice that I was shut up, was to march day and night to come before the
said <hi>Cassaigne,</hi> they making account that I could not be reliev'd in eight dayes, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no place of any strength to which any one could repair, they having possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of <hi>Lectoure.</hi> The Enterprize was so laid, as it had been certain, and would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
have taken effect, had I been asleep in the business; or if to move in State like the
Kings Lieutenant, I had staid till morning, that those I had sent for had come in.</p>
            <p>The Kings Lieutenants may here take a good example by me, both as to the good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
I was careful to keep, in my judgment to provide against the present extremity,
and in my prompt resolution (not regarding whether I was weak or strong) to go, as I
did, to put my self into the Town: for all these things together preserv'd the place in
the Kings obedience, together with my own life, and consequently the whole Country,
which had been absolutely lost had I been kill'd, and <hi>Lectoure</hi> taken: for that being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
there had been no place of safety, but within the Gates of <hi>Tholouze</hi> and <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux:</hi>
and when all <hi>France</hi> had heard that <hi>Guienne</hi> was lost, I leave men of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to judge how the Kings affairs would have been discountenanced, and the ardour of
those who stood for him cool'd at the news. I believe the greatest part of them would
have closed with the Enemy. Therefore do not you who are the Kings Lieutenants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to your selves; I must stay for the Nobless, I must go well attended; for if you be
such as you ought to be, that is to say, fear'd, and belov'd, you your self alone are
worth a hundred. Every one that sees you march will come in to your assistance, and
take courage by your example, and your Enemies for one man that you have will say you
have a hundred. It is no time to dally, and stand upon punctillio's in such affairs, for
whilest yo deferre time, to Lord it in greater state, you lose your place. And take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the error I had like to have committed in permitting the Seneschal to go again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Castle upon his word; we live in a time wherein it is the fashion with many to
dispence with the breach of their faith; and a man shall excuse himself that his promise
was extracted from him by force, and in the mean time you are shut out of your Fort.
Never deferre that till to morrow that you can do to day, for it failed but very little that
I was not lost; and had I not set those people without, the Succours had entred, and the
Seneschal had had good reason to laugh at my easiness. This was the Enterprize upon
<hi>Guienne;</hi> and I dare be bold to say, that <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> it self had not been very secure had
my throat been cut: for a Country without a head is in very great danger, and the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots
had very great intelligence, and a very strong party in that City.</p>
            <p>After I had left order with Monsieur <hi>de la Cassaigne</hi> about <hi>Lectoure;</hi> the same Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
(being <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day) I went in all diligence to <hi>Agen,</hi> where so soon as I arriv'd,
I immediately sent for the Sieurs <hi>de Nort</hi> the Kings Counsellor, and <hi>Delas</hi> the Kings
Advocate to come to me, who were assisting to me in all my dispatches, and were ever
my Counsel in all affairs.<note place="margin">Diligence of the Sieur de <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> We sent then for two Clerks of the Town, and two Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of mine, and of all night long we did nothing but write Letters to all the Lords and
Gentlemen of the Country, and I do believe amongst us we writ above two hundred.
The Elder <hi>Brother</hi> of the Counsellor call'd <hi>de Navy</hi> was Consul, who did nothing all
night long but run up and down to seek out Messengers to send every way. I gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in my Letters to every one, as well of the attempt upon <hi>Lectoure,</hi> as of the words
the Seneschal had cast out, and of the other who had confirmed them. I gave them
likewise to understand, <q>that now the Kings good and faithful Subjects would be known,
as also who were good Frenchmen, and that since there had been a King in <hi>France,</hi> so
fair an occasion had never presented it self, wherein to manifest the fidelity we owe to
the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> for at that very time the life of the King was in apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
if not already taken from him, which should it prove so, we were all bound by
the Law of God, Nature, and Nations to revenge his death: or at the least he was
threatned with Captivity, and in such an extremity, those who should sit at home,
ought to be branded for disloyalty, and mark'd for Traitors to their Prince and his
Crown for ever: that the <hi>Gascons</hi> had never hitherto been branded, with those Characters,
and that therefore I begged of them we might not leave such an obloquy upon our own
Posterity, nor our Childrens Children, that should succeed them.</q> In short I omitted
nothing
I could think of that might excite or encline them to betake themselves to arms,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:105656:157"/>
and to succour the King; assigning them all to meet at <hi>Agen</hi> by the tenth of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.

there might be some fault in my self, as I have observ'd in some others, who have
been on the contrary so over-addicted to it, that they had rather be in their Cabinets, than
in the Trenches. News came to me from every side, that every one prepar'd to march,
and I dispatch'd forty Captains of Foot, four Companies of Gens-d'arms, which had been
those of the Sieurs <hi>de Gondrin, de Masses, d' Arne,</hi> and <hi>de Bardozan,</hi> and eight or ten
Cornets of Harquebuzeers on horseback. Of these I gave the Command of the Foot to
Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens,</hi> who was Colonel of the Legionaries, that is to say, fifteen En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

for him, and fifteen for my Son the Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who was in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hom I writ to come away to the Army. After I had heard what had past at the
fine business of <hi>Meaux,</hi> I sent him to the King, besieching his Majesty to conferre upon him
the Command of the fifteen Ensigns; which also he did with a very good will.</p>
            <p>The ninth day after <hi>la Sainct Michel,</hi> as I was walking upon the Sands of <hi>Agen</hi> to see
the Horse and Foot come in from all parts, which I quarter'd on both sides the River
<hi>Garonne,</hi> there came to me Captain <hi>Burée,</hi> who had been eight dayes in coming, and scap'd
narrowly four or five times of being taken, having come most part of the way on foot,
not daring to shew himself at the Post-houses, most of the Post-masters being Hugonots.
He brought me a Letter from the King, and another from the Queen, wherein their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
acquainted me with their fortunes,<note place="margin">The King sends to the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> and how they had been very near being taken,
his Majesty exhorting me once more to preserve for him the Province of <hi>Guienne,</hi> as I had
done in the former troubles. His Majesty in these Letters did not send to me for any
Succours, fearing I should have enough to do to secure the Country with all the forces
I could make in it. The said Captain <hi>de Burie</hi> staid but two hours with me, I sending
him back in all diligence (for so I was to proceed, and had alwayes done so) to assure their
Majesties of the Succours I was about to send into <hi>France,</hi> and to tell them that I hoped
to secure <hi>Guienne</hi> with the Gentlemen only who were Natives of the Province, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Country. But I did not fail to write to the Queen, that she should no more
be so incredulous, nor deaf to my advertisements; and that had she pleased to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the game, and got the start of her Enemies, she had put them quite out of their
play. I then presently dispatch'd away new Messengers to <hi>Tholouze</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and
to all the Gentlemen of that part of the Country, with Copies of the King and Queens
Letters, desiring them to march with all possible expedition to relieve the King, whom
the Enemy had besieg'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> and one thing I can affirm with truth, that I never in
my life either saw, or read in any History of so wonderful a diligence, as every one made
both Horse and Foot to this effect.<note place="margin">The People of <hi>France</hi> very good and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</note> There is not in the whole world so good a People,
nor a Gentry so affectionate to their Prince, had not this new Religion corrupted them;

nine and twenty dayes (accounting from the thirtieth of <hi>September,</hi> that I wrote my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches)
with a thousand or twelve hundred Horse, and thirty Ensigns of Foot, whom I
there muster'd together with the Gens-d'armes, the Treasurer-General <hi>de la Gourgues</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
brought along some money he had taken up for that purpose; for I for my own
part was never accustomed to finger the Kings money. Being at <hi>Limoges</hi> I assembled all
the Lords and Captains of Gens-d'armes in my Chamber, and there deliver'd my self to
them after this manner.</p>

you ought to feel the same joy in your bosoms that I do: for what greater blessing could
God Almighty have conferr'd upon you, than to see your selves assembled together in
so brave and so spritely a body in so short a time on horse-back to go to the relief of your
Prince, for whose defence God has given you life, and made you men, and me also; I
say for the defence of his Person: for, as you very well know, the Masque is now taken

and directly against his person, that this Rebellion is set on foot, and those who
were engag'd in the wicked Enterprize of <hi>Meaux,</hi> as you your selves very well know,
directed the attempt immediately against his Majesties sacred person. How great a
good fortune is it then to see, that God has reserv'd you to revenge so great an injury,
and to assist your King, and natural Prince in so great a necessity? O my Companions!
how much ought you to esteem your selves happy, how highly ought you to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with your fortune? How will the King be ravisht with joy to see such a Nobless
from the extreamest part of his Kingdom, in so short a time, and in so brave an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
come in to his relief? He will never forget so great, and so timely a service, but for
ever acknowledge it to you and yours. Believe me Gentlemen, though I am infinitely
pleased to think, that I have some share in this service, yet I am very sensibly afflicted,
that I am like to have no hand in the main stroke of the business, and that I cannot
have the honor to lead you to this glorious work, that we might go together to lay down
our lives at his Majesties feet for the defence of his life and Crown. May God never
prosper me, if I do not desire it more than ever I did any thing in this world, but you
see it cannot be without putting the whole Province into manifest hazard, which I hope
to preserve with those few Forces are left me in despite of the Enemies practices. It only
then, Gentlemen, remains that you make the haste requir'd, remember what you have
seen me do, and how often you have heard me say, that <hi>diligence is the best part of a
Soldier.</hi> You know not what condition the Kings affairs may be in, nor how pressing
his danger may be; therefore do not delay time I beseech you. I know there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:105656:158"/>Now when <hi>I</hi> thought to have this great diligence of mine very kindly taken, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to receive a return of thanks from their Majesti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s for so opportune a service, I was
quite contrary presented with a Patent, that on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Dragon,</hi> Deputy to the receiver of <hi>Guienne</hi>
brought from Court, and that was sent by the King to Monsieur <hi>de Candalle,</hi> by virtue
whereof his Majesty made the said Sieur <hi>de Candalle</hi> his Lieutenant General in the City of
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Bourdillois,</hi> with as ample commission, and full power, as if I was there.
I was very much surpriz'd at this, and knew very well that some one or another had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me a Traverse at Court, and that the King and Queen would never have put such a
trick upon me, had it not been for some back friend of mine; and thanks be to God the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> have ever such kind of Vermin to spare, who have evermore lent their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
to the best and most faithful servants our Kings have had, which made me not so
much wonder at this last kindness of theirs. It was not the first office of that kind I had
receiv'd at their hands, Monsieur <hi>de la Malassize,</hi> who is yet living, did me one in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania</hi>
to Monsieur <hi>de Guise,</hi> endeavouring by that means to make me be put out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> to make way for Monsieur <hi>de la Molle,</hi> making the Duke believe
that I had spoke unhandsomely of him, which the said Duke gave credit to, and for a
time bore me ill will upon that account. Since in the presence of Monsieur <hi>d'Aumale,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Montpezat,</hi> Messieurs <hi>de Cipierre</hi> and <hi>de Randan</hi> (which two first are dead,
and the other two living) at <hi>Macherate,</hi> I acquitted my self; yet could I not so far dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess
him of his ill conceiv'd opinion, but that some seeds of it remain'd, so that he was
never absolutely reconcil'd till the business of <hi>Thionville.</hi> At my return to <hi>Montalsin</hi> it
faild but very little that I did not cut the throat of him that was the cause, and therefore
'tis no wonder if he continue to do me all the ill offices he can: yet I will not here insert
the reasons for several considerations. I shall still let him proceed to do as he has hitherto
done, managing the Queen, though I hope her Majesty will one day alter her opinion, as
did Monsieur <hi>de Guise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had another good office done me when King <hi>Henry</hi> sent me into <hi>Piedmont</hi> after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from <hi>Sienna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the Siege of <hi>Vulpian.</hi>
               </note> at the taking of <hi>Vlpian,</hi> only because I kept about Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale,</hi>
not sparing my life no more than the meanest Soldier in the Army, and I think they had
no mind that Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> should have the honor to take it, nor other places that
he took; I had there a Letter brought me from the Constable, wherein he writ me word,
that the King had commanded him to write to me, that I should retire to my own house
till further order, charging me, that <hi>I</hi> had said I would not obey Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> as
if I had not alwayes been accustomed to obey him; for I have all my life preferr'd him
before my self in all things; and he did deserve it. Not long before, some body had done
him such another courtesie, saying, that by reason of his Marriage in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the
friendship he had contracted with the <hi>Biragues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Charity lent to Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and to Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale.</hi>
               </note> he might easily seize <hi>Piedmont</hi> into his
own hands; as if either the one or the other had ever so much as thought of any such
thing: however this was sufficient to make him to be call'd back out of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> but he
was too honest a man, and that was not a fit recompence for so many services as he had
done. Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> also had the same piece of service done him, it being reported
to the King, that the Princes would not obey him, and that therefore his Majesty must
send Monsieur <hi>de Termes</hi> to command; as if Monsieur <hi>d' Aumale</hi> was not of a be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter Family
than Monsieur <hi>de Termes,</hi> and that the Princes would sooner obey a private Gentleman,
than one who was a Prince, though he was not of the Royal blood; I can affirm, as having
been an eye-witness, and no man can give a better testimony than my self, that the said
Princes no more spar'd themselves than the meanest Gentleman in the Army, and perform'd
a piece of bravery worthy the noble Families from whence they descended; for they went
on in their own persons to the assault, and mounted the breach at <hi>Vlpian,</hi> scrambling up
with the help of their Pikes, and some few Ladders of Ropes, for the Breach was not
reasonable, as I have said elsewhere before.</p>
            <p>And since I am entred upon the discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se of the good offices honest men have done
them at Court, I will reckon up some others that I have seen in my time, as also some that
I have read of in the Roman Histories. And of these <hi>I</hi> will first mention that which had
like to have cost Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> so dear; which was, that a certain person detein'd
from him a hundred thousand Crowns, which the King had commanded <hi>St. Blanzay</hi> to
send him, wherewith to pay the <hi>Swiss,</hi> which summe had it accordingly been sent, the
<hi>Swiss</hi> had not retir'd into their own Country; for they only return'd for want of pay,
and by that means the Dutchy of <hi>Millan</hi> was lost. Upon which occasion this poor Lord
Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> was hardly thought good enough for the Dogs, for a certain time,
and could never obtein the favour to be heard to justifie himself: but in the end the King
was pleased to hear him,<note place="margin">St. Blanzay <hi>hang'd.</hi>
               </note> and thereupon caused <hi>St. Blanzay</hi> to be hang'd, though the fault
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:105656:158"/>
was none of his; but the poor man paid for't. I know who was the cause of all this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
but I have nothing to do to write it. Oh '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is a tickle thing to serve these great

has ordein'd them to command, and us to obey, and others also obey us, and yet we are

eight dayes have been necessitated to capitulate. O that such a man as this ought to have
been husbanded, for I think that he alone ruin'd the affairs of King <hi>Francis.</hi> Kings and
Princes ought not to use Strangers at that rate; nor their own Subjects neither, when
they know them to be men of service: and if our Master was ill advised, the Emperor
was very discreet to put in in time, to win the said <hi>Auria</hi> over to his side, that the King
might not have leisure to reconcile himself to him, and to reestablish him in his service.

easie mark to be discern'd: when men are mixt in a Battel, the dust, the smoak and the
cries confound a man's judgment; and besides 'tis usual with gallant men to appear in
their greatest bravery, that they may be known in a day of Battel, especially in a War with
Strangers, which is for honor, and not upon the account of animosity: but in a Civil
War 'tis not so proper, Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> being very much endanger'd by so distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his person at the Battel of <hi>Dreux.</hi> Thus did they calumniate this poor Lord, though

he made certain Skip-Jack hirelings pass muster in his Company of Gens-d'armes, to get
so many Pays, which (as it was said) was prov'd to be true, but it was to pay men withal

he had banisht him the Court: but very often those of both Sexes, who govern Princes,
make them do things against their own natures and inclinations, and afterwards they are
sorry for it; but it is too late to repent, when their Traverses have brought upon a Prince
such an inconvenience as is irreparable, and those who would afterwards seem to excuse
them, endeavour to make the matter worse by contriving new accusations, and laying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aspersions upon them. I shall not mention the Constables business, which drave
him also from Court, and all, as it was said, about women; nor that of the late Monsieur
<hi>de Guise,</hi> we have seen them sometimes out, and sometimes in. The King would do well
to stop the mouths of such Ladies as tattle in his Court; for thence proceed all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports

them to meddle with their own affairs (I except those that are to be excepted) for
their tittle tattle has done a great deal of mischief, and after, as I said, it is too late.
These are the good offices that in my time I have seen done several great persons, and also
such poor Gentlemen as my self, all which proceed from the jealousie and envy they bear
to one another, who are near unto the persons of Princes. In the time that I have been
at Court I have seen great dissimulations, and several carry it very fair to one another in

            <p>By this one may judg, that the misfortune into which this Kingdom is fallen, is not
come upon it through any default of courage, or wisdom in our Kings, nor for want of
valiant Captains and Soldiers; for never Kings of <hi>France</hi> had so many both of Horse and
Foot, as <hi>Francis, Henry,</hi> and <hi>Charles;</hi> who had they been employed in forreign Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
would have carried the War far enough from our own doors, and it was a great
misfortune both to them and the whole Kingdome, that they were not so employed,
and yet can we not lay the blame thereof, either to the Church, or the third Estate, for all
that have by the Kings been demanded of them, have been freely granted. Every Child
then may judg where the fault lay, and from whence sprung the Civil Wars; I mean from
the great ones; for they are not wont to make themselves parties for the word of God,

judgment, for having dedicated the spoil of his Conquests to the foundation of Temples,
wherein to sacrifice to their Gods, of which spoil the one half belong'd of right to the
Soldier: but that the Gods might assist them in their Battels and Conquests, he presented
them this gift, saying, <hi>That the Soldiers stood as much in need of the assistance of the Gods
as he.</hi> So that upon his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the reward of the great services he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and the famous Victories he had obtain'd for the Common-wealth, they brought
him to his Tryal: yet did they not nevertheless put him to death, but sent him into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile
to a City the name whereof I do not remember, for it is long ago since I read <hi>Livie,</hi>
not in Latin (of which I have no more than my <hi>Pater Noster)</hi> but in French. Now
when he had remain'd sometime in this City, there came two or three <hi>Gaulish</hi> Kings with
a mighty Army, and took <hi>Rome,</hi> killing almost all the Citizens, saving some few who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into the Capitol, and there held out for some time. <hi>Livie</hi> reports, that one night those
who were thus retir'd into the Capitol were all asleep, and the Enemy had already gain'd
a part of the Capitol, when a Goose begining to cackle awak'd the Guards, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
enter'd into a combat with the Enemy, and repell'd them. At this time the said
<hi>Camillus,</hi> gathering together all the men he could, took the field, where the Enemy finding
nothing more to plunder, nor provisions to maintain their pleasures in <hi>Rome,</hi> having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
themselves all over the Country ten or twelve leagues distant from the City, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

retir'd to the Garrisons where they had lain all Winter, where being come they found that
all their Colonels were slain, and were therefore necessitated to choose one, whom they
call'd the New Captain. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having intelligence that this new General had rallied
the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers who were escap'd from the two defeats, went immediately to assault
them; but was stoutly repus'd, and constrain'd to retire himself to a certain place, where
this valiant Captain fell upon him by night, and not only defeated the Army he had

of nothing but arms? O how many brave Captains would this Kingdom then supply the
world withal, whereas I do believe that two Thirds of the Nation are taken up in these
Courts, and pleadings, and in the mean time, though they are naturally brave, by degrees
degenerate into Poltrons and Rascals. This Kingdom would then be formidable to Strangers,
and besides how rich and opulent? for the whole ruine of the Gentry proceeds from no
other cause, but those pestiferous Counsels wherewith the Advocates seduce their Clients;
and set them together by the ears. I remember I once read in the window of a house at
<hi>Tholouze,</hi> which one of the most eminent Advocates of that Court call'd <hi>Mainery,</hi> had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and since they themselves record it, I may well say after them, that we are very great fools
to destroy one another to enrich them: it being equally ruinous to him that prevails, with
him that is baffell'd, for they spin out the Suits in such length, that when he who has got
the better of his adversary comes to reckon the money he has spent, he will find himself
still a great deal out of purse, besides the loss of his time. And if the King would do this
perhaps the custom of Traverses, and ill offices men now practice upon one another would
be laid aside with the Laws; and his Majesties good Subjects, who meditate no other thing,
but how l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now seeing I have the honor in my disgraces to be rancked with so many great Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
both of former ages, and those whom I my self have known in my own time, I shall
the better enjoy my retirement, and be proud of being associated with so many illustrious
persons, being assur'd of two things, one whereof is my fidelity, which no one can by
any means deprive me of, and the other that I have to do with a gracious King, who
in time will (I doubt not) acknowledg the services I have perform'd for him, and for his
Crown. And if I am retir'd into my own house, it is with no great regret, it being a thing
I have long desir'd, provided it might be with the good favour of the King and Queen,
which also they cannot justly take from me, for which I praise God, who has guided me
so well through all my several Employments, that I never gave them any just cause of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and am in this privacy of mine more happy, and better satisfied, than they who
have given me these Traverses: for I laugh at the anxie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and defend themselves from one another. I think the Souls in Purgatory are not in so great
pain, whilst I live here in repose in my Family, with my kindred and friends about me,
passing away my time, in causing to be writ down before me the things that I have seen;
so that were it not for the great Harquebuz shot in my face, which I am constrain'd to
keep open, I should be very well content, and think my self exceeding happy. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the loss of my Sons, I comfort my self that they all died like men of honor with
their swords in their hands for the service of my Prince, and as to the rest, I should be a
man void of sense and understanding, if I did not look upon them as tricks that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
practised in the world, and consider my self in a happy estate, who have no more

            <p>First he would that those of <hi>Tholouze</hi> should deliver me twenty thousand Frances of the

me four pieces of Canon, and some Culverine. These were my assignments, wonderful
certain, and very proper for such an Enterprize, which seem'd rather a Mockery, and a

Letters to the Parliament, and Capitouls of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> to which they return'd me an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that the few goods of the Hugonots which had been found in their City had long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
been sold, and the money dispos'd of for the charge they had been at in several occasions.
Upon this answer I went for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could never prevail with them to advance one Denier, they telling me, <hi>that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Stock they had to employ it for the defence of their City, if occasion should be, and not
lay it cut upon</hi> Rochelle, <hi>which was no member of their Iurisdiction.</hi> I then dispatcht away
to their Majesties to give them an account of the answers I had receiv'd; but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did not for all that forbear to march into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> beseeching them to send me other
more certain assignments, or that otherwise I could not engage my self before <hi>Rochelle,</hi>
without losing their Majesties reputation, and my own, and peradventure the whole Army:
for to besiege a place of that importance without paying the Soldiers to keep them in their
Trenches, were to force them abroad to pillage, and to leave my Artillery in the mean
time engag'd; neither was I to learn in those affairs. I writ moreover to his Majesty that
he would please to command the Governor of <hi>Nantes</hi> to send me the Artillery with all

               </gap>ible speed, and cause it to be brought to <hi>Broüage,</hi> hoping that I should soon gain the
Isles. Having sent away this dispatch, I return'd into <hi>Agenois</hi> to march away twelve
or thirteen Ensigns, as also to take the Gentlemen of the Country along with me, when
being come to <hi>St. Macaire,</hi> I there found Monsieur <hi>de Lauzun,</hi> and the Muster-Masters,
who was mustring his Company, whom I entreated that immediately after the Muster
he would send away Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> who carried his Ensign directly to <hi>Xaintes</hi>
to which Sieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> I gave a Cornet of <hi>Argoulets</hi> belonging to the Sieur <hi>de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duzan</hi>
Seneschal of <hi>Bazadois</hi> my Kinsman, together with the Companies of <hi>Mabrun,
Thodias,</hi> and <hi>la Mothe Mongauzy,</hi> giving him in charge to make extreme haste without
staying till he came to <hi>Xaintes,</hi> and that in case the <hi>Marennois</hi> should be at <hi>St. Seurin,</hi> so
soon as ever he had baited his men, he should immediately go to fight them, and if they
got the victory be sure to ply their hands, for they were only a pack of Rascals, and when
the others should hear of the defeat of their Companions, they would take such a fright
at the news, that they would never make head again, and that the fear would run as far as
<hi>Rochelle:</hi> but that he must above all things be sure to make a great slaughter to strike a
terror into the whole Party. I writ also to Monsieur <hi>de Pons</hi> an account of the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
ordering him to send some of his Forces to <hi>Xaintes,</hi> to the end they might jointly fall
upon this execution. I had already sent to the Ensigns that they should move towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genois,</hi>
and to the Gentry also, and the said Seneschal <hi>de Bazadois</hi> took upon him the
Charge of our Mareschal de Camp of Gens-d'armes. I had no more but the Company of
Monsieur <hi>de Lauzun,</hi> my own, and that of Monsieur <hi>de Merville</hi> Grand Seneschal of <hi>Guien,</hi>
for of that of Monsieur <hi>de Iarnac,</hi> which the King had appointed to come to me, the fourth
part was not to be found, most of them being with the Prince of <hi>Condé:</hi> nowithstanding
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105656:161"/>
which, I staid three daies only at <hi>Agen:</hi> but return'd straight into <hi>Bourdelois</hi> with the
few Forces I could get together, giving the Command of the Foot to my Nephew the
Sieur <hi>de Leberon.</hi> In my second dayes march from <hi>Agen</hi> I receiv'd letters from Monsieur
<hi>de Madaillan,</hi> wherein he gave me to understand, that he had made so good haste, as that
the third night after I departed from them they arriv'd at <hi>Xaintes,</hi> where having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
that there were three Ensigns of Foot at <hi>St. Seurin,</hi> who had there lodg'd and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
themselves, they had fallen upon them, and brought away three Colours. Five or six
daies after I came to <hi>Marennes,</hi> where I found Monsieur <hi>de Pons,</hi> to whom his Majesty had
written, as also to Monsieur <hi>de Iarnac,</hi> to come to me to the Siege of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I received a letter from the Governor of <hi>Nantes,</hi> wherein he sent me word, that I was
not to wait in expectation of his Artillery, for that he had one piece of Canon only
mounted upon an old rotten Carriage, and that all the rest were on ground, without pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of being made ready in less than three months time. See how our Frontier Cities
and places of importance were provided and fortified! <hi>Rochelle</hi> was not so. I then fell
to spinning out the time about <hi>St. Iean</hi> and <hi>Xaintes,</hi> in expectation of an answer from
their Majesties, and money to bring the Artillery from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> very sorry that I had
advanc'd so far. Day by day I sent new dispatches to them to that effect; but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obtain any answer. The last I sent to Court was <hi>Dragon,</hi> who had retir'd himself to
Monsieur <hi>de Pons,</hi> and in the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Lude</hi> came near unto <hi>St. Iean,</hi> where
at a privat Gentlemans house we had some conference. He there shewed me the letters
the King had writ to him, wherein his Majesty commanded him to joyn with me in the
Enterprize of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> telling me that he would as cheerfully obey me as the proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King himself, as being the oldest Captain in <hi>France,</hi> that he would bring me
six or seven Ensigns of Foot, and three or four hundred horse. It did not then stick at me,
nor at those Gentlemen the King had commanded to assist me, neither at the Forces of Foot
or Horse; but only at the want of means to bring up the Artillery, and a little money to
pay the Foot, that this Siege of <hi>Rochelle</hi> did not succeed. I will not say I should have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it, but I should have frighted them at the least, and perhaps have done them no
good.</p>
            <p>In this interval Monsieur <hi>de Pons</hi> had reduc'd the Isles of <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Alvert;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The taking of the Isles.</note> for they
are for the most part his own, and Captain <hi>Gombaudiere</hi> was in them, having his house
there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and commanded as well in <hi>Alvert</hi> as <hi>Oleron.</hi> There only then remain'd the Isle
of <hi>Ré,</hi> where they had erected a Fort near unto a Church, and several others at the places
of landing. I caused five hundred Harquebuzeers to be chosen out of all our Companies,
with all the Captains, Lieutenants, and Ensigns, the one half of <hi>Mongauzy</hi> the elders
Company excepted, who staid ashore to command those that were left behind, making
my Nephew <hi>de Leberon</hi> with the said five hundred to embark at the Port of <hi>Broüage.
Guillet,</hi> the Kings receiver in those parts took great pains to victual and prepare the Vessels,
whom the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> put to death in the late troubles, but I could never learn
for what, I ever knew him to be a good servant of the Kings, and believe his diligence
upon this occasion of our mens putting to sea did him more harm than good, and perhaps
might be the cause of his death, for the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> did by no menas love those
people. My said Nephew was a day and a night hindred by foul weather from landing,
as also the Enemy defended the landing places from the Forts they had made: but in the
end he unbethought him in the night to send away all the lesser boats he had brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him full of Soldiers to land amongst the Rocks on the back of the Island, where
the Enemy kept no Guard, who so soon as part of them were got on shore, the Enemy
discovering the stratagem, ran to that part, and fought them; but ours remain'd Masters
of the place. My Nephew who was one that was engag'd in the fight, thereupon present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispatcht a Skiff to the Captains and Soldiers who were aboard the greater Vessels, to
bid them come away, which being suddenly done, so soon as they were all landed, they
marcht directly to the great Fort by the Church, a long league and a half from thence,
which they assaulted on two or three sides at once; so that they carried the place, putting
all they found within it to the sword, whilst the rest who guarded the landings put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into little boats, and fled away towards <hi>Rochelle.</hi> We imagin'd them to be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabitants of the Island, who escaped away, and that our people had gotten the
victory, and two dayes after my said Nephew sent me an account of the whole action,
which sooner he could not do, the wind being so contrary that they could not possibly
get to <hi>Marennes,</hi> where the aforesaid Sieur and I lay: upon which news we call'd back
my said Nephew, leaving two Foot Companies in the Isle. I then left Monsieur <hi>de Pons</hi>
at <hi>Marennes,</hi> and went away to St. <hi>Iean,</hi> where Monsieur <hi>de Iarnac</hi> came to me, to take
order for all things necessary for me in order to the Siege. I caused great provision of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals

This was the success of my expedition into <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> and seeing I have been reproacht,
that for three years I had done nothing considerable, I could wish that such as propose
Enterprizes to the King would be as prompt to provide things necessary for such designs,
as they are ready to give assignments that signifie nothing, like those they sent me, and then
perhaps some good might be done: but as they order it, a man must be a God to work

               </gap>acles. Oh the happy time that these men have who are about the Kings person, and
never come within danger of a Battel! they cut out work, and very good cheap for
others, that the King may think them wise and politick; but they never care to offer his
Majesty, that if <hi>Montluc</hi> or another shall refuse to go upon such an Enterprize, they
themselves will undertake it. It is enough for them that they can talk well, and such
perhaps there are, who propound a design which they would be glad should miscarry, for

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ally there is nothing but dissimulation, jealousie, and treachery amongst them, and
this is to betray ones Master like a good Frenchman. I am confident by the chearfulness
I saw in the Gentlemen who were with me, and by the astonishment I discover'd in the
people we had to do withal, that had I been supplied with necessaries requisite for such
an Enterprize,<note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelle.</hi>
               </note> I should have set hard to have carried this City, which has since so forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
it self, that if the King permit them to take surer footing, 'tis to be fear'd they will
withdraw themselves from his obedience: but I was at this time so ill assisted, and his
Majesty so ill serv'd, that I could do no more than I did.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after the King sent me the Peace to cause it to be proclaim'd at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>
commanding me to disband the Foot, and to dismiss them every man to his own house;
which I accordingly did, and sent the Proclamation to the Court of Parliament, and the
Jurats to cause it to be publisht: but for my own part I would not be present at it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well, that it was only a Truce to get breath, and a Peace to gain time to provide
themselves better for a War to come, and not intended to be kept, for the King who had
been taken unprovided I was confident would never put up the affront had been put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, who though he was very young, was notwithstanding a Prince of great spirit,
and that bore this audatious Enterprize with very great impatience, as I have since been

Troops, that he will ever forget that insolence? you would hardly endure it from your
equal, what then would you do with a Servant? for my part I never saw, nor ever read
of so strange a thing, which made me alwayes think it would stick in the Kings stomack.
The Prince and the Admiral committed a great oversight in this Peace; for they had by
much the better of the Game, and might doubtless have carried <hi>Chartres,</hi> so that those
who mediated, and procur'd this accommodation, perform'd a very signal service for the
King and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This was all I did in the second Troubles, and me thinks it was no contemptible service,
to send the King a recruit of eleven or twelve hundred Horse, thirty Ensigns of Foot, and
to preserve for him the Province of <hi>Guienne,</hi> conquer him the Isles, and not to be wanting
on my part, that I did not try my fortune at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and send him all the money the
Rebels had amassed together in that part of his Kingdom. But I must do miracles forsooth,
those who are about the Kings person have ever done me one good office or another, and on
my conscience would his Majesty hearken to them now, that I have nothing at all to do,
they would find out one thing or another to lay to my charge; for the customs of the
Court must not be lost, which is to do all ill offices, and invent slanders against those who
have a desire to do well. Was I near them I could quickly give some of them their answer,
but the distance is too great betwixt <hi>Gascony</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> besides I have lost my Children,
and <hi>an old Beast has no resourse.</hi>

was ordinarily brought from Court, by such as came from thence, I very well perceiv'd
that this Peace would not long continue: For one while I was told, that the Prince of

assur'd to the contrary, and also that the King had sent no order to disband his own Forces,
as at the Peace of the former Troubles, and that those of the new Religion went and came
to and fro from place to place, and frequently met at Conventicles. It was moreover bruited
that <hi>Rochelle</hi> would not surrender, nor <hi>Monta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it seem'd to be rather a Truce, than a Peace concluded. On the other side I was

<hi>Blaye,</hi> taking the Atturney General of the Parliament, called <hi>Laket</hi> along with me, where

least) of Catholick Soldiers: That notwithstanding I very well knew the contrary, and thereupon
like a true friend remonstrated to him, that he should call to mind from what Father he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended,
and remember that in recompence of the good services he had perform'd for the Kings</hi>
Francis <hi>and</hi> Henry, <hi>they had first given him the Command of that place, and since continued
it to him his Son; with several other Remonstrances,</hi> which I thought Proper to wean him
from an ill-conceiv'd opinion, in case he should peradventure really have entertain'd any
such thing in his fancy. I had formerly evermore taken his part, and having ever known
him (as I thought at least) very affectionate to the King's service, had writ to his Majesty,
that if I was to be responsible for any man, it should be for him (see how a man may be
deceiv'd in judging of men by their own fair speeches) but so soon as I was return'd to
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and saw some signs that did not much please me, I had no more the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of him that before; of which I also gave their Majesties present notice; but it was
seven or eight dayes after I had parted from him.<note place="margin">The practices of the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots to win <hi>Des-Rois</hi> over to their Party.</note> I heard since that a few dayes after I

that they had another meeting three dayes after that, and I had further intelligence,
that he was determin'd to go to Court to present himself to the King, to give his Majesty
more ample assurance of his faith. Whereupon I dispatched away to the King, giving him
an account of all I had heard, and telling him that I had formerly given his Majesty assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

            <p>
               <hi>Des-Rois</hi> fail'd not to begin his Journey the same day that I sent away my dispatch to
the King, which was upon a Monday, and being come to Court, as I was told, addressed
himself to Monsieur <hi>de Lansac,</hi> to whom I believe he made his complaint, perswading the
said Sieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> that all these jealousies proceeded from no other cause than the desire
I had to preferre some Gentleman who was at my devotion, to the Command of that
place, which how true it was God then knew, and time has since discover'd: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the said Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>de Lansac,</hi> as well upon the account of neighbourhood, as out of
consideration of the good repute of the Father and Family of the said <hi>Des-Rois,</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to embrace his interest, and consequently spoke to his Majesty in his behalf, wherein
he was himself first deceiv'd, and afterward asham'd of his mediation. It was however
hard to judg a man who had never been blemisht before, nor ever committed any fault,
but rather behav'd himself well than ill, as this Gentleman had done. <hi>Men are not to
be discover'd by the sight, like counterfeit money;</hi> and God alone can dive into the hearts of
men. So it was, that he return'd back very well satisfied with the King, to whom, that
he might be more affectionate to his service, his Majesty gave a thousand Crowns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:105656:163"/>
his Majesty did not perhaps consider, that he was of an ill hair, of which there are
very few good men; but, however it was, another might have been as well deceiv'd as he,
for he had a smooth tongue, and knew very well how to disguise the rancour of his
heart.</p>
            <p>See here how cautious a Prince ought to be,<note place="margin">Advice to Princes.</note> whether the King ought not to have taken
more notice of this conference of one of his Governors with the Hugonots, and in a case of
suspition like this, to have enclined to the safest counsels. There are wayes to satisfie such
as we would rid our hands of, without driving them to despair, whereas we run a very
great hazard in leaving a place of importance in the hands of a suspected person, as his
Majesty did in the power of <hi>Des-Rois,</hi> and a very good place too. When a woman once

            <p>
               <hi>Before I departed from</hi> Bourdeaux <hi>I in the morning assembled the Attorney General,

I would communicate what I had fancied with my self upon the news that daily came

                  </gap>idence and discontent the Prince of</hi> Condé <hi>was in, and what I should
do if I were in his place. In which discourse they may remember I told them,</hi> that if
the Prince could pass, he would infallibly come into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> having <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and almost
all the Country at his devotion; that the Isles when they should see Forces in <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> and
at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> so near them, would presently revolt, and
that then the said Prince and the Hugonots would resolutely turn all their designs this way;
for in <hi>France Roan</hi> was no longer theirs, which being gone, they had not one Port-Town at
their devotion;<note place="margin">

               </note> and that it would be in them a ridiculous and a senseless thing, to begin a
third War, without first having a Sea-Port in their power. Now they could not possibly make
choice of one of greater advantage to them, than that of <hi>Rochelle,</hi> on which depends that of
<hi>Brouage,</hi> which is absolutely the fairest, and the most commodious Haven in all the Kingdom;
for being there they might have succours out of <hi>Germany, Flanders, England, Scotland,
Brittany,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> all of them Countries abounding in people of their own Religion,
so that in truth should the King give them their choice to Canton themselves in any Port of
the Kingdom, they could not possibly choose a more advantageous nor a more commodious place.
<hi>They all approv'd of my discourse as being near the truth, which I had fram'd in the
Night as I lay considering the state of our affairs, for so I used to pass part of the time
in bed; and this waking fancy of mine seem'd to presage almost as much disaster and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
as the dreams I had dreamt of King</hi> Henry <hi>and King</hi> Charles.</p>
            <p>Having entertain'd them with this discourse, I then proceeded to tell them, <hi>that it would
be convenient to find out some fit remedies against the evil before it should arrive; for to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
this conceipt to their Majesties, without proposing at the same time some way to
frustrate the Enemies designs, were,</hi> I thought, <hi>to make them neglect my intelligence, and to
slight my advice.</hi> We therefore fell to considering, that to prevent the mishaps which seem'd
to threaten us, there was no other way, than by making Forts upon the sea, and betimes
to secure the Ports, which with four Ships, and as many Shalops to lie at <hi>Chedebois, la
Palice,</hi> and the mouth of the Harbour at <hi>Broüage,</hi> might sufficiently be provided for;
and that the Ports being once our own, neither English, nor any other of their Party, could
or would attempt to come into their assistance, knowing they were to land at places where
they are almost always certain to meet with very tempestuous weather; and that Seamen
will never venture out to sea to go to any place, unless they are first sure of a free and a
secure Harbour to lie in: and on the other side, that our Ships lying about the Isles would
so awe the Inhabitants, that they would never dare to revolt, and our men of War would
so keep <hi>Rochelle,</hi> as it were besieged, that it must of necessity in a little time either wholly
submit to the Kings devotion,<note place="margin">The design of a Naval Army.</note> or at least contein themselves quiet, without attempting any
thing of commotion. All which being remonstrated to them we unanimously concluded,
that I ought to send an account thereof to the King and Queen.</p>
            <p>Now the next thing we were to consider of, was, which way the money was to be raised
to equip these Vessels, and to pay the men; and as to that we made account that with ten
thousand <hi>Francs,</hi> and two thousand sacks of Corn, which I offer'd of my own for the
making of Biscuit, we should set them out to sea. General <hi>Gorgues</hi> would undertake
also to cause Cattel to be sent from the upper Country upon the account of his own credit,
and all upon the confidence we had, that his Majesty would in time reinburse us: The

(which the present T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Farm, insomuch that the Treasurer out of spite had forborn to execute his Warrant) which
when the Jurats should see was to be laid out for the publick good, not only in the behalf
of his Majesties particular interest, but moreover for the benefit of their own City, every
one would lay to his helping hand, so that what with this, and what with the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
advance, it would not for the future cost the King a penny. The Attorney Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and the said Sieur <hi>de Gorgues</hi> then with Captain <hi>Verre</hi> cast up the account before me,
which being done, we concluded that the Sieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> should go carry an account of all
to the Queen, very well knowing that her Majesty would better understand the business
than any of the Council; whereupon I accordingly dispatcht away the said Sieur <hi>de Lebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
post to Court.</p>
            <p>The Queen hearkned to all my said Nephew had to deliver with very great patience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
him answer thereupon, <hi>that she would propound is to the Council,</hi> which she did, and
three dayes after told him, <hi>that the Council did by no means approve of the motion,</hi> which I
believe was occasion'd by some ones buzzing into their ears, that I made this Proposition
more out of a desire to range along the Coast, than out of any reason there was to suspect
any such thing, as I fancied should fall out. I remember very well that I gave my said
Nephew further in charge to tell the Queen, <hi>that I had been so unfortunate in all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
I had presum'd to offer to her Majesty, that she had never been pleased to give any credit
to any of them, notwithstanding that her Majesty had so often been convinc'd, that they had
been alwayes good, and my intelligences continually true: but that I did most humbly beseech
her to give credit to me once in her life only, which if she did not, she would I doubted repent
it, and that it would be too late to be remedied, when the misfortune should be once arriv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but all these remonstrances signified nothing, and she sent me back my said Nephew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other answer but this, <hi>that the Kings Council had not approv'd of the thing.</hi> Which
prov'd very ill; I believe had her Majesty been pleased to follow my counsel the Hugonots
affairs would not have been in so good a condition as they now are: but <hi>God disposes all
things as best pleases him.</hi> I know very well, that had I wrought every day a miracle, the
Court would never have believed me to be a Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who would be sorry their Majesties should believe that any in the Nation should be
so vigilant, so intent upon the affairs of the Kingdom, or so wise as they, and yet I have
often heard that those who presume so much upon their own wisdom, are often the veriest
fools of all.</p>
            <p>Oh how vigilant ought a wise and prudent King to be, to discover these Court Cheats,
I was too far off to dispute it with them face to face, and letters have no reply; one Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
also in the Kings Council is able to do a man more mischief, than thirty friends can
do him good, of which I have had woful experience, and in the mean time all things go
backwards, without any hopes of amendment, for any thing we can do or say. I may
here aptly enough bring in the story of <hi>Marco de Bresse</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> who had perform'd
some signal services for the Signiory of <hi>Venice,</hi> for which having long sollicited a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
but still in vain; it hapned at last that the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> died, which so soon as
ever Signior <hi>Marco</hi> heard of, he presently preferr'd a Petition to the Senate, wherein he
entreated the Signiory to choose him Duke for the reward of his service. The Senate equally
astonisht, and scandaliz'd at the ridiculous, and yet the audacious pretence of this man,
sent some of their Senators to him to check him for his insolence, and to remonstrate to him
the offence he had given to, and the affront he had put upon the Republique by his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

night there was a Gentleman came to her from Monsieur <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> who had
above four hours been shut up with her in her Cabinet. What Peace soever had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
I was evermore at watch, and alwayes maintain'd spies to give me an account of
what they did in <hi>Bearn,</hi> for I very well knew, that no goodness was hatching there. I had

Her arrival at this place filled many with expectation of novelty, and possest the wiser

conservation of the publick repose, I should soon see that her desire and intention was the same;
in concurrence to which common benefit I was only to communicate to her such things as I
should hear, and that she would take order concerning all things that depended upon those of her
Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things oblig'd me to believe that this Queen spoke from her heart, although the
Court was pleased to censure me for that credulity, of which the first was, that the
King had never given her occasion to act any thing against him, but on the contrary both
formerly maintain'd her interest against the Pope, and more lately against her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Bearn,</hi> which I conceived ought in reason to oblige her: and the other the great
promises which both by Lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never to be against him, of which I do believe his Majesty has no less than a whole hundred
to produce. All which consider'd, together with the near relation she has to the King,
what must he have been, who durst have manifested a suspicion against her. Had I done

               </gap> she would have said, and have accused me to have been the cause that she had altered
the good inclination she had ever had to his Majesties service. Wherein she would have
wanted no seconds at Court against me, <hi>to load me with the Pack instead of the Saddle.</hi> I am
much better satisfied that she has persecuted me as she has done without any cause then that
she had done it with any just pretence: <hi>but the weakest alwayes goes to the walls.</hi> If the
King or Queen had a mind to have had me done otherwise, why did they not order me
to do it; I should then have fear'd nothing; but I must be a Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an eye to what they did in <hi>Bearn,</hi> because it is a Country very much infected with the
new Religion, that is crept in amongst them I know not how, nor I know not who will
root it out. They had amongst them, 'tis true, a pack of Godly Ministers, who with all
their seeming humility, and pretended sanctity, breath'd nothing in their Pulpits but
War and Rebellion: but as to the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> I could never have imagin'd that
she would have committed such an error, and have hazarded her State, which the King
had maintain'd her in, as she did. But I think those virtuous Ministers under shew of
holiness inveigled her over to their par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> The Queen departed from
<hi>Nerac</hi> on Sunday morning, the very same day that my Wife intended to have gone thither
to have kissed her hand, and Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> and my Sons were to have gone along
with her, to run at the Ring, and to divert the Prince where they made account to have
stayed eight or ten dayes. I sent my Wife thither on purpose to entertain the Queen with
reiterated assurances of me and the Catholicks, that we would not offer so much as once to
think of taking arms, but the same Sunday morning by break of day came a Comptroller of
hers, by whom she sent me word, that my Wife should not come thither, for that she was
going away to <hi>Castelgeloux,</hi> upon some intelligence she had receiv'd, that certain incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of her Religion had a mind to raise some commotion; but that she would not fail to
prevent them. I then perceiv'd that it was something else than to suppress those pretended

him to follow after with all possible speed.</p>

raise thirty Ensigns of Foot, wherein the Levy was so sudden, that the Captains could not

that the Victory would be our own, seeing they were so few, and so inconsiderable people.

and others said, that whilst we were meditating to defend the Cities of <hi>Xaintonge</hi> we should
lose our own. In fine there was not one Captain, or Knight of the Order, that was of
any other opinion, but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so many brave Captains; only to gain still more favour and esteem with their Majesties,
to the end they might grant him his demands, which came so thick, that the King never

Monsieur <hi>de Montpens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they afterwards made it sufficiently appear, for no body would follow him when he was
with the Monsieur, but chose to follow Monsieur <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> who was not half so much
a Favourite as he; but he was by much a better Soldier. Yet will I not say but that the
Sieur <hi>de Mons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les</hi> was a very brave Gentleman in his own person, but a man ought to
take measure of his own abilities, to moderate his ambition and to sweat a long while
under his arms, before he take upon him to play the great Captain, and to Lord it in
Command.</p>
            <p>After this Consultation held at <hi>Gourdon</hi> the said Sieur <hi>de Monsales</hi> being departed from
us, there came news from the Bishop of <hi>Cahors</hi> his Uncle, who sent us word, that the
Provençals Camp was come within three or fours leagues of <hi>Cahors,</hi> and that therefore he
conjur'd us for the honor of God to come speedily and relieve the City; for they expected
the Enemy the next morning; and before we departed from <hi>Souillac</hi> there past by one
whom I will forbear to name, lest should he be yet living, it might cause him to be kill'd,
who brought a Letter from the Queen to Monsieur <hi>d' Escars,</hi> wherein she writ to him to
let the bearer pass with all the secrecy he could, for that she had sent him to the Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çals
Camp to discover what number they might be. Monsieur <hi>d' Escars</hi> thereupon came
to acquaint me with the business, and carried me to his Lodging, and there into a Cabinet,
where he had conceal'd this man, who, so soon as I came in to him acquainted me with
the Command he had from the Queen, telling me, that if I would give him a man in
whom I durst confide, and that was good at the numbring of men, he would undertake to
shew him all the Army; for he himself was not to stand upon computing of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to play another kind of person; but that he would nevertheless order it so, that the
man I shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d send should view the whole Army at his ease. Whereupon I deliver'd a
Soldier to him, whom I knew I might trust, who also was to counterfeit himself a Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
and so they went away together.</p>
            <p>Now to return to the advertisement vve had from the Bishop of <hi>Cahors,</hi> upon his Letter
we immediately turn'd that vvay to go fight vvith the Enemy. Monsieur <hi>de la Vallette</hi>
vvent before vvith his ovvn Company, and took Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> along vvith him,
vvho at that time vvas my Lieutenant, vvith the one half of mine. I every day expected
an ansvver from the King, to a request I had made to him to give the one half of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to the said Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> and the other half to the Knight my Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
I should not live long, both by reason of the long sickness I had had, of vvhich I
vvas not yet recover'd, and also by reason of the violence vvherevvith I daily forc'd my self
to do more than I vvas able.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de la Valette</hi> made so long a march to go to discover these people, that of tvvo
dayes vve could not meet again, their horses being almost all unshod. He vvas as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
a Captain as any I ever knevv, but by this means he vvas constrain'd to stay a day at
<hi>Cahors</hi> to get his horses nevv shoos, for the vvay they had gone vvas so stony, as had left
half his party barefoot; and Monsieur <hi>d' Escars</hi> having heard that the Enemy took the

return'd back to us in all diligence, and we rallied at <hi>Gourdon,</hi> a Town belonging to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

we there made a halt to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

besides the third ten, which was immediately to be commanded by my Son himself.
Which because the Country thereabout was very barren, we were constrain'd to quarter
at some distance from one another, by which means, what by reason of the long way
they had to return back, as also that the Quarters of the thirty Ensigns were separated,
and that Monsieur <hi>de la Vallette</hi> could not come up to <hi>Gramat</hi> that day, we there stayd
till it was so late, that the Sun was almost going down, where still from hour to hour
Monsieur <hi>du Masses</hi> sent continually word that the Enemy still marcht towards the <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogne,</hi>
and intended to take up their Quarters in certain Villages betwixit <hi>Gramat</hi> and the

            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>d' Acier</hi> very well knew whereabouts we lay, insomuch that it was put to
the question, whether or no they should come to attaque us, and their intelligence was so
good, that they knew how many we were almost to fifty men. All his Captains were of
opinion that he ought to do it; but he shewed them a Letter from the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi>

that he had once been of my Company, and had serv'd me upon several very good occasions,

of his life; whereupon he told us, that they were betwixt sixteen and eighteen thousand

that there were six thousand Harquebuzeers old Soldiers all, of which he had never seen
so great a number in any Army of the Kings, that they had other six thousand, of whom
they did not make altogether so much reckoning as of the first, but that nevertheless there
was good men amongst them, and such as he believ'd, under favour of the first six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,

oppor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unity to see, and to number all the Enemies Camp in the Plain of <hi>Figere,</hi> where
they were all drawn up into Battalia to give an assault to the Town; but that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
had sent Monsieur <hi>d' Acier</hi> a Present, which had qualified their fury, and prevail'd
with them to forbear. He told us that he had there counted a hundred, fifty, and two
Ensigns of Foot, and being the Cavalry were a little at a distance, he could not so exactly
number them, as he had done the Foot: but that he thought they might be betwixt six
and seven hundred Horse, and that he had numbred the Foot to be betwixt three and
and four and twenty thousand men. Monsieur <hi>d' Escars</hi> and I then took the Spy aside
by himself, who gave us the same account that the Soldier had done; the Spy was in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
fear lest Captain <hi>Moreau</hi> should peradventure have discover'd him, for so soon as
ever he saw him he slunk out of the Troop, and before we were settled every man in his
quarters, it was after midnight. The next day we all met together again, and all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
came to my lodging to consult what we had to do, having found that we had to deal
with other kind of people than with five or six thousand scoundrils with their wives and
children. At night the aforesaid Captain <hi>Moreau</hi> told me in private, that in case we
should attempt to fight them in the place where they were encampt, we should infallibly
be defeated, were we four times as many Horse and Foot as we were, by reason that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>d' Acier</hi> who was of this Country, had purposely chosen this place not to stir from
thence of eight or ten dayes, but there to lie in expectation of the return of a Messenger
he had sent to the Prince and the Admiral, to tell them, that he would go no farther;
and that they all humbly entreated the Prince to come and make <hi>Guienne</hi> the Scean of the
War, which they were confidently assur'd they should make their own, before the King
could draw sufficient Forces together to fight them: that to this end they would march
before him towards <hi>Libourne,</hi> and would try to carry <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> for they fear'd nothing
but our Horse, and therefore it was that they had made choice of those Quarters, it being
a stony Country, and the stones so sharp that they cut like knives, insomuch that a horse
dares not gallop, or indeed almost tread upon them, and moreover all the Country, and
all High-wayes are enclosed with dry stone walls of the height of a man, and the lowest as
high as a mans girdle, under favour of which they made account to enclose all their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers,
and the Horse in their Rear, so that we could not possibly go to fight them,
without exposing our selves to the mercy of their shot.</p>
            <p>All these things consider'd, as also the situation of the place, and the number of men,
made us matu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ely to deliberate of the condition we were in, and with the best discretion
we had to provide against the odds against us, and to supply the weakness of our Forces
with the best resolutions founded upon the best rules of War. Upon which consultation
it was in the end agreed, that Monsieur <hi>d' Escars</hi> should send a Gens-d'arme of his, an
intelligent person, to found the Pass of the <hi>Dordogne</hi> leading to <hi>Figeac,</hi> wherein if the
Foa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the stones, where the Caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y could not come to fight, and that finding the Foards such
as we believ'd they were, we might at any time pass over, either to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than a little league from one another. With this resolution we dispatcht away the said
Gens-d'arms to go sound the Foard, and the Commissaries to make ready the provisions,
concluding to depart the day following, and not before, because we would give the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries
time to prepare the provisions, and the Gentlemen leasure to sound the
Foard.</p>
            <p>The next day about ten of the clock in the morning there arriv'd the Brother of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

we should march away to M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nsieur <hi>de Montpensier.</hi> We very well understood by the
stile, that these Letters were of Monsieur <hi>de Monsales</hi> his contriving; forasmuch as he had
told us at his coming to call us away, that the King and Queen did not care though <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>
was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, provided we fought with the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> for he being once defeated,
all the rest would be recover'd of course: at which time I remember there were some who
in my presence reproacht him, that he talk'd at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase; for although his house should be
burnt, he was very well assur'd the King and Queen would give him three times as much as
he could possibly lose, and that hitherto it had never been known, that ever the King had
conferr'd so many ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fits upon all the Captains of <hi>Guienne,</hi> put them all together, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him alone: and this was the thing that made us believe he had sent this Letter ready
drawn to the King, that his Majesty might write to us after that manner. For in the
Cabinets of Princes such tricks have been usually playd, and such extraordinary favours
granted, with much less difficulty than men of our trade can obtein the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t justice. The
above-named Captains who were present at the Consultation are able to testifie what a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
there was amongst us, before we began to march, as seeing the apparent loss and ruine
of the Country, should the Prince transfer the Scean of the War into <hi>Guienne,</hi> as we did
confidently believe he would, seeing these people refuse to advance any further, and also
knowing Monsieur <hi>d' Acier</hi> to be of that opinion; and that the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> being
with the Prince would eternally solicite him so to do, if but to secure her own estate: for
having once <hi>Guienne</hi> at her devotion, she might very well assure the State of her Son, and
moreover pretend to a great deal more.</p>
            <p>But after all the disputes that have been concerning that affair, I call all the Captains
to witness, whether I did not propose to obey the Kings pleasure, and to march away to
Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier</hi> in what pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t soever he might be; telling them withal, <hi>that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
by reason of my indisposition I could not engage my self in field service in the beginning of
a turbulent winter, as being altogether useless in an Army:</hi> but that they might boldly
proceed, without fearing their houses should be burnt: for that with the Gentlemen and
the Common people who would be left in the Country, I did not doubt to secure them,
or at least to cut out so much work for the Enemy, that they should pay dear for what
they got. There was then a debate about marching the Infantry, all the Captains saying,
that it was to send them to the slaughter they being no way able to match the Enemies
Foot, and were therefore generally of opinion, that I ought to place them in Garrison to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>St. Foy, Libourne,</hi> and <hi>Bergerac</hi> along the River <hi>Dordogne,</hi> and that in the mean time
they should see which way the Enemy would take;<note place="margin">Resolution.</note> who should they march into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi>
the Chevalier my Son might afterwards go thorough <hi>Limousin,</hi> and joyn himself with
the King.</p>
            <p>Thus then I return'd towards <hi>Cahors,</hi> and to <hi>Castelnau de Monrartier,</hi> expecting news of
the Enemies march, where at the said <hi>Castelnau</hi> I was surpriz'd with a Dissentery, that put
my Physitian almost to the end of his lesson, and me of my life: and seeing there are
some, who to do me a good office, have said, that I might have fought the Enemy if I
would; and others, that seeing I would not fight them, I ought speedily to have sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Forces to Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier,</hi> I have here to a syllable set down the truth
of the story, from the beginning to the end, and all upon the testimony of the Captains
who were present, excepting those who are since dead; and I think they are all, saving
Monsieur <hi>du Masses,</hi> yet alive: so that if there was a fault any where, it ought to be charg'd
upon the Governors, who first of all suffer'd them to assemble in their Governments, and
afterwards to pass the Rivers without offering to oppose them; and truly as to them, if
any one have a mind to accuse them, that they did not do well, I think they may do it
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105656:167"/>
with colour enough. But they must evermore lay the blame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon me, who would never
depend upon the favour of any but the King and Queen alone; and because I had no Idol
that I ador'd at Court, (which I never had, nor never will have) to defend me from the
charities of those vertuous Court-worms. It has not been my custom to avoid fighting, I
have been too much bred to that from my childhood; neither was I ever in place where we
were near the Enemy, that I vvas not evermore of opinion vve ought to fight; and if I
commanded in chief have ever fought, though almost alwayes the weaker; and had I at
this time had my own will, I had tried a better or a worse, and would have brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a leg or a wing, either from Front or Rear; by which means we might have given
Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier</hi> time to have come and have joyn'd with us: but these Letters of
<hi>Monsales</hi> his invention must carry it against what we saw with our own eyes was best to
be done. To hear these men talk who are pleased to accuse me, a man would say I ought
to kill all before me with my nails, and take <hi>Rochelle</hi> and <hi>Montauban</hi> with my teeth:
but I am no such fool as to throw stones against the wind, and in a disadvantagious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with three thousand to fight with twenty thousand men, and by my overthrow to
draw after me the ruine of the Country. But I shall leave this discourse, as not willing
to enter into excuses, for I was not in fault in the least, and shall not learn my Trade of
those Musk-Cats that prate by the fire-side, far enough from blows, and the while we are
engag'd in action, give the King (about whose person they have the honor to be) unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
counsels. But it is the business of a Lieutenant of the King, to take his own way,
and do as he himself b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st fees cause: for it is not alwayes necessary to do as the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
he is far off, and relies upon your conduct: it is therefore your part, if you have
any discretion at all, to judg what is best to be done. No man living can deny but that
had I fought a Battel, I had manifestly expos'd the Province of <hi>Guienne</hi> to ruine, for I
must have fought against the odds of ten to one; and had I done as the King, at the
importunity of the Sieur <hi>de Monsales,</hi> commanded me, I had left all the Country at the
Enemies dispose, as I refer to any indifferent person to judg.</p>
            <p>I then return'd back to <hi>Agen,</hi> where I recover'd a little health, and upon that reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
immediately resolv'd to go seek out Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier;</hi> which determination
I signified accordingly to Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> and to Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> who was come
back from <hi>Gourdon</hi> by reason of a sickness that had there seiz'd him; and we had enough
to do to perswade him to return, for sick as he was he would have gone along with his
Company, in case they were to go with me. We appointed to meet at <hi>Ville-neuf d' Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
to which place I brought ten Ensigns of Foot conducted by the Knight my Son,
leaving the other two Tertias of his Regiment to be commanded by the aforenamed Captains,
when, as we were all joyn'd together ready to march, I receiv'd a Letter from Monsieur
<hi>de Montpensier,</hi> wherein he sent me word, that all affairs set apart I should forthwith
put my self into <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> if I was not already there; for he had intelligence that the
Enemy had a design upon that City, and was afraid I could hardly come time enough to
save it. At the same time also there came to me one of the Ushers of the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> by whom the Court desir'd me to make haste to their succour, and
that they gave the City for lost, if I did not put my self immediately into it. I was
strangely astonisht whence these enterprizes should proceed, and was constrain'd to send
to Messieurs <hi>de Terride</hi> and <hi>de Gondrin</hi> to <hi>Castillon,</hi> to gather together the said Companies
of Horse and Foot that came along with us, and there stay to expect my further order,
for I hop'd soon to provide against the present danger, and taking fifteen or twenty Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
only along with me, went away in all diligence, causing our great horses and arms
to follow after. Being come betwixt <hi>Marmanda,</hi> and <hi>la Reoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> I there met with Monsieur
<hi>de Lignerolles</hi> returning from <hi>Spain,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> the younger, who both of
them entreated me to make all the haste I could, for that they doubted the next day
(being Wednesday) the City would be taken,<note place="margin">Divisions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </note> which they had left so strangely divided,
that they did not confide in one another. The said Sieur <hi>de Lansac</hi> had receiv'd two
Letters, by which it was evident enough that there was some conspiracy in the City it self.
I scarce stayd to embrace them, but went away to lie all night at <hi>Langon,</hi> and the next
day by noon came to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> having first sent away the Usher post before, to give the
Parliament notice of my coming, to the end, that if there was really a design in hand that
might hold them a little in suspence: I was there constrain'd to stay five or six dayes.
The next morning I enter'd into the Court, where I made them a speech the best I could
to assure them, and put them out of all doubt; which the Parliament took exceeding kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from me, and return'd me their thanks. After dinner I went to the Town-house,
where I made another to the Jurats, in conclusion whereof I gave them order the next
day to put all the City into armes; which was accordingly done, and I found them to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105656:168"/>
amount to two thousand and four or five hundred men, well arm'd. I found also that
the two Companies of Monsieur <hi>de Tilladet</hi> (who as yet was Governor) were there, and
three others. The next day I again went to the Court of Parliament, where I gave them
an account of the Forces I had found in the City, remonstrating to them the little occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had to apprehend any danger, and the good disposition I had observ'd, as well in
the Citizens as the Soldiers, exhorting them to do their endeavour in the defence of their
City: after which having made them all hold up their hands to live and die together in
the defence of their City, and that if they should discover any one who should go about
to betray it they would all fall upon him, they all swore to me so to do, which greatly
rejoyc'd the whole Assembly, to whom I further remonstrated, <q>That themselves also
ought to take up arms,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc's</hi> Speech to the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
                  </note> if occasion should so require, and remember that the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Captains the <hi>Romans</hi> had were men of Letters, who had they not been qualified
with learning would have been lookt upon as unworthy of great commands, and that
their knowledge ought by no means to hinder them from the use of arms, and from
fighting, but rather encourage them to do like those antient <hi>Romans,</hi> being men as well
as they, who had no more than two arms, and one heart, as they had. Gentlemen,
said I, I see by your countenances, that you are not men that will suffer your selves to
be beaten, those who have gray beard and heads shall be for the Councel, but a good
number that I see here are fit to trail a pike, and how much think you will it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the people, when they shall see those who have power over their lives and estates
take arms for their defence? Not a man will dare to mutter, and your Enemies will
tremble when they shall hear, that the Parliament it self is taking arms to suppress them,
by which they will understand you are in earnest; and moreover all the young men
whom I have seen enter this place, and who are more fit for a Corslet than a Gown,
will then do the same.</q> To this end I entreated them to shut up the Palace for eight
dayes, that in those eight dayes time every one of them might be aquainted with the arms
he intended to make use of in time of need, and that they might divide themselves into
two and two, to stand at the Gates with their arms, that in so doing the whole City would
take exemple; and on the other side should there be any Treason in the said City, this
good order would be a means to put a stop to their proceeding, and put them out of hopes
of executing their design; wherefore seeing so great a good was to be expected from this
prudent order in affairs, as the preservation of their City, their lives and fortunes, they
ought to spare nothing to that end. After which I told them for the conclusion of all:
<hi>Gentlemen, consider I beseech you what I have said to you, and I make you here a tender of
my own life, and the lives of these Gentlemen my friends to do you service, and to establish you
in the peace and security you your selves desire.</hi> The President <hi>Rossignac,</hi> who at that time
had the Chair (for Monsieur <hi>de Legabaston</hi> was retir'd, his service not being agreeable to
this King) made answer in the behalf of the whole Court, giving me very many thanks
for the Remonstrance I had made to them, for which they would for ever be my servants,
and telling me withall, <hi>that there was not a man amongst them young or old who would not
take arms for his Majesties service in the defence of the City.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the two Parliaments of <hi>Tholouze</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
               </note> In earnest the King owes a
great deal to this Society, as also to that of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> for if either the one or the other had
fail'd <hi>Guienne</hi> had had much to suffer; forasmuch as the loss of one of these two Cities
carries a long train after it, to wit the ruine of the whole Province. In four dayes time
I had clear'd all the jealousie and apprehension that was before in the City.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen that are Governors, it is a fine thing to know the humour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of the Nation over which you command, and one thing I will say for this people,
that if their Governor have once gain'd a reputation among them, and can so pertinently
deliver himself, as to demonstrate to them any kind of probability in the thing he would
perswade, he shall not only engage the Gentry, the Soldiery, and the Magistrates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but also the Monks, Priests, Labourers, and even the very women to fight. For
they are a Nation that want no courage, but a good Chief, that knows how to command;
and you ought to believe, that seeing the Antients made so much use of Orations before
all their Battels, and found so great a benefit to accrue thereby, that we in these times
should not lay aside that kind of encouragement. They found it of so considerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that they have not thought fit to omit the several Orations in their Histories
and Records, and we likewise ought to believe that in using the same means, and in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their exemple, we shall find as great advantage by it as they did, and I look upon
it as a great and necessary quality in a Captain to speak well. I was not brought up to
this, and yet have ever been so happy as in Soldierlike terms to express what I had to say
tollerably well, though with a vehemency a little relishing of the Country from whence I
came. I would therefore advise all persons of condition, who have the means to do it,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:105656:168"/>
and design to advance their Children by Arms, the rather to bestow some Learning upon
them, for if they be call'd to Commands, they will often stand in need of it, and will
find it of infinite use to them; and I believe a man who has read much, and retein'd what
he has read, is much more capable of executing great and noble Enterprizes than another.
Had I made the best out of my little reading, it had been much better for me; and yet I
have naturally enough to perswade the Soldiers to fight.</p>
            <p>The fifth day then I return'd, and being that Monsieur <hi>de Merville,</hi> Grand Seneschal
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> by reason of a late sickness, was not able to go carry his Company to the
Army, we came together as far as <hi>St. Foy,</hi> where I receiv'd Letters from Monsieur <hi>de
Montpensier,</hi> wherein he sent me order, that I should lie about the <hi>Dordogne,</hi> and above
all things have an eye to <hi>Beurdeaux</hi> and <hi>Libourne,</hi> for that he was not yet able to guess,
whether the Enemy would fall back again into <hi>Guienne,</hi> or continue on their march.
Which was the reason that I stayd about <hi>St. Foy,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> at <hi>Castillonnes,</hi>
expecting what the Enemy would do, and also further orders from Monsieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensier,</hi>
being certain that in two or three dayes march we should at any time be able to
joyn with him from thence. Soon after we heard that he was gone in all haste towards
<hi>Poictiers,</hi> to meet the Monsieur Brother to the King, and that the Enemy marcht along the
River <hi>Loire</hi> towards <hi>la Charité,</hi> there to meet and joyn with the Duke of <hi>Deuxponts:</hi> so
that seeing it impossible to over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake the Army, that we might ease the Country along the
Banks of the <hi>Dordogne,</hi> I left two Ensigns of Foot only at <hi>Castillonnes,</hi> and three at <hi>St. Foy,</hi>
and sent away the Sieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> with his Company of Gens-d'arms into <hi>Libourne,</hi>
and the Sieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> remain'd at <hi>St. Foy,</hi> having three Companies with him, with
whom I left order that in case the Enemy should approach <hi>Guienne,</hi> he with the said three

these troubles in these parts of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So soon as the Monsieur came up to the Army he spun out the time for a certain space a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

for the Vicomtes kept about <hi>Castres, Pay-Laurens, Millau, St. Antonin,</hi> and <hi>Montauban,</hi>
making only some slight inroads to pilfer and steal, which I did not think considerable
enough, that therefore I should set an Army on foot, for the little harm they were
able to do; and besides I was willing to save money, for no other end but only to send it
to the Monsieur, which made me averse to all kind of unnecessary expence. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Gens d'armes, and some Captains of foot belonging to the Royal Army came,
or else sent their i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

space I receiv'd Letters from the Monsieur, wherein he commanded me to go into <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergue</hi>
to fight the Vicomtes, if possibly I could. Whereupon I sent away for my Nephew
<hi>de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>beron</hi> at <hi>St. Foy</hi> with his three Companies; and although I was certain before hand
that I should do no good, immediately began to march. That which made me doubt my
expedition would signifie very little, was that I knew so soon as ever the Vicomtes should
hear I had taken the field, they would certainly retire into the holds and lurking holes
they held by the right of War, where they were so wise as to save themselves upon every
rumour of an enemy; and the least place that was dispos'd to resist me had been sufficient
to stop my progress, and for any hopes to find them in the field I had none: So that I
knew I should do nothing but eat upon the Publick, and devour the people, should I stay
long about Towns and Castles, to bolt them out of their Burrows; especially considering
that I could take no Artillery along with me, which I could not do for want of money
to defray the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>harge: neither indeed did I raise much, because I would have it all go
to the Monsieurs &amp; for there it was that the main Game was to be play'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was reason that the main provision should be reserv'd for that use, all the rest of
the War being nothing but petty skirmishes in comparison of what was done, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be done there. As I was preparing for my expedition there arrived Monsieur
<hi>de Pilles,</hi> and with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m the Sieurs <hi>de Bonneval, de Monens,</hi> and a great number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gentlemen, who were come from the Enemies Camp, either to levy men, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the design they had upon <hi>Libourne;</hi> which nevertheless they fail'd in; after
which the said <hi>de Pilles</hi> put himself into <hi>St. Foy,</hi> which he made his place of Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
forasmuch as I had drawn from thence my Nephew <hi>de Leberon</hi> with the three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

to take them along with me into <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ergue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So soon as I came to <hi>Cahors</hi> I sent my said Nephew before with five Ensigns of Foot,
and part of the Company of Gens-d'armes belonging to Monsieur <hi>de Gramont,</hi> which
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105656:169"/>
Captain <hi>Mausan</hi> Quarter-master to the said Company commanded, and made him
depart in all haste to surprize some of the Enemy that lay about <hi>Ville-Franche de Roü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergue,</hi>
who accordingly made so good haste, that they marcht eight long leagues, and came
to the place by one of the Clock in the night, thinking an hour before day in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to surprize them: but they were no sooner in the Town but that the Enemy had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
intelligence sent them, and were all retir'd into their Forts. Neither is it to be
thought strange; for I wonder that either the Monsieur himself, or any other who
commanded the Kings Armies, did any thing of moment, by reason the Ordonnance
and Edict his Majesty had made, that no one was to demand any thing of the Hugonots,
provided they abstain'd from arms, and liv'd peaceably in their own houses. From

themselves to know what we did, those people giving them continual notice when and

have made our advantage of their Estates, by which means they must of necessity either

for I knew very well how to handle them, and seeing I had found the way to do it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cheap, as with two yards of Match in the first troubles, I should not have been much to
seek in these last. But by means of this vertuous Edict no one durst speak to them, but
we were oblig'd to endure them amongst us. It is not therefore (as I said) to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wondred
at, if they have perform'd so many notable exploits, considering that at all hours they
were continually advertis'd of what we did, and design'd to do. 'Tis very well known
that an Army can do no great matters without good Spies; for it is upon their report that
a Council of War is to dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mine what they have to do; but we had none amongst those
people, for there was not a Catholick, let him be otherwise as brave as brave could be, that
durst venture his person amongst them, it being to throw away himself, no man escaping
that fell into their hands; thorough which defect we could know nothing of their affairs,
and they were enform'd of all ours. O poor King how have you been gull'd and abus'd, and
are yet daily impos'd upon in the Edicts that you have, and do publish in these mens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?
I will not deny but that in some occasions you have not been so well serv'd by your
Soldiers and Captains as you ought to have been:<note place="margin">Oversights in the King.</note> but whoever will look narrowly into it,
will find that the Edicts and Ordonnances you have been made to sign, have been more the
cause of your Majesties and our misfortunes, than any defect in your Soldiers or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.
Believe me (Sir) believe me, with this clemency and moderation you will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
these people. The best man amongst them would be glad to kiss you dead, and yet
you forbid us doing them any harm. It is better then to be of their party than of yours;
for being in their houses, let what reports will be abroad they shall be secure at home.
Sir, Sir, there are some about you, who corrupted by these people, perswade you to sign
these Edicts in their favour. Severity makes them tremble. At the time when without
the Ceremony of Tryal, or Indictment I brancht them upon every Tree in the high-ways,
and truss'd them up wherever I found them, not a man of them durst quitch. Consider
then, Sir, I beseech you of what importance these fine Edicts are to your Majesties affairs;
and yet they have moreover made you sign an Ordonnance to send Commissioners through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdom, to compel us to make restitution to the Hugonots of all whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we have taken from them, and not to cause them to restore that they have pilfer'd and
purloin'd from us. Which, under correction Sir, is a Law imprudently made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consideration of the mischiefs will ensue; or else by cland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stine malice contriv'd to
make you hated by us who are faithful to you, who acknowledge you for our lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105656:169"/>
and have ever maintain'd your cause, to the end that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en another War shall
hereafter break out, you may not find one Catholick who will take up arms in your quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
But had your Majesty and the Queen call'd to mind what I propounded to your
Majesties before your Council at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> you would never have consented to send Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to cause restitution to the Hugono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, till first you had sent others to do us right
also, for the plunders and rapines they have made upon your Catholick Subjects. They
have a great excuse. The Commissioners say, that we do not complain as the Hugonots do.
How should we complain, for in the first place they say, that those of theirs who were in
arms only, plunderd us who were in arms also; but that we plunder'd those who never
sti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d from their own houses. A pretty pretence, when there was not one Hugonot who went
into arms, that did not first secure his goods in the Houses of those who stayd at home.
And on the other side by the peace the King has granted them, he has given them an
Indemnity for whatsoever they have done, not only against himself, but against us also,
who have born arms for his Majesties service. Seeing then that his Majesty has been so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
to them as to pardon them all, is it not reasonable that the same Indemnity should
extend to us also? Notwithstanding it is quite contrary. What they have acted against
us is approv'd, and what we have done against them censur'd and condemn'd, yea, and
moreover we are deliver'd up into the hands of justice. To counsel the King then to make
a Law for the one, and not for the other, I do say, and will affirm it whilst I live, that
it was barbarously done, and that it is the most unjust Law that ever Prince in the world
was advis'd to make,</p>
            <p>All this was disputed at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and the Commissioners, and Commissioners, Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and Edicts were all revok'd, and his Majesty pardon'd all in general, as knowing
very well that those Commissioners would do no other good, but ruine both the one and
the other, to beget a perpetual hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ground, whilst they were abroad in the Kings service, and their Wives forc'd to retire into
the houses of their kindred and friends; and to this day neither they, nor their Husbands
have a house to put their heads in of their own; and when satisfaction is demanded, they
say the men are beggars, and worth nothing. They say true, for the rich men never stirr'd
from their houses, and so preserv'd them; and yet we must be call'd to an account, and
not they, because those who committed the outrage are beggars, and have nothing: but
if his Majesty would have approv'd our doings,<note place="margin">Complaints of the Catholicks.</note> those who continue of their Religion
should another time have taken heed how any of their Party had done any injury to any
of ours: But I return to my Subject.</p>
            <p>I dispatcht away another Courrier to Monsieur <hi>de Leberon,</hi> and to Monsieur <hi>de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi>
Company, that they should return in as great diligence as they went, especially if
they desir'd to be present at the fight. The Courrier found that they were risen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from their Quarters an hour before day, thinking yet to find the Enemy, and not
meeting with them for the aforenamed reasons, burnt all the Boats in which they had
passed the River, wherein they did a great mischief to the Country. So soon as ever they
receiv'd my letters, they turn'd immediately back, and made more haste in their return,
than when they went; for they came before <hi>St. Foy</hi> as soon as we; so that had Monsieur
<hi>de Savignac</hi> and his companions made half the haste they did, we had trapt Captain <hi>Pilles,</hi>
and not a man of them had escap'd. Monsieur <hi>de Chemeraut</hi> saw all the dispatches I writ.

Rivers, and the ill wayes the Infantry had met withal in their march, and that they could
not abandon their Foot, telling me withal, that I ought not to engage the Enemy till we
had all our Forces of Horse and Foot together; but that they would make all the haste
they possibly could. Immediately after my arrival at <hi>Monflanquin,</hi> which might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

on the other side the River <hi>Lot</hi> towards <hi>St. Vensa</hi> and <hi>Aymett, Marmanda</hi> and <hi>Toneins,</hi>
and that they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I gave them order that Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> should go with my Company before, that
Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> should follow after at a convenient distance
to be ready to second him, and that I with my Gentlemen would sustein them; and that
after this manner they should march till they came within half a league of <hi>Miremont,</hi>

               </gap>e they should send out Scouts to enquire where the Enemy was, which should they
happen to be in <hi>Miremont,</hi> that then they should give the word back from Party to Party,
for I would immediately put my self upon the Trot to come up to them, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
did. Now I had caus'd my Foot to march without beat of Drum to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
discover'd, who after that silent manner arriv'd at <hi>Monbahus,</hi> where my Son finding
me departed thence, marcht after, and Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> being advanc'd within half
a league of <hi>Miremont</hi> made a halt according to the order he had receiv'd, and sent out to
discover, where it was told him, that the Enemy were all on the other side of the <hi>Lot,</hi>
and that there was not any one at <hi>Miremont,</hi> of which he gave notice to Monsieur <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenilles,</hi>
desiring him to acquaint me with it, that he might know what I would further
command him to do. Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> accordingly dispatcht away an Archer to
me, by whom hearing there was no Enemy on this side the <hi>Lot,</hi> I sent back word, that
Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> should further advance as far as <hi>Miremont,</hi> to enform himself more
certainly of the place where the Enemy was, to the end that the next morning Messieurs <hi>de
Terride, de Bellegarde,</hi> and I being united together might go to attaque them, and that in
the mean time I would fall back to <hi>Monbahus,</hi> where we had left our Baggage to bait and
refresh my men. I accordingly did so, having first plac'd my Son and his five Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in five or six houses near unto the place from whence I retreated, sending an account
of all to Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> to the end that should they receive an unexpected charge

for that Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> had nothing but Horse, of which there were not above
three hundred that were good, the rest to the number of fifteen or sixteen hundred, being
all mounted upon pitiful Jades that were worth nothing. The Messenger was with them
within an hour and a half after day-light, for it is no more than two leagues from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bahus</hi>

<hi>de Madaillan,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc,</hi> and must here in the first place set down Monsieur
<hi>de Pilles</hi> his design. Immediately upon my arrival at <hi>Monflanquin,</hi> which might be about
two of the clock in the afternoon, the Hugonots of the said <hi>Monflanquin</hi> advertis'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Pilles,</hi> who was newly departed from <hi>Cahors,</hi> that the next day I was determin'd
to draw nearer to him, expecting in the mean time Messieurs <hi>de Terride</hi> and <hi>de Bellegarde</hi>
to come up to me, which notwithstanding they could not do yet these two dayes, and
that I had not above fifty or threescore good Horse with me in all. Upon this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
the said Sieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> dispatcht away all night to six Cornets he had about <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda</hi>

would come and bring the rest of his Forces to joyn with them, before I could be rallied

            <p>In the mean time Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> went directly to <hi>Miremont,</hi> when being come

a great number of white Cassacks going to and fro in the great street: whereupon he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

arriv'd, and seeking for accommodation to bait and refresh themselves. Monsieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillan,</hi>
who saw himself discover'd, charg'd these two Cornets that were on horseback,
and beat them out of the Village in rout and confusion,<note place="margin">Four Cornets of Horse of <hi>de Pilles</hi> defeated.</note> so that they fled with might and

fac'd about towards <hi>Ponens</hi> from whence they came. It was ill luck; for had not Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Madaillan</hi> sent me word that he could hear no news of the Enemy, I had still
marcht on in the same order we began, and had not turn'd back again to bait. I came
up at the same time that the last two Cornets did arrive, where I thought to have had as
good a prize of them, as the rest of our people had had of the other four; but when I came
up to our Foot, an Archer came to tell me they had fought, and pursued the Enemy half
a league, and that some prisoners they had taken assur'd them, that <hi>Pilles</hi> and all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were at <hi>St. Bensa</hi> and <hi>Aymet,</hi> not above a league and a half from thence: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were retreating towards me, not being strong enough to withstand the Enemies
Forces should they come upon them. This is the truth of what passed in this Engagement.
They brought me two Cornets, but in running away they had torn off the Colours.</p>
            <p>Could we thus keep spies amongst them,<note place="margin">The Retreat of Monsieur <hi>de Pilles.</hi>
               </note> as they do amongst us of such as the King
has given liberty to live quietly in their own houses, our affairs would prosper better
than they do; and if I had been advertiz'd by some friends of ours, as they were by theirs
of Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> his retreat, I had easily defeated him; for Monsieur <hi>de Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorens</hi>
had been joyn'd with me, who was coming very well accompanied to seek me out
the very same way the Enemy fled, when seeing night coming upon him he drew into
<hi>Monsegur,</hi> to expect further intelligence which way I was gone, and in pursuing them by
night I had means to send a man or two to him to give him an account of all that had
pass'd. We lay upon our Guard, and kept very strict watch, suspecting lest the said <hi>de
Pilles</hi> should come upon us for his revenge: but he was quite otherwise dispos'd, for he
marcht all the night as fast as ever he could directly to <hi>St. Foy,</hi> where he arriv'd, as we
were enform'd by break of day, though it be the worst way imaginable, for the Country
is marvelously dirty, and the night was so dark, that men could not discern a yard from
one another. Thus we see how the affairs of War do oft miscarry for want of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
for Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> his answer came not to our hands till the next day,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:105656:171"/>
nor that of Monsieur <hi>de Lauzun;</hi> and the Messengers they sent to me had like to have fall'n
in amongst the Enemy, which put them into such a fright, that they hid themselves till
the day appear'd. In the morning by Sun-rise Messieurs <hi>de Terride</hi> and <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> came
up to us, who, when they heard of the Engagement had pass'd, were ready to tear their own
flesh, cursing the Foot to all the Devils of Hell, and the hour that ever they came from
about <hi>Tholouze;</hi> for they might easily have been at <hi>Monbahus</hi> as soon as we, had it not
been for the Foot, the staying for them being the only reason they came up so late, and
the belief they had we would not offer to fight till we were first joyn'd all together, had

            <p>We marcht straight to <hi>Miremont,</hi> and by the way met with one of Monsieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillan</hi>'s
Archers, who came to bring us news of the disorder of Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> his
people, that the news of their defeat had reacht as far as his head Quarter, that thereupon
the said Monsieur <hi>de Pilles,</hi> and the remainder of his Forces had taken their way directly to
<hi>St. Foy;</hi> that twelve Soldiers Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> kept in his house near unto <hi>la Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetat,</hi>
had kill'd two and twenty of them at the Gates of the said house being mounted
upon pittiful Jades: that the Inhabitants of <hi>la Sauvetat</hi> had also sallied out upon them,
and had kill'd three or fourscore, and taken their horses; and had Monsieur <hi>de Saincto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi>
staid a quarter of an hour only in one place by which he pass'd, the most of them
had fall'n into his hands; which alass he knew not till the next day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no more than I, and
had then his share of vexation as well as the rest of us. But a man cannot prophecy things,
which makes the <hi>Italian</hi> say <hi>Fa me indivino Ti daro denari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were constrain'd to lodg at <hi>la Sauvetat, St. Vensa,</hi> and <hi>Aymet,</hi> from whence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
wese departed, by reason there were no Quarters to be had from <hi>la Sauvetat</hi> till one
comes to <hi>St. Foy,</hi> and left Monsieur <hi>de Sauignac</hi> with his two Ensigns at <hi>Miremont,</hi> because
there were no Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Miremont</hi> there were above twenty men found hid in the houses, whom they kill'd every
Mothers Son, and got some fifteen or sixteen horses; for none of us ever stayd to alight,
but passed on forwards. The next morning very early we marcht directly for <hi>St. Foy,</hi> and
I dare be bold to say, that of a long time I had not seen such a Cavalry, for the number,
as those we had with us; and when we came within sight of <hi>St. Foy,</hi> Messieurs <hi>de Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilles,
de Madaillan,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> with his six companies put themselves before,
and marcht directly towards the Town. Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> with his own Company,
and that of Monsieur <hi>de Negrepelice</hi> marcht after to sustain them; Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens,</hi> and I sustein'd Monsieur <hi>de Terride;</hi> and there Monsieur <hi>de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi>
Company came up to us, and Monsieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> with his five Ensigns. I think
the best Curtel in all our Troops could not have made more haste than they had done, for
they were no more than two dayes only in coming betwixt <hi>Ville-Franche de Roüergue</hi> to
<hi>St. Foy.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Lauzun,</hi> and the Vicount his Son were come up to us in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with some Gentlemen only, for I think their Companies were in the Camp, and both
of them assur'd us that Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> had eighteen hundred Horse,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> three or four
hundred of which were well mounted, and in very good equipage and order, the rest were
Harquebuzeers on Horse-back, and very ill hors'd. The Chevalier then alighted,
and taking an hundred Harquebuzeers, put himself right before the Town, the rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, and Messieurs <hi>de Fontenilles de Madaillan,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> after; when
so soon as they approacht the Gate, fifteen or twenty Harquebuzeers sallied out to skirmish.
The Knight pressed still forwards notwithstanding, and those of the Enemy retir'd, and
shut themselves again within the Town. Monsieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> had all night long been pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his men over the <hi>Dordogne</hi> in great hurry and disorder, and himself at Sun-rise pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over also had left these fifteen or twenty Harquebuzeers in the Town to amuze us, and
a great Boat, and a lesser to bring them over also, for there were no more but these left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
who so soon as they were retreated into the Town, ran presently to the Boats, and
passed over in an instant; so that at the same time the Chevalier came to the Bank of
the River, (having passed thorough the Town, where he saw no body but women) they
landed on the other side.<note place="margin">Why the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> is so particular, and has writ an account at length of this Action.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This is the truth of all that passed upon this occasion, wherein I have been necessitated
to give so precise and particular an account of this action as may perhaps seem tedious to the
Reader; forasmuch as I have been told that some reported to the King, the Queen, and
the Monsieur, that it only stuck at me we did not fight with <hi>Pilles:</hi> but whoever will have
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105656:171"/>
the patience to read this Narration will see the truth of all as it passed, by the testimony
of all the Captains who were present upon the place, of which two only namely Messieurs
<hi>de Terride</hi> and <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> are dead, and by that it will appear whether I was in fault
or no: neither in truth can I justly tax, or lay the blame upon any one, but only the ill
wayes that Monsieur <hi>de Savignacs</hi> Company met withal: for as to the said Sieurs <hi>de Terride</hi>
and <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> they govern'd themselves more by the rule of War, than that they were
hindred by any want of good will they had to the cause, or any want of courage and
desire they had to be at the fight. Monsieur <hi>de Chemeraut</hi> who had brought me letters
from the Monsieur was privy to all my dispatches; for he would make one, and to that
end entreated me to furnish him with horse and arms, which I did, and of fifteen dayes
never left me. I am confident that he will always bear me witness, that every Title I have
writ of this Action <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s litterally true, and that he was as glad of the occasion of being there
as any one of the Army whatever, hoping to have carried the Monsieur better news than
he did. Such as are men of judgment in matters of War have often found by experience
how hard a thing it is to fasten a Battel upon a man that has no mind to fight, esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cially
an old Soldier, and a circumspect Commander, as the Sieur <hi>de Pilles</hi> was, who I think
was by much the best, none excepted the Hugonots had. He knew he should gain nothing
by us but blows, which made him that he would not long abide in those parts.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after we came into <hi>St. Foy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> sent the King's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant into <hi>Bearn.</hi>

thought that that his death has prolong'd our Wars; but I for my part am of opinion
that had he liv'd we should have seen our affairs in a far worse condition: For a Prince of
the Blood as he was, having already so great a Party of the Hugonots, would have had
much more credit and authority amongst them than the Admiral. This unfortunate
Prince lov'd his Country, and had compassion for the people, I was long conversant
with him, which had like to have been my ruine, I ever found him an affable and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Prince: but he lost his life in Battel, maintaining a quarrel that was unjust in the sight
of God and man. It was great pitty, for had he been elsewhere employed, he might have
been serviceable to the Kingdom. The unadvised Peace that some perswaded King <hi>Henry</hi>
to make has been the cause of all these mischiefs we have seen: for to have so many Princes
of the blood, and so many others of the same Nation, and to keep them unemployed in some
forreign War, is very ill advis'd. We must either fight with others, or fall together by
the ears amongst our selves. Could we always continue in peace, so that every one would

would be very well: but that cannot be. And therefore, Sir, I do say and affirm, that it is
a very vain opinion,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the King.</note> and fruitless, to think of making peace at home, if at the same time
you do not meditate a War abroad. You are not to renew the War of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi>

               </gap>ssession. The King your Grandfather would never lay down
this claim, but seiz'd of the Territories of Monsieur <hi>de Savoy,</hi> although his Uncle, to have
a secure passage whereby to enter into the Dutchy of <hi>Millan.</hi> Your Royal Father took
upon him the protection of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the <hi>Siennois</hi> to no other end, but
in order to a Pass for the recovery of <hi>Naples.</hi> You, Sir, are descended from these Heroick
Princes, and you have their right and title; if God therefore send you peace at home,
you may send a Tempest into the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominions, and shall have a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it than you are aware of; for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is a Prince more addicted to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105656:172"/>
Negotiations than to War: he is not like his Father, in five or six years he will be old,
and you in the flower of your age. He will leave his Children very young, and since the
Father was not generous in his youth, it is not to be expected he should be so in his old
Age. Besides if you know how to manage the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> you will find them all
at your devotion, even the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> himself, for something that I know, and some
reasons that I could give, as having felt his pulse whilst I was the Kings Lieutenant in
<hi>Tuscany.</hi> The Duke himself I am confident will not say the contrary, nor deny but that
he is more <hi>French</hi> than <hi>Spanish. England</hi> will not hinder you, for that has a Woman at
the Helm, and <hi>Scotland</hi> a Child. To be short nothing ought to deterre you: but I leave
this discourse to another time. The death of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was the occasion of my
entring into it, for I am a Frenchman, and lament the death of those brave Princes slain
by our own hands, who might elsewhere be serviceable to us, and help to enlarge the <hi>French</hi>
Dominions.</p>

                  </gap>alse intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence sent to the Monsieur.</note> all which time we spent in consultation
about the means to carry on the War, when there came a Gentlmen sent post from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Montferran,</hi> Governor of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to my said Lord the Monsieur, to give
him notice that a great part of the Admirals Army, both Foot and Horse were come into
<hi>Medoc,</hi> and that two foot Companies he had planted there had been constrained to quit
the Pass, and to escape away by night. The Monsieur was not over-hastly to believe this
news; for we discoursed about the Pass, where I represented to him the vast breadth of
the River at that place, which requir'd a whole Tide, and an infinite number of Boats to
pass it: for an Army carried a mighty Train along with it: and that on the other side,
it was not very likely that the Admiral who was a Soldier would engage himself in the
<hi>Landes,</hi> a barren Country, and beyond Rivers, he could not well expect ever to repass.
The night following there came a Courrier with like intelligence from the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and the said Monsieur <hi>de Montferran,</hi> in yet much greater heat than the former,
and making the number of the Enemy much greater than before. It is true that he also
writ to my Lord the Monsieur, that he was just taking Horse himself to go and discover
them. And accordingly, as I have heard, he did go, but he had no horse with him sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some few Harquebuzeers on horseback only, and when he came within half a league
of the Pass, those he had sent before to discover, came back, and brought him word,
that already a great number of the Horse were got over, and that the Foot began to follow
after; so that being so slenderly accompanied, the said Sieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to retire; and on the other side the people all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led towards <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The said
Sieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> dispatcht away another Courrier to the Monsieur, assuring him that
the intelligence was most certainly true, which was the reason that his Highness sent me
back to my great misfortune, for since that time I have never had any thing but trouble
and vexation, whereas had I still continued about his person, all the mischief that has
since befall'n me had never come to pass, for I had either died in doing him some brave
piece of service, or had never been wounded, as I am, to live in a perpetual languishing
condition, without possibility of ever being cur'd. All which misfortune befel me for
want of five and twenty good horse only, which had Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> had with
him he had himself discover'd the Enemy, for he wanted no courage, and had then di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereof the one half were defeated by the way about <hi>Mont de Marsan.</hi> His Highness
may please to remember, that standing by his Bed-side I told him, <hi>that upon my life and

could be nothing but some small party going ever into</hi> Bearn, <hi>or</hi> Chalesse, <hi>for a great Party

to spend my Prentice-age in so good a School as yours.</hi> Whereupon I took my leave of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Behold of what importance it is to discover an Enemy very well, before a man takes
the Alarm.</p>
            <p>Captains, my friends and companions, you must rather hazard your selves to be taken,
and discover the truth, than rely upon the report of inferiour fellows, for their fear makes
so strange an impression upon them, that they take Bushes for Squadrons, and will swear
it: you may trust to them if you will. 'Tis just the same as when they see a hundred
Crowns they think them to be a thousand: send alwayes some bold Soldier, some fellow
that has not his heart in his Breeches, and let him venture his Carcass to bring you a true
account: but if you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll do better, go your selves; I have alwayes done so, and found
an advantage by it.</p>
            <p>So soon as I cam to <hi>St. Foy</hi> I was advertis'd of the truth of the business, and sent my
said Lord the Monsieur an immediate account of it, very angry at the said Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferran,</hi>
and being there was nothing at present to do, I still continued at <hi>St. Foy,</hi> to be
near my said Lord the Monsieur, to the end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat when he should please to send for me,
I might in two or three dayes be with him. I have heard since that one of the principal
persons about his Highness should tell him, that he had done well to rid his hands of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for that I was cross-grain'd and wilful, and would evermore command in all places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I came. His Highness himself told me the story at the Siege of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> I have never been
so obstinate, but that I would alwayes submit to reason; but to speak the truth, I have
ever found my own counsel better than that of any other. It is reasonable then that those
Monsieurs, who are only pretty fellows at running the Ring, should learn of those who
have studied under the great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having nothing to do, but lying idle at <hi>St. Foy,</hi> I went thence to <hi>Age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Montferran</hi> sent me word, that the Sieur <hi>de la Roche-Chalais,</hi> and Captain <hi>Chaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyrac</hi>
were in <hi>la Roche,</hi> with a hundred or sixscore Hugonot Soldiers, that over-ran all
the Country, committing innumerable outrages, insomuch that no one could pass from
<hi>Xaintonge</hi> to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and that if I would go to <hi>la Roche,</hi> we should be enow to do the
work; he sent me word likewise that Monsieur <hi>de la Vaug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion</hi> was about <hi>Montpont,</hi> and
<hi>Mussidan</hi> with Monsieur <hi>de Sarlabus</hi> his Regiment, and three Companies of Gens-d'arms,
to whom if I would send to invite him, he would willingly be of the party. Upon this
intelligence I went immediately to <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and by an express Messenger a Gentleman
gave Monsieur <hi>de la Vauguyon</hi> private notice of the designe, who presently return'd me an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he would willingly joyn in the Enterprize, and that I should therefore send him
word what day I would have him to march, and appoint him the Rendezvous, to which
he should come. I therefore sent to entreat him to be at <hi>Liboure</hi> the third day after (which
was upon a Saturday) in the morning, where Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> and I would meet
him, to determine upon that we had to do, which he accordingly observ'd, and I also.
The said Sieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> staid to take order about the Artillery, for we were to carry
it by water as far as <hi>Coutras.</hi> We were in dispute which way to go to work, for Monsieur
<hi>de la Noüe</hi> was about <hi>St. Alvare,</hi>

<hi>la Roche</hi> to be lost, without attempting to relieve it, to do which he had only the
River of <hi>St. Alvere</hi> to pass, which in many places was to be foarded by the Horse, and
which the Foot also would boat over in four hours time; and as to the River that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>la Roche,</hi> they had the Bridge of <hi>Parcou</hi> in their own possession, Town and all, and
had a Garrison in it; wherefore we must either resolve to attaque both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
or not to make any attempt at all. In the end we concluded to attaque <hi>la Roche,</hi>
and to fight Monsieur <hi>de la Noüe</hi> in case he should offer to relieve it, all of us who were
present at the deliberation taking an oath not to discover the designe. Monsieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferran</hi>
then stayed with Commissary <hi>Fredeville</hi> to see the two pieces of Canon embark'd,
and I departed the Saturday morning very early, and came to <hi>Libourne,</hi> where I found
Monsieur <hi>de la Vaug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yon,</hi> who was come thither upon the Friday night.</p>
            <p>Now whilst we were busie at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> about this Enterprize upon <hi>la Roche,</hi> I plotted
another of as great importance as that of <hi>la Roche,</hi> which was this. A Hugonot Captain
had seiz'd upon the Castle of <hi>Levignac</hi> appertaining to Monsieur <hi>la Marquis de Trans,</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:105656:173"/>
and had three or fourscore Soldiers within it, had there enclosed the Streets of the Bourg,
which is a large one, with Rampiers of earth, and in the night all retir'd into the Castle:
which was the very place where <hi>Pilles</hi> had surpriz'd <hi>la Mothe Mongauzy</hi> the elder, kill'd
him, and defeated almost all his whole Company. Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi> had come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> my Company lying at <hi>Cleyrac</hi> and <hi>Thonen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at the deliberation about the Enterprize of <hi>la Roche,</hi> whom I made to return in all
diligence, writing to Monsieur <hi>de Leberon,</hi> that they two should joyn together with
four Companies of Foot, and make so long a march, that in one night they should shut
them in, at what price soever should take the Castle, and put them all to the sword;
and that from thence in one night more they should present themselves before the Castle
of <hi>Bridoire,</hi> apperteing to Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe Gondrin,</hi> where there were fourscore or
a hundred Hugonots more, commanded by one <hi>Labaume,</hi> which was the place into which
<hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffre</hi> that notorious Thief, who has committed so many villainies, used to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
By the things this Villain has done, he gave proof of a great heart and courage,
and manifested himself to be a man of execution. I gave them charge that they should
begird and besiege the Castle so close, that nothing could escape away: for that so soon
as I had done at <hi>la Roche,</hi> I would turn with the Canon suddenly to them, but that in
case Monsieur <hi>de la Noüe</hi> should come to fight us, they must then leave all, and march
day and night to come up to the Battel.</p>
            <p>These were the instructions I gave to Messieurs <hi>de Leberon,</hi> and <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> who
accordingly did carry the Castle. The place was strong enough to resist any force of hand,
so that they could that way do no good, and the Enemy defended themselves very well,
as it stood them upon; for they knew they were to expect no quarter, by reason of the
many insolencies and great cruelties they had committed all about <hi>Levignac.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zun</hi> therefore lent them a Culverine, with which they made a hole thorough the wall
wide enough for two men to pass, which they had no sooner done, but they immediately
fell on to the Assault,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levignac</hi> taken by assault.</note> and storming at once by the breach, and giving a Scalado by Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at the same time to the <hi>Basse-Court,</hi> they carried the place. There was but three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
sav'd, all the rest were cut in pieces, and the night following those who had seiz'd
the Castle of <hi>Taillecabat</hi> belonging to Monsieur <hi>de Mereville,</hi> Grand Seneschal of <hi>Guienne,</hi>
hearing how those of <hi>Levignac</hi> had been handled, stole away in the dark, and our people
marcht before the Castle of <hi>Bridoire,</hi> where they found that those fellows also were upon
the point of going to shift for themselves, and clapt close Siege to them. But by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and by reason of the haste they were in, our people having either forgot, or not been
able to carry along provision wherewith to refresh the Soldiers, the Foot began in the night
to disperse themselves to go seek out for victual, and the Horse retir'd into a certain Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
to bait their horses till midnight; so that few being left before the Castle, those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
seeing their opportunity made a desperate Sally in the night, and got away. Our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
mounted to horse to pursue them, but so soon as ever they were out they separated like
a Covey of flown Partridges, and by several paths retir'd every man to his own house.
The night was exceeding dark, which so much favour'd their flight, that not above three
or four of them were slain. God knows when I heard it whether I was not ready to tear
the hair off my head, and writ them word, that they very well manifested they had not
retein'd what I had so often taught them.</p>
            <p>Now as to our Enterprize upon <hi>la Roche-Chalaise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Enterprize of <hi>la Roche-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi>
               </note> Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
night came with the Artillery to <hi>Coutras,</hi> and I came thither also. Monsieur <hi>de la Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyon</hi>
was to take his way directly to <hi>Parcon,</hi> where the Bridge was, to try if he could take
the Town upon his first arrival, and make himself Master of the Bridge, which if he should
do, he was then to send over some Horse, who were to scoure the Country towards <hi>St.
Alvere,</hi> to enquire after Monsieur <hi>de la Noüe,</hi> and to learn if he made any shew or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of coming towards us. Now from <hi>la Roche</hi> to the said <hi>Parcon</hi> it was no more
than two leagues, so that we made account once in two hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wayes betwixt them being very good. When Monsieur <hi>de Vauguyon</hi> and I parted, upon
the same Saturday he went to make his people immediately advance, marching night and
day, and I came upon Sunday morning very early to <hi>Coutras,</hi> where I found Monsieur
<hi>de Gironde</hi> the Governor of <hi>Fronsac,</hi> who was also of the Enterprise and Council that I had
held about it at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Having there made ready as many Carriages as we stood in

and about midnight I depar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed thence, and by break of day came within a quarter of a
league of <hi>la Roche,</hi> where <hi>I</hi> found Monsieur <hi>de la Vauguyon,</hi> who was got thither by mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
and had sent fifteen or sixteen of his Horse before the Castle. Those Horse soon came
back to the place where we were, and told us that they had found the Enemies Horse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and had charg'd them, of which <hi>Chanteyrac</hi> refus'd to shut himself within the Castle,
but going along the Wall of the Base-Court recover'd the Pass at the Mill, where putting
himself into a Boat, under favour of ten or twelve Soldiers that made good the Mill, he
passed the River, making his horses follow by the Bridles. Monsieur <hi>de la Roche</hi> did not
take the same way, but with six or seven Horse return'd into the Castle, when seeing those

               </gap> Courreurs of Monsieur <hi>de la Vauguyon</hi> gone away, and that <hi>Chanteyrac</hi> had forsaken
him, he thought to sally out, and make his escape; in order whereunto the most of them
were already come down into the Base-Court, but Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> came up just
in the nick, and charg'd them, forcing them to retire into the Castle. In doing which
he gain'd the Base-Court, and put a great many men into it: which being done he went
to attaque the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lls, which made a very stout resistance, but in the end he took them, and
put all those within to the sword. He sent me present word of all just at the time when
Monsieur <hi>de la Vauguyon</hi> and I were at Breakfast, whereupon the said Sieur <hi>de la Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyon</hi>
immediately went, and put himself in the head of his men to march directly to the

the Town, for the Enemy were all retir'd into the Mills upon the Bridg; his men forc'd
and gain'd the Bridg, and so all was wonne, and in the night I made my approaches,
and planted my Canon in Battery. At break of day Monsieur <hi>de la Roche</hi> desir'd to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
with Monsiur <hi>de Montferran,</hi> who being he was his Kinsman, and a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
would not let him go in again, but detein'd him, and the others when they saw the
Artillery ready to play began to cry out, <hi>that they would surrender,</hi> who seeing no one
give ear to them, they cried out again, <hi>that they would surrender to our discretion.</hi> The

come along with us, cried out, <hi>that we should by no means receive them to mercy, for that
they were Libertines, and men of no Religion, especially one of them call'd</hi> Brusquin <hi>who had
kill'd above fourscore men with his own hands, the most of them Labourers and Country-men.</hi>
It then came to the question of marching out, whereupon the said Sieur <hi>de la Roche</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of me a certain Lacquay of his, his Valet de Chambre, and his Cook, which I
granted him, and we cull'd them out from the rest. Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> put himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Castle with ten or twelve men to preserve it from being rifled, and the men that came
out of it I recommended to the Soldiers dispose, who were handled according to the life
they had lead, for not one of them escap'd, excepting those I have mentioned before.</p>
            <p>That very <hi>Brusquin</hi> the Hugonots so exclaim'd against to have him kill'd, caught hold

Court of Parliament was very hot upon the Enterprize; but when they saw it was requir'd
that every one should lay to his helping hand there was no more talk of the business.
These men of the Long Robe are a dry hide-bound sort of people, and still pop us in the
mouth with their Priviledges. I will maintain, and that by the testimony of the best and
honestest men of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that they were the cause this Enterprize was not executed:
for when the Citizens saw they would part with no money, they would part with none
neither, saying that the Court of Parliament had as much or more wealth than half the
City besides, and twice they made me come to them, assuring me that so soon as ever they
should see my face all things should be done; but when I came I still found them put me
off with so many delayes, that I was forc'd to return as wise as I came. I think they had
a mind to have had me done it at my own expence, and that the advantage and the profit
should only have accru'd to them; and in truth by the offers I made, any one might
plainly see I was willing to advance something of my own; for I defray'd all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that did me the honor to go along with me at my own charge, without putting the
City to the expence of a Hen. This in truth was the reason why the Enterprize upon
<hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> was not put into execution. I am very sure there was nothing in <hi>Guienne</hi> could have
hindred me from effecting my design. At the time when <hi>Des Rois</hi> besieg'd it I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
an exact survey of the place, and it is no such choak-pear as they make it. Besides at
that time the Hugonots scarce shew'd their heads, and <hi>Guienne</hi> was quiet enough: for all
those who were able to bear arms went into the main body to the Admiral, who after the
death of the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> caus'd himself to be declar'd Head of the Faction,<note place="margin">The Admiral declar'd Head of the Hug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Prince serving him only for a shadow. It was that nevertheless that so much upheld
the said Admiral and his Party, for a Prince of the Blood can do much, and the Son
of the said Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> though he was very young, was a great support to him
also; for without them and their authority he had never been able to have maintain'd the
War so long.</p>

was I in any capacity of performing any notable exploits; both because there was
not much of that nature in the Province left to do, and also by reason I had on the other
side, sent away most of the Forces to the Monsieurs Army, and did reserve all the money
for his use. I have moreover another reason why I am thus particular in my writing;
which is to the end, that if the King shall vouchsafe the pains to read my Book (and I
think he reads some worse) his Majesty may then see how much they have spoken against
the truth, who have said that I had now no other care, nor meditated on any other thing
but how to live quietly and at ease in my own house. God knows these people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

to <hi>Tholouze.</hi> I sent him back his Messenger in all haste, desiring him by no means
to go that way, but that he would come to <hi>Rhodes</hi> and into <hi>Quercy,</hi> and that I would
come to meet him at <hi>Cahors;</hi> for the Court <hi>de Montgomery</hi> was arriv'd about <hi>Castres,</hi>
where he was drawing a Party together, so that he could not pass that way but he must be
in danger of falling into the midst of the Enemy. I had no answer from him till he
came to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> from whence he dispatcht a Courrier to me to advertize me of
his arrival, sending me word that he had past in the very beard of the Enemy;
but that none of them had presented themselves to oppose his way. I was very glad to
hear of his safe arrival, and in his letter he entrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed me that we might meet and see one
another, to the end that being together we might take a good resolution to do the King

               </gap>luxion fall'n upon one of my paps, so that I was constrain'd to have it launc'd
in two places, and to put in two tents, which made my breast so soar that I was hardly
able to endure my shirt; but the fury of the dolor being a little asswag'd, and the Fever
occasion'd by it a little over, I put my self upon my way, though I was able to ride no
more than three leagues a day at the most, and that with intolerable pain.</p>
            <p>Such as shall please to read my life may take notice with how many sorts of maladies
I have been aflicted, and yet notwithstanding I have never been idle or resty to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of my Masters, or negligent in my charge. 'Tis unbecoming a Soldier to lye grunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Bed for a little sickness. Now you must know that neither the King nor the Queen
had writ to me that I was to obey the Mareschal, neither did he in his own Letter take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to command me, nevertheless out of respect of the friendship I bore unto him,
and the affection that of my own voluntary inclination I had vow'd to him all the dayes
of my life, I went of my own accord to offer my obedience to him, and to make him a
tender of all the service lay in my power in reference to his own particular person. I found
him in a little feverish distemper, and stai'd two dayes with him at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and there
I was at that time better accompanied than he; for I had no less than threescore or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten Gentlemen in my Train. We concluded together that I should return to
<hi>Agen,</hi> there to assemble the Estates of the Province to see how many men the Country
was able to furnish out, and maintain for the prosecution of the War. I assur'd him that
<hi>Guienne</hi> would furnish money to pay a thousand or twelve hundred Harquebuzeers;
alwayes provided that when he should have won a Town in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he would come
to attaque annother in <hi>Guienne,</hi> which I also engaged to them in the Mareschal's behalf
that he should do; <hi>but I reckon'd without mine Host.</hi> I immediatley however set afoot
the Companies of a thousand Harquebuzeers, and made choice of the best Captains that
were then in the Country to command them. The Estates gave the charge of receiving
the money to <hi>de Naux,</hi> one of the House of <hi>Nort</hi> of <hi>Agen,</hi> and we concluded to be ready
the first of <hi>August</hi> to take the field.</p>
            <p>Two or three moneths were passed over in these transactions, during which Monsieur <hi>de
Terride</hi> was still at the Leaguer he had laid before <hi>Navarreins,</hi> and for my part I gave the
Town for taken; for we had still news that no more provision was enter'd into it, and
that they began to suffer. On the other side I consider'd, that all the Forces the
Count <hi>de Mont-gommery</hi> had brought with him were but threescore and ten Horse,<note place="margin">Considerations upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Count <hi>de Montgommery.</hi>
               </note> and
that he had no other Forces but only those of the Vicomptes, which I did not much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
forasmuch as with a very few men I had kept them in such aw, that they had

in <hi>Rovergue</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Cornusson</hi> and his Sons, and Monsieur <hi>de St. Vensa</hi> did the same,
as also Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> on that side towards <hi>Tholouze;</hi> in brief they were

a power sufficient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elieve <hi>Navarreins;</hi> for he must of necessity cross the River at
<hi>Verdun,</hi> where in two dayes I should be upon the Pass to oppose him: and I had so good
Spies, that I was very sure to be immediately advertis'd should he come to <hi>Montauban,</hi>
or offer to pass where he did, which was at <hi>St. Gaudens.</hi> I again consider'd that in that
Quarter there were seven or eight Companies of Gens-d'arms, which were those of the
two <hi>Bellegardes, d' Arne, de Gramont, de Sarlebous,</hi> that of the Count <hi>de Candalle,</hi> and of
Monsieur <hi>de Lauzun,</hi> and the ten Companies of Monsieur <hi>de Savignac;</hi> so that all the
Earth could never have made it sink into my head that the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> should
come to relieve <hi>Bearn.</hi> Thus do men sometimes deceive themselves with reasons; for I
made account his coming into those parts had been only to defend those places they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
in the Provinces of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Guienne;</hi> and also I heard the Vicompts refus'd
to obey one another, which made me rather think he came to moderate that affair, than
for any thing of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and in truth there was greater likelihood in it; but the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
have ever had that quality to conceal their designs better than we. They are a people
that very rarely discover their counsels, and that's the reason why their Enterprizes sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
fail of taking effect. The Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> also herein manifested himself
to be a circumspect and prudent Captain. It was he who was the occasion of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
mishap that these five hundred years has befall'n this poor Kingdom, for he kill'd
King <hi>Henry</hi> my good Master in the flower of his age, running against him in Lists; and
this man was the ruine of <hi>Guienne,</hi> by setting the Hugonots again on foot, as shall be
declar'd in its due place.</p>
            <p>You who are the Kings Lieutenants upon whose care the whole Province does rely,
consider the oversight that I have committed, and not I alone, but some far better than I,
upon this coming of the Count <hi>de Montgommery:</hi> look better about you when you shall
happen to be in the like occasion, and ever suspect the worst, that you may provide better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such inconveniencies than we did. The Mareschal <hi>d'Anville</hi> very well knows, that
when we were together at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> we were generally of opinion that the Count was
not come for the end that he afterwards discovered. We had very good arguments to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
this error, especially I, as the following discourse will make appear to such as have a
mind to be further satisfied in that particular: but this man, although a stranger, and in
a Country where he had never been before, made it seen that he had very good friends
there, and perhaps amongst us our selves; the Hugonots have ever been more cautelous
and subtile than we; I must confess that of all the oversights have ever been committed
in all our wars, this was the greatest; I know it has been variously desca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted upon, and
that the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> set people on to raise strange reports: but I know also that I
was not in fault; and I am sure Monsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi> is so good a servant to the Crown,
that he can say as much for himself as I.</p>
            <p>At my departure from <hi>Tholouze</hi> I had some private conference with two of the principal
Capitouls of the City,<note place="margin">A fault in the <hi>French</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> where I gave them many things in charge to deliver to the body
of their Corporation concerning the carrying on of the War. These men were very well
dispos'd, but that is not all; and I must here by the way insert a thing that I have ever
said, and shall do so long as I live, that the Gentry are very much to blame so much to
disdain City Employments, principally of Capital Cities, such as <hi>Tholouze</hi> and <hi>Bourde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux.</hi>
I am sure when I was a boy I have heard that both Gentlemen and Lords of very
great birth and quality accepted of the charge of Capitouls at <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and of Jurats at
<hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> but especially at <hi>Tholouze;</hi> whereas now refusing these offices, or suffering
them to be conferr'd upon others, the Citizens have got the power into their hands, so
that when we come we must cap and cringe to them. It was ill advised of those who
first were the cause. Would to God that (as they do in <hi>Spain)</hi> we had made our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
abode in the good Towns, we had then both had more riches and more authority.
We have the keys of the Field, and they of the Towns, and in the mean time we must
pass thorough their hands, and for the least affair trot up and down with great trouble
from City to City to beg their favour and esteem. But to return to my two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitouls,
had they been men who had rightly understood the instructions I gave them,
they might have given me seasonable notice. Neither is it in this thing only that I have
observ'd this fault, but in several other things also, and if the Catholick Gentlemen
would introduce this custom of taking City Employments upon them, they would find
advantage by it, and would in a short time see all things in a much better posture. But
let us make an end of the business in hand.</p>
            <p>I had intelligence from that side towards <hi>Tholouze,</hi> that the said Count reinforc'd
himself both with Horse and Foot and that he made his Levies about <hi>Castress,</hi> and at
<hi>Gaillac,</hi> but that did nothing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter my former opinion of his design (I confess that God

               </gap>ill that within eight or ten dayes before he took the
Field. Monsieur <hi>de St. Germain</hi> coming to give me a visit at <hi>Agen</hi> about some private bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness

to go over into <hi>Bearn.</hi> I disputed the contrary with him, telling him that the said <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gommery</hi>

in eight or t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n dayes time I should also be ready to march, hoping in twelve dayes to be
with him. To which the said Sieur de <hi>St. Germain</hi> made answer, that let me never more
repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e him a good Servant of the Kings, if the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> did not go over
into <hi>Bearn;</hi> and that he would cross the River at <hi>Verdun,</hi> or else higher towards the
Sourse. The confident assurance he gave me made me think to advertize Monsieur <hi>de
Terride,</hi> which by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xpress Courrier I did, and having well weigh'd and consider'd
all things with my self, began to apprehend there might be some apparence in the thing.
In the mean time I entreated the said Sieur <hi>de St. Germain</hi> to go to <hi>Tholouze</hi> to acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Mareschal with it; to which he return'd me answer, that he could not imagine but
that the Mareschal must needs know of it, considering that <hi>Montgommeries</hi> Levies were
making within seven or eight leagues of <hi>Tholouze:</hi> but I was so importunate with him
to go, that in the end he consented, though he was at that time very much troubled with
the stone, which yet continues with him; which made me write to the Mareschal (not
naming the said Sieur <hi>de St. Germain</hi> otherwise than that a Gentleman and a Knight of
the Order, whom he very well knew, and who was a very loyal Subject of the Kings) was
coming towards him, to acquaint him with something that concern'd his Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
beseeching him that he would please to give credit to what he had to deliver to him.
The said Sieur <hi>de St. Germain</hi> was not come to <hi>Tholouze</hi> when my Messenger came away,
for the Mareschal writ me word back that the Knight of the Order who I said was coming
to speak with him, was not yet arriv'd, but that if he came he would give ear to what he
had to say, and would signifie his opinion to me concerning what he should deliver to him.
Four or five dayes after Monsieur <hi>de St. Germain</hi> writ me word, that he had been with the

he gave greater credit then to him: but that I should remember what he told me, and
should in a short time see it come to pass. I gave continual notice of all to Monsieur <hi>de
St. Girou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he should look well about him, and that in case the Enemy should offer to pass
the River, he should send me present word, and in a day and a half I would not fail to
be with him. To which he return'd me answer, that he would give me three daies warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that those of <hi>Grenade,</hi> and <hi>du Mas de Verdun</hi> had command to assist one another

whom I had given as ample Commission to Command in those parts as if I my self was

and night. It was almost night when I received the news, and in the morning by break
of day, so soon as I had sent away my Messengers I departed and went to <hi>Lectoure;</hi> from

coming directly to him with five Ensigns of Foot: but that notwithstanding should the

enough, and am very confident it would have fall'n out so: for many a time have I set
out with thirty men only, and the next day have had all the Gentlemen of the Country
about me. I stay'd but that day at <hi>Lectoure,</hi> and as God shall help me, when I departed
from <hi>Agen,</hi> I had but one old Gentlmen with me call'd Monsieur <hi>de Lizac,</hi> and my own
Servants; but the next morning I had above thirty came in to me, with whom I marcht
that night to <hi>Cauze,</hi> and the next day went no further than to <hi>Nogarol</hi> to stay for the
Companies of Gens-d'arms and five Ensigns of Foot I had near unto me, and they were
commanded by Captain <hi>Castella,</hi> by reason that I had sent my Nephew <hi>de Leberon</hi> to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne;</hi>
the King having writ to me to put my self into it, his Majesty having had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
that the Enemy had a design upon that place. Which Command I receiv'd at the

to the said <hi>Libourne,</hi> that I might be near the Mareschal to go relieve the said Sieur <hi>de Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride;</hi>
or fight <hi>Montgommery</hi> by the way. Being come to <hi>Aire</hi> we found that we were
above sixscore Gentlemen, and the five Foot Companies came thither as soon as we. In
the morning my whole Company came in on the one side, and by the way of the <hi>Landes</hi>
at the same time came the Baron <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> who the day before had marched nine leagues,
and my Company seven, and at night came Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles.</hi> As I was mounting
to horse to depart from <hi>Nogarol,</hi> the Messenger I had sent to the Mareschal from <hi>Lectoure</hi>
return'd and brought me his answer, which was, that since <hi>Montgommery</hi> was already
passed the <hi>Garonne,</hi> he conceiv'd it would be to no purpose to follow him, and that he had
given Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> notice from the time that the Count had first made towards
the Rivers, to look to himself, for that the said <hi>Montgommery</hi> was coming to attaque him;
who had re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urn'd him answer, that he was strong enough to fight <hi>Montgommery,</hi> and that
he would not leave the Siege, which was the same answer the said Sieur <hi>de Terride</hi> had
sent to me. The said Mareschal sent me further word that he was going to batter a Castle
near unto <hi>Lavaur</hi> called <hi>Frigeac,</hi> till the Foot who were coming out of <hi>Languedoc</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Sieur <hi>de St. Geran de la Guiche</hi> should come up to him.</p>
            <p>So soon as ever I alighted at <hi>Aire</hi> I dispatcht away Captain <hi>Mausan</hi> (who had been
Quarter-master to Monsieur <hi>Gramont</hi>'s Company, and was lately come into mine) to the
said Mareschal by whom I begg'd of him, that setting all other Enterprizes apart, he would
please to apply himself to the grand Concern; for having once fought <hi>Montgommery</hi> he
would have no more to do either in <hi>Languedoc</hi> or <hi>Guienne,</hi> being that all the Forces of two

a very considerable and sprightly Army, he would hardly notwithstanding adventure
to attaque Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> seeing we were coming up towards him: but I think he
had intelligence that neither the Mareschal nor I would enter the Country, and that we
were not ready to joyn, which made him pursue his determination. The same night that
I came to <hi>Aire</hi> after I had sent away Captain <hi>Mausan</hi> came Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

<hi>Montaut,</hi> who would by no means accept of the Commission, but frankly told him,
that he was confident I would not enter into <hi>Bearn;</hi> and had given him so many reasons
for that resolution, that not a man about me would offer to advise me to it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I sent him word by his Messenger that I would do no other but what I had told him

<hi>Castel-Sarrazin,</hi> who was with Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> has since told me, that he kept all
the Letters I had writ to the said Sieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> and that would he have been perswaded

and the Baron <hi>de Arbous,</hi> Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de Gramont,</hi> along with him, I having
earnest business to communicate unto him, which accordingly they all three did. He had
with him four Companies of Gens-d'arms, namely his own, and those of Messieurs <hi>de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
d' Arne,</hi> and <hi>de Sarlebous;</hi> and there I laid down before them all that I writ to
Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> with the answers he had return'd me back, and that he tempted me
to come to <hi>Orthez,</hi> telling them withal the foregoing reasons why I conceiv'd I ought not
to do it; which they all approv'd of, saying, that the Mareschal would have just cause to
take it exceedingly ill if I should not stay for him; although they well enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by several Letters he had writ to them, that he had a mind to make war in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>

him with money for the expence of the war, perswading him to expend it in <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
and not in <hi>Guienne;</hi> which was a thing easie enough to be believ'd, for <hi>every one
strives to draw the water to his own Mill.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> then told us, that he
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:105656:177"/>
would write to the Mareschal, and tell him that he ought to march towards us, and after
the Enemy: but that nevertheless he believ'd he would not do it, for the forenam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These were the contents of the Letter which pleas'd us all exceedingly well, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon the receipt thereof I went to <hi>St. Sever</hi> with all the horse and foot I had; and
from thence so soon as ever I came thither dispatcht away Captain <hi>Montaut,</hi> who from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thez</hi>

upon what we had to do. I made no manner of question but he would come,
which made me send to Monsieur <hi>de Gramont</hi>'s people to provide us something for dinner,
for <hi>Agetmau</hi> is his in right of his Daughter-in-Law <hi>d' Andois</hi> Countess of <hi>Guichen,</hi> and
gave the Letter the Mareschal had sent me by Captain <hi>Mausan</hi> to the said Captain
<hi>Montaut,</hi> to shew him. I made this assignation purposely to remonstrate to him, that
the Mareschal would hardly be drawn so far as into <hi>Bearn,</hi> by reason he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
by all the Estates of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and all the Lords of that Countrey to make
war in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and not in <hi>Gulenne,</hi> which he must in the end be necessitated to do, or
they would give him no money; that therefore he ought to retire to <hi>St. Sever,</hi> leaving
a few men in the Castle of <hi>Orthez,</hi> and that when we should be all together we should
make up the body of an Army, entreating the Mareschal to leave us Monsieur <hi>de Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde</hi>
with the four Companies of Gens-d'arms, which I hoped he would easily grant
us, he having enow besides to be Master of the Field, and that in five or six dayes I
doubted not but we should have a thousand Foot, or more to those we already had:
for Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> had two Companies with him, and that Captain <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>usan</hi>
should go into <hi>Bigorre,</hi> from whence he hand his Brother would bring a considerable
number of men, and that the Count <hi>de Labatut</hi> would do the same.</q> This was what I
had premeditated to say to him, not doubting but by those arguments to overcome his
Council that hindred him from retiring; and besides I believ'd the Mareschal would be
very glad of this resolution, by which means he would be at full liberty to pursue his own
designs. Yet did I not do this of my own head only, but communicated all to the Knights
of the Order, and the Captains who were with me. Now when I in the morning expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
he should come to <hi>Agetmau</hi> (it being but two leagues only from <hi>Orthez)</hi> to conclude
of such things as should be most proper for his safety and honor, he sent me word that he
could not come to <hi>Agetmau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sieurs <hi>de Montluc</hi> and <hi>de Terride.</hi>
               </note> his Council not conceiving it fit for him to go out of his
Government, because <hi>Agetmau</hi> was not in <hi>Bearn,</hi> but that I should come to him. See here
the vanity of this world! a man weak, beaten, and upon the matter defeated, stands upon
his punctillio's, and moreover with a man who came only to save his life, and who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to his own quality might challenge some respect.</p>
            <p>For God's sake (fellow Captains) leave this pride behind your Beds-head, when necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shall press upon you; for it is to be devoyd of all sense and understanding, seeing that a
man does miserably and ridiculously lose himself. Had he been of greater quality than I, he
ought notwithstanding to have accepted my invitation, and to have come so far to confer
and consult with me about an affair whereupon his own safety and that of his Army wholly
depended. His evil Angel govern'd him. He neither knew before nor after which way to

go about either to escape, or defend himself. Yet was it not thorough any default of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,

I should first see his Forces and mine together, to know if they were sufficient to match
the Enemy: that I had seen too many caught in the Trap for that; <hi>that I would not

his punctillio's of honor, but that it was not time to insist upon such niceties; and that
he appear'd to me like a man who is in necessity, and yet thinks he does the person too
much honor to borrow money of him of whom he desires it.</q> All this I writ to him in
my anger, when I saw I could not make him come to a place where I had a mind to tell
him by word of mouth what had been concluded, as well by Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> and
the Captains n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar unto him, as by those that I had with me: and when they saw that I
was resolv'd not to go, they sent to me Messieurs <hi>d' Audaux,</hi> and <hi>de Damasan</hi> to perswade
me to it.</p>
            <p>The question was not whether I ought to carry the five Ensigns of Foot, and my three
Companies of Gens-d'arms into <hi>Orthez,</hi> for they not had 3 daies provision for themselves:
but I must go as one neighbour goes to another's house when he makes a visit. I do not use
to go after that manner in a time of War, especially when the Enemy is so near. The said
Sieurs <hi>d' Audaux</hi> and <hi>de Damasan</hi> spar'd for no arguments to induce me to it, and I was not
to seek for reasons (and such as were much more evident than theirs, as any child m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Monsieur <hi>de Gramont</hi> had a picque to some of their Council, or else that they had a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by no means a proper place for our meeting. Whereupon we concluded that the next day
about Noon we should meet at a Gentlemans House, which was not in Monsieur <hi>de Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s

told them the same thing that the Merchant had done before. Whereupon they made a
halt to rally such as should be flying away from the defeat. The Merchant held on his
way, and coming to <hi>St. Sever,</hi> found me in bed. His news was so unexpected, and so

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nge, that I could by no means give any credit to it, not being able to imagine that
two and twenty Ensigns could take eighteen in a Town that was none of the weakest;
but Captain <hi>Fleurdelis</hi> coming within a quarter of an hour after, and confirming the same,
I was constrain'd to believe it, not without making above three times the sign of the Cross.</p>
            <p>I have thought fit to give an account at large of the truth how all things passed in this
business, by reason that all the Kingdom cried out, that if Monsieur le Mareschal <hi>d' Anville</hi>
and <hi>Montluc</hi> had perform'd their duties <hi>Montgommery</hi> had been defeated, and the Princes
after the rout at <hi>Moncontour</hi> would not have known which way to turn them, having no
other refuge but to throw themselves into the arms of the Count <hi>de Montgommery,</hi> who
was fresh, victorious and full of Crowns (all which was laid in our dish) and <hi>Guienne</hi> had
not then been in mourning as it now is. And yet I think the Hugonots had not passed
thorough <hi>Limosin</hi> and <hi>Perigort:</hi> for we should have gone out to meet them to bid them
good-morrow: but the account that I have truely set down will discover who was in fault.
In the mean time they who shall follow after us may learn that an oversight in War is
irreparable. There are several persons of honor yet living, who will testifie the truth of
what I write, for I did not make any Dispatches in secret, but in the presence of all the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:105656:178"/>
Captains and Knights of the Order who were with me. I do not write to accuse either
the Mareschal or Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> I say nothing but the truth, to manifest my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to such as have said, that if I would I might have reliev'd Monsieur <hi>de Terride.</hi> The
few men I had, the daily advertisements I gave him, and the resolution taken amongst
us, are all evidences whether I was in fault or no. I must needs say that had he retir'd,
that had he sooner believ'd my intelligence, and would have hearkned to my advice, and
not have been so overrul'd by his own Council, that then in eight dayes time we should
have been strong enough to have fought <hi>Montgommery,</hi> and either to have driven him out
of <hi>Bearn,</hi> or have shut him up in <hi>Navarreins,</hi> where they would not have receiv'd him
neither, forasmuch as there had not been provision to have nourisht his Army four days; by
which means he must have been necessitated either to fight, or to turn back to the place from
whence he came, which he would have found a matter of great difficulty for him to do;
for the very Peasants would have defeated him, knowing us to be in his Rear. Monsieur
<hi>de Terride</hi> had yet all the other Towns, and had this En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had not needed to have been troubled with our war, but had been left at liberty
to pursue his own designs, provided he would have left us Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> and
the four Companies of Gens-d'armes, which I believe he would have done having himself
no need of them. It is then Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi>'s Council that is to be blam'd, and not
I; and that all the world may see how unlikely <hi>Montgommery</hi>'s<note place="margin">Montgommery's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it is most certain, that he never had at the most above five and twenty hundred Foot, and

of Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi>'s Ensigne and Guidon, and of Monsieur <hi>de St. Felix,</hi> Lieutenant
to Monsieur <hi>de Negrepelisse,</hi> and Captain <hi>St. Projets</hi> Ensigne, who were prisoners, and
went every day at liberty upon their parole up and down their Camp; and since the

to be surpriz'd, especially he being himself a good Soldier, and having good Officers
about him: but they lost their understanding in a time of the greatest need.</p>
            <p>This is the truth of the beginning and source of all the miseries of <hi>Guienne.</hi> Had not Monsieur le M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lords and Gentlemen who went in to him would have done me the honor to have come to
me, and I think we should have play'd our Game a little better. It was but reason they
should pay that great respect to him, he being a great Lord, Son to a Connestable and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
of <hi>France,</hi> and moreover a brave Cavalier in his own person, rather than to me,
who am a poor Gentleman, old, a Cripple, and out of favour: but notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
both by the Gentry and the People.</p>
            <p>You Lieutenants of Provinces who shall come after me, if peradventure my Memoires
shall fall into your hands, make your advantage of this oversight of Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi>
to the end that you may not occasion the ruin of your Masters affairs. I will not blame
nor accuse him either of cowardise or treachery, for he was an admirable good Field-Officer:
but other qualities are requir'd in a Lieutenant of a Province; upon your head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
your prodence and circumspection all the rest depend. Had he credited the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
we gave him of the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi>'s coming to raise the Siege, he had
made an honorable Retreat, and had sav'd his Canon, which had he not had leisure to
draw off, he might have thrown them into the <hi>Gave,</hi> which is a River full of great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices,
so that it would not have been in the power of <hi>Montgommery</hi> to retrieve them;
and we should have been with them in the time that such a work would have requir'd.
But setting this aside, having been routed in his Siege, and after that being retir'd into a
Town sufficiently strong, he ought to have considered of the means, either of retreating
further, or of fortifying himself there; and yet the last fault was worse than the first,
which was, that their fear depriv'd them of their judgment; for he escap'd with a good
number of Gentlemen into the Castle, which is a very strong one, without having ever
thought of putting provisions into it wherewith to sustain him;<note place="margin">The fault of Monsieur <hi>de Terride.</hi>
               </note> and in all these disgraces
to stand upon his punctillio's of honour, without deining to condescend so far as to come
three steps out of his Government to confer with a friend who came meerly to do him
service, and to preserve him, was a most inexcuseable folly. Leave, leave these punctillio's
in a time of necessity, I have never done so, but oftentimes with ten Horse only have put
my self into the Field. I am confident that had he come to speak with me he had not
fall'n into the misfortune, which cost him both his honor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his life. For my part so oft as
I have call'd this action to remembrance, I have ever lookt upon it as a meer Judgment of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:105656:179"/>
God. For to raise a Siege against equal Forces, to conquer, and force a Town, and to take
the Kings Lieutenant in a sufficient place in three dayes time, as it were in the sight of a
Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> and a Lieutenant of the Kings, as I was, and in short, in three dayes
to conquer a whole Province seems to be a Dream. It must needs be confest that in all our
Warrs there was never perform'd a more notable exploit. But who (Fellow Captains) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

this glory for the Count <hi>de Montgommery?</hi> truly no other but his own diligence,
which was such as scarce gave leisure to Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> to look before him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what he had to do. It is one of the best pieces in a Soldiers Harness. And what
lost Monsieur <hi>de Terride?</hi> the little diligence he employ'd in his most pressing concern.
For my part I did what lay in me to do; for to enter further into a Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, without

               </gap>ed Army; I was not so ill advis'd as to shuffle all things
into confusion only to bear him company in his ruine. I had been too long possessed of
the honor of having never been defeated, to hazard my reputation for the relief of a man
who would throw himself away in despite of all the world.</p>
            <p>Let no one wonder that I insist so long upon this subject:<note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gommery's</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> for I believe that from this

I am assur'd that the affairs of the Hugonots had otherwise been reduc'd to such an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that it had been impossible ever to have repair'd them again. For in the first place,
had the Mareschal and I follow'd him, there is no doubt but <hi>Montgommery</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and consequently all <hi>Bearn</hi> reduc'd, which had been no contemptible thing, and
I think the King would then have been bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e his Subjects, if they be great and powerful, should be in the
heart, and not in the extremities of his Kingdom; for then they dare not shew their
horns: And besides the King wanted no good title to <hi>Bearn,</hi> for it is said that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of right belongs to him. I once heard Monsieur <hi>de Lagebaston</hi> the first President of
<hi>Bourdeaux</hi> lay open that ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> but I have nothing to do to revive that antiquated quarrel. He
told us also that at the time when they began to fortifie <hi>Navarreins,</hi> the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sent to King <hi>Francis</hi> to remonstrate to him, how much it imported his Crown to
hinder that Fortification: but the King sent them word, that he was not offended at it;

But 'tis done and past, and there is now no remedy; <hi>For to a done thing the Council is

Peradventure there may be some who would have been glad I should have writ more at
large after what manner Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> was defeated; which I would not do; for I
have heard that <hi>Of ill flesh a man can never make good Pottage.</hi> I leave that to those who
were present at the business, and who gave me relation of it, and to the Historians who talk
of all the world, and very often unseasonably, and from the purpose, like ignorant fellows

            <p>These postings to and fro betwixt Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> and me continued three whole

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:105656:179"/>
pass the River towards <hi>Languedoc, Montgommery</hi> would infallibly fall into the Kings
Country, seeing there was no body to make head against him; but that if he would please
yet for a few dayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o deferre his expedition, one might then see what <hi>Montgommery</hi>
would do; for being puft up with so glorious a Victory, he would not there st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p the
progress of his Arms. The Mareschal was contented so to do, but sent me word withal,
that he would lose no more time than a months pay only, which the City of <hi>Tholouze</hi>
had given his Army, but would employ the remainder in reducing the places in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Now to say the truth from the time of Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi>'s defeat, affairs
were in so strange a confusion, that a man had much ado to divine what course was best
to take, unless the Province of <hi>Languedoc</hi> would have been contented to have paid the
Mareschal's Army for the service of <hi>Guienne,</hi> which however perhaps he would not have
done, neither indeed had he any reason to do it. During the nine dayes that I stayd at
<hi>Aire,</hi> we made a new appointment to meet at a Village, the name whereof I have forgot,
and there all those who were at <hi>Proian</hi> accordingly met, where we fell to debating of what
remedies might be found out (which was a matter of great difficulty for the aforegoing
reasons) for the present evil, and in the end concluded together, that I should write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Mareschal to tell him, that if he would be pleas'd to come so far as <hi>Viques,</hi> I would
there wait upon him, to resolve upon what he should think we were best to do for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Guienne.</hi> I accordingly writ, and in answer thereunto had word from him back
again, that upon a certain day, which he nam'd, he would not fail to be there, which
was two or three dayes after. I will here in the mean time give an account of what I did
at <hi>Aire</hi> within five leagues of the Enemy, and in an open Town, having no more but the
five Companies commanded by Captain <hi>Castella,</hi> and one of Vicount <hi>de Labatut,</hi> who
was also come thither; which because it may be of use to some one in time to come I will
here set down, and peradven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The three Companies of Gens-d'arms were in a Village on this side the <hi>Dou</hi> towards

be left behind but our Horses and Arms; I would then that every night they should
come an hour after midnight with the three Companies before <hi>Aire,</hi> on that side the River
towards <hi>Gascony.</hi> I had, besides those, four Companies of Argoulets, which in all might
be about three hundred Harquebuzeers, who in like manner were to come at the same
time to <hi>Millas</hi> a Village on the brink of the River. Our six Ensigns of Foot were quarter'd
at <hi>Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without the Village, and in case of an Alarm without Drum or Trumpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, were to retire
by <hi>Aire,</hi> and pass over the Bridg, at which time we who were quarter'd at the said <hi>Aire</hi>
were to foard it over (for the River was foardable) and that in the mean time twenty
Horse should every night go the <hi>Patrouille</hi> upon the three Highwayes by which the Enemy
could only come to us, which Horse should have intelligence one with another, to give one
another notice if they came, that so they might all at once retire to <hi>Aire,</hi> without giving any
Alarm, and might come and tell our Foot, and consecutively us; and that the said twenty
Horse should advance a long league, or a league and a half upon those Highwayes, to
the end, that we might not be constrain'd to draw off our men in disorder, but might
have time to have made half a league towards our place or retreat, which was to <hi>Noguarol,</hi>
before the Enemy could be arriv'd at <hi>Aire.</hi> I then calculated the length of the night, for
I fear'd not their coming by day, by reason that I kept a Gentleman call'd Captain <hi>Bahu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in an enclosed Village, a league and a half distant from <hi>Aire</hi> towards <hi>Morlas,</hi> who kept
Scouts all the day upon all the wayes by which the Enemy could come to us, and had three
or fourscore Soldiers with him, with twenty or five and twenty Argoulets. I also repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them, that when the Enemy should have marcht five long leagues of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
chiefly the Foot, and especially in the night, the Foot must of necessity stay to eat and
drink at <hi>Aire;</hi> to which place also they could not come till almost day, when men are the
most enclin'd to sleep, especially Foot who have marcht all night, so that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be able to get one Foot Soldier out of Town, and that the most of the Harquebuzeers
on horseback would stay with them, and that then by the Rule of War the Horse would
pass on forwards after us, supposing that we retreated for fear, and that I design'd our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
to be half a league from <hi>Aire,</hi> which as I had computed the time, would happen
to be betwixt break of day and sunrise: that so soon as we should see them approach us,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:105656:180"/>
we should cover all our Foot with our Cavalry, and give them a swinging Charge, and
that in so doing I made no doubt but we should defeat them. They all approv'd of my

upon them, who seeing their Cavalry defeated, and put to rout, there was no question to
be made, but that every one would shift for himself the best he could, and endeavour to
escape without offering to fight. Thus are we to represent things to our selves when we
are to undertake an Enterprize, and to hear one anothers reasons and opinions upon the
same.</p>
            <p>We lay nine dayes at <hi>Aire</hi> in reference to this Stratagem, during which time we were

               </gap>night in Battalia after this manner, expecting when the Enemy should fall into our
Quarters thinking to susprize us, but I think had we stayd till they had come we had been
there till now. The tenth day having receiv'd an answer from the Mareschal, that he
would in three dayes be at <hi>Auch,</hi> we reti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d towards <hi>Marsiac,</hi> to rally with Monsieur <hi>de
Bellegarde,</hi> to whom I gave all the men I had, and with twenty horse only went away to
<hi>Auch,</hi> marching nine long leagues that day (which are as much as twenty French leag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es)
the next morning being the time appointed by the Mareschal for our meeting. In my life
I was never so weary, for it was excessively hot, and I there found Monsieur <hi>de Negrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisse,</hi>
who was come thither the day before, having heard that the Mareschal would be
there, as also to rally what was left of his Company, which had been with Monsieur <hi>de
Terride.</hi> The next morning instead of coming himself the Mareschal sent thither Monsieur
<hi>de Ioyeuse,</hi> and we held the Consultation at Monsieur <hi>de Negrepelice</hi> his house, he being
ill of the Gout. There Monsieur <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> acquainted us with the Mareschal's intention,
which was, that he was going to repass the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and to employ his time in his own
Government, considering the charge the Country was at of defraying the expence of the
War. We controverted this determination of his, arguing that the Enemy were in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi>
and that he having the charge of <hi>Dauphiné, Provence, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> was
equally obliged to preserve the one as well as the other; that we were all the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and Servants, and that the Country was the Kings, and that therefore he ought to
go there where the Enemy was, and to endeavour to repair the great oversight we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
In answer whereunto Monsieur <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> laid before us, that the Country of
<hi>Languedoc</hi> would not pay the Mareschal's Army, unless they should see that he employ'd
their money in recovering the places of their own Province, and as I have already said,
he had reason.<note place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> But in the mean time we who were of <hi>Guienne</hi> expected no other but the
total ruine of it, and consequently of all our houses; for which considerations we should
have been very glad that the Mareschal would have resolv'd upon the defence of <hi>Guienne,</hi>
and not to have return'd into <hi>Languedoc.</hi> In conclusion he told us that he must be gone,
for he was to be that night with the Mareschal at the Isle, and that the next morning
the said Sieur would cross the <hi>Garonne</hi> towards <hi>Languedoc;</hi> at which we were very
much confounded, as knowing very well that <hi>Montgommery</hi> could not long subsist in
<hi>Bearn,</hi> and would therefore fall into the Kings Country; whereupon I told Monsieur <hi>de
Ioyeuse,</hi> that seeing I had no Forces left for the defence of <hi>Guienne,</hi> I had nothing left
to do but to retire to <hi>Libourne,</hi> where the King had commanded me to be, and so return'd
to find out Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> at <hi>Marsiac,</hi> who was as much confounded as I, he
being in no less fear of the ruine of his houses than I, and the rest of us whose Estates
lay in those parts. I left the Vicount <hi>de Labatut</hi> with his two Companies in <hi>Marsiac,</hi>
leaving it to his own discretion to do as he saw cause, for Forces I had none to relieve
him. Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> also retir'd a little further towards <hi>Coma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the Mareschal what he was to do, and the Baron <hi>de Gondrin</hi> went towards <hi>Euse,</hi>
there with his Company to do the best service he could. We were all like strayed sheep.
I with my Foot Companies went to pass the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> placing them at Port <hi>St. Mary</hi>
and at <hi>Aguillon,</hi> to see if I could yet raise any more men, and issued out three or foar
Commissions to that effect. There only remain'd with me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who was gone to bury his Wife, had taken one part along with him: Of those who were
his Neighbours, his Brother who carried my Ensign was also gone sick to his own house,
and had in like manner taken along with him some others that liv'd there abouts, and my
Guidon was gone <hi>to Tholouze</hi> to a Tryal he had depending in that Court, which was the
reason that I was thus left alone. It is true that I was assur'd they would be back with
me again in eight dayes. As for the Gentlemen of <hi>Armagnac</hi> they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

towards <hi>la Gruere,</hi> and <hi>le Mas-d' Agenois,</hi> leaving me the passage free; so that I went to
quarter at <hi>Damasan,</hi> where I found the Captains <hi>du Plex</hi> and <hi>Pommies</hi> newly arriv'd,
having but fourscore Foot only betwixt them; for they had not had time to fill their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and about fourscore Harquebuzeers on horseback came with them also. Captain
<hi>Lauba</hi> a Kinsman of mine, who might have about threescore Harquebuzeers on horseback,

               </gap>ther likewise about four a clock in the afternoon, by which time we were all got
over the River.</p>
            <p>At my coming to <hi>Damasan</hi> there met me two men from <hi>Castel-geloux,</hi> whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ants of the Cities had sent to me to demand relief; for that <hi>Calonges</hi>
had been before the Town to summon it, to whom they had return'd answer, that in case
they heard no news of me by the next morning they would deliver up the Town. It was
a strange thing that Cities, which were in no manner of danger of being forc'd, should
so tremble for fear. They had condition'd that none but the Captains should enter, in
consideration of a certain sum of money they were to give them; but that was but a juggle,
for they were resolv'd to make themselves Masters of the Town, and to leave a Garrison
there, the Captains being very well assur'd, that being once within, they, with the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots
of the place should be able to master the Catholicks. I immediately hereupon order'd
Captain <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Company, that they should bait their horses, and Captain <hi>Plex</hi> and <hi>Pommies</hi> to bait
their Harquebuzeers on horseback; and that in the close of the Evening Monsieur <hi>de No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
should depart with five Gens-d'arms, and the said <hi>du Plex</hi> and <hi>Pommies</hi> with their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
on horseback with him, taking one of the Messengers in their Party, and the
rest of the Light-horse, which might be about ten; and the fourteen of my Company
should go with the said Captain <hi>Bengue</hi> and Captain <hi>Lauba</hi> with him, and should stay at
a place appointed within a quarter of a league of the Town: where if Monsieur <hi>de Noé</hi>
could enter in, he should give notice to Captain <hi>Bengue,</hi> if not he should retreat to him;
and I with fourteen or fifteen Gentlemen who were with me, and some fourscore Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzeers
on foot, would hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> about half a quarter of a league short of the said Captain
<hi>Bengue,</hi> at a Gentlemans house call'd Monsieur <hi>de Ganet,</hi> where they were to send me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of all that passed. I order'd it thus, to the end that in case the Enemy should
come to hinder Captain <hi>Noé</hi> from entring the Town, Captain <hi>Bengue</hi> and he might rally
together, and I also would shew my self in the field to amuze the Enemy, and to make them
think that we were three Parties in the field. I knew very well that they would soon
have intelligence from those who playd the good Subjects, by staying at home in their own
houses, under the protection of the Kings Edict: and therefore caus'd all the three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to go away by night, to defeat those Intelligencers of the knowledge of how few men
we were. Monsieur <hi>de Noé</hi> came an hour after midnight to the Gates of <hi>Castel-geloux,</hi>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:105656:181"/>
where there arose a great dispute amongst those of the Town, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her or no they should
let him in; some said I, and some said no, insomuch that they made him wait two long
hours before they could conclude, but in the end the Catholicks ran to the Gate of the
Town, and made themselves Masters of it, and offer'd it to him; who so soon as he was
got in, advertiz'd Captain <hi>Bengue</hi> thereof, sending him word to retreat to me, as it had
been order'd he should, which he accordingly did, and by this time it was sun-rise.
About break of day two Hugonots, Towns-born Brats, came before <hi>Castel-geloux,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
if their relief was at hand, and whether they were determin'd to let the Captains
enter according to their Capitulation, telling them that the said Sieur <hi>de Peyre</hi> was with
his forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ion of their return. When as some of those within held them in discourse,
some Horse sallied out and took one of them, but the other made his escape, and carried
news to Monsieur <hi>de Peyre,</hi> that his Companion was taken, and that they that took him
were Gens-d'arms in yellow Cassocks. Monsieur <hi>de Peyre</hi> then perceiv'd that I was got up
before him, and retreated to <hi>Mas.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> was come in the night at the

was retir'd after I had given order for them to march away by night, telling me by the
way as we went, that the Mareschal was not pass'd over the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> to go over into
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> as Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> had assur'd us he would, but was marching towards
<hi>Muret</hi> to ease the Country; so that I receiv'd that night two great satisfactions, the first
and the chiefest, that the Mareschal had thought better with himself, and was not cross'd
the River, by which means I hop'd we should be able to do some good for the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and for the defence of the Country; and the other, that I had reliev'd <hi>Castel-gelo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x,</hi>
which was of singular advantage to us, as well in <hi>Bourdelois</hi> as in <hi>Bazadois.</hi> Which I
thought fit to commit to writing, to shew that with the little power I had, I did all I
was able to do, without lying idle at home, and suffering all things to go at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Captains, although these be no great Conquests, nor famous Battels, you may yet by
them, as well as in other places of my Book learn what a great diligence can effect, (I am
alwayes touching upon this string, and I cannot too often repeat it) and that it is good to
run a hazard sometimes in a case of necessity. When I crost the River twenty men might
have hindred my passage, had they stayd in the Houses of the Port <hi>de Pascau;</hi> for I must
of necessity land betwixt the two great Houses: and if I would have stood to consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the reason of my passage, not a man with me would have been of opinion, that
I ought to adventure to pass. By which you may note that the necessity of war will have
it so, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a man must sometimes venture when the affair is of great importance, and not
alwayes go by the reason of war: but I must also tell you, that if you are long in design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and tedious in making preparation for the execution of your design, you may then
lose more in venturing, than you are likely to win: for a man that is resolv'd to hazard
must keep his design very close, and his execution must be sudden, that the Enemy may
have no inkling of what you intend to do, till you come just to the push; for if you give
him time to discover your intention, or to prevent your design, you must imagine he has
understanding and judgment as you have, and will so well provide for you, that instead
of surprizing him, you your selves will be surpriz'd, and defeated. Do not alwayes choose
the easiest way, but deceive your Enemy, making a shew to put your selves into one place,
to get convenience of going into another. As to what concerns diligence, Monsieur <hi>de
Noé</hi> stay'd not two hours to bait at <hi>Damasan,</hi> but the night was upon him; nevertheless
he departed at the first word without making any dispute of the business. How many
Captains are there who would have given their Horse time to bai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and rest that night, at
least till within an hour or two of day, considering that they had been all day on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
at the passage of the River in excessive heat? Which had I order'd it so here, Monsieur
<hi>de Noé</hi> would then have found the Enemy in the Town, as they did him, wherefore I
would alwayes advise you to remember the Motto of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. <hi>Leave not
that till to-morrow, which you may do to day.</hi> After a long march you shall repose at your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase and acquire honor. You must oft-times make your horses quail under their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
you will get more horses enow, but your honor once lost is never to be regain'd.
'Tis a thing that is not to be found by the high-way, but to be acquir'd by valour, and for
which you wear your swords by your sides.</p>
            <p>So soon as I return'd back to <hi>Damasan</hi> I presently retir'd to <hi>Buset,</hi> a house belonging

The next morning I drew off the Sieur <hi>de Noé</hi> and his Cavalry from the said <hi>Castel-geloux,</hi>

should be a Law, and are impatient of being contradicted; and yet what I told him was
true, for he had undertaken all that; however seeing the Mareschal angry, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

to lay things home to him, for I saw very well that I had displeas'd him, and therefore would
give him no more trouble.</hi> Which they having promised me to do, I left a Gentleman with

word that he was resolv'd to go to <hi>Granade,</hi> of which I was infinitely glad, and so were
all the rest, and I thereupon immediately went to him, to know if I should go away in
the night before, to try to shut up those who were in <hi>Granade,</hi> and trap them; to which
he return'd me answer, <hi>That he should be well pleased with it, and that he had already sent
away</hi> l' Estang de Cornusson <hi>with his four Cornets of Cavalry, to put himself into</hi> Cazieres,
which four were, that of the said <hi>l' Estang,</hi> and those of <hi>St. Pourget, du Sendat,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac.</hi>
I parted then in the beginning of the night with the Gentlemen, and my own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Gens-d'arms, and had it not been for the rain that fell upon us in the night (the
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have met withal than three hundred others, and I think I should have handled them
so, that there would hardly have been any more fear of them; for that is the very Den of
Rogues. But one mischief seldome comes alone, for the rain beat me into <hi>Gaube,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my Brother Monsieur <hi>de Valence,</hi> which continu'd above three long hours, and yet
had they not escap'd me, had it not been that so soon as ever Monsieur <hi>de l' Estang</hi> came
to <hi>Cazieres,</hi> he sent away Captain <hi>Porget</hi>'s Ensign in the beginning of the night with twelve
Gens-d'arms to scoure the Road as far as beyond <hi>Granade</hi> towards <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> who
passing close by <hi>Granade</hi> did not enter into it, neither did he think that any of the Enemy
were there, and therefore would not discover himself, but went on above a league further
towards <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> and seeing no sign of an Enemy, return'd back the same way
he came, when being before the Gates of <hi>Granade,</hi> he sent in his Guide to discover if
there was any Body in the Town, who coming to the Gate saw Horse going towards the
Market-place, and up and down the streets, and thereupon return'd to the Ensign, telling
him what he had seen; and that though the night was very dark, he thought they had
white Cassocks. The Ensign then alighted and went all alone to the Gate, and enter'd
into it although he very well saw the Horse; but he had an opinion it was I, because he had
heard that I was to be there by break of day, as I had been and two hours before, if the
rain had not hindred me. He could not very well discover if they had white Cassocks
or no, and therefore stept four or five paces into the Town, which as he was doing, those
who quarter'd near unto the Gate came out to mount to horse; the Ensign who saw them
was so near, that he perceiv'd they had white Cassocks, and had then thought to have
recover'd the Gate, but he was enclosed behind, and taken, where they made him tell them
all he knew, and mounting him behind one of their Troopers, carried him away a good
round gallop. The Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> who lay about <hi>Montaut</hi> and <hi>Nugron</hi> was soon
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105656:182"/>
advertiz'd of what the Ensign had told his people; at which he took such an Alarm, that
he immediately mounted to horse, and never aligted till he came to <hi>Orthez,</hi> leaving his
Artillery by the way, abandoned by all, saving some thirty who were bolder than the rest,
by the report of the honest people of the Country, and also by the confession of those
who were taken prisoners. A little after sunrise the Mareschal came to <hi>Granade;</hi> my
Quarter with the Vaunt-guard was at <hi>St. Maurice,</hi> which appertains to Monsieur <hi>de Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sac</hi>
of <hi>Quercy,</hi> and the Mareschal would that Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi> should also be of the
Vaunt guard, with the Companies of Messieurs <hi>de Gramont, d' Arne,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de la
Chappelle Lauzi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all to <hi>Granade</hi> within three leagues of <hi>Mont de Marsan.</hi> Two dayes after our arrival
the Mareschal was again talking of returning back, for that was evermore the burthen of
his song, asking me what I would that he should do in <hi>Bearn,</hi> seeing that all the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were surrendred, and that the King had neither Towns nor Castles there; that he
should only lose so much time; that on the other side provisions would fail him, and that
already the Soldiers cried out of hunger, and besides he had no Artillery to batter the
Towns. He had in truth reason on his side for what concern'd Provisions, by reason
that our Carriages were not yet come up: and yet I had taken such care, that so soon as
ever he had sent me word he would march, I immediately sent to tax <hi>Condommois, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnac,

as we could wish. In the end I perceiv'd very well that his inclination would not be apt
to continue him long in this service,<note place="margin">Division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chiefs.</note> neither were those of his Council any better enclin'd

of me how I could think to take a walled Town, a good one, and not only one, but
three, all enclosed with exceeding good walls, which was very true: to which nevertheless
I made answer, that I had taken others that had been stronger, and mann'd with much
better Soldiers than that was, by surprize (for I remembred <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

content I should try my fortune; whereupon I entreated him to let me have Monsieur <hi>de

were likely to meet with no great resistance in executing their designs in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that the Enemies Forces were in <hi>Bearn,</hi> from whence I believe they conceiv'd they
would hardly stir. But we of <hi>Guienne</hi> knew very well that <hi>Montgommery</hi> could not long
subsist in <hi>Bearn,</hi> and that of necessity, although he should have no mind to do it, he must
fall into the Kings Country, and upon our Houses. I moreover very well knew, that those
who followed the Mareschal's opinion, thought that in retaking the Towns of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi>
they should do the King so considerable a service as would obtein grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for these considerations, for I have ever heard that <hi>The Shirt is nearer than the
Robe, and that Charity begins at home,</hi> which is sufficient for their excuse, seeing there was
no dishonour in the case, as there was not: but I was angry at those others who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the same opinion, and yet were of <hi>Guienne,</hi> because they only did it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

well that I was told some of those of <hi>Guienne</hi> should possess the Mareschal; that all
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:105656:183"/>
the importunity, and all the arguments I used to perswade him to make war in <hi>Guienne,</hi>
was for no other end, but that in case the said Mareschal should perform any brave action,
the glory thereof might redound to me, and the success be wholly attributed to my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and conduct, as in the time of the first troubles, when Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> and I were
together; but if I ever entertained any such thought, may God never have mercy on my
soul, or other design or desire, but that he might do some great thing, and that I might
be with him to lay to my helping hand in some brave Enterprize for his Majesties service,
that the King might esteem and love him for ever,<note place="margin">Jealousie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s.</note> and that the Mareschal might be so
sensible of the service I had done him, as to take my Children into his protection, and to
assist them in the obteining some advantages from the King; for as for my own part I
was resolv'd, if I should live to see an end of the War to retire to my own house, feeling
my self old and decay'd both in body and mind; and besides I bless God I had acquir'd
honour enough, without needing to deprive another: but it is impossible to eradicate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
out of the mindes of men, when it has once taken root. They make us think what we
never thought, and say what we never said: but I shall wave this discourse to return to
my Enterprize upon <hi>Mont de Marsan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same night being returned to <hi>St. Maurice,</hi> the Mareschal sent to remonstrate to
me, that I ought by no means to go to <hi>Mont de Marsan;</hi> for should I be baffled in the
Enterprize, it would be a great dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>epute to his Army, that I could expect to reap no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fruit but disgrace from the attempt, and that also he was resolv'd within two dayes
to return. I was ready to burst my hoops for spite when I heard this language. I then
sent to him Messie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who was one of his own Officers, <hi>d' Arblade,</hi> and <hi>la Mothe Gondrin</hi> to remonstrate
to, and in my behalf to entreat him not to be angry, and to have patience yet a few days;
for as for provisions he saw he had more than they knew what to do withal, and besides
he needed but to pass over the <hi>Dou</hi> to five Hugonots houses that were within the Kings
Pale, where we should find victuals sufficient to nourish his Camp a month abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, both the
Hugonots and all the Catholicks of those parts having carried all their provisions in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
that therefore he would onely be pleased to permit me to go to <hi>Mont de M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rsan,</hi>
and that in order to that Enterprize I would ask no more but two of his Field-pieces only,
wherewith to batter the Centry-houses, and little Defences that serv'd the Enemy for
Flanckers. They return'd back, and told me, that notwithstanding any thing they could
say to him he was resolute to return, but that he was content to lend me the two pieces.
In the morning then so soon as every one had got something into his belly, we began to
march, Monsieur <hi>de Montastrue</hi> being come with the two Guns, who had in Commission
from the Mareschal to tell me, that he should be very glad I would alter my design, and
return back to the Army. I think he did it that in case I should miscarry in the business,
he might have that advantage of me, as to say, <hi>I told him as much.</hi> Nevertheless we set
forward, I marching with the Cavalry, and a hundred or sixscore Argoule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s before, and
the five Ensigns after me, and after all Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi> with the two Field-pieces.
I met two Letters by the way, writ to me by a Gentlewoman of the Town, in the first
whereof she desir'd me by no means to come, for <hi>that the Enemy had intelligence of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and that Captain</hi> Favas<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(who is of</hi> St. Maurice) <hi>was come thither with a hundred or
sixscore Horse,
and another Captain with some Foot.</hi> The second letter met me within half
a quarter of a League of the Town, wherein she sent me word, <hi>That the Enemy had made
a review, and found themselves to be five hundred fighting men compleat, the Inhabitants of
the Town compriz'd, so that if I went I should reap nothing but certain disgrace.</hi> All which
notwithstanding, and that the Gentlewoman and her Husband were Catholicks, and my
very good friends; yet being they were not themselves in the City, I could not give credit
to what they writ, but march'd on into the sight of the Town which is seated in a Bottom.
Being there I caus'd a hundred or sixscore Argoulets to alight to go, and gain the houses
that were near unto the Gate, bidding them withal to run on as fast as they could, that
they might prevent the Enemy from setting them on fire, which otherwise they had done,
some of them being already sallyed out to that intent, and having already apply'd the
fire, but being by our Argoulets constrain'd to retire into the Town, they began to play
upon them from the Walls. In the mean time whilst we stayed for the coming up of
our Foot and the Artillery, I went to pass the River with a Troop of Horse below <hi>Mont de
Marsan,</hi> on that side towards <hi>Dacqs,</hi> and within Harquebuz shot of the Wall, to go dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the other side of the Town, and to view the Ditch to see if there were any water in
it, that I might pass over the Sieur <hi>de Savignac</hi>'s Ensigns, and give a Scalado on both
sides at once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:105656:183"/>The River was deep almost to the Sadle-skirts,<note place="margin">Mont de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san <hi>discover'd.</hi>
               </note> and we passed over, when being on the
further side, we perceiv'd four or five Horse, who were coming to put themselves into the
place; but they turn'd short, without it being in our power to take them. I thereupon
drew up all my Horse into Battalia, which being done I alighted; and causing Captain
<hi>Fieux</hi> who was of <hi>Miradeux</hi> only to alight with me, went directly up to the Ditch of
the Town. The heat was excessive, and my arms were exceeding heavy, so that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
to put my self into a little Ditch being able to go no further by reason of the
weight of my Arms, and that I was to climb the Ditch, and therefore made Monsieur <hi>de
Fieux</hi> to go on alone, who accordingly went all along by the Graffe of the Town, and in
going found a woman squat down behind a little hedge close by the Graffe, whom he
made to rise, still going on, for they shot furiously at him, as they did also at me; for
from the place where I was it was not above ten paces to the Graffe. At last Captain <hi>Fieux</hi>
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>turn'd to me, bringing the Woman along with him, who told us that there was water
in the Graffe a Pike deep, as Captain <hi>Fieux</hi> also assu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d me according to his judgment, by
what he had been able to discover, and the Woman told u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moreover that it was very deep
of mud. I then lost all hope of doing any thing on that side, and knew that we were to
fall on all at one place, and leaving Messieurs <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> and <hi>de Madaillan</hi> there, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
with the Gentleman to repass the River; which as I was foarding over I thought I
saw some Ensigns in the Town, and very near the Bridg, which on a sudden I lost sight
of, and thought they were the Enemy. I had at my setting out from <hi>St. Maurice</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
Monsieur <hi>de Till<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de Montastruc</hi> had told me from him, and to assure him that we had good hopes of
carrying the Town; and withal to try if he could perswade him to consent that we should
cross the River, and to make him al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>r his resolution of returning. The said Sieur <hi>de
Tilladet</hi> accordingly went, and imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>diately return'd to his own misfortune; for at his
return he found me already gone to pass the River, and saw me upon the passage, and on the
other side saw our Argoulers who were alighted, ducking and playing at Bo-peep behind
the Houses, which made him come down full speed to draw them from behind the Houses,
which he did, bringing them out into open view, and making them shoot at the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which as he was doing, and gallopping along the side of the Ditch to encourage
them to shoot: as he was returning back by the same way he had gone by the edge of the
Graffe, the Enemy pour'd so violent a storm of shot upon him, that in the end one of them
took him in the belly, so that his horse falling at the same time he got away on foot, and
wounded as he was, above a hundred paces out of the reach of the Harquebuz shot. He
did not at first feel himself wounded,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Tilladet</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded.</note> but was afterwards carried into a House without
the Town, where two dayes after he died of his wound. I had seen nothing of all this,
for I was at that time viewing the other side of the Town; in the mean time the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>Arne,</hi> the Baron <hi>d' Arbous, l' Estang,</hi> with the four Companies of Light-horse, and
Monsieur <hi>de la Chappelle Lauzieres</hi> were on the right hand up the River, within a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buz
shot of the Town.</p>
            <p>I must now give an account how the Town was taken. Captain <hi>Castella</hi> with the five
Companies who marcht after me, so soon as he came within sight of the Town, which is
within Harquebuz shot, seeing that our Argoulets did not behave themselves very well,
(for they were evermore creeping behind the houses) he made five or six Ladders which I
had caused to be brought in a Cart, to be taken off the Carriage, and to be carried by the
Soldiers, when without staying for me, Monsieur <hi>de Savignac,</hi> the Artillery, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Command, he ran full drive directly up to the Wall; where though the Enemy
plyed them very well with shot, they notwithstanding never stopt nor stayd till they
came up to the very foot of it, where being come they immediately clapt to three Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which were long enough to reach up to the top of the Wall, all the rest being too
short, upon which the Captains without more ceremony, having Targets upon their arms,
presently began to mount, and what rattle of shot soever the Enemy pour'd upon then
never desisted moun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing till they were got upon the said Wall, and then the Enemy fled.
Our people pursued them by the same way they endeavoured to retire, and ran down af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, when as they thought to have recover'd the Gate of the other Town to shut it
after them, ours were in with them, and fell in pel-mel amongst them. The Enemy
then made directly towards the Bridg, all along a great street where they had made a
Barricado, which all of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m could not recover, for a great many were cut off by the way.
Now as they were making head at the Barricado, Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi> and his people
arriv'd, vvho at the same instant that the last of ours vvere got up by the Ladders, ran
up thither mounting by the same Ladders <hi>first come first serv'd,</hi> and so soon as they vvere

put themselves into the other Tovvn by the Wicket, my five Ensigns follovved them,
and fail'd but very little of entring pel-mel amongst them: but the Enemy made shift
to clap to the Wicket, by vvhich means our five Ensigns vvere constrain'd to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a little house close adjoyning to the Gate of the City, vvhere one of the five
Captains call'd <hi>Mossaron</hi> vvas slain. The Enemy shot very fast from the Tovver of the
Portal, and ours also from the little house threvv Fagots and Plancks before the Gate,
and there it vvas that Captain <hi>Mosseron</hi> vvas slain, vvhere for all the infinite number of

               </gap>buz shot that the Enemy shoured upon them, they forbare not to
set fire to the Gate of the said Tovvn. I had (as I have said) seen these Ensigns as I vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
the River; but I thought they had been the Enemy, vvhen vve vvere no sooner got
over, but an Harquebuzeer on horseback came full speed to tell me, that our five Ensigns
vvere in the Tovvn, vvhereupon vvithout staying to see vvhat Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi>
vvould do, we set spurs to our horses, and gallopt immediately up to the Gate: (for it was
not above four hundred paces.) I there found Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi>'s people, some vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and some vvithout the Gate, vvho had already made a hole vvide enough to pass one
by one underneath. We then all alighted and passed thorough this hole; I had brought
with me some Peasants of <hi>St. Maurice,</hi> who came along with the Artillery, and falling
to work upon the Gate, immediately forced it open, but we were all got in before. Our
Camp-master Monsieur <hi>de Castaneu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> did not enter with me, for I found him at the
end of the Bridg, in a street on the right hand, where he told me that he had been to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
a house or two that looked into the other Town. There was not a man that durst
abide in the great street, for the Tower of the Gate commanded it, he carried me to the
two Houses which were close by the water side, and where in one of them I mounted a
pair of stairs into a Chamber that looked upon the River, and there caused seven or eight
holes to be suddenly made thorough the Wall, on the other side of the Room that looked
towards the Town, from whence the Enemy shot so fast; which being done I descended
again into the Street, and went into the other House adjoyning to it, and of that into a
low Parlour, which had a door out of it, thorough which by five or six steps there was a
passage down to the River. The Enemy shot at this door with great fury, and thorough
the corner of a little Window I perceiv'd that they were filling some Barrels they had
placed upon a Breach of the Wall. Monsieur <hi>de Savignac,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Andosielle</hi> his Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
Captain <hi>St. Aubin,</hi> and another Captain of his (whose name I have forgot) were
in the Parlour with me. Monsieur <hi>de Cassaneuil</hi> was entred into another House, where
he found a Tanner a very tall man, and brought him to me, who assur'd me that the
water was not above middle deep. I then offer'd this fellow ten Crowns, if he would
lead the Soldiers the way over the River, telling him moreover that I would give him a
Target of proof for his defence, which he undertook to do. I therefore deliver'd him a
Target, but the Rascal presently threw it down, telling me that it was too heavy, and that
though he was big and strong, he found himself encumbred with it, and therefore would
venture to pass over without. Monsieur <hi>de Montastruc</hi> who was Master of the Ordnance
was also present with me. I saw we must make haste to pass over; for should the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
once have filled their Barrels, it would be a matter of great difficulty to enter by this
Breach; which made me speak to Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi> to call in three or four of his
Ensignes; whereupon Monsieur <hi>d' Andosielle, St. Aubin,</hi> and the other Captain ran into
the Street, and fetcht in their Ensigns, for my five were in the little House by the Gate,
and so soon as the three Ensigns were come into the Parlour, and a great many of their
Soldiers who crowded in after them, I commanded the Ensigns boldly to follow this man,
who would lead them the way, telling them that they were by no means to stop till they
came to the other side of the River close up to the breach, sending at the same time to the
Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quebuzeers who were in the Chamber, that they should ply their shot, to favour the
passage of our men; which being done, I suddenly threw open the door, and put out
this Tanner, together with a good Soldier, who offered himself to go hand in hand with
him, and after these two the three Ensigns, and the three Captains followed after. I put
out five or six Harquebuzeers after these, and my self also, with all the Gentlemen who
were with me went out after them. We were to go down the formention'd five or six steps,
and the Enemy shot with great fury on that side, but my Harquebuzeers in the Chamber
held them so short, that they durst not shew their heads. Still more Soldiers ran after
down the stairs, and I stood upon the brink of the River, making them believe I would
pass over with them, when Monsieur <hi>de Montastruc</hi> seeing me in that posture, ran into
the Street, crying out, <hi>O Soldiers, Monsieur de Montluc himself is passing the River;</hi> at
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:105656:184"/>
which cry the Soldiers who were busie about their plunder,<note place="margin">The courage of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</note> and those who were in the
Street left all, and entred in a crowd into the Parlour, where such as could not come to
the stairs leapt down by the sides, and without any manner of regard plung'd into the
River, like as one forces in a flock of sheep, insomuch that the River was so cover'd over
with men from the one side to the other, that there was no water to be seen. I still stept
in to the mid leg into the River, making a shew as if I meant to pass it, as also did
Messieurs <hi>de Brassac,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Romegas,</hi> and the rest of the Gentlemen who were
with me. Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi> was there also, and it was no good wading for him, for
the tallest Soldier was up to the armpits, and I believe had he gone in it would have taken
him up to the chin: for every one knows that he was not of the stature of a Giant: and
we were in danger to have lost a great many Soldiers who were little men: but I still call'd
out to them to help one another, which they did; and I do verily believe, and have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe so, that had I not unbethought me to make those loop-holes in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and to have placed a good many Harquebuzeers there, as I had done, so that their
shot continually rattled without intermission, and that they had moreover open'd a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
through which two or three might fire at once, we had lost above a hundred men:
for from the Walls, and from the Barrels, from whence they fir'd at us, it was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
six paces to the Bank of the River, vvhere our people landed. The Ensigns and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
entred the Barrels, which so soon as I per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eiv'd, I immediately sent to those in the
Chamber to give over shooting, by reason they might as well kill our own people as the
Enemy. To supply which our Harquebuzeers who follovved the Ensigns shot at those
vvithin, as vvell as they at them, and being c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on the brims of them, vvhich vvere not half full of earth, the Enemy not having had

them by the vvay, vvhen so soon as I savv them enter'd I return'd into the Street, so
vveary as in my life I never felt my self in such a condition, by vvhich I very vvell savv
that I vvas no more to think of bearing arms, for I thought above ten times that I should
have fainted, and falln dovvn in the street. There is no remedy, vve cannot be tvvice.
The Chevalier <hi>de Romegas</hi> and Captain <hi>Fabian</hi> my Son supported me by the arms to <hi>Ion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s
House, where I found his Wife, who presently made me a Bed ready and put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. I found that I had sweat through my Buffe Collar, insomuch that my very arms
were wet with it; we had brought no Baggage with us, but had left it at St. <hi>Maurice,</hi>
forasmuch as I my self had no very great hopes of bringing about my design, neither had
I any great reason to hope it; wherefore my servants were fain to dry my Shirt that I had
on, and all my other cloaths, which were almost in as bad a pickle, and so soon as the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier
<hi>Romegas,</hi> my Son, and the other Gentleman had left me in the hands of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
they departed to go fall upon the Castle; when at their going away I said to this
brave Chevalier,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s words to the Chevalier <hi>de Romegas.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I have seen the time when for such a dayes work as this I should not have
quitted either Cask or Corslet, and had there been any appearance of danger, I might perhaps
have passed over the night in this Estate; but there is no remedy, you young men must do
what we old men cannot.</hi> Having been in bed about half an hour, and all my cloaths being
dry, I got up again, and fell to dressing my self, which as I was doing there came in
Monsieur <hi>de Savignac,</hi> Captain <hi>Fabian,</hi> and some other Gentlemen with them, to tell me
that those of the Castle would surrender, and to know if I would consent, that they should
upon the Capitulation receive them to Quarter. Perceiving therefore that Monsieur <hi>de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignac</hi>
and Captain <hi>Fabian</hi> had a great desire to save <hi>Favas,</hi> and to give him fair quarter,
because he had the reputation of a good Soldier, and a gallant man; I told them they
might grant them what conditions they should think fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that I would sign the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation;
though inwardly I had a mind to make a dispatch: which was the reason,
that so soon as they were gone from me, I sent a Gentleman after to speak secretly to the
Soldiers,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> causes them to be all slain.</note> and some of the Captains, that during the Parly they should take their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to enter in on one side or another, and to kill them all: for that we must revenge
the death of the Gentlemen who had been so barbarously massacred at <hi>Navarreins,</hi> being
that contrary to Article, and the publick faith they had stab'd the Sieur <hi>de St. Colombe,</hi>
and seven or eight others, who had surrendred upon conditions of Quarter at <hi>Orthez</hi> at
the time when Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> was taken. The Enemy did this execution under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
that they were the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Subjects; but if the King offer to touch any
one of her Subjects, they presently say he cannot do it; all things must be allowed to these
people, and nothing to us; but I hope the time will come when the Dice shall turn, that
we may pay them in their own Coin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:105656:185"/>I could not have committed this execution to a better hand than to this Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being Cousin-German to the Baron <hi>de Pordeac,</hi> who was one of those that were massacred;
and he had no sooner spoken to two or three of the Captains, and to the Soldiers, but
that they presently ran to seek out for Ladders, which clapping to a Canton of the Base-Court

as they saw the disorder pulled to them, which was well for him, who had otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
gon to pot with the rest. Our Horse likewise who were on the right hand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that our people were within the Town, gallopped a little up the River, where they
found a Foard, which though it was very deep they notwithstanding passed over, and
ran directly to the Castle, on that side by the Religieux, where coming up just at the time
when five and twenty or thirty threw themselves out at the Windows, they sav'd those
also, otherwise there had hardly been any one left to carry the news, but Captain <hi>Favas</hi>
only. And thus the Town was taken; of which I immediately sent an account to the
Mareschal, and in the morning went my self to vvait upon him, vvhere he promised me
to come up the next day vvith all the Army, and I presently return'd back to <hi>Mont de
Marsan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly in the morning the Mareschal came at the time when I was taking the best
order I could to preserve the Town from being further sackt, but I could do little good in
it; and as I was going out at one Gate to meet him, he enterd by the other; for I had
much ado to get out, by reason all his Army were got into the Streets, especially the Horse,
by whom I was told that he was gone directly to the place where our people had entred,
where having seen all, and heard how all things had passed, he said, <hi>Here was more of
fortune than reason.</hi> Many there were also who made a shew of rejoycing at our success,
that in their hearts would have been glad I had receiv'd a baffle. At last with much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
I was no sooner got out, but that I was told he was already entred in: which made
me return, where I was again above half an hour so enclosed amongst the Carriages, that I
could not possibly get out, but in the end I made shift to get to his lodging. His Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
de Camp quarter'd all the Cavalry in the Villages without the Town beyond the
River, the Infantry in the Suburbs, and the Gentlemen in the Town. I thought
this success would perswade both him,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</note> and his Council also, to pass the River, and
enter into <hi>Bearn,</hi> which we had infallibly carried, and compell'd the Count either to
fight, or to shut himself up in <hi>Navarreins;</hi> but he positively told me, <q>That
he would return to look after his own business, in his own Government, and that he
would not go to engage himself before Towns in <hi>Bearn,</hi> having no Artillery to ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter
withal; and that he would not that either the King or any other should reproach him,
that he had spent his time in other Enterprizes than his own: that he had told the
King at his departure what he intended to do,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Mareschal.</note> which he would also put in execution,
considering that here he was only to fight with the Walls of the Towns of <hi>Bearn.</hi>
               </q> I
then remonstrated to him, that the Count would infallibly take one of these wayes, either
to hazard a Battel, which I thought he would never dare to do, or to leave the Country
so soon as he should hear of our coming, or else would shut up himself in his Fortress;
the last of which courses I conceiv'd he would not willingly take, but would rather choose
to retire: and that also we might easily have Canon from <hi>Dacqs</hi> and <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and that
this being done, the Province of <hi>Guienne</hi> would be at peace, that of <hi>Bearn</hi> reduc'd, and
all those in <hi>Languedoc</hi> would tremble at the report of our arms: that if on the other side,
should we follow in the said <hi>Montgommery</hi>'s Rear, we should certainly trap him in one
place or another, in case we should determine to pursue him where ever he should go to
that effect. All this I represented to the said Mareschal: but he, half angry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd
by those Gentlemen about him, objected difficulty upon difficulty, and would
by no means give ear to my advice. Now he had sent the Baron <hi>de l' Arbous</hi> towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getmau</hi>
to enquire news of the Enemy, which Baron sent him word by a Gentleman call'd
<hi>Repeyre</hi> of Monsieur <hi>de Gramont</hi>'s Company, of the disorder in which the Count <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gommery</hi>
had retreated into <hi>Bearn,</hi> and how his Artillery had for almost two dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
been abandoned upon the road to <hi>Orthez;</hi> and the Mareschal himself was the first
from whom I heard it, and afterwards from others, as I said before.</p>
            <p>The day before he intended to depart in order to his return, I had notice given me
that he had dispatched away the Sieur <hi>de Lussan</hi> towards the King, without saying a word
to me; which <hi>Lussan</hi> was my Enemy, because I would not suffer him to be Governour
of <hi>Lectoure.</hi> I thought it very strange that he would say nothing to me of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
apprehended that he had not made choice of this person to report any good of me;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105656:185"/>
for I knew he was not very well satisfied with me, forasmuch as he alwayes held his
Consultations apart, calling no one to his Counsels but Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sieur <hi>de Ioyeuse,</hi> Messieurs
<hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> the Father and the Son, and Monsieur <hi>de la Croissette</hi> his Mareschal de Camp.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore to be wondred at if I took it very ill that I was not admitted to the
Council, and that nothing was communicated to me, considering that I commanded the
Vaunt-guard, and was the second person in the Army. But it was so carried, and
I had reason to be highly offended at it, very well discerning that these Consultations were
held at our expence.</p>
            <p>When I saw then that the resolution was taken to return, I went in the Evening to the
Mareschal's Lodging, where I gave him to understand in the gentlest terms I could, (for
after that manner I was to proceed) <q>That I would send my Son to surrender up the
Government to the King;<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> offers to lay down his Government of <hi>Guienn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> for that seeing he went away I very well saw, that all the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Enemy from doing what he pleased in the King's Territories, by which means all the
honor and reputation I had acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d in the precedent troubles, in preserving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Guienne,</hi> would be lost and forfeited in this; that therefore I had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
another should bear the blame than I, who never had other design than to end my
dayes with honour, and nothing more.</q> To which he return'd me answer, <q>That I
ought not to do it, neither ought I either to stomack any thing from the King, or to
be angry with my self; and that I knew very well, that although the King had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon him the Command of <hi>Guienne,</hi> as well as the other Provinces, he did not
nevertheless meddle with it at all, but permitted me to govern as before, and should be
very unwilling to usurp upon my Authority. I made answer, That this was an effect
of his own generosity, and good nature, but that his Parent was so large, as did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
derrogate from mine, and that whenever he would he might command as pleased
him, without leaving me the least power at all, no more than the poorest <hi>Cadet</hi> in <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony.</hi>
To which he replyed, That it was true, but that my valour and experience were
so considerable, as would ever make me sought after and courted.</q> From this light foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
it arose, that I quitted my Government because I would not obey him; and after
this manner it was reported to the King by the fore-named Captain <hi>Lussan,</hi> or another
that was sent to Court presently after him:<note place="margin">The Kiing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the Sieur <hi>de Montluc.</hi>
               </note> and this was it that made the King so angry
with me for quitting my Government, they having possest him, that it was only upon
this account, which I no more thought of than of cutting my own throat: but I was
born under a Planet to be evermore subject to calumny. I gave the Mareschal an account
to the contrary, when, as sick as I was, I went to him to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> so soon as I heard he
was come thither, to make him a voluntary and free tender of all obedience, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any letter or command from the King, the Queen, or the Monsieur.</p>
            <p>By this it is easie to judg whether the difference that grew betwixt us arose from thence.
So it was that I suspected some foul play, forasmuch as a certain person had sent to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Noé</hi> Lieutenant to Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a stab.</note> to come and speak with him about an
affair that concern'd my life. Whereupon the said Sieur <hi>de Noé</hi> departed from <hi>Panjas,</hi>
or else from <hi>Noguarol,</hi> posting away in all hast, without telling any one but Monsieur <hi>de
Fontenilles</hi> onely; and at his return finding us in <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> told Monsieur <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenilles</hi>
and me, that a man who never stir'd out of the Mareschal's Chamber, and might
hear all that was spoken, had said to a friend of his these words; <hi>Montluc does nothing
but eternally vex and importune the Mareschal, but he will one day be laid dead upon the floor
with a stab.</hi> Immediately hereupon this person came to the House of him who sent for
Monsieur <hi>de Noé,</hi> and told it him, that he might acquaint me vvith it, vvhich vvas the
occasion that Monsieur <hi>de Noé</hi> had been sent unto to go vvhere he did. Monsieur <hi>de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
my Brother was at this time at <hi>Gaure,</hi> a place of his own within three leagues of
<hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> to whom I sent twice to beg of him with joyned hands that he would
come to me; but he would by no means be entreated to it, what excuses he made I have
now forgot. My design was to have had him discourse this affair with the Mareschal in
private betwixt them two only, where I intended to have dealt so candidly with him, as
to have nam'd the man who had spoke it; and that was one of his own people: but it rested
there, for I would not intrust the secret to any other: and although I took no notice of it,
yet it stuck damnably in my stomack, and I have since wondred how I could command my
self,<note place="margin">Fear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of old age.</note> by which I learn to know, that Age deprives a man of his heat: for in my younger
dayes the greatest Prince upon earth could not have made me swallow such a pill. The older
we grow, the more our blood steals from our heart, and it appears that the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to death, the more we fear it. It may be notwithstanding that this person might
make this story of his own head, and that the Mareschal never thought of any such thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:105656:186"/>The next morning I attended him at his rising. I had before day heard the Drums
beat in the fields, by break of day they began to march, and so soon as the sun was up I
went and knokt at his Chamber door, where a Valet de Chambre came out and told me
he was not yet awake, though I had been told below, that Messieurs <hi>de Ioycuse,</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and <hi>la Croisette</hi> were all gone in before. Nevertheless I wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed half an
hour or more at the door, and in that time knockt three or four times, but no body would
speak, though the Valet de Chambre, who came out to me, was gone in again, and that
I had intreated him if the Mareschal was awake to tell him that I was there. At last
being ashamed to wait so long at his door, which never a Prince in Christendom would
have suffered me to do, I was constrain'd to go walk in a little Garden of the House, not
so slende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly attended however, but that I had with me two hundred Gentlemen or more
of the best Families of the Country, who were as sensible of the affront, or more than I,
and said a great many passionate things to me; which though I knew very well to be
spoken out of the affection and respect they bore to me, yet as I was the oldest, I conceiv'd
I ought to be the most discreet, and to consider that I should put many things in hazard,
should I come to an absolute rupture with him. I waited above a long hour, what at
his Chamber door, and in the Garden, and in the end came Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde,</hi> who
seeing the Gentlemen asked them where I was: They told him I was in the Garden
thorough which he was to go to enter into the Hall; he then came to me, and asked me
why I did not go into the Mareschal's Chamber, to which I made answer, <hi>That I had
been there, and had knocked several times, but that no body would speak.</hi> He then told me,
that Monsieur <hi>de Ioycuse,</hi> his Son, and Captain <hi>Croisette</hi> had been there above an hour;
whereupon I told him, <hi>That I did not understand why the Mareschal should make me dance
attendance at his Chamber door, that I had never given him occasion to use me after that
manner, and that I had the honor from the King, the Queen, and the Monsieur all the while
they stayed in</hi> Guienne, <hi>that their Cham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er doors were never refused me, that I was not of a
condition to be so treated, but that since their Majesties service was interested in it I would make
no breach.</hi> He was very much troubled at it, for he and I had been good companions and
friends, and there had never been the least division betwixt us till death made the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He then went and knocked at the Chamber door, which was immediately open'd
to him, and as suddenly clapt to again upon me, at which all the Gentlemen advised
me to return to my Lodging, and to come up no more; but I was resolved to have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for which I have since a hundred times wondred at my self. The said Mareschal
stayed yet above a quarter of an hour before he came out, after Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> went
in, and at last he came, where I forced my self to give him the good-morrow, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to Mass, where by the way I intreated him to leave me one of the Companies of
Monsieur <hi>de Savignac</hi>'s Regiment, or two hundred Harquebuzeers, till such time as I
had remov'd the grain that was in the Town, that the Enemy might not make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it, therewith to victual <hi>Navarreins,</hi> there being by computation of Monsieur <hi>de
Cumies,</hi> and of those he had employed to examine it, twelve hundred Wagon loads of all
sorts of grain in the Town, as also by the account of the Providores, who had been joyn'd
with his Officers to look into that affair. For this City serves as a Granary to all the
<hi>Landes,</hi> and the <hi>Basques</hi> Country, from whence, to the detriment of <hi>France,</hi> they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their grain into <hi>Spain,</hi> and it is said to be one of the best Corn-Markets in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
He then mounted to horse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mont de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san</hi> the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of <hi>Gasco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y</hi>
               </note> and I went to wait upon him out of Town, and in so
doing found my self alone, not one of the Gentlemen that were with me once offering to
mount, to pass that Complement upon him; but whether they did it because their Horses
were not ready, or that they had no great mind to go, I know not, and so he departed.
Immediately after his departure I dispatcht away Captain <hi>Fabian</hi> my Son with letters to
the King, to surrender the Government into his Majesties hands, but when he came to
<hi>Bourg de Dieu,</hi> he was taken by the Enemy, and there lost his Leters, which was the
cause that he could not deliver his Majesty the reasons that mov'd me to quit my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which made his Majesty exceedingly offended with me, thinking it was because I
would not obey the Mareschal <hi>d' Anville,</hi> as Captain <hi>Lussan</hi> had given him to understand.
A thing that never entred into my thought; but I foresaw the Tempest, and would
therefore retire to give others leave to do better.</p>
            <p>The thing was evident enough by the report of several as well of the one as the other
Religion,<note place="margin">A discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the retreat of the Mares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal <hi>d'Anville.</hi>
               </note> that had the Mareschal passed the River the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> had infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly

not do it, by reason there was no provision, and in the other places of <hi>Bearn</hi> yet much
less. For which reason it would necessarily have followed, that necessity and famine would
have compell'd him to return headlong to the place from whence he came, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

the Country to us; when it would have been a thing of no manner of difficulty for
us to have defeated him either in front or rear, nay the very Peasants would have disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him, who would have taken heart seeing us so near, and never have suffer'd him to
pass the River. And if he himself will confess the truth, as others who were with him
have done, he ever gave himself for lost, till he heard that the Mareschal retir'd: and
to think of fighting a Battel he could never do it, considering the odds of Forces we had
against him. He alwayes said, <hi>that he had two great Mastifs at his breech, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would be strange he should escape, but that he would sell his skin as dear as he could.</hi>
On the other side, that I should imagine the Mareschal retreated out of cowardize, no
man living can say that; for to this hour that was never reported of him; he is of two
brave a Race, and has ever given proof to the contrary, and I esteem him a great Captain,
who is able to do a great deal of good, and a great deal of harm whenever he pleases, and
although some have censur'd and aspe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st him, because he was so near the Admiral, I, for
my part, had never any such opinion of him. I know not what he may do hereafter, I
never knew him other than a faithful servant of the Kings: but he ought not to have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
me after this manner. I had seen too much boyl'd and rost in my time. It was not
then fear that made him to retire, for his Forces were so much greater than those of the
Enemy, that we had defeated the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> with our Cavalry alone, and
our Argoulets, which we would have dismounted, without ever engaging our Foot in the
business. For at the Battel of <hi>Ver</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> had thrice as many Foot as the
Count <hi>de Montgommery,</hi> and a great many more Horse, better men, and better Officers,
and we were not so many Horse by two thirds as we were here, and yet we defeated them
and won the Battel. It cannot therefore be said that he did it out of fear of being beaten,
considering he had so little reason: but it was our misfortune that it was fixt in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal's
fancy, and more in that of his Council, that he should ruine himself before the
Towns of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and do no good, not knowing the sterility of the Country, as we did,
and that Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> had so devour'd all the provisions of those parts, that there
could be none left for the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> had he stayed there. Had it pleased
God that the Mareschal had not been so bent upon returning into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> to pursue
his own designs in those parts, or that his Council had been of an opinion contrary to him,
and that he had resolv'd to pass the River, it had been a happy thing, and of infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to us: and on the contrary turn'd very much to our prejudice; for he went and
engag'd himself before <hi>Mazeres,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Mazeres.</hi>
               </note> where he lost a great number of the best Soldiers he had,
and almost ruin'd his Army, without being able to make any other attempt. By which
means there was nothing done of any moment either in <hi>Languedoc</hi> or <hi>Guienne,</hi> but utterly
undoing the people, our own Forces having in all parts done as much mischief, as the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
themselves. Neither was it possible to be avoided, by reason of the great number of
Gens d'arms, Light-horse, Argoulets, and Foot that we had, who must all of necessity
live upon free quarter. Thus did all the Mareschal's Forces, which were sufficient both to
defeat <hi>Montgommery,</hi> and afterwards to make head against the Admiral, moulder away
and vanish without performing any thing worthy to be repeated.</p>
            <p>I have ever observ'd, that when Almighty God is not pleased that matters shall succeed
as men desire, he infatuates their Councels, and turns the will of the Chief, and of his
Counsellors quite contrary to what they ought to do. His name be praised for all, since it
was his Divine pleasure to have things go as they did. There is no one, after the people, that
smarts for it but I, because I incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r'd the Mareschal's disfavour by speaking the truth.
He ought in reason to have lov'd me more than those that counsell'd him to do contrary
to what I advis'd him; but 'tis the Law of <hi>Bearn,<note place="margin">Law of <hi>Bearn.</hi>
                  </note> The beaten must bear the blame;</hi> for
the King has approv'd, and ratified all that the Mareschal did, and disallowed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all my doings, and indeed I declin'd towards my setting, and was no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd
like a rising Sun, and yet I am as innocent and unblameable of that fault (if fault
there was) as I had never been born into the world, of which I desire no other testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
than the three Estates of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> which is neighbour to it, who know
how all things passed, and have smarted for the miseries of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and dare moreover
stand to the depositions of all the Captains, three or four excepted, who were of the
Council, for those were the cause of the evil. I am not the first who for well doing have
been paid with this Coin, of which I have given Exemples enow in this Book, and find
it a good matter to be a great Lord; for a little Companion as I am must alvvayes bear the

much encourag'd our Enemies. As for my own part, in five Companies that I had there was
not left two hundred men, by reason they were stoln away, with what booty they had got,
every man to his own house.<note place="margin">The inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king war with Soldiers, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the same Country where the Scene of war lies.</note> This is the inconvenience of making war with the people of

regard, and of whom he has care. And as to the Cava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry we had, they could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

of it self was barren. However I stayed four or five dayes after the Mareschals departure,
causing three or four hundred Waggon loads of grain to be remov'd from thence, which
I carried to <hi>Euse,</hi> and other adjacent places, that the Enemy might not therewith vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
their Towns in <hi>Bearn:</hi> but I must have carried away fifteen hundred load or more
to have remov'd it all; and had my five Ensigns been compleat, as at my coming thither,
I would have engag'd my self in it, though I was certain not to be reliev'd, for I have
committed as great follies in my life as that, and hitherto (blessed be God) never met

               </note> I sent Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> also into the Country of <hi>Bigorre,</hi> to see if he
could do any thing on that side to amuze the Enemy, but all this was no remedy for so
great a discase. I shall not here take upon me to give a particular account of the defeat
of Captain <hi>Arne,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de l' Arbous,</hi> for as much as I did not place them there,
where they were defeated; but so it was, that I sent however to Captain <hi>Arne</hi> to tell
him, <hi>That he was a Soldier, and must needs know that in the place where he was he could
expect nothing but disaster, and that therefore I conceiv'd he would do well to retire to</hi> Auch,
<hi>which was an enclosed Town;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Captain <hi>Arne</hi> flain,</note> 
               <hi>but he sent me word, that he was placed there, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resolved rather to dye than to stir a foot from thence.</hi> It was not above four dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had given him this advice that news was brought me of his defeat, and two dayes
after that of his death, which was a great damage to the Kings service, and a great loss to
his Country; for he was a fine Gentleman, and a valiant man, and one of whom we had as
great an esteem, as of any Captain whatever of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now soon after the Mareschal being about <hi>Mazers,</hi> and I in <hi>Agenois,</hi> the Count <hi>de
Montgommery</hi> did like the Wolves whom hunger forces out of the Woods, and came into
<hi>Armagnac,</hi> by little and little moving towards <hi>Condommois.</hi> He had caused three pieces
of Canon to be brought, and two Culverines to batter <hi>Euse,</hi> knowing very well that there
was no body in it but Monsieur <hi>de Montespan</hi> with his Father's Company of Gens-d' arms,
and the new-rais'd Company of Foot that I had sent him. So soon therefore as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
was come to <hi>Noguarol,</hi> that he had sent to discover the Enemy, and that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonot
Kindred and Friends he had, had given him notice of the preparation against him,
he sent me word of it. I had no body to send to reinforce him, and less power of my
self to relieve him, neither was there any relief to be expected; for the Mareschal was
either lying before <hi>Mazeres,</hi> or else retir'd to <hi>Tholouze.</hi> I therefore sent him word,
<hi>That I would not he should follow the exemple of Captain</hi> Arne, <hi>and that it was enough we
had lost one brave and valiant Captain, and one Company of Gens-d'arms, without losing two;
that therefore he should retire and take along with him all the Priests and Religious people of
the Town, together with all the rich Catholick Merchants, and escape to</hi> Lectoure. which
he accordingly did; for although I had sent to surrender my Goverment, I did not for
all that forbear to do all that lay in my power for the service of my King and Country,
but raised five or six Companies about <hi>Ville-neufue</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> leaving one old and two
new Companies at the said <hi>Florence,</hi> and four (with that of the Governnor Monsieur <hi>de
Panjas</hi>) at <hi>Lectoure,</hi> which were enow, by reason that all the Gentry of <hi>Armagnac</hi> with
their Families were retir'd into that place, which made the Town so full that no more
could lodg there: and these things being done I came to <hi>Agen,</hi> where I heartned the
Inhabitants the best I could, and stayed there for some dayes. The Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:105656:187"/>
then came to <hi>Euse,</hi> where so soon as he was arriv'd the Hugonots of <hi>Candom</hi> (who had
liv'd at home under protection of the Kings Edict, having evermore hypocritically profest
not to take arms, relying upon his Majesties Royal word, and had been used with greater
humanity than the Catholicks themselves) betook themselves to arms, and went to seek
out the Count <hi>de Montg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">The Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> at <hi>Condom.</hi>
               </note> But they all assur'd him that I
had no men, nor means to raise any to make head against him, and that therefore he might
securely come, and so they allur'd him to <hi>Condom.</hi> These were the fine fruits of the fine
Edict they perswaded the King to make, that provided the Hugonots stirr'd not from
their Houses, no one should demand any thing of them. I have spoken of this suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
elsewhere; though, if I would, I have a great deal more to say, and of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
but it would do no good, for the King would take no order in it, since those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

            <p>A few dayes after we heard news of the Victory God had given the King, thorough the

to come with four Companies he had there and at <hi>St. Foy,</hi> to port <hi>St. Maries</hi>

               </hi>
after the fine piece of work the Captain of the Castle had made, who would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
himself upon Captain <hi>Montaut,</hi> and was upheld by some about the Mareschal,
who were related to him. But I referre it to the truth, which those of the Town did no
wayes conceal, and never after receive him. The City of <hi>Agen</hi> and the Clergy there, had
set a foot a Company of two hundred Strangers at their own charge, commanded by one
Captain <hi>Raphaël</hi> an Italian, who was married in the Town.</p>
            <p>The said Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> remained six or seven weeks at <hi>Condom,</hi> wherein he
committed an error; for had he followed his blow he had put a great many to their
trumps: but who is it that is never mistaken? The Mareschal's Camp was at <hi>Tholouze,
Granade,</hi> and thereabouts; they had no great fancy to bite one another, for they never
so much as gave one another an Alarm. The Mareschal had put out Monsieur <hi>de Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilles</hi>
from the place to which I had sent him, and taken from him the Command I had
given him in those parts, and order'd me to be about <hi>Beaumont de Lomagne,</hi> openly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping
upon my Government, according to his Patent. He sent likewise to the Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n
<hi>de Gondrin,</hi> Signicur <hi>de Montespan</hi> (whose Father lay sick at <hi>Lectoure)</hi> to come to him,
giving orders every where that none should obey me in the least; for that I was no more
the Kings Lieutenant, but that he was the man. He writ twice also to Monsieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daillan,</hi>
that he should not fail to bring his Company to him, who both times returned
him answer, <hi>That the Company was mine, and none of his, and that it was not in his power
to bring it to him;</hi> and all the affronts he could put upon me, he did. This nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
me in my own particular, for what I did was in order to his Majesties service, and
for the conservation of the Country. Behold how particular animosities occasion a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ruine! notwithstanding I did not for all this forbear to act, as if I had still been the
King's Lieutenant; and it was requisite for the poor Country's interest, that I should
not regard the injuries he put upon me; for my despite might have done a great deal of
mischief. Being the Son of a Constable of <hi>France,</hi> and himself a Mareschal, I did by
no means disdain to be commanded by him, had he been pleased to command me, and that
he would have done his duty.<note place="margin">Division be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <hi>d' An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>
               </note>
But so it was, that he as much as in him lay traverst all
my designs for the conservation of <hi>Guienne,</hi> which stood in much greater need than <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.</hi>
In the mean time news was brought us, that the Princes and the Admiral were
in <hi>Perigord,</hi> and took the way of <hi>Quercy</hi> to retire to <hi>Montauban,</hi> by which I very well

Governor, and some thirty or fourty Gentlemen of those parts, who were retir'd with
them into the Town. I then return'd to <hi>Lectoure,</hi> where I did not stay above three or

the Enemy would infallibly attaque that place. I then assur'd them, that I would not
engage my self there: whereupon they asked me, if I thought it convenient that they
should write a Letter to the Mareschal in the behalf of all the Gentry of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

Clergy, and Magistracy, and to give me notice so soon as ever they were met together, for
I would go speak with them. They accordingly did so, neither did they need to use
many entreaties, for rich and poor, every one ran to see me, and to hear what I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
them to do. When so soon as I came into the Hall (which was so full that five or
six Gentlemen I had brought along with me had much ado to crowd in) I plac'd my
self in the middest of them, to the end that every one might hear me, and spake to them
to this effect.</p>

fit for them to be at continual labour) but that all those of the City, both Rich and Poor,
Women and Children, without exempting any one, should put their hands to the work.
Now before I would suffer Messieurs <hi>de Blazimond,</hi> and <hi>de la Lande</hi> to speak, I entreated
them, that all those who should answer, would speak so loud that every one might hear
them; which they also did, and when all the three Orders had made an end of speaking,
I strain'd my voice, and said, <hi>Have you all heard what these Gentlemen have propos'd who
have spoken in the behalf of the whole City?</hi> to which they cried out that they had;
whereupon as I had held up my hand, I made them hold up theirs, and take the same
Oath I had taken; which being done, I desir'd them every one to withdraw to provide
all sorts of Instruments, and that I would retire to my Lodging with the principal men
of the City, to make election of the eight who were to govern over them: but being it
was already almost night they entreated me, that seeing they were all together, I would
give them leave to make election of the eight, that I would please in the mean time, to
retire to warm my self, and to get my Boots off, and that the next morning they would bring
me a List of their Burgers names, of them to make election which eight I should think
fit. And so I withdrew to my Lodging, where after supper there came to me M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de Blazimond</hi> and <hi>de la Lande,</hi> the good man <hi>de Nort</hi> and his Sons, with so great joy, as
more could not be exprest; telling me that the Merchants who had pack'd up their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and a good many of them already loaded them in Waggons had unloaded all,
and that they thought never City was overjoy'd as theirs was, and that so much as to the
very Women and Children there was no other talk but of fighting, knowing the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that I had taken to tarry amongst them.</p>
            <p>Companions, you who shall take the pains to read my life, you may take fair exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
by me. This people, who were all their wits end, and ready to over-run the City,
immediately at my word only reassum'd such courage, that I will be bold to say with
truth, no man ever after discover'd the least apprehension in them; though to say the truth
they had no great reason to be so secure, the Town being of two great a circuit well to be
defended, commanded moreover by a Mountain, and too Armies ready to fall upon us
at once. Believe me, Companions, when I tell you, that upon your resolution depends
that of all the people, who take courage, as they see you do. And how great a good
shall you do, besides the honour you acquire to your selves, to save a poor City from the
Sack? so many Families stand eternally oblig'd to you, and not only the City it self, but
the whole Country also: for the taking of the Capital City of a Province ordinarily
draws after it the loss of a whole Seneschalsie. I, but you will say, a man must then shut
himself up in a place where he can acquire honour: and where will you have that to be,
in a Castle of <hi>Millan?</hi> it cannot be there; for there it is the strength of the walls that
defends you; but it must be in a place that you see to be of publick concern, let it be
never so weak. <hi>A good heart is a good Fortress.</hi> I could have stayd at <hi>Lectoure,</hi> and have
hearkned how the squares went. I had nothing to lose at <hi>Agen,</hi> and could justly have
laid all the blame upon the Mareschal, who had shoulders broad enough to bear it, but
this good City being taken, I saw all the Country was lost. In a time of need and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
therefore shew that you have a heart to drive fear out of others; and in so doing you
will alwayes appear to be what you are; and assure your selves that the Enemy seeing
such a man engag'd in a place, will think on't thrice before he will once come to

attaque you. I have (as you may have observ'd before) ever had that good fortune, the

to attaque me. Get then this priviledge over you Enemy, as you will do in doing well,

what Forces I on my part could assist him. I then reckon'd to him, that what from <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufue,
Lectoure, Agen,</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> I could make a thousand Harquebuzeers, and the
thousand of Monsieur <hi>de Montferran,</hi> shewing him the Letters that the said Sieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferran</hi>
had sent me from <hi>St. Macaire.</hi> He could not find in his heart to lose so much time
as to bait his horses, before he return'd to carry back this news to the Mareschal, when
being just about to take horse to return, there came a letter from Monsieur <hi>de Montferran,</hi>
dated from <hi>Marmande,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his horse. At the end of three dayes, the Troops being at Port <hi>St. Marie</hi> and <hi>Aguillon,</hi>
I had word sent me from <hi>Lectoure,</hi> that the Mareschal was return'd from <hi>Grenade</hi> to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi>
out of despite at the Letter the Gentlemen of <hi>Armagnac</hi> had written to him, which
I have made mention of before, and that for one clause that was in it, which ran thus;
<hi>That in case he should not please to march to come to help to re-establish th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they should be constrain'd to go apply themselves to the King in their own persons, humbly to
beg assistance from him.</hi> This was the ground of all his discontent, and he discharg'd his
anger upon me, accusing me that I had caused the said Letter to be writ: I will not deny
but that the first draught was read to me as I was mounting to horse; but, so God help
me, I could not have repeated six words of it, for my affection hurried me away to <hi>Agen,</hi>
to take care that the Town should not be forsaken, and took horse that very minute it
was read to me, as I have said before. However I leave it to any man of understanding to
judg if these words were of such importance, that the said Mareschal ought reasonably to
have taken such offence at them. It was at the King that he took offence, and not at us.
He is the Kings Subject as well as we. O! would I have taken pet after this manner, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the Mareschal was return'd in discontent to <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and that he would hardly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd

not know but that the Princes might turn their designs that way, hearing there was no
body in it. Which he accordingly did, as there was good reason, by which means I was
left naked, without hope of being reliev'd by any person whatsoever. Thus for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a word, for one insignificant picque, the whole Country ran a dangerous
fortune.</p>
            <p>You Princes, Mareschals, and Lieutenants of Provinces, who command Armies, never
sacrifice the publick interest to a private distaste. The Mareschal ought to have consider'd,
that these were <hi>Gascons</hi> exil'd from their own houses, who writ in passion: he ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been offended at me, nor them; but to have excus'd their sensibility, and not

confer together like Brothers, and after some handsome service, or good success, open their
hearts to one another, and become good friends. I have since been told by some who had
the good fortune to be there, that most of the Chiefs who were at the great Battel that
was obtain'd over the Turk, were mortal enemies, but that they agreed out of respect to
the common interest, and after the Battel became perfect friends. Would to God the
Mareschal would have left the animosity he had against me at <hi>Tholouze</hi> to have come and
claw'd away <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by it, whereas his peevishness ruin'd all. I thought I had been the most cholerick
fellow in the world, but he has made it appear that he is more passionate than I. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
had he been pleased to come, I would have serv'd him as freely as the meanest
Gentleman in the Army.</p>
            <p>Having understood his resolution I sent twice to Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> to bring his
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mpany, and come put himself into the Town with me; but he could very hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
leave to come, though he came at last. I had the four Companies my Nephew <hi>de
Leberon</hi> had brought me from <hi>Libourn,</hi> three at <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> and another at <hi>Aguillon,</hi>
which immediately upon the departure of Monsieur <hi>de Montferran</hi> by my order came in
thither: and before Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Agen,</hi> a Gentleman called Monsieur
<hi>de Montazet,</hi> came to entreat me to call away the Company that was at <hi>Aguillon,</hi> and
that he would undertake to defend the Town with the Inhabitants only. A promise that
although I knew he was not able to make good, and that he only did it to spare the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of the Town. I nevertheless granted his request, fearing he would write to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ieur
le Marquis <hi>de Villars,</hi> that I had made him to consume the fruits of his Estate, and
sent the Company to <hi>Ville-neufue.</hi> Wherein I committed a very great error, for this place
had kept the Rivers of <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Garonne:</hi> but these bawling fellows, who will spare their
Masters Houses and Estates, to appear good Stewards, oftentimes lose very considerable
places. Therefore you, who have the honour to command, stop your ears against all
complaints in such cases, and so pressing necessities. I had done a great deal better, if upon
this occasion I had practis'd the Lesson that I now teach you.</p>
            <p>Now you must know I drave on an Enterprize with Monsieur <hi>de Leberon,</hi> to go give a
Scalado to the Captains <hi>Manciet</hi> and <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>audy,</hi> two errant Rogues who lay at <hi>Monheurt.</hi>
The said Sieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> was with eight or ten Harquebuzeers only at <hi>Aguillon,</hi> that he
might the better conceal his design. <hi>Viard,</hi> Muster-Master to the Mareschals Camp, came
at this time to <hi>Agen,</hi> who was going to Court from the Mareschal, and though I knew
very well that the said Mareschal was very much out with me, yet did I not forbear to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and pay all respect to all that came from him, being it was for his Majesties service.
I therefore writ to Monsieur <hi>de Leberon,</hi> that he should send a Convoy with him till he
was past <hi>Toneins,</hi> whom he found at <hi>Aguillon,</hi> in order to the Enterprize they were the
next day at night to put into execution; for I was sending him five or six Boats full of
Soldiers from <hi>Agen,</hi> and the three Companies that were at the Port were also to joyn in
the business. But, as the fortune of war is sometimes very odd and extravagant, she well
appear'd to be so the day that the Muster-Master <hi>Viard</hi> passed that way; for the said Sieur
<hi>de Leberon</hi> giving him a certain number of Harquebuzeers for his Convoy, and making
account that in three hours time they would be back again; whilst he waited in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:105656:190"/>
of their return there arrived Messieurs <hi>de la Caze, de la Loüe, de Guytinieres, de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neins,</hi>
and other Captains, with 7 or 8 Cornets of Horse, who were come from <hi>Lauserthe,</hi>
which is nine long leagues, and had not baited above an hour at <hi>Haute-faye;</hi> to be short
they had made a Cavaleade with the diligence of old Soldiers, and environ'd <hi>Aguillon.</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> seeing himself thus trapt alone with but very few Soldiers, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Town, was in a little perplexity what to do in his defence, when Monsieur
<hi>de Montazet</hi> presently came and told him, that he was not able to defend the Town, and
that he would not put it to the hazard of being ruin'd and sackt; and accordingly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado made some conditions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aguillon</hi> taken.</note> which was well for the said <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eron,</hi> for he fell
into the hands of these four, who were all of them my very good friends, by reason that
in former times I had done something for them. I was the first Captain that ever shewed
Captain <hi>Moneins</hi> any service, and made him a Soldier; and the rest were every one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to acknowledge the several obligations they had to me; and so let him go. These
are Civilities amongst Soldiers: but my said Nephew play'd there the part of a Novice,
not to reserve to himself men enow for a time of need: he thought the Enemy was too
far off to trouble him. Captains, my Companions, this was a ridiculous security of his,
he ought to have consider'd the importance of the place, situated upon two Rivers, and
that the Enemy could not but covet so sweet a mors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, the vicinity of <hi>Cleirac</hi> and <hi>Toneins</hi>
consider'd. But I play'd the fool as well as he, in drawing out the Garrison, for fear of
offending the Marquis.</p>
            <p>So soon as ever I heard of his being taken, I drew my three Companies that were at the
Port into <hi>Agen.</hi> Two dayes after the Princes Army came and encampt themselves, their
quarters extending from <hi>Aguillon,</hi> as far as within half a league of <hi>Ville-neufue,</hi> and up to
the great Road, which leads to the said <hi>Ville-neufue,</hi> all along the valleys which are in that
place, where there are very good Villages. Now, as I have already said, I had divided
the City into eight parts, and over every division had set two good Chiefs of the Town.
It was a delightful thing to see the men and women all work, who came to it constantly
by break of day, and never gave over till the night took them off: they were never longer
than an hour at dinner, and all the head Burgers of the City were eternally solliciting them
to ply their labour, from which no one was exempt, not even the Religious women. One
night a man came to tell me, that a Troop of Reiters were come up within a quarter of a
League of us, to a Village close by <hi>Moubran,</hi> which is a Castle belonging to the Bishop of
<hi>Agen.</hi> In the morning therefore I mounted to horse with my Company, and went close
up to the Village, where, because two Country fellows told me, that three other Cornets
of Reiters were quarter'd very near unto the first, I made the Argoulets that came out with
me stay behind, assuring my self that the Reiters would relieve their fellows, being so
near, and that consequently we should be put to retreat in haste, where I should be in
danger of losing the said Argoulets, by reason they were not very well mounted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
there was dirt up to the Horse Cambrils. Nevertheles some of the best mounted of
them went along with Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> whom I commanded to charge des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
quite through the Bourg. He did so, and some few were kill'd in the Streets
as they passed, whereupon the Reiters put themselves into two or three houses
where their Officers were quarter'd. The other three Cornets who were quarter'd close by,
upon the Alarm were immediately on horse back, so that all we could do was to carry away
six and thirty of their horses, and I believe had I suffer'd all the Argoulets to go they had
not left them one: but Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> seeing the three Cornets coming upon the
Gallop to relieve their Companions, retreated to me; but they did not much pursue him,
and so we retir'd into the Town.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Viard</hi> was soon back from Court, for he had both the Kings Pass and the Princes;
and went to find out the Mareschal. The next morning after we had taken the Horses
Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> arriv'd, by which means I had two Companies of Gens d'armes
in the City,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Laug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ac</hi> at <hi>Peymirol.</hi>
               </note> and three of Foot. I had from my first coming placed Monsieur <hi>de Laugnac</hi>
at <hi>Peymirol</hi> with two Foot Companies, which were those of the Garrison of <hi>Port. St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
and <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ves,</hi> who made very brave skirmishes, and though Monsieur <hi>de Laugnac</hi> was
then sick of the disease that so long has held him, he nevertheless kept the Soldiers night
and day abroad, and was evermore making some attempt upon the Enemy. Our Horse
went out very often, but they still found the Reiters so barricado'd and bolted up in the
Villages,<note place="margin">Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> that nothing was to be got of them but blows, and they were alwayes mounted
in a trice. In truth those people encamp themselves like true men of war, it is very hard
to surprize them: they are more careful than we, especially of their horses and arms, and
are besides more terrible in war, for a man can see nothing but fire and steel; and not a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ldiers. I could not relieve our Cavalry with foot, by reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
foulness of the wayes, and also fearing a mischance, having so few men as I had
in the City; which should any sinister accident have fall'n out, might have struck such
a terror into the Town, as might have drawn after it the loss of the place. I was only on
the defensive part, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et I kept them in awe, giving them to understand that I did not
much fear them. The Princes and the Admiral lay five weeks or more where I have said,
and Monsieur <hi>de Montgommery</hi> three or above at <hi>Condom,</hi> his quarters extending as far as
<hi>la Plume des Bruilles.</hi> We did nothing on either side, forasmuch as I had no men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing withall, and they lay quiet, eating and drinking their fill, and making
good cheer; for they had so suffer'd ever since the defeat of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> as nothing could
possibly be more; so that I think they had more mind to rest than to meddle with me.
As for my part I night and day intended my Fortification. Being upon these terms, and
in this posture on both sides, one night arriv'd Monsieur <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who came from the
Monsieurs Camp, and by fortune happen'd to be at <hi>Ville-neufue,</hi> at the time when the
Princes sent a Trumpet to Monsieur <hi>de Cassaneuil</hi> to summon the Town.<note place="margin">The Princes summon <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufue.</hi>
               </note> The said Sieur
<hi>de la Valette</hi> himself order'd the answer, which was, <hi>That the Town was the King's, and
none of theirs; that therefore if either Trumpet or Drum should again come on such an errand
they would kill him, and that there were too many men of honour in the Town to deliver it up.</hi>
The said Sieur <hi>de la Valette</hi> hazarded himself in the night to pass the Enemies Camp in
exceeding great danger, and came to me about nine of the clock. He found me in bed;
for I was very much reliev'd by Messieurs <hi>de Fontenilles, de Madaillan, de Leberon,</hi> and the
other Captains, by which means I slept at my ease; all things in the mean time going on
in marvailous good order, as well by night as by day. Old age must be excus'd. The said
Sieur <hi>de la Valette</hi> told me that I must presently send away a Chief to command over all
those who were in <hi>Ville-neufue,</hi> or that otherwise the Town was about to be lost; yet
would by no means tell me the reason, but only that I must make haste immediately to
send away a Chief, alwayes telling me, that if I was not sudden I should be the first would
repent it, for that it was a place of importance, and a neat Town of War. But he said
enough to make me get out of bed, for I would not slight the advice of so good a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
as his; and therefore instantly dispatch't away two men to the Chevalier my Son at
<hi>Lectoure, that immediately upon the reading my letter he should mount to horse, and come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to me to</hi> Agen; <hi>thence to put himself into</hi> Ville-neufue, <hi>and that by the haste he should
make I should know if he were my Son.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ville-neufue.</note> I writ also to the Chevalier <hi>de Romegas,</hi> entreating
him to perform alone what they two had joyntly undertaken before. It was day before
the two Messengers got to <hi>Lectoure,</hi> whereupon the Chevalier my Son immediately took
leave of all the Gentlemen that were there, and about three in the afternoon come to <hi>Agen.</hi>
Four or five dayes before this Monsieur <hi>de Montgommery</hi> with all his Camp, both Horse
and Foot came to give a Camisado to Captain <hi>Codreils,</hi> Lieutenant to my Son Captain
<hi>Fabian</hi>'s Troop of Light-horse, which I had put into <hi>Moyrax,</hi> with five and twenty Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and five and twenty Harquebuzeers. Now <hi>Moyrax</hi> is a little Village enclosed with
walls, the highest part whereof might be mounted with a Ladder of twelve staves, and
without Flankers, where he arriv'd an hour before day. Of this design news was brought
me to <hi>Agen,</hi> at a time when I had newly taken a Glister, which I had yet in my belly;
whereupon without any more ado I put on my arms, mounted to horse, and went to pass
the River. The Gentlemen of my two Companies past after one another as fast as they
could. Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> came not till the next day, and those that came in the night
follow'd after such a manner, that I found my self with no more but four horse only on
the other side of the River towards <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cony,</hi> where <hi>Moyrax</hi> is situated, and near unto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillac,</hi>
which is mine. With these four horses I galloped full-drive directly to <hi>Moyrax,</hi> it
being a League betwixt that and the River: so that in truth had Monsieur <hi>de Montgom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>
sent out ten or twelve horse only upon the Road from <hi>Agen,</hi> to <hi>Moyrax,</hi> I had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
been kill'd or taken: but a man must sometimes play the Soldier, and tempt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Your Enemy knows not what you do. And thus I arriv'd at <hi>Moyrax,</hi> where I found
that the said <hi>Montgommery</hi> was departed about half an hour before, and had left his lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at the foot of the wall; where, though they had stayd two long hours, they never
had the courage to set them up, which made me, though I had before no great opinion
of their Foot, to think much worse of them now; and so I return'd back to <hi>Agen;</hi>
where at my return the Physicians were fain to give me another Glister to bring away the
first, which by the pains I had taken was hindred from working, and made me so ill, that
I two dayes kept my bed. So soon as the Chevalier my Son was come, I presently sent for
Captain <hi>Cadreils,</hi> sending five and twenty Harquebuzeers in his room, to the end that he
might go with my said Son to <hi>Ville-neufue.</hi> At this time Monsieur <hi>de St. Giron,</hi> brother
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:105656:191"/>

had caused himself to be brought sick to <hi>Agen,</hi> having been wounded at the Assault
of <hi>Mazeres,</hi> either in a leg or in a thigh; and would retire himself to his own house for
his cure. At one of the clock in the night I put out my Son, his Camrades, and two
Guides,<note place="margin">The Chevaliet <hi>de Montluc</hi> at <hi>Ville-neufue.</hi>
               </note> bidding them be sure to be the next morning by break of day at <hi>Ville-neufue.</hi> Every
one was exceeding glad of his coming, and I believe their dispute was that they would not
obey one another. I would have sent my young Son Captain <hi>Fabian</hi> thither, but that we
gave him over for a dead man, after his return from the Camp; and at this time had no
manner of hope of his recovery.</p>
            <p>Now I had hourly intelligence,<note place="margin">A Bridge of Boats made by the Admiral.</note> that the Admiral was making a Bridg of Boats at Port
<hi>St. Marie,</hi> and to that end had gather'd together all the Boats upon the <hi>Lot,</hi> and the
<hi>Garonne,</hi> as far as <hi>Marmanda.</hi> I had also hourly intelligence that the Enemy had sent for
great Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>illery into <hi>Bearn.</hi> All which made me hasten the Trenches and Fortifications
I was making at <hi>Agen,</hi> believing, as there was very good reason, that all this preparation
was intended against me; for <hi>Agen</hi> was no small prize, as well for the Riches, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the defeating of so many men of condition, who had shut themselves up in it for
my sake. I then call'd a Council in my Lodging, and in a little Cabinet there, where we
were no more but eight or nine persons to consult, and contrive which way we might break
this Bridg. Now there was a Free Mason of <hi>Tholouze</hi> in the Town, who had made the
Marquis <hi>de Villars</hi> some Mills at <hi>Aguillon,</hi> and this fellow upon some discourse with some
one or another had said, that if we turn'd one of those Water-mills, which lay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
before the Town afloat, it would break the Bridg: for the River of <hi>Garonne</hi> was
great, and very much out, and every day still rising, because it almost continually rain'd.
There was not any one man of his opinion, that a Mill could break the Bridg, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we had been assur'd, that the Admiral had caused Cables as thick as a mans leg
to be made at <hi>Thoneins,</hi> and others of the like size to be brought from <hi>Montauban</hi> also, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with very great Chains; which was very true, for besides the great Cables, the Bridg
was lock't fast together with great and ponderous Chains. To make short of my story,
not one of us was of the Masons opinion but Captain <hi>Thodeas</hi> our Engineer only, who
said, that in case the Mill was loaded with great stones he thought it might do the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but not without being loaden; and so we concluded nothing. Two dayes after I
had word sent me from <hi>Tholouze,</hi> that the Mareschal <hi>d'Anville</hi> was equipping three Boats,
which were to be conducted by Captain <hi>St. Projet,</hi> mann'd with threescore men, which
in eight dayes would be ready, and that the said <hi>St. Projet</hi> within that time was to bring
them down by night to break the Bridg. Concerning our design we had debated, that
we could not load this Mill, but that the Admiral would have intelligence of it by those
of the Religion who liv'd in <hi>Agen</hi> under the protection of that accursed Edict, (for so I
may, and ever shall term it) so that (I know not how) we remain'd distracted in our
design, without hope of any other remedy, but only in bravely defending our selves.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Muster-Master <hi>Viard</hi> came again to <hi>Agen,</hi> being sent a second time
from the Mareschal to the King,<note place="margin">The Mareschal <hi>d'Anville</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to break the Bridg.</note> and bringing along with him a Trumpet of the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rescal's,
arriv'd on Wednesday betwixt nine and ten a clock in the morning: where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me in private with the Mareschal's Enterprize to break the Bridg: but that he
was afraid the Admiral had intelligence of his design: for which reason he had brought
one of the Mareschals Trumpets to go with him as far as <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> where if he
should, when he came thither, find that the Enemy had any inkling of it, he would send
back the Trumpet to let me know so much, that I might stop the said <hi>St. Projet</hi> from
going any further; to which end, and that he might not slip by, I was to keep continual
watch upon the River day and night. And so he took his leave of me, and arriv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two in the afternoon at <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> where he saw three Cornets of Reiters pass
over the Bridg, to come quarter on that side of the River towards <hi>Gascony.</hi> The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
had very good leisure to view the Bridg, and to observe how strongly it was fastned;
to be sure those of <hi>Clairac</hi> and <hi>Thoneins</hi> had spar'd for no cost nor labour, those good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thinking nothing too dear that was laid out to annoy and mischief their Neighbours,
and against the King. About nine at night the Trumpet return'd, by whom <hi>Viard</hi> sent
me word, that I should have a care <hi>St. Projet</hi> proceeded no further to execute his design;
for the Enemy had notice of it, aud had planted seven or eight small pieces of Artillery at
that end of the Bridg towards <hi>Gascony,</hi> and that the other end was guarded by a thousand
or twelve hundred Harquebuzeers: In short, that I must by no means suffer him to go, for
not a man of those that went could possibly escape. So soon as the Trumpet had deliver'd
his Message he retir'd to his Lodging, and I, without making any more noise, sent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
for three persons of the Town to whom I had already discover'd my intention,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:105656:192"/>
which was to set adrift the Mill belonging to President <hi>Sevin,</hi> by reason the said President
had abandoned the Town. I will not here name the three men, because the President
would sue them, and the Commissioners, who are now in those parts, would easily give
him what damages he would desire, as they do others against the Catholicks. After, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a while conferred together, we concluded that they should send out six Soldiers who
were Mariners, who should go, and under colour of watching upon the Bank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that Captain <hi>St. Projet</hi> did not pass by, unloose the Mill. Thus then they all three
departed from me, and were not slow in sending out the Soldiers, neither were they idle
to unloose the Mill; one whereof was drown'd in loosing the Chain, falling from the
little Boat, as the stake broke to which the Chain was fastned. This might be about eleaven
of the clock at night, and I have been told since by some of the Enemy, the Mill came to
the Bridge about one. Now the Enemy had placed Centinels more than half a league
up the River, that they might give them the Alarm when Captain <hi>St. Projet</hi> should pass
by, who no sooner heard the noise of the Mill, but that they immediately gave the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm,
and the Mill immediately after arriv'd at the Port. Every one upon the Alarm ran
to the two ends of the Bridge, and began to let fly great volleys of Harpuebuze shot at the
poor Mill, that said not a word, but gave such a shock that it carried away all the Bridg,
Cables,<note place="margin">The Bridg bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> Chains, and Boats, in such sort, that there was onely one remaining that was
chain'd to the Wall of the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Lodgings. Two of the Boats went down
as far as <hi>St. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>caire,</hi> and I have been told, that there were some carried down as far as
<hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> This brave Mill of the Presidents stopt not here, but went still on to break
another <hi>Hugonot</hi> Mill below <hi>Thoneins,</hi> and at the last stay'd at the Isles about <hi>Marmanda.</hi>
The first who brought us any news of the Bridg being broken, were certain poor people
who had been to buy salt at the end of the said Bridg of the Hugonot Soldiers, who had
taken seven or eight Boats laden with it; and the Enemy had kill'd several of those poor
people, accusing them for the cause that the Bridg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was broken. Some of their Soldiers
who had leapt upon the Bridg upon the Alarm were carried away by the Current; but
it was not till betwixt spring of day, and sun-rise, that the Guards sent me word there
were seven or eight of the people arriv'd, who were wont to carry Salt, and said that
the Bridg was broken. I then presently went out to talk with those people who had been
at the Bridg with those the Enemy had kill'd, and escap't thorough the fields under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the night, who told me the whole story, as also did others who came fromwards
the Port, and still one or other was coming in who confirmed the news. I then sent out
ten or a dozen Light-horse on that side towards <hi>Gascony,</hi> who went as far as under <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gnac,</hi>
where they took two prisoners, who gave me yet a more perfect account than those
poor people had done. In the mean time I presently caused a little Boat with eight Oars
to be made ready, and gave the Master of her 25 Crowns to go carry the news to <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux:</hi>
by whom I writ a Letter to Messieurs <hi>de Lansac,</hi> the Baron <hi>de la Garde,</hi> and the
Bishop of <hi>Valence</hi> my Brother, wherein I gave them a Narrative how all things had passed,
entreating them to communicate it to the Court of Parliament, and the Jurats, that they
might all share in the good news. And good news it was; for this very much brake the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
designs, whom we might shrewdly have incommodated, taking them thus separated
as they were by the breaking of this Bridg, would the Mareschal have been pleased to have
laid his anger aside. The said Mareschal's Trumpet before he went away was witness to
the joy the whole Town was in for this success, and so departed in all diligence to carry
the news to his Master. This was executed upon Wednesday about midnight, and upon
Thursday in the beginning of the night the Mariners set out from <hi>Agen,</hi> who when they
come to <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> near unto the place where the Bridg had been, they let the Boat
glide down at the discretion of the Current, themselves being all squat down in the Boat.
The Enemy began to call out, but no body answered, which made them think it was
some Boat that had accidentally broken loose, and was adrift; but they were no sooner
got past them a Crosbow shot, when they all start up and fell a rowing, and then began
to rate and call them after their eloquent manner, plying their Oars so well, that they
were the next morning, which was Friday, by sun-rise at <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> where the joy was
was such, that I think never Mariners that came from new-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound-lands brought news
that invited so great a Crowd. And yet it seem'd so incredible a thing, that almost all
the Gentlemen doubted the intelligence, and every one ran to Monsieur <hi>de Lansac</hi>'s Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and to those of the Baron <hi>de la Garde,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Valence,</hi> to be satisfied of
the truth, Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> immediately dispatched away his Secretary called <hi>Chauny</hi>
to their Majesties to carry the news, which was quite contrary to what Commissary <hi>Viard</hi>
had brought them. The said <hi>Viard,</hi> as I was told, arriv'd in the morning, and very much
troubled their Majesties, and the Monsieur, at the account of the Bridges being brought
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105656:192"/>
to perfection, with the description of its st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ucture and strength, being such as great Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
might pass over at pleasure, and the Horse three a-breast, as it was true, and the man

               </gap>ittle;<note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Bridg.</note> and his Majesty had good reason to be concern'd, for the
commodity of this Bridg would have given the Enemy leisure to have taken all before
them, and to have passed over their Canon at pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asure. At night <hi>Chauney</hi> arriv'd, who
brought news that the Bridg was broken; so that if the one brought vexation, the other
brought joy, and for a few dayes I was the best man in the world, and a great Soldier:
but that good opinion lasted not long, for the Enemies I had at Court disguised all things
to the King, who was at that time at <hi>St. Iean;</hi> so that in the end, let my deserts be what
they would, I neither did, nor had ever done any thing worth taking notice of, and the
King believ'd it, or I think seem'd to believe so rather, to satisfie their humour. This is
the story of the breaking of the Bridg, and the whole and exact truth of it.</p>
            <p>I am now to tell you of what advantage the breaking of this Bridg was to us,<note place="margin">The Admirals Design.</note> and what
the Admiral had determin'd in case the Bridg had stood. It was resolv'd and concluded
upon in their Council, that they would pass over that part of Winter till harvest in the
Quarters where their Camp then lay, and would cause great Artillery to be brought from
<hi>Navarreins,</hi> wherewith to take all the Towns upon the River <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ronne,</hi> to the very Gates of
<hi>Bordeaux,</hi> that they would attaque <hi>Agen,</hi> but that they would leave that work for the last,
because they would f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st take <hi>Castle-geloux, Bazas,</hi> and all the other places on this side the
<hi>Garonne,</hi> as far as <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> by which means, and by the communication of this Bridg,
both the one Country and the other, which are of the richest of <hi>France,</hi> would be wholly
at their convenience and command. And all this they made account to have taken in less
than fifteen dayes, as they would really have done, for they were absolute Masters of the
field. They intended also to attaque <hi>Libourne,</hi> assuring themselves that in all the Cities
they should find great store of provisions, by which means nothing could be convey'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> neither by the <hi>Garonne,</hi> nor much less from the <hi>Landes,</hi> making account
that so the City of <hi>Bordeaux</hi> would in three moneths be reduc't to the last extremes. And
for my part I do not think it would have held out so long;<note place="margin">The situation of <hi>Bordeaux.</hi>
               </note> for already Corn was there
at ten Livers the Sack, and by sea nothing could get in by reason of <hi>Blaye.</hi> The City is
good, and rich, and a strong Town of War, but situate in a barren Country; so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should deprive it of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and the <hi>Dordogne,</hi> it would presently be reduced to

               </gap>inually living from hand to mouth.</p>
            <p>They had moreover determin'd to bring their Ships up the River to <hi>Blaye,</hi> which they
had in their hands, to keep the Gallies either from coming out, or going in. The Vicomtes
also had promised the Admiral to cause threescore thousand Sacks of Corn to be brought
him upon the River <hi>Garonne,</hi> which they meant to take out of <hi>Comenge</hi> and <hi>Loumaigne,</hi>
the most fertile Countries of all <hi>Guienne;</hi> and where the greatest store of grain is, there
being no less than five hundred Merchants,<note place="margin">A Country rich in Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

four years store alwayes by them in expectation of a dear year, when their Corn may go
off at greater rates; so that they might with great ease have kept their word with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral;
and by that means were certain to bring the King to their own bow, and to make
such conditions as themselves should think fit: and had they once got <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> into
their clutches, I know not but that they might have kept it as well as <hi>Rochelle;</hi> at least
having <hi>Rochelle</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux</hi> both in their possession, they might have boasted that they
had the best and strongest Angle of the Kingdom, both by Land and Sea, commanding

Rivers of <hi>Ile, Dordogne, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Garonne,</hi> the King must have had four Armies at least
to have compell'd them to fight; and I will be bold to say, they had the best Country,
and two of the best and most capacious Havens of the Kingdom, which are those of <hi>Broü<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>

               </note> as to advise the King, that it would be his
best way to coop up the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>Guienne.</hi> 'Tis a dangerous piece to be depriv'd of,
and should the King once lose it, it would be a great while in recovering. But these good
Counsellors do it for their own ends, and to remove the War far enough from their own
doors; and yet we shall sell it them very dear before they have it. In truth the King
ought to make more reckoning of this Province, to hinder the Enemy from getting foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, and not so to abandon the Country, suffering others to make merry at our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
to that degree, as to ask, <hi>if we yet have beds to lie in.</hi> I cannot believe this word could
come out of the Queens mouth, for she has ever had, and yet has a great many very good
Servants there; and those Messieurs of <hi>France,</hi> that jeer at our misfortunes, may have their
share in time. <hi>The evil is not alwayes at one door.</hi> Now this was the result of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Council; and it was very well design'd. My Brother Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> will bear
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:105656:193"/>
witness, that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> person who was assisting at their Councils (when he thought fit)
gave us an account of the aforesaid deliberation, which was great; and I believe that had
they taken a resolution to drive out all the Catholicks, and to have call'd in all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots
out of <hi>France</hi> into this Province, which was so much despis'd when they had once
made it their own, they would have had possessions enow to have enricht them all; and
moreover all the Gentry of those parts would have been constrain'd to turn Hugonots, and
to take up arms for them; by which means the King would afterwards have had much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
to reduce, and more to reclaim them: for to have made them turn again to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thing, be it good, or bad, he is very unwilling to leave it: but God would not suffer so
great a mischief, both for the King and us, who are his Catholick Subjects.</p>
            <p>This was the advantage that accru'd by the breaking of the Bridg,<note place="margin">The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bridg.</note> in the judgment of
all both Friends and Enemies: and I will be bold to say, that of all the services I ever
did for <hi>Guienne</hi> this was the most remarkable exploit, which proceeded from no other
thing, but my resolution to go put my self into <hi>Agen;</hi> for otherwise the Town had been
quitted, and the Admiral had come directly thither, and not to <hi>Port St. Marie;</hi> nor to
<hi>Aguillon</hi> as he was constrain'd to do. For a consultation being held at <hi>Lauserte,</hi> it was
there concluded, that at their departure from thence, they should go to quarter at <hi>Castel-Sagrat,
Montjoy, St. Maurin,</hi> and <hi>Ferussac,</hi> and the next day at <hi>Agen,</hi> making full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they should meet with no resistance. Which had it so fall'n out, the Admiral
would have had elbow-room enough; and betwixt two great Rivers, not only have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht
his Army at great ease, and in great security; but moreover have made the whole
Country sure to him. I know very well that it was told the Admiral by two or three
persons in his Army, that in case it was true that I was in <hi>Agen,</hi> they could never get me
out but by bits, and that in my life I had committed greater follies than that. And there
were who said that they had seen me engage my self in three or four places, the strongest
of which was not half so tenable as <hi>Agen,</hi> and had still come off with honour. These who
said this,<note place="margin">The Admiral'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> opinion.</note> might well affirm it with truth, as having been with me in those places. But
the Admiral still maintain'd, that he was confident I had not put my self into <hi>Agen</hi> with
any intention to stay there, but that my determination was, so soon as I should hear of his
coming to pass the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and go put my self into <hi>Lectoure,</hi> saying, <hi>he is too old a beaten
Soldier to engage himself in so ill a place.</hi> The others still affirm'd that they would pawn
their lives I would not budg from thence; which made the Admiral in the end to adhere
to their opinion, and to alter his course directly to <hi>Aguillon,</hi> extending his Quarters as far
as <hi>Port. St. Marie,</hi> where if they should see, that upon their approach I abandoned the
Town, and retreated towards <hi>Lectoure,</hi> as they believ'd I would, then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to <hi>Agen.</hi> He found in the end that they who maintain'd I would not stir from
thence were better acquainted with my temper, than either he or they, who told him I
would retire to <hi>Lectoure;</hi> and being it was cast in my dish, that for three years I had done
nothing to purpose, let every one judg by what I perform'd in these three years, without
money, or either Horse or Foot; had I been supply'd with money onely to pay the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
or had the King reliev'd me with the Foot, and Gens-d'armes I desir'd, whether or
no I had not done my work. I think I should have kept the Admiral from watering
his horses at the <hi>Garonne,,</hi> and his Reiters from drinking our <hi>Bordeaux</hi> wine: for the
Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> would never have had leisure to have call'd them in; and I think
I should have dealt pretty well with him.</p>
            <p>The Bridg being broken the Admiral was four or five dayes in suspence, not knowing
which way to turn him, nor what course to take: for besides the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi>'s
Camp, he had moreover the Cornets of Reiters engag'd on that side the River towards
<hi>Gascony,</hi> which were those that had passed the River, and were quartered at <hi>Labardac,</hi> and
which he could not imagine which way to draw off from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

man either on foot or horseback durst attempt to pass it; and the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi>
was yet at <hi>Condom,</hi> and about <hi>Nerac,</hi> and <hi>Bruch.</hi> The Admiral then caused a little Bridg
upon two Boats to be made, upon which five or six horses could only pass at one time, the
Boats being to be hal'd by a rope after the Italian manner. So soon therefore as the water
of the Rivolet began to abate, the Reiters began to pass over a stone Bridg there is in that
place, and drew near to the passage of the Port, where they began to ferry over upon this
Bridg of Boats by six and six, or seven and seven at a time at most. Which they found so
troublesome, that with all the diligence the Passengers could use, the Boat was alwaies an
hour and an half in going to and again, with which great pains and difficulty these three
Cornets passed, and were two dayes in passing over. The Count <hi>de Candalle,</hi> and Monsieur

               <hi>de la Valette</hi> lay at this t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me with eight or ten Cornets of Horse at <hi>Staffort,</hi> to the first of
which, so soon as the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> began to move from <hi>Condom,</hi> to draw
near the River, I writ a Letter, <hi>That if his resolution was to fight</hi> Montgommery <hi>at the Pass,
I, with my two Companies of Gens-d'armes, and five hundred Harquebuzeers, would not fail
to be at the fight, not to command, but to obey him as much as the meanest Soldier there.</hi> He
return'd me many thanks, sending me answer back, <hi>That if it came to that, both he, and
all under his Command would obey me:</hi> but nevertheless said nothing of my coming to joyn
with them: I understood well enough however by the Letter, that they would have been
all glad to have had me with them: but <hi>la Croisette</hi> who was there, play'd the <hi>Dominus
fac totum,</hi> and govern'd all. I therefore sent again to tell them, <hi>That in case they had
no mind to have me come in person, I would however, if they pleased, send over the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
and the five hundred Harquebuzeeers to joyn with them.</hi> By which any one must
discern, that I had not left the Mareschal because I would not obey him, since I offer'd
to obey the Count, and Monsieur <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and even Captain <hi>Croisette</hi> himself, who
was in the greatest authority amongst them.</p>
            <p>I shall not here take upon me to give an account of what they did upon this occasion, by
reason I was not there, neither have I much enquir'd into it, saving that I was told they
charg'd some they met with at their marching out of <hi>Bruch,</hi> and beat them in again, and
I have since heard that the Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> was himself then in the Town. How
true it was I am not able to say, but I believe they did all that lay in their power to do;
for they are sufficiently known, and reputed all for very brave Gentlemen. The Count
<hi>de Montgommery</hi> passed over first his Horse, and then his Foot, one after the other. I sent
threescore Light-horse pickt out of my own Company, and that of Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi>
over the River, with three hundred Harquebuzeers, to make good their retreat, who
marcht up to a little Village near unto the Ferry call'd <hi>la Rozie,</hi> where they kill'd fifteen or
sixteen men, and took twelve or thirteen Horses, giving them so hot an Alarm, that I was
since told, had our Horse pusht on to the Pass it self, they had caused three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to be drown'd, for five or six drown'd themselves upon this Alarm for haste. And
on the Admiral's side he could no way relieve them, for they could not repass above six or
seven horse at a time upon the Bridg of Boats, which made them five or six dayes in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
over. This was the plunge and quandary the Admiral was in, to draw off the Count
<hi>de Montgommery,</hi> and three Cornets of Reiters,</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de la Chappelle,</hi> Vice-Seneschal, and Monsieur <hi>de Bouzet</hi> had sent me word,
that if I would grant a Pass to a certain Hugonot, to whom at their entreaty I had given
assurance to live quietly in his own house, he offer'd to go to <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> and enquire
out, and discover what way the Admiral intended to take, after the Count <hi>de Montgom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>
should be passed over the River, or whether or no he had any thoughts of making
another Bridg; which Pass I accordingly sent, and the same day that the Count made an
end of ferrying over, this man return'd back to their house, telling and assuring them,
that at the Enemies departure from <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi> which would be within two or three
dayes after the Army should be got over the River, they would march towards <hi>Tholouze,</hi>
and go to pass at <hi>Montauban,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Admiral's design against the <hi>Tholouzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

in all that Country, the Captain reply'd, <hi>That if the Master of that House had no other
he would be houseless.</hi> The said Sieur <hi>de Bouzet</hi> himself told me all that this person had
said to them; of which I immediately advertiz'd the premier President, for to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the Mareschal with it had been to no purpose, and I was very certain he would
have given no credit to any information of mine, which made me rather choose to advertise
the President, sending him word that he ought to call in Monsieur <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who
was already return'd towards <hi>Tholouze,</hi> and Messieurs <hi>de Negrepelice</hi> and <hi>de Sarlabous;</hi>
and that they could not have too many good men in the City; for the Enemy talkt strange
things, which nevertheless I would not repeat, by reason it was but the discourse of the

            <p>These were the contents of my Letter, I am confident the President has not lost it,
and thus all the Enemies Forces departed from <hi>Port St. Marie,</hi>

them all march by within less than a Harquebuze-shot of me, I having no more than eight
or ten Horse in my Party, for I had left the Caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them so covertly, but that the Enemy saw them very plain; yet not so much as a man came
out to discover what we were, but held on their march, and went to quarter that night about
<hi>Pont de Casse,</hi> and drawing towards <hi>St. Maurin,</hi> quarter'd themselves about the said <hi>St.
Maurin,</hi> and the adjacent Villages, where they stay'd two or three dayes. Now being the
said Sieur <hi>de Durfort</hi> had seen all their Army, both Horse and Foot pass by, and had had
leisure at his ease to number them upon their march, I entreated him to take Post, and to
go acquaint his Majesty with the number of their Camp, who amongst other things told me
he had discover'd a Troop of five or six hundred Horse, who passed by at a little further
distance than the rest; the most of which had no Boots, and could therefore be no other
than Grooms and Footmen they had mounted only to make a shew. I did nothing that
I did not first communicate to the Bishop of <hi>Agen,</hi> in whom I did at that time confide as
much, or more, than in my own Brother, esteeming him for one of the best friends, and
a man of as much integrity and virtue, as any Prelate in <hi>France.</hi> He is descended from
the House of <hi>
                  <unclear>Fregosa</unclear>
               </hi> of <hi>Genoa.</hi> I gave instructions to the said Sieur <hi>de Durfort,</hi> and a
Letter of Credence,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> sends the King intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</note> which consisted of these heads, <hi>That I had sent to his Majesty the
Sieur</hi> de Durfort, <hi>who had had the conveniency exactly to number the Army of the Princes,
to deliver a perfect account of all that he had numbred and seen.</hi> After which I acquainted his
Majesty with the course they steer'd, and the resolution they went withal, to burn all
before them; of which I had also given notice to the priemier President of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> to
acquaint therewith all those who had Houses near unto the City, that they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their goods, and that they would do well to call in Monsieur <hi>de Negrepelice,</hi> if he
was not already there, together with Messieurs <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> and <hi>de la Sarlabous.</hi> In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
clause of my Letter to the King I sent word, that the person (I do not here name)
of the Religion, who had been in the Enemies Camp, had brought news to the Sieurs <hi>de
la Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppelle</hi> and <hi>de Bouzet,</hi> that the Captain of Horse with whom he had conferr'd, had
told him that they had designs upon <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and <hi>Pont St. Esprit,</hi> which were sure to
take effect, telling his Majesty that I was very well acquainted with the Governor of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelier,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Castetnau,</hi> for whom I would be responsible with my life, but that I
knew not him of <hi>Pont St. Esprit:</hi> but that if his Majesty would please to give a caution
to the said Governors to have an eye to those places, it would be a means to awake their
diligence, and to make them provide better for their safety and defence. I likewise gave
his Majesty to understand, that the Bishop of <hi>Agen,</hi> who was lately come from an Abbey
of his in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> near unto <hi>Narbonne,</hi> had told me that all the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> from
<hi>Montpelier</hi> to <hi>Avignon,</hi> were in very great anxiety, having no one in those parts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them; and had sent to the Mareschal to entreat him to send them Monsieur <hi>de
Ioyeuse;</hi> for provided they had a Chief to head them, they should be enow to defend
the Country; and that therefore, if his Majesty thought fit, he might do well to send to
the Mareschal, to let Monsieur <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> go into the lower <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he having enow
other great Captains about him; for as much as the said Sieur <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> would be there
better accepted than any other, as the said Bishop had assur'd me. I moreover acquainted
his Majesty in my said Letter, that if he would please to command the Monsieur to march
with the one half of his Army only, we should be able to fight with greater Forces than
those of the Princes; and let his Majesty look upon me as the basest fellow that ever bore
arms, in case the Monsieur would come but with the one half of his Army, provided he
brought his Reiters along with him, if he did not defeat the Princes, and put an end to the
War: that in case his Majesty should not think fit the Monsieur should come, let him
then command the Prince <hi>Dolphin</hi> to march with the Army towards the Country of <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergue,</hi>
with whom I would joyn, and we would find means that the Mareschal <hi>d'Anville</hi>
should also joyn with us, and that then about <hi>Tholouze,</hi> or which way soever they should
move, we would find an opportunity to fight them at our best advantage.</p>
            <p>These were all the heads of my instructions; and to say the truth not a man of them
had ever return'd into <hi>France,</hi> unless they had hid their heads in their strong holds, and
we had preserv'd the Country. Had they once been broken, or separated, they would
have had much ado ever to have rally'd and piec'd again. This good Bishop of <hi>Agen</hi> had
told me, that he gave <hi>Narbonne</hi> for lost, and that Monsieur <hi>de Rieux</hi> the Governor was
a Hugonot, that he had driven one of the principal Catholicks, to whom all the rest of the
Catholicks ever address'd themselves out of the City; at which the Inhabitants were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in despair, insomuch that the Catholick Citizens had writ to the Mareschal, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
him to write to Monsieur <hi>de Rieux</hi> to permit him to return into the Town; which
said Sieur <hi>de Rieux</hi> had sent back many excuses, and that he could not do it; whereupon
seeing the Mareschal cold in their behalf, and that he did not enough interest himself in
their concern, to cause the Gentleman to be readmitted, the Catholicks had apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:105656:194"/>
to the Parliament, that the Parliament had thereupon remonstrated the Citizens
grievance to the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>schal, who again at their instance had writ to the said Sieur <hi>de Rieux;</hi>
but still to no effect, which had made the people to give themselves absolutely for lost. I
told all this to the Sieur <hi>de Durfort;</hi> not that I had included it in my instructions, and
much less that I gave him in Commission to tell it to the King, because perhaps it might
not be true, but telling him, that to be more certain, he would do well to ask the Bishop
of it, and if he would give him leave from him to tell it to the King. He therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
enquir'd of the Bishop touching that affair, who thereupon told him the whole story
after the very same manner he had related it to me, and moreover told him, that he would
himself write to the King, which he accordingly did; but the said Sieur <hi>de Durfort</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to receive the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etter till first he had seen the Contents, which he therefore shew'd
him, and then the said Sieur took it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elling me that he had seen what the Bishop had
writ to the King, which was word for word as he had related it to me before. This
was all that was compriz'd in my instructions; for as to any letter of Credence, the said
<hi>Durfort</hi> carry'd no other from me but onely what was contain'd in those instructions, he
telling me freely and plainly, that he would never carry other Letter of Credit, but only
Instructions sign'd and seal'd.<note place="margin">Monsieur de <hi>Durfort</hi> sent to the King.</note> And upon this foundation it was, that the Mareschal
<hi>d' Anville</hi> writ that defamatory Letter against me, and had I not been withheld by the
respect to those to whom he appertains, and the Rank he held in the Kingdom, I should
have tried to have taught him how he gave the Lye, without being first well enform'd
of the truth. I might justly have given it him, forasmuch as the testimony of the King
himself, and the Instructions themselves, would have manifested the truth: but it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that the King and the Queen knew the contrary to what he had coucht in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that my conscience is absolutely clear. We shall see hereafter whether he or I
shall do our Master the best service. He is indeed two advantages over me, he is a great
Lord and young, and I am poor and old; I am nevertheless a Gentleman, and a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
who have never yet suffer'd an injury, nor ever will do whilst I wear a sword. I
am willing to believe, that the forenamed Bishop at that time knew nothing of the design
complotted against me; but his wicked Brother came and stayd with him four or five
days, and during that time wrought upon him to consent to this virtuous Conspiracy: of
which I shall say no more, for God has begun to shew his miraculous arm in my revenge,
and I have that cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lence in him, that I hope he will not stay it there.</p>
            <p>Now the Princes went the same way that I had advertiz'd the President they intended
to march, and executed the resolution of burning all the way they wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. I could wish
from my heart that my intelligence had not proov'd true; for I have been assur'd by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of very good credit of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> that the Army of the Princes endammag'd them above
a million of Livers. I shall not here undertake to give an account of what they did in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> for I do not pretend to meddle with other mens actions; neither how well
the Mareschal perform'd his duty; but shall return to a Letter sent me by the King, that I
must go forthwith into <hi>Bearn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty sent me a command, that I should gather together all the Forces I was able
to make, and that with all possible expedition; which being done, that I must take Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
from <hi>Tholouze, Bayonne,</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> and elsewhere where it was to be had, and
go to invade the Country of <hi>Bearn.</hi> He writ also to the Capitouls of <hi>Tholouze,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me with Artillery and Ammunition; but not a syllable of any money, either to pay
the Soldier, or to defray the Equipage of the Canon; and God knows whether in such
Enterprizes any thing ought to be wanting. An Army resembles a Clock, if the least
wheel or spring be wanting, all the rest goes very false, or stands still. I therefore sent <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palanques
a Bearnois</hi> to Court, with ample instructions of all that was wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, and that
would be necessary for me to have before I could begin to march. I was constrain'd to
do this, by reason that the Letters his Majesty had sent me about this Expedition were so
cold, that it seem'd he that contriv'd them, must either have no great mind to have me
go thither, or at least if I went, should be able to do nothing to purpose, or that he was
an absolute <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> However I took no notice of any thing at all to his Majesty, but
onely desir'd him to write an Express, and a pressing Letter, and Command to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touls
to lend me two pieces of Canon, and one great Culverine, with requisite Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
for which I would be responsible to them; for the Artillery and Ammunition are
properly their own. They had already sent me word, that they had no Artillery ready,
and much less Ammunition, by reason that Monsieur <hi>de Bellegarde</hi> had spent most of their
stock at <hi>Carla,</hi> and at <hi>Puylaurens,</hi> and that the Mareschal <hi>d'Anville</hi> had the rest at <hi>Maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
I writ also to his Majesty, that he would please to command Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> to
cause a little money to be deliver'd to me for one Muster, or at least for half a one for the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:105656:195"/>
Foot to buy powder, for that of two years this War had lasted, all the Foot that I had
rais'd in those parts had had but two Musters payd them, and the most of them but one;
and also that he would send to Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> to send a Treasurer along with me to
defray the Artillery, and whilst I waited in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>expectation of <hi>Espalanques</hi> return, I would
take so good and speedy order for the rest, that at his coming back he should find me ready
to march.</p>
            <p>These were all the demands I made to the King. His answer was, that he did very much
wonder I should so long deferre this Expedition, that he had thought I had been already
in the Country;<note place="margin">The King di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with Monsieur de <hi>Montluc.</hi>
               </note> that if I would proceed no otherwise than hitherto I had done in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
he would appoint some other to undertake it, and that for three years past I had
done nothing to purpose. These Letters were ready to break my heart, and withal put
me into such a passion, that I was once resolv'd not to go, but to write to the King to
send some other, that had formerly serv'd him better than I, and that might do his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
as Monsieur <hi>de Terride</hi> had done. Nevertheless I at last thought better on't, and
determin'd not to do it, knowing very well that these Letters proceeded not from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
nature, neither from the Queens, nor the Monsieurs, for they had all three writ to
me in the same stile: I knew very well that this came from the counsel of my Enemies at
Court, and that neither the King, the Queen, nor the Monsieur ever writ so tart Letters
as those were, to the greatest Enemies they had. I shewed them to none but Monsieur
<hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother, for fear lest by my Exemple every one should be frighted from
their duty; for all of them generally, of what condition soever, very well knew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of what was laid to my charge, and that I had done very well with the little money
I had left me. And then it was that I evidently perceiv'd they intended to lay all the
miscarriages that had happen'd in those parts at my door; having no friends at Court to
take my part, or defend me.</p>
            <p>I now see that the greatest Error I committed in my whole life, was that I would have
no dependance upon any other, after the decease of my old Master, but the King and
the Queen; and find that a man in command is much more secure in depending upon a
Monsieur, a Madam, a Cardinal, or a Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi> than either upon the King,
the Queen, or the Monsieur; for they will evermore disguise affairs to their Majesties, as
they themselves are enclin'd or think fit, and shall certainly be believ'd by them all;
for they only hear and see with others ears and eyes. 'Tis an ill thing, but it is impossible
to help it, and he that has done best shall by this means be left behind: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
if I could return to my former Age, I would never care to depend upon the King or
the Queen, but upon those who are in greatest favour with them: for though I should
behave my self as ill as a man could do, they would cover and conceal my faults, seeing
that I onely depended upon them, for 'tis their chiefest good, and principal honour, to
have servants about them whom they may call their Creatures. If the King would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
only distribute his benefits, he would pair their nails: but whoever has a mind to
be taken notice of, and rewarded, let him address himself to Monsieur or Madam, for
the King gives them all, and knows not others but by their report. I am sorry I cannot
return to my vigorous age, for I should better know how to govern my self than I have
hitherto done, and should no more so much build my hopes upon the King, as others
that are about him. But I am now grown old, and cannot be young again, and must
therefore be content to follow my old humour; for should I now go about to take up
another, I should be to seek at which end to begin. 'Tis too late for me to mend, it may
serve others though, that I leave behind me; but if the King would be truly a King, and
confer no benefits but at the recommendation of his own judgment, oh, how many would
be dor'd in their designs, and frustrated in their expectation!</p>
            <p>I also committed another oversight, in not having one of my Sons alwayes about the
King; they were well enough born to be receiv'd, and well enough qualified to win their
Majesties esteem. But God took from me my <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> too soon, and since Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

me to be idle, but to learn my trade; for the first follow'd arms, wherein he bravely
signaliz'd himself, and follow'd me in all my Voyages and Expeditions; the second had
acquir'd so great a reputation in <hi>Guienne,</hi> that it was not my interest to part with him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the War; the third, since his return from <hi>Malta,</hi> has follow'd me in these late
Wars, and the youngest also. But I shall leave this discourse, which puts me into pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to return to the Expedition of <hi>Bearn.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> then went to <hi>Bordeaux,</hi>

the Receiver had been fain to borrow this. Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> went also to <hi>Tholouze</hi>
with my Letter of Atto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in case the King should refuse to do it; and upon these terms they lent me a Canon, a
Culverine, and some Ammunition. I then dispatcht away Messieurs <hi>de Montespan,</hi> and
<hi>de Madaillan</hi> with a hundred Horse cull'd out of my own Company of Gens-d'armes,
and that of Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> directly to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> to Convoy the Artillery that the
Vicount <hi>d'Orthe</hi> was to send me from thence; and sent Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin</hi> to <hi>Noguarol</hi> to
begin to form the Army, and with him Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens,</hi> to whom I had given the
Command of Mareschal de Camp: and I my self stayd four or five dayes behind to set
forwards the Foot and Horse, and to give time to the Commissaries of provisions to go
thorough the Provinces to execute the Orders I had given them, for the advance of victual
for the Army, to which end I delay'd the time but six dayes only, after which I went in
two dayes to <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So soon as I came thither we immediately fell to Counsel to deliberate with what places
we should first begin.<note place="margin">A Consultation touching the War of Bearn.</note> In which Consultation some were of advice, that it would be best
to begin with <hi>St. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver,</hi> others said it would be the best course to march directly to <hi>Pau:</hi>
but I was of opinion that I ought in the first place to fall upon <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> and for these
reasons. First, because that beginning with that, I should leave the best Country of
<hi>Gascony</hi> open and free behind me, from thence to be supply'd with victual for the Army;
and secondly, that <hi>Rabasteins</hi> being the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ongest Castle, the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> had in
her possession, if I should take it by force (which I foresaw I must do, as being confident
they would not easily surrender) I would put all to the sword; assuring my self, that that
proceeding would strike so great a terror into all the Inhabitants of <hi>Bearn,</hi> that no place
afterwards would dare to abide a Siege, <hi>Navarreins</hi> only excepted. And on the other side,
that those of <hi>Tholouze</hi> hearing of this good beginning, would not spare to furnish me
with any thing I should stand in need of, when they should see that things succeeded
well with me; whereas on the contrary, should I begin with <hi>St. Sever,</hi> I should engage
my self in the <hi>Lands,</hi> a Country only fruitful in sands, where my men would perish for
want of bread, and could have no relief from <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> though I should take the place.
That therefore it was much better to begin with the strongest first, and there suddenly to
employ my Forces, than with the weakest, and daily to consume my men, and waste
my time to little or no effect. This was what I propos'd, which in the end took place in
the Council, and was approv'd by all. But I told them, that above all things, to strike
a terror into the Enemy, we must kill all before us which made any opposition, which
would make the Capitouls of <hi>Tholouze</hi> to furnish and supply us with all things necessary,
seeing that it was <hi>Good hand, good hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Council was held immediately upon my coming thither, and the next morning
before day I took 25 or 30 Horse, and went in all diligence to <hi>Dacqs.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de
Gondrin</hi> had shew'd me a Letter, that his Son Monsieur <hi>de Montespan</hi> had sent him from
<hi>Bayonne,</hi> wherein he sent him word, that the Artillery was not so ready as we believ'd,
but that the Vicoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>d'Orthe</hi> was exceedingly diligent to equip, and make them fit;
wherefore so soon as I came to <hi>Dacqs</hi> I dispatcht away two Gentlemen to Monsieur <hi>de
Montespan,</hi> one in the heels of another, to quicken his haste; and writ to the Vicount to
entreat him to advance a day or two before, and to try if he could bring Messieurs <hi>de Luxe</hi>
and <hi>de Damezan</hi> along with him, that we might consult together of what we were best
to do: which he accordingly did, bringing the said Sieur de <hi>Damazan</hi> only in company
with him, it being impossible for Monsieur <hi>de Luxe</hi> to return so soon to <hi>Dacqs;</hi> where I
layd before the said Sieur <hi>de Damezan</hi> what had been debated amongst us in the Council
at <hi>Noguarol,</hi> and my opinion, which was there also allowed by all to be the best, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by Monsieur <hi>de Damezan;</hi> who told me, that should we march directly to <hi>St.
Sever,</hi> it would be impossible to get one Basque out of the Province, by reason they would
be necessitated to pass the waters in the Enemies Countrey: but if I went to begin there
where I intended, I should no sooner be arriv'd at <hi>Nay,</hi> but all the Country of the

glad to find him of my opinion, but I was constrain'd to stay three dayes at <hi>Dacqs</hi> before
the Artillery came up to me. At my departure thence I left two pieces of Canon with the
Vicount <hi>d'Orthe,</hi> with Ammunition proportionable, with which he was to march directly

that at the same time I should begin to march, I should send two Companies of Gens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'arms

            <p>Monsieur de <hi>Montamat,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi>'s Lieutenant in that Country, was put

very well by my motion, that I had no thoughts of going that way: but expected I should

in two dayes and two nights, with four pieces of Canon, a great Culverine, and two
Bastards I arriv'd at <hi>Noguarol;</hi> where Messieurs <hi>de Gondrin</hi> and <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> joyning with
me, we marcht directly to <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> and in three dayes with the greatest part of our
Horse and Foot came before the Town. It continually rain'd, insomuch that all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were full, which was the reason that the Artillery could not come before <hi>Rabasteins</hi>
so soon as the Army; but immediately upon my arrival I took Commissary <hi>Fredeville</hi>

manner of the Siege, some of them saying that we must first take the Town, and from

I ought to attaque the Castle from without, and <hi>Fredeville</hi> himself was of that opinion:
but I would see it my self; for in such matters I would never trust to any one, and a good

confess, that we were first to attaque the Town, and from within, the Castle;
after which we return'd one after another running, for it was hot standing still, and went
to conclude with Messieurs <hi>de Gondrin, de Basillac, de Savigna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, de Sainctorens, de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>span,
de Maidaillan,</hi> and Captain <hi>Paucillac</hi> Colonel of the Infantry, to attaque the Town.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the day I employ'd in causing Gabions and Bavins to be made, and
by break of day the next morning had the Artillery planted in Battery before the Town,
which in a very few volleys made a Breach. The Enemy had no intention to keep the
Town, for they had filled all the houses with straw and faggots, which so soon as they
saw our people coming on to the Assault, they gave fire to in an instant, and ran away
men, women, and children to put themselves into the Castle. Our men did what they
could to save the Town from being burnt, but they shot so furiously from the Castle, that
it was impossible to hinder the greatest part of it from being consum'd to ashes. The night
following I brought the Artillery into the Town, and began to batter some Lodgings on
the left hand, at the end of which was a Turret that cover'd the Draw-bridg and the Gate
of the Castle; and by Evening the said Buildings were opened, and the Turret beaten
down to the Ground. In the morning by break of day we began to batter the great Tower
where the Clock was, which whilst we were doing our Soldiers gain'd the Gate of the
Town, which was within ten paces or less of that of the Castle, and that lookt a little into
their false-Brayes: but there was a great Terrass a Pike height, and as much in thickness,
made of Bavins after the manner of a Rampire that cover'd their Draw-bridg, so that our
people could not do them so muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> harm as they did us; to remedy which inconvenience
we made a Blind of some barrels and planks in that place, which something secur'd our
men that lay before the said Portal. All day long our Artillery batter'd the face of the
Tower, and in the end the said Tower was opened, after which I made them shoot from
the other Battery, which play'd into the Castle, till the next day, which was the third,
at noon, but could see no issue of the business. At this time Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> and
Captain <hi>Moret</hi> came with the piece of Canon, and the great Culverine from <hi>Tholouze;</hi>
but they did us no service at all, for the Culverine burst in an hundred pieces, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
was crackt.</p>
            <p>I then caused two pieces of Canon to be remov'd to the left hand close by the Wall of
the Town that pointed upon the other Face of the Castle upon the left; wherein my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
was, if I could, to make the Tower fall on our side, which if I could effect, it
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:105656:196"/>
would choak up the Ditch that was full of water, and fill the false-Brayes on that side,
by which means we might go on to the Assault over the ruine, which I made account
would infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bly fill the Graffe, for the Tower was very high. All the fourth day I bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the face of this Tower with these two pieces of Canon, and in the end beat it down,
so that nothing remain'd standing, but the right side, and the corners. I then caused
them to shoot at the first Corner which lookt towards the Artillery I had first planted on
the left hand, and with two pieces that I was all night removing, at the other Corner that
look't towards the Town. In ten or twelve shots the Coins was broken, and the Tower
fall'n on our side, exact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y in the place where I would have it: but how high, or how
thick soever the Tower was, it did not so wholly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill the Graffe, but that we were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
a great way into it. It is true, that the ruines had drunk up the water, and fill'd a
good part of the Ditch, but not so that we were not yet to go very low. The fifth day
at night the Sieur <hi>de Basillac,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de St. Lary,</hi> brought me fifty or threescore
Pioneers, for all mine were stoln away, and fled; and they had raised these amongst their
own Tenants, upon their own Estates which lay hard by. I gave these fellows to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Leberon,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> his Brother-in-law, with thirty or fourty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that the Captains <hi>l' Artigue</hi> and <hi>Solles</hi> made to take upon them the office of Pioneers,
their Captains themselves assisting them at the work. The service they were employ'd about
was to take away the Terrass, that the Artillery might look into the Draw-bridg, and batter
the side of it, and that the Ball might pass all along by the Flank, and into the Courtine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Breach within. The Enemy had also made a Barricado in the Chambers above, so
that a man could not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssibly see any thing on one of the two sides. I gave the charge of
removing the two pieces of Canon to the place where Monsieur <hi>de Leberon</hi> drew away the
Terrass to the Vicount <hi>d'llza,</hi> and my self went to take a little repose, for this was the fifth
night that I had not had a whole hour of sleep. By break of day I heard the two Canons
play, but could not believe it possible that in that one night all the Terrass could be remov'd,
at least all that was in our way. Our Artillery began to play its feats all along this Flank,
and it cost us a great many shot to break this Barricado, which did us infinite mischief, for
they shot desperately into our Canon. I then made the Vicount <hi>d'Vza,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Lebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> to go to rest, and left Monsieur <hi>de Basillac</hi> to assist the Artillery.
After this we caused a hole to be made in the Wall of the Town close by our Artillery, that
we might come to it in security from without, for from within it was impossible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being kill'd or wounded. The fourth day of our Siege I had given to Captain <hi>Bahus</hi>
the charge of causing Gabions to be made, who had accordingly taken great pains, and
been very diligent in the execution of his Command; but he had caused them to be made
so little, that the wind of the Canon had presently shaked them all to pieces, an error that
a man must take care to avoid.</p>
            <p>Our Cavalry all this while was quarter'd in Villages a league and a half from the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer,
where there was accommodation of Hay and Oats for the Horses, with instruction
and command to be every night all night long in the field, to prevent any relief from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in: for the very day that we came to <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> we had taken a great Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
sent by Monsieur <hi>de Montamat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Monsieur de <hi>Montamat</hi>'s Letters taken.</note> to the Vicount <hi>de Caumont,</hi> Monsieur <hi>d' Audax,</hi> and

Company of Gens-d'arms from the higher <hi>Comenge,</hi> to come and joyn with us, that in
so doing, he should make a halt thereabouts where the relief was of necessity to pass, and
that night and day he should keep his Horse upon the Avenues, to give us continual adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement

               </note>
Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin</hi> with twenty Light-horse, and four Ensigns of Foot, was to stay
with the Artillery, and I with the rest of the Camp, when the news of their approach was
brought to us, was to march day and night to go and fight them. This was the Order
we had concluded on, had any Forces come to relieve them, making account that in case
we defeated their Succours, the whole Country of <hi>Bearn</hi> was our own. Which I have
here set down, and enform'd my reader withal, that others may take exemple by it,
when they shall be engaged upon the like occasion; the young Captains I mean, for the
old Soldiers know well enough they are to proceed after this manner. My deliberation
moreover was, the Castle being taken, to dispatch away a Gentleman who should post it
day and night to the King, to carry his Majesty news of the success, to the end that he
might send some Gentleman to the Mareschal <hi>d' Anville,</hi> who was about <hi>Montpelier,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the trace of the Enemy, (where I have not heard of any great harm he did) to
bid him write to those of <hi>Tholouze</hi> to send me eight pieces of Canon, of twelve of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
that were yet at the said <hi>Tholouze,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Design for the Conquest of <hi>Bearn.</hi>
               </note> and order him to direct his Letters to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Capitouls, to move them forthwith to defray the charge of conveying the
said pieces of Canon to me. Which whilst it was in doing we would go attaque another
Castle within two little Leagues of <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> which vvas not very strong, and from thence
would go to pass the <hi>Gave</hi> at a Foard above <hi>Nay,</hi> very well known to the <hi>Bearnois</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in our Camp, and take <hi>Nay,</hi> there to establish our Magazine of victual, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Messieurs <hi>de Luxe,</hi> and <hi>de Damazan,</hi> the Vicount <hi>de Chaux,</hi> and <hi>d' Almabarix,</hi> with
the <hi>Basques</hi> they were to bring in to us, and so to march before <hi>Pau,</hi> where the Vicount
<hi>d'Orthe</hi> was to come with the two pieces of Canon, and the Culverine had been left in his
hands at <hi>Dacqs;</hi> being confident that all the Country, some for good will, and the rest
for fear of their lives and estates, would immediately surrender to us. That having taken
<hi>Pau,</hi> and the eight piec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Canon being come to us from <hi>Tholouze,</hi> we would then march
before <hi>Navarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins,</hi> and whoever would have put me to my Oath, whether I should have
taken it or no, I should rather have sworn I should than I should not, for we had with us
Gentlemen of <hi>Bearn</hi> and <hi>Bigorre,</hi> and principally Monsieur <hi>de Basillac,</hi> who had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Siege of <hi>Navarreins</hi> for Monsieur <hi>de Terride,</hi> who both then said, and have since
affirm'd, that had we assaulted <hi>Navarreins</hi> as briskly as we did <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> we should have
carried that with less difficulty than the other; every one that knew them both concluding
that <hi>Rabasteins</hi> was by much the stronger place.</p>
            <p>But as men design, and God disposeth as seemeth best to him the Events of things, he
was pleased to order it very much contrary to what we proposed to our selves: for the
fifth day of the Siege,<note place="margin">1562.</note> the 23, of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the year 1562. upon a Sunday about two of the
clock in the afternoon, I resolved to give an assault, the Order whereof was after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
following.<note place="margin">Order for the Assault.</note> That Monsieur <hi>de Sanctorens</hi> Mareschal de Camp should lead the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
one after the other up to the Breach, which that he might the better do without
confusion, I order'd all the Companies to be drawn by four and four together out of the
Town, which upon pain of death were not to stir from their places till Monsieur <hi>de Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorens</hi>
should come to fetch them, who was to stay three quarters of an hour betwixt every
leading up, and in that manner to conduct all the Companies one after another; and it
was also order'd, that the two Captains who were upon the Guard by the Breach, which
were <hi>l' Artigues,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Canon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.</note> and <hi>Salles</hi> of <hi>Bearn</hi> should go on first to the Assault. As I was setting
down this Order one came in haste to tell me, that the two Canons that batter'd the Flanck,
and that had been remov'd in the night, were forsaken, and not a man durst shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the Battery, by reason the Artillery it self had ruin'd all the Gabions. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
left it to Messieurs <hi>de Gondrin</hi> and <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> to conclude the Order of the Fight,
that is to say, that the Companies should go on successively one after another, which was
to be set down in writing, and my self ran on the outside to the whole of the wall, where
I found only ten or twelve Pioneers squat with their bellies close to the ground; for <hi>Tibau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
the Commissary of the Artillery, who had the charge of those two pieces of Canon,
had been constrain'd to quit them, and even Monsieur <hi>de Basillac</hi> himself. Seeing then
this disorder, I unbethought my self of a great number of Bavins I had the day before
caused to be brought into the Town, and said to the Gentlemen who were with me these
words:<note place="margin">The words of the Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer.</note> 
               <hi>I have heard, and alwayes observ'd, that there is no labour, nor danger, that
Gentlemen will ever refuse; follow me therefore I beseech you, and do as you shall see me do?</hi>
They did not stay to be entreated, and so we went in great haste directly to the Bavin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
that were within the Town, and lay in the middle of a Street there where not a man durst
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:105656:197"/>
abide, and there I took a Bavin and laid it upon my shoulder, as also every Gentleman
took one, and there were a great many who carried two a-piece; after which manner we
return'd out of the Town by the same way we entred in, and thus I marcht before them
till we came to the hole. By the way as we were going I had given order, that they
should bring me four or five Halbardeers, which at my return I found already arriv'd at
the hole, and made them enter into it. We threw them the Bavins into the hole, which
they took with the points of their Halberts, and ran to throw them upon the Gabions to
raise them. I dare be bold to affirm with truth that we were not above a quarter of an
hour about this work, and so soon as ever the Canon was cover'd, <hi>Tibauville</hi> and the other
Canoneers return'd into the Battery, where they began to shoot with greater fury than
of all the dayes before, every clap almost overtaking another, every one assisting them with
great cheerfulness. If, Captains, you shall do the same, and your selves first put your
hands to the work, you will make every one follow your exemple, very shame will push
and force them on: and when the service is hot in any place, if the Chief do not go in
person, or at least some eminent man, the rest will go very lamely on, and murmur when
a man sends them to slaughter. And if you covet honor, you must sometimes tempt
danger as much as the meanest Soldier under your Command.</p>
            <p>I will deprive no man of his due honor; for I think I have assisted at as many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
as any man this day alive, and must needs say this, that I never saw Commissaries
of the Artillery more diligent and adventurous than both <hi>Fredeville</hi> and <hi>Tibauville</hi> shew'd
themselves during the whole five dayes that the Battery continued, in my whole life; for
they themselves both levell'd, and fir'd, though they had as good Canoneers as ever I saw
handle Linstock in my dayes; and I dare be bold to say, that of a thousand Canon shot
we made against this place not ten fail'd of their effect, or were spent in vain.</p>
            <p>In the morning I sent for Monsieur <hi>de Gohas,</hi> who was at <hi>Vic-Bigorre,</hi> and the Captains
who were set to have an eye to <hi>Montamat,</hi> and the Succours expected by him, writing
to him to come away that he might be with me at the Assault, by reason that Captain
<hi>Paulliac</hi> Colonel of the Infantry was so dangerously wounded,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Paul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liac</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ot.</note> that we had no hopes of
his life. He receiv'd his shot at the time when I went over-night to carry Messieurs <hi>de
Leberon</hi> and <hi>de Montaut</hi> to cut off the great Counterscarp, which shot went quite through
his Body.<note place="margin">Fabia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hot.</note> My Son <hi>Fabian</hi> was also shot in the chin, and two Soldiers close by my side.
I there committed a very great error, for I went in the evening before it was dark, and
I believe they were aware that we intended to cut the Counterscarp, for all their Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzeers
were run together to that place; and the reason why I committed this error was,
that having computed with my self how many hours the night was long, I found that it
was not above seven hours or thereabouts; and on the other side I saw that in half an
hour I should lose all that I had done, if the Counterscarp was not pulled down by break of
day, and in that case I should think fit to give an assault that day, they would be so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rampir'd and fortified, that with as many more Canon shot as I had made against
the place, it would be a matter of very great difficulty to enter. This was the reason why
I made so much haste to go and begin the work, that I might have it perfected by break
of day; where I recommended the care of it to Messieurs <hi>de L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>beron</hi> and <hi>de Montaut,</hi> and
the two Captains upon the Guard, by telling them that in their diligence our victory
wholly consisted. And in truth they slept not, as I have already said, for by break of day
the Artillery began to play, and the Counterscarp was wholly pulled down.</p>
            <p>O Camrades, you who shall go to besiege places, you cannot but confess, that both here
and in several other places, my Enterprizes and Victories have succeeded more from my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy
and prompt execution than my valour, and I on my part am willing to confess,
that there was in the Camp braver men than I. But no one can be a Coward that has
these three things; for from these three all the Combats and Victories proceed, and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men choose to follow Captains that are provided with these three qualities. And
on the other side he cannot be call'd hardy, let his heart be never so good, if he be tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
backward, and slow in execution: for before he has fixt his resolution, he has been
so long deliberating about it, that the Enemy is advertiz'd of what he intends to do,
and consequently is provided to prevent his design: but if he be quick he shall even sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
himself. So that there is no great confidence to be repos'd in a Chief that is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd
with these three qualities, vigilancy, promptitude, and valour. If a man examine
all the great Warriours that have ever been, he will find that they had all those qualities.
<hi>Alexander</hi> did not in vain bear the Device I have mentioned before. Examine <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Commentaries, and all the Authors that have writ of him, you will find that in his life
he fought two and fifty Battels without ever losing any, saving that of <hi>Dirachium;</hi> but
within thirty dayes he had a sufficient revenge against <hi>Pompey,</hi> for he won a great Battel,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:105656:198"/>
and defeated him. You will not find that in these two and fifty Battels he ever fought
three times in his own person, that is, with his own hand, though he was alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
there; by which you will understand, that all his Victories were the effects of his
conduct, for being diligent, vigilant, and a prompt executer of his designs. But for all
this, these qualities are rarely found, and I believe we <hi>Gascons</hi> are better provided of them
than any other people of <hi>France,</hi> or perhaps of <hi>Europe,</hi> and many good and great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
have gone out of it within these fifty years. I shall not compare my self to them,
but this I will say of my self, because it is true, that my Master never lost any thing by
my sloth or remissness. The Enemy thought me a league off when I came to beat up his
Quarters. And if diligence be requir'd in all exploits of war, it is much more in a Siege,
for a very little thing will serve to overthrow a great design. If you press your Enemy
you redouble his fear, he will not know where he is, nor have leisure to recollect himself.
Be sure to wake whilst others sleep, and never leave your Enemy without something
to do.</p>
            <p>I shall now return to the Assault; our Order being set down, I went and placed my
self at the Gate of the Town near unto the Breach, where I had all the Gentlemen with
me, of which there might be six or seven score, and still more came up to us, for Monsieur
<hi>de la Chappelle Lauzieres,</hi> who came from <hi>Quer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> brought a great Troop of Gentlemen
along with him. I shall here relate one thing of my own presage, which is perfectly
true, That it was impossible for all the friends I had to dispossess me of an opinion I had,
that I should in this Assault be kill'd or wounded by a shot in some part of my head;
and out of that conceipt was once half in a mind not to go to the Assault, knowing very
well that my death would at this time be of ill consequence, if not to the Enterprize in
hand, yet to the general design upon that Country; this fancy therefore still running in
my head the morning before the Assault was to be given, I said to Monsieur <hi>de Las</hi> the
Kings Advocate at <hi>Agen,</hi> who was of our Council, these words. <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Las, <hi>there
are some who have exclaim'd, and do yet cry out that I am very rich; you know of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
I have to a Den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r, for by my Will, to which you are a witness, you are sufficiently enform'd
of my Estate. But seeing the world are not otherwise to be perswaded but I have a great deal
of money, and that consequently, if by accident I should die in this Assault, they would demand
of my Wife four times as much as I am worth, I have here brought a particular of all the
money I have at this day in the whole world, as well abroad at Interests, as at home in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody
of my Wife. The account is of my Steward</hi> Barat<hi>'s drawing, and sign'd by my own
hand. You are my friend, I beseech you therefore if I dye, that you and the Councellor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ur</hi> de Nort <hi>will transfer your love and friendship to my Wife and my two Daughters, and that
you will have a care of them, especially</hi> Charlotte Catherine, <hi>who had the honor to be Christned
by the King and the Queen his Mother.</hi> Which having said, I deliver'd the Scrowl into
his hands, and very well perceiv'd that he had much ado to refrain weeping. By this
you may judge if I had not the misfortune that befel me before my eyes. I have no fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
spirit, but few misfortunes have befall'n me in the whole course of my life that my
mind has not first presag'd. I still endeavour'd to put it out of my fancy, resigning all
things to the good will of God, who disposes of us as seems best to his own wisdom, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I ever do otherwise, what ever the Hugonots my Enemies have said or written to
the contrary against me.</p>
            <p>So soon as two of the clock, the hour prefixt for the assault, was come, I caused eight
or ten Bottles of wine, that Madam <hi>de Panjas</hi> had sent me, to be brought out, which I gave
the Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Montluc</hi>'s Speech to the Gentlemen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to the Assault.</note> saying, <hi>Let us drink Camrades: for it must now soon be seen which of us has
been nurst with the best milk. God grant that another day we may drink together; but if our
last hour be come, we cannot frustrate the decrees of Fate.</hi> So soon as they had all drunk,
and encourag'd one another, I made them a short Remonstrance in these words, saying,
<hi>Friends and Companions, we are now ready to fall on to the Assault, and every man is to shew
the best he can do. The men who are in this place, are of those who with the Count</hi> de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gommery
<hi>destroyed your Churches, and ruined your houses; You must make them disgorge
what they have swallowed of your Estates. If we carry the place, and put them all to the
sword, you will have a good bargain of the rest of</hi> Bearn. <hi>Believe me they will never dare
to stand against you.<note place="margin">The Assault.</note> Go on them in the name of God, and I will immediately follow.</hi> Which
being said I caused the Assault to be sounded, and the two Captains immediately fell on;
wheresome of their Soldiers and Ensigns did not behave themselves very well. Seeing then
that those were not likely to enter, Monsieur <hi>de Sainctorens</hi> marcht up with four Ensigns
more, and brought them up to the Breach, vvhich did no better than the former, for they
stopt four or five paces short of the Counterscarp, by vvhich means our Canon vvas nothing
hindred from playing into the Breach, vvhich made those vvithin duck dovvn behind it.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:105656:198"/>
I then presently perceiv'd, that some body else, and other kind of men than the Foot must
put their hands to the work; which made me presently forget the conceit I had of being
kill'd or wounded, and said to the Gentlemen these words. <hi>Camrades, no body knows how
to fight but the Nobles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and we are to expect no victory but by our own hands, let us go then, I
will lead you the way, and let you see that a good horse will never be resty. Follow boldly, and go
on without fear, for we cannot wish for a more honourable death. We deferre the time too long,
let us fall on.</hi> I then took Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> by the hand, to whom I said, <hi>Monsieur</hi> de
Gohas, <hi>I will that you and I fight together, I pray therefore let us not part; and if I be kill'd
or wounded, never take notice of me, but leave me there, and push forward, that the Victory
however may remain to the King:</hi> and so we went on as cheerfully as ever I saw men go on
to an Assault in my life, and looking twice behind me, saw that the Gentlemen almost
toucht one another, they came up so close. There was a large Plain of an hundred and fifty
paces over, or more, all open, over which we were to march to come up to the Breach,
which as we passed over, the Enemy fir'd with great fury upon us all the way, and I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix
Gentlemen shot close by me. One of which was the Sieur <hi>de Besoles;</hi> his shot was in his
arm, and so great a one, that he had like to have died of his wound; the Vicount <hi>de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batut</hi> was another, and his was in his leg: I cannot tell the names of the rest, because I
did not know them. Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> had brought seven or eight along with him, and
amongst the rest Captain <hi>Savaillan</hi> the elder, of which three were slain, and the sad Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Savaillan</hi> wounded with a Harquebuze shot quite through the face. There were also
hurt one Captain <hi>du Plex,</hi> another Captain <hi>la Bastide,</hi> both Kinsmen of mine about <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neufue,</hi>
who had alwayes serv'd under Monsieur <hi>de Brissac,</hi> one Captain <hi>Rantoy</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masan,</hi>
and Captain <hi>Sales</hi> of <hi>Bearn,</hi> who had before been wounded with the thrust of a Pike
in the Eye. There were two little Chambers about a Pike height or more from the ground,
which Chambers the Enemy so defended both above and below, that not a man of ours
could put up his head without being seen; however our people began to assault them
with a great shower of stones, which they pour'd in upon them, and they also shot at us,
but ours throwing downwards had the advantage of this kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight. Now I had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
three or four Ladders to be brought to the edge of the Graffe, and I as turn'd about to
call for two of them to be brought to me,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> shot.</note> a Harquebuze-shot clapt into my face, from the
corner of a Barricado joyning to the Tower, where I do not think there could be four
Harquebuzeers, for all the rest of the Barricado had been beaten down by our two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
that playd upon the Flanck. I was immediately all over blood, for it gusht out at
my mouth, nose, and eyes; whereupon Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> would have caught me in his
arms, thinking I would fall, but I said, <hi>Let me alone, I shall not fall, follow your point.</hi> Upon
this shot of mine almost all the Soldiers and the Gentlemen began to lose courage, and to
retire, which made me cry out to them, though I could scarce speak, by reason of the
torrent of blood that pasht out at my mouth and nose; <hi>Whither will you go? Gentlemen,
whither will ye go? will ye be terrified for me? do not flinch nor forsake the sight, for I have no
hurt, and let every one return to his place;</hi> in the mean time hiding the blood in the best
manner I could; and to Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> I said, <hi>Monsieur</hi> de Gohas, <hi>take care I beseech
you that the Soldiers be not discouraged, and renew the Assault.</hi> I could no longer stay there,
for I began to faint, and therefore said to the Gentlemen, <hi>I will go get my self drest, but
if you love me, let no one follow, but revenge me:</hi> Which having said I took a Gentleman
by the hand, I cannot tell his name, for I could scarce see him, and return'd by the same
way I caine, where by the way I found a little Horse of a Soldiers, upon which by the
Gentlemans assistance I mounted as well as I could, and after that manner was conducted
to my Lodging; where I found a Chirurgeon of Monsieur <hi>de Gohas,</hi> called Maistre <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
who drest me, and with his fingers (so wide were the Orifices of the wound) pull'd
out the bones from my two Cheeks, and cut away a great deal of flesh from my face,
which was all bruis'd and torn.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Gramond</hi> was upon a little Eminence hard by, looking on at his ease, who
being of this new Religion, though he had never born arms against the King, had no mind
to meddle amongst us. He was aware how upon my hurt all the Soldiers were dishearten'd,
and said to those who were with him, <hi>There is some eminent person slain, see how the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
are discourag'd, I am afraid it is Monsieur</hi> de Montluc, and therefore said to one of
his Gentlemen call'd Monsieur <hi>de Sart, Go run and see who it is, and if it be he, and that
he is not dead, tell him that I entreat him to give me leave to come and see him.</hi> The said
Sieur <hi>de Sart</hi> is a Catholick, who accordingly came, and at his entring into the Town he
heard that it was I that was hurt, and coming to my Lodging found my people weeping
for me, and me tumbled upon a Pallet upon the ground; where he told me that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Gramont</hi> begg'd leave that he might come to see me. To which I made answer,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:105656:199"/>
               <hi>That there was no unkindness betwixt Monsieur</hi> de Gramont <hi>and me, and that if he pleased
to come, he would find that he had as many friends in our Camp, and peradventure more than
in that of their Religion.</hi> He was no sooner gone from me, but Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan</hi>
my Lieutenant, who had marcht on the one hand of me when I went on to the Assault,
as Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> did on the other, came to see if I was dead, and said to me; <hi>Sir,

them, who put all to the sword: and assure your self we will revenge your wound.</hi> I then
said to him, <hi>Praised be God that I see the Victory ours before I dye. I now care not for death.
I bese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch you return back, and as you have ever been my friend, so now do me that act of friendship
not to suffer so much as one man to escape with life.</hi> Whereupon he immediately return'd,
and all my servants went along with him, so that I had no body left with me but two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Monsieur <hi>de Las,</hi> and the Chirurgeon. They would fain have sav'd the Minister,
and the Governor, whose name was Captain <hi>Ladon,</hi> to have hang'd them before my
Lodging, but the Soldiers took them from those who had them in their custody, whom
they had also like to have kill'd for offring to save them, and cut them in a thousand pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They made also fifty or threescore to leap from the high Tower into the Moat, which
were there all drown'd. There were two only saved who were hid, and such there were
who offer'd four thousand Crowns to save their lives, but not a man of ours would heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to any Ransom; and most of the women were kill'd, who also did us a great deal of
mischief with throwing stones. There was found within a <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchant whom the
Enemy had kept prisoner there, and another Catholick Merchant also, who were both sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and these were all that were left alive of the men that we found in the place, namely
the two that some one help't away, and the two Catholick Merchants. Do not think,
you who shall read this Book, that I caused this slaughter to be made so much out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for the wound I had receiv'd, as to strike terror into the Country, that they might
not dare to make head against our Army. And in my opinion all Souldiers in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of a Conquest ought to proceed after that manner, with such as are so impudent
as to abide Canon; he must bar his ears to all Capitulation and Composition, if he do not
see great difficulties in his Enterprize, and that his Enemy have put him to great trouble
in making a Breach. And as severity (call it cruelty if you please) is requisite in case of a
resolute opposition, so on the other side mercy is very commendable, and fit, if you see
that they in good time surrender to your discretion.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Gramond</hi> then came to visit me, and found me in a very ill condition, for
I had much ado to speak to him, by reason of the great quantity of blood that issued
from my mouth; Monsieur <hi>de Gohas</hi> also immediately after him came back from the fight
to see me; saying, <hi>Take comfort Monsieur, and cheer up, upon my word we have sufficiently
reveng'd you, for there is not one man left alive.</hi> He thereupon knew Monsieur <hi>de Gramond,</hi>
and saluted him, who after they had embraced, entreated him to carry him to the Castle,
which he did,<note place="margin">The Fortress of <hi>Rabasieins.</hi>
               </note> where Monsieur <hi>de Gramond</hi> found the taking of it exceeding strange, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he could never have believ'd this place had been near so strong, and that had I attaqu'd
<hi>Navarreins</hi> it would have been more easily taken. He would then needs see all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
I had made of the Canon, which having seen, he said, it had not been requisite that
we should have omitted any thing of the Battery. About an hour after he return'd, where
he offer'd me a House of his hard by, and all other things in his power, and has since told
me, that at that time, and in the condition he then saw me, he never thought I could
have liv'd till the next day, and believed he had taken his leave of me for ever. All that
day, and all that night I bled continually, and the next morning sent to entreat all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to come and see me, which they did, where having recover'd a little heart, and being
able to speak with greater ease than before, I made them the following short Oration.</p>

you a strict and inviolable friendship with one another. My wound, if you perform
brave exploits, will be the occasion of your acquiring honor for your selves; and for God's
sake my beloved Friends, do not give over this Enterprize in the beginning, and at a
time when you ought most to pursue it. Follow your blow in this astonishment of the
Enemy, and make it manifest that it was not I alone, but every one of you also, who
have an honourable share in the victory. Are you not content with the Election I have
made for you of Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin?</hi> and are you not willing to accept him for your
Chief?</q> to which they all made answer that they were, and that it was all the reason
in the world he should command. Which having all declar'd, I entreated them to see
me no more, that they might not encrease my Fever, but all retire themselves to him, and
so they sorrowfully departed from me.</p>
            <p>One thing (Lieutenants of Provinces) I can say, and that without bragging or lying,
that never any man in my Command was better belov'd of the Nobless than I, and though
I was of a peevish cholerick nature, yet so it was that they bore with my inperfections,
knowing that I did nothing out of malice. O 'tis an excellent quality that in a Chief!
and believe me what great Lord soever you are, if you do not win the love of the Nobless,
the Officers and Soldiers, you will never do any thing to purpose. And if your passion
sometimes make you say, or do any thing you should not do, (for we are all men) you
must repair it. I would fain see any of those Messieurs of <hi>France</hi> who censure our actions
in governing the Nobless of <hi>Gascony,</hi> undertake the Government, to see if they could so
easily, and at all turns manage those Gentlemen as they pretend. There was yet another
thing that has evermore preserv'd me the friendship not of the Gentlemen only, but of
all those who serv'd under my command, which was that I never thought any thing too
dear for my Captains and Soldiers. I have often when I was but Captain my self given
away my arms and my cloaths when I saw any one in need.<note place="margin">Liberality a quality neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in a Chief.</note> For a Pike, a Halbert, a
gray Hat and a Feather, I have gain'd the hearts of some to that degree that they would
have run into the fire for me; neither was my Purse ever ty'd up in my Companions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
and yet they say I am covetous! He that sayes so of me is nothing acquainted
with my nature; and it is the vice, of all others, that I have the least been polluted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I dare say that in this last War onely I have given to the Lords and Gentlemen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Command eleven <hi>Spanish</hi> Horses, and two Coursers. Which that no one may
think to be a lye, I shall name the persons to whom I gave them; not to reproach them
with it nevertheless; for they did me honor in accepting them.</p>
            <p>First, I gave a Courser to Monsieur <hi>de Brassac,</hi> who follow'd me in all these Wars at
his own charge (a Gentleman of ten thousand Livers a year, but the Enemy ever kept
from him all the Estate he had in <hi>Xaintonge</hi> and <hi>Chalosse)</hi> for which Courser he would
not now take 400 Crowns. I gave another Courser to Captain <hi>Cosseil,</hi> who bare arms
with me twenty years, and was Captain <hi>Charry</hi>'s Lieutenant, after he had first been my
Ensign. I gave to Monsieur <hi>de Madaillan,</hi> who was my Lieutenant, a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse he
would not part with for 400 Crowns, and another to his Brother he would not now sell
for five. I presented the Chevalier <hi>de Romegas</hi> with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse that co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> me two

200 Crowns to buy him a Horse, because his won had been hurt at <hi>St. Foy.</hi> He is a poor
Gentleman, but very valiant, as Monsieur <hi>de Sansac</hi> will witness, who is one of the oldest,
bravest, and most prudent Captains of this Kingdom. And because he had another Horse
that unluckily died, I gave him a <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, a tall and strong one to carry <hi>Barbs,</hi>
which after the Peace he sold for 1600 Crowns. Captain <hi>de la Bastide</hi> had another <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Horse of me, and the younger <hi>Beauville</hi> my Brother-in-law another, by reason his

Company, a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or Gentleman, but a man of extraordinary valour. I gave another to
Captain <hi>Fabian,</hi> he having lost his horse in his return from Court, for which I had often
refus'd 500 Crowns. And yet another to Captain <hi>Mons</hi> my Guidon, a poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had layn a whole year in prison at <hi>Montauban,</hi> which horse cost me three hundred
and five and forty Crowns. Being sick in bed, and dismissing my Nephew <hi>de Balagny,</hi>
who I hope will not shame the Family from whence he is descended, I gave him the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Horse that I had ever kept for my own Saddle. Several others I have lost, and three
in this last War, particularly one that I design'd for the King, who being swelted,
founder'd under me as I was going to relieve <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> which I thought Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Montamat</hi> had been going to besiege; and could I reckon all the horses I have
given in my life, I think it would exceed my Estate. If you do the same, you Lords who
are the Kings Lieutenants, you shall alwayes be well follow'd, for the Soldier abhorres
nothing so much as an avaricious Captain.</p>
            <p>To return to my Subject all these brave Gentlemen took their leaves of me, and the
next morning, which was the third day after my hurt, my Nephew <hi>de Leberon</hi> caused me
to be carried to <hi>Marsac,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The State of Monsieur de <hi>Montluc</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my after his hurt.</note> which is two leagues from <hi>Rabasteins.</hi> I was no sooner departed
from the Camp, but that the affection all the Soldiers bore unto me did too soon appear,
for all the Gentlemen Voluntiers retir'd, and most of the Foot, for which I was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
sorry, and could have been rather content with all my heart they should have totally
forgot me. How much (my Companions) did you there prejudice your King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?
and how great a wrong did you to your own honor? Had you united and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
a good intelligence one with another, as you promis'd me you would, all <hi>Bearn</hi>
had been your own. 'Tis an untoward thing this AEmulation to command. The same day
that I made the Remonstrance to the Nobless, they dispatcht away Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> to
the King,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc</hi> layes down his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> whom I entreated <q>to present my most humble service to his Majesty, and in
my behalf to beseech him, that he would please to provide for my Goverment, whether
I should live or die, for that he was to expect no more service from me: that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done enough, and must now make room for others, and that I would now for
the time to come seek what I had ever avoided before, which was the privacy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of my own House.</q> He found at his arrival at Court, that the King had already
dispos'd of my Government above a month before, which till this time never any King
of <hi>France</hi> before had ever done: but I ought not to lay the blame upon him. When I
heard the news I did not much concern my self at it, though it did a little trouble me
I confess, to have such a trick put upon me; for though I had not been shot, I should
never more have exercised that Command;<note place="margin">The Marquis <hi>de Villars</hi> the Kings Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
               </note> and I think he that now has it, which is the
Marquis <hi>de Villars,</hi> would as little care to be dismist from it as I; for it is not a <hi>Benefice
without a Cure,</hi> to have to do with the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince her Son, who
is already grown up to a man, the principal Governor, and an Enemy to our Religion;
who being what he is cannot want courage, credit, or means, not onely in <hi>Guienne,</hi> but
even in the King's Cabinet. Out of which consideration I had before quitted the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had it not been that I would not the King should reproach me, that I had
abandon'd his service in a time of War, and the greatest necessity of his affairs.</p>
            <p>That I may return to speak of my wound, which I do but too well remember, you
that are Generals of Armies, and Lieutenants of Provinces, may here observe how much
it imports you to preserve your own persons, and not to expose them to hazard, as I did
mine in playing the Common Soldier, and the Pioneer. For this unlucky shot of mine
was the cause that the Army under my Command moulder'd away to nothing. I do not
however intend to say, that you ought to be Cowards, and to hide your selves behind
the Gabions, whilst others lie open to the Harquebuze shot, but only that you may learn to
be wise by my exemple, and go discreetly into danger: for upon your loss all the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends;
as you know it befell that brave <hi>Gaston de Foix</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> I know
very well that a good heart, seeing his men misdemean themselves, cannot forbear leading
them the way, and exposing himself to danger, as I did, seeing my Foot go so untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to work. Which made me call to the Gentlemen, for I ever found by experience,
that fifty Gentlemen will do more than two hundred Common Soldiers. We retein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of honor, which our Fathers have acquired for us, and which gives us a Title to
that fair Epithet of Noble.</p>
            <p>By the whole account of my life hitherto you have been able to judg whether or no the
King had any reason to use me ill, considering that I never spar'd my life (which certainly is
the thing most dear to us in this world next to our honors) for his service; and not only my
own, but the lives of my Sons also: for of four that I had I have been three fall in Battel
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:105656:200"/>
in his Majesties service the fourth only remains, which is the Chevalier, whom though I
had design'd for the Church, and the Bishoprick of <hi>Condom,</hi> yet did I alwaies command
him to shew himself a <hi>Montluc;</hi> and he had the honour to be entitled Chevalier by the
late King <hi>Henry</hi> my good Master, who sent him to <hi>Malta</hi> where he serv'd his Apprentice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

from the Kings own nature. You may perhaps be more fortunate, and may not have
so many Enemies as I, who for disdaining to be any ones creature, had no Patron to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me; and on the other side have been perhaps too liberal of my tongue, in speaking
freely what I thought. 'Tis dangerous sometimes to speak truth, and I could never lie
nor dissemble. Yet shall I not be so ingrate as not to acknowledg my self highly oblig'd
to the Kings my Masters for the benefits and honours they have conferr'd upon me, who
from the condition of a private Gentleman, have rais'd me to the greatest Employments
in the Kingdom: but I can also say that I purchased those honours at the price of my
blood. Now you must know that having recover'd a little, and finding my self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better of my wound, I writ a Letter to the King, which I have thought fit to insert

to have deputed another in my place. But by the manner of doing it, your Majesty
has evidently manifested to all the world, that you have stript me of it for some forfeiture
of mine, either as to matter of arms, or for some foul play I have practised upon your
Majesties Treasure, by which means my honour is like to be brought into dispute through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

City of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where by the way I fought with, and routed the Forces that were gather'd together to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

danger that I had before <hi>Tholouze,</hi> without staying longer than two dayes there, I crost
the River with sixscore Horse, believing that Monsieur <hi>de Burie</hi> would come up to me, as
indeed he did, but it was four hours after the fight, where he found that I had defeated
six Ensigns of Foot, and seven Corne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without resting day or night I pursued Monsieur <hi>de Duras</hi> so close,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> that I compell'd him
to sight, before our Foot could come up to us; nay, I scarcely gave leisure to Monsieur <hi>de
Burie</hi> to come time enough to be present at the Engagement, where we succeeded so well,
that a handful of men defeated three and twenty Ensigns of Foot, and thirteen Corners of
Horse. After which I sent your Majesty ten Companies of <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, of which we
had made very little use; but that did good service at the Battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> as also did

his head but for your Majesties service; so that with good and just cause your Majestie
conferr'd upon me the Title of Conservator of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the second Troubles, I had long before sufficiently advertiz'd your Majesty, and
the Queen your Royal Mother, of what you afterwards saw come to pass, and though
by your command I had twice or thrice letters sent me, that I was very ill enform'd:
I did not for all that slack my vigilancie, nor neglect to stand upon my Guard, that I
might not be surpriz'd; but the same day that the Insurrection hapned at <hi>Paris,</hi> without
other intelligence than my own, and upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Eve, I put my self into <hi>Lectoure,</hi> the
most important City of all <hi>Gascony,</hi> in so opportune a season, that I frustrated the design
of six hundred men, which were to have been let in at the Postern, and after having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Town in your Majesties obedience, knowing you stood in need of relief, as
your Majesty afterwards sent me word, I made so good haste in raising of men, that in
29 dayes after the said <hi>Michaelmas</hi> day I sent your Majesty twelve hundred Horse,<note place="margin">Relief sent to the King.</note>
and thirty Ensigns of Foot, which were conducted by me as far as <hi>Limoges,</hi> and from thence
by the Sieurs <hi>de Terride, de Gondrin,</hi> and <hi>de Monsales;</hi> when though it seem'd to many,
that <hi>Guienne</hi> would be left a prey to the Vicompts, who had very great Forces; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
at my return I found them so much work to do, that they gain'd nothing either upon
me, or upon the Province: and with the few Forces I was able to gather together, I
went afterwards into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> where at my arrival those who had taken arms at <hi>Marennes</hi>
were defeated by <hi>Madaillan,</hi> and the Seneschal of <hi>Bazadois,</hi> who after meeting with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Pons,</hi> took <hi>Marennes,</hi> with the Isles of <hi>Oleron</hi> and <hi>Alvert.</hi> With the like dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
was the Isle of <hi>Rhé</hi> recover'd by my Nephew <hi>de Leberon,</hi>

had your Majesty been pleased to have furnisht me with what you promised of money,
Artillery, and other Ammunitions of War, I had put fair to have reduced <hi>Rochelle</hi> it self
to your Majesties obedience, before the Peace that was at that time concluded.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns the last Troubles, it is true, that they broke out at a time when I
was sick, and scarce recovering from the danger of death, yet I did not nevertheless for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to put my self into the field, and to get together all the Horse and Foot I possibly
could, and hearing that the Forces of <hi>Languedoc, Provence,</hi> and <hi>Dauphen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> and other Captains, who were all of opinion, that the best we could
do was to retire; and when we were all resolv'd to coast the Enemy, to keep them a little
in, and to try to ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> some advantage over them, the younger <hi>Monsales</hi> brought letters
from your Majestie to all the Captains to march towards Monsieur <hi>de Montpensier,</hi> and
to me that I must return, which I accordingly did, both out of regard to my own sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and also to preserve the Country, as I have done so long as the Forces were in my
hands. Being afterwards at <hi>Cahors,</hi> to which place I went with an intent to fight the
Vicounts, I was advertiz'd that <hi>Pilles</hi> was about <hi>Agenois</hi> with a great number of Horse,
whom thinking to surprize, I marched day and night to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight him, which had also so
faln out, had it not been that Monsieur <hi>de Fontenilles,</hi> and Captain <hi>Montluc</hi> with some
Light-horse met with five or six Cornets of the said <hi>Pilles</hi> his Cavalry, whom they charg'd
with so great f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry that they put them to rout, which made the said <hi>Pilles</hi> the same
night pass the River <hi>Dordogne,</hi> and retreat towards the Body of their Army.</p>
            <p>As to the coming of the Count <hi>de Montgommery,</hi> '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is very well known, that at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Mont de Marsan,</hi> which in two hours time I had besieg'd, assaulted, and
taken, Monsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi> carried away all the Forces in order to some designs he had in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> leaving me no more but my own Company, with those of Messieurs <hi>de Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenilles</hi>
and <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> and five Ensigns of Foot, with which I was fain to make shift
for the defence of <hi>Lectoure, Florence, Ville-neufue,</hi> and <hi>Agen;</hi> and although the said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal
afterwards call'd from me the forenam'd two Companies, and that I was left alone
with my own, yet did I not for all that forbear to put my self into <hi>Agen,</hi> when the Army of
the Princes drew near, without being reliev'd by any but the Sieur <hi>de Fontenilles</hi> onely, who
indeed came and brought his Company to my assistance. From which Town of <hi>Agen</hi> the
Princes Army were very much incommodated; and whereas they had thrown a Bridg of
Boats over the <hi>Garonne,</hi> with a design to pass into the Country, and of <hi>Condommois</hi> and <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi>
to make as it were a City; I broke their Bridg, and so shatter'd it to pieces, that they
could never recover any more than two of the Boats, with which they repassed the River, but
so leisurely withal, that had your Majesty been pleased to have sent me never so few Forces,
I could have kept them well enough from ever uniting again. And whereas during the time
of the said Princes being in these parts, they had possessed themselves of certain Castles in the
Country of <hi>Agenois,</hi> I retook them, and reduced them all to your Majesties obedience.</p>
            <p>You Majestie has since commanded me to go make War in the Country of <hi>Bearn;</hi>
wherein I so promptly obeyed your Command, that though it was very hard to raise
men, by reason that every one took the Peace for concluded, notwithstanding in less
then fifteen dayes I set on foot five and fourty Ensigns of Infantry, and six hundred Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse,
with which I resolv'd to invade the Country, either to force <hi>Montamat</hi> to a Battel,
or to suffer his Towns and Castles to be taken one after another before his face, as any one
may judg it must of necessity have fall'n out. For having begun with <hi>Rabasteins,</hi> as it
was necessary I should, for the reasons I have before laid down, though it was one of
the strongest places of all <hi>Guienne,</hi> I carried it in eight dayes time, playing at once in my
own person the parts of Pioneer, Canoneer, Soldier, and Captain. Where in making my
approaches I was like to have lost my youngest Son, who was shot close by my side, as
also was Captain <hi>Paullac;</hi> and when it came to an Assault, seeing the two first Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
did not go on as I desir'd they should have done, I went my self to the Breach, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with the Signieurs <hi>de G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as,</hi> and the Vicount <hi>d'Vza,</hi> and followed by about
a hundred or sixscore Gentlemen, of which two and fourty were hurt, I my self being
one of the number of those that were wounded, and in such a part that I shall carry the
marks of it to my Grave. And although this action joyn'd to others of the like nature, that
I have perform'd during the Reigns of the Kings your Father and Grandfather, make me
hope for no other advantages than what was before in the prospect of my ambition, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a gracious acceptation, and an honourable acknowledgment of my service from the
said Kings my Masters; I had reason however to believe that your Majestie would have
my performances in some little esteem. Moreover I represented in my person before your
eyes an old Soldier of threescore and ten years of age, your Majesties Lieutenant General
in these parts, and one who onely in giving the word of Command to others, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in his own person, might have sufficiently perform'd the duty of his charge; but
who nevertheless out of the zeal he had to render your Majestie Victorious in all your
Enterprizes, put himself into the rank of the meanest Foot-Soldiers, and in the greatest
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:105656:202"/>
danger of death, where several Gentlemen also ran the same fortune, esteeming it a great
honor and happiness to follow one of the oldest Soldiers, not to say Captains of <hi>France.</hi>
I also thought your majesty might have consider'd, that as in the first Tumults, the first
Victories your Majestie obtein'd were by my hand, I had likewise in these last Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d you victorious in the last Enterprize of War that was perform'd in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
But when I expected a Letter at least, such as your Majesty is accustomed to write
to the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Captain in your Kingdom, all the fruits of my great labour, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
was only to hear that you had depriv'd me of my Government, and (which
was worse) without sending me so much as one syllable to signifie your Royal intention,
insomuch that I saw the man already come who was to succeed me, before I had any inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of my being cashier'd from my Command. Nay, at the very same time, that by
an universal Law throughout the whole Kingdom your Majesty has rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r'd to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Employments all such as have been depriv'd of them, I may say that by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Law made for me alone, I am degraded from an Employment wherein I have so
long maintain'd my self with my sword in my hand. But though I had been stript to
my Doublet, I should yet remain cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the Kings my Masters could themselves desire. I am sure every one will frankly

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess that I have been in as many Combats, Battels, Rencounters, Enterprizes both by
day and night, Assaults, Takings, and Defences of Towns, as any man this day alive in
<hi>Europe;</hi> and for such am known in Forreign Nations as well as at home, and yet I can
say with truth (for which the Glory be attributed to God, and the honor to the Kings
my Masters, who were pleased to employ me) that whether it were through my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
the influence of their Majesties arms, or any other accidents conducing to it, I was
never defeated in any place, where I had the honor to command in Chief, nor never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqu'd
my Enemy but I beat him. Several persons of honor yet living will also bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my behaviour at the Battels of <hi>Pavie,</hi> the <hi>Bicoque,</hi> and <hi>Serizolles,</hi> where I had the
Command of all the Harquebuzeers, and also in what esteem the late Sieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> had
me, for having seen me in his own presence sight betwixt <hi>Bayonne</hi> and <hi>Fontarabie;</hi> as also
for having serv'd under him in a Command of Foot in his Expedition into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in which services I received no less than four Harquebuze shots.
There are also several men of honor yet alive, who very well remember how I carried my
self at the taking of the County of <hi>Oye,</hi> in the quality of Camp-Master to all the <hi>French</hi>
Foot; and others are able to testifie in what esteem I was with the Prince of <hi>Malphe,</hi>
and the late Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eschal <hi>de Brissac,</hi> for having seen me in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> at all hours, and upon

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tness, that at the time when the disgrace besel our people in the Lower <hi>Bullen,</hi> I
alone with a very small number of men maintain'd the fight, and at the time when your

               </gap>pite of the <hi>English,</hi> and brought off with me two and twenty Colours of ours, that
had been taken, insomuch that one only remain'd in the hands of the Enemy. If Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Guise</hi> were now alive, he would not conceal what he saw me do at the taking of

was not I who took the Tower, from whence ensued the loss of the Town. All the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> will for ever honor me for what I did at the Siege of
<hi>Sienna,</hi> where I was the late King your Father's Lieutenant, as I was afterwards in <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi>
where I lost nothing, but remain'd victorious over the Enemy, and had my servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
so highly accepted by your Royal Father, that besides that at my return from
<hi>Sienna,</hi> he conferr'd upon me the Order, which in those dayes was a mark of great and
extraordinary service, he moreover gave me the County of <hi>Gaure</hi> for term of life, which
since, and after the death of my said Royal Master, at the calling in of your Majesties
Demeasns was taken from me, without the least murmur or shew of discontent on my part
at my being so depriv'd.</p>
            <p>All these things, Sir, I have thought fit to represent unto you, forasmuch as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
may peradventure not have heard of them, and that in speaking of me in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
presence I may by some have been otherwise represented, and have had other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
given of me than I deserve. I know that sometimes they have made as if I were a
Thief, and that otherwhiles, and for the most part have talkt as if for three years last past I
had done nothing of any moment. Wherein, Sir, they have abused your Majesty more than
they did me; for all the ill tongues in the world cannot deprive me of the honor I have
acquir'd, whereas by their importunity they may have induced you to do a thing that I
fear may be of ill exemple to men of my Trade; forasmuch as those who have of late been
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:105656:202"/>
call'd to Offices and Commands, and who desire to advance themselves by the exercise of
arms, will be apt by my exemple to apprehend, that long services, and the glory by those
services acquir'd throughout the world will not stand them in so much stead as the evil
tongues of their Maligners, and such as would put a bar to their preferment, may do
them harm.</p>
            <p>It remains, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, that for the conclusion of my long and tedious Letter I must humbly
beseech your Majesty to excuse me, if after such a blow of fortune I have been constrain'd
to address my Complaint, and to sigh out my grievance to you, and you alone; and
have been oblig'd to do it, as well to make my self better known to your Majesty, than I
have been in times past, as also most humbly to beseech you, that for the time to come,
when your Majesty shall be importun'd to use either me, or any other of your good and
faithful servants so unkindly, you will please to reserve evermore one ear for the accused,
before you resolve upon doing any thing that may wound or dishonor them. As for
what concerns my self, out of the desire I have ever had to see your Majesty prosper, I
am very glad if in these last troubles you have been so well, and so successfully serv'd in
all parts of your Kingdom by all those your Majestie has employed as by me, who on
this side have preserv'd your Cities, and the Country committed to my charge, have beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
your Enemies as oft as I could get opportunity to fight them, and taken Towns by
assault, with the extreamest peril of my life. And though it has been said, that I have
done nothing considerable, yet I beseech your Majestie to believe that no man has surpass'd
me in good intention, and a hearty desire to serve you. After which (since such is your
royal pleasure) I am willing to retire without other mark of all my labours, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of so many years, but the sorrow for the loss of my Children sacrific'd to your Crown,
and seven Harquebuze shots, which will serve continually to put me in mind of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and affectionate devotion I have ever had to perform the best and most obedient ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to your glorious Predecessors; which also I shall ever retein for your Sacred Majestie,
to whom I pray Almighty God to give all prosperity, health, and happiness, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This was my Letter, which more perplexed the Monsieurs, who at that time govern'd
the Court, to comment upon, than it did me to write it. And that unknown to me was
afterwards printed and publisht; for my friends, and such as best knew what I had done for
the conservation of <hi>Guienne,</hi> were as much, or more offended, than I. And I would have
it known, that both then and since, had I as disloyal a heart as they have, who after the
first Commotions represented me to the Queen for a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> I had yet means, and
interest enough to have done a great deal of mischief: But I neither am, nor ever will
be other than a good <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and a true Servant to the Crown. I also know very
well that none of these doings proceeded from the King, who never withdrew his favour
from me. But a young Prince involv'd in so many affairs has much ado to please all
the world; to which may be added, that several who could hurt me no way but with
their tongues, had a very great influence, not over his Majestie (who never lov'd the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,
what ever he might pretend for his own repose) but with the Council. O that
Kings and Princes ought to be very tender of disgracing a man, who has ever been
loyal and faithful to them, and who is a man of spirit: for it might light upon such an
one, as may put their affairs into a very ill posture, of which within these fifty years we
have seen too many exemples, to the great loss and detriment of the King of <hi>France,</hi> as
I have said before, when speaking of the traverses and ill offices that several great Captains
have receiv'd at Court. How many are there, that had they been used after this manner,
would not only have quitted all, but perhaps have done a great deal worse: for a man
that does his duty, and finds himself ill rewarded, it goes to his heart. I have heard
that either King <hi>Francis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Gascon</hi> Gentleman<hi>'s</hi> answer to the King.</note> or <hi>Lewis</hi> (I know not which of them it was) one day asking a
Gentleman, a <hi>Gascon,</hi> as I am, <hi>What would debauch him from his service? Nothing Sir,</hi>
reply'd the other, <hi>unless it be a despite.</hi> And it is also an old saying, that <hi>Out of spite a man
would turn Turk.</hi> Notwithstanding, all this unkindness could never make me either Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
or Hugonot. I have ever lov'd my honor too well for that, and will go down to
my Grave with that fair white Robe, without suffering the least ugly spot upon the name
of <hi>Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uc;</hi> and every one that has any regard to his honor ought to do the same. If his
King and Master will not make use of his service he may sit at home, and look on to see
how others behave themselves. If he be a man of valour, fortune that cast him down, will
raise him up again; she is not alwayes angry. How many great Lords and valiant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
have we seen cultivating their Gardens at home in a time of action, whom the King
has been constrain'd to recall into his service, and could have wished he had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
them from him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:105656:203"/>I have seen a great many in my time,<note place="margin">The miserable condition of such as revolt from their Princes.</note> both on the King's side, and also on the Emperor's,
who have turn'd their Cassocks, and some very lightly, and upon very slender occasion:
but they obtein'd no great advancement by it, and being amongst us, were lookt upon
for such as they were. I believe our Enemies did the same. Every one loves the Treason

constrain'd to side with the Emperor, and to give himself to the Devil, because God
would have nothing to do with him (for doubtless he was compell'd and necessitated to
it) we were told that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> themselves lookt askew upon him; and the poor

               </gap>t his life. When after he was slain at
<hi>Rome,</hi> it was a common dispute, whether the Pope, the King of <hi>France,</hi> or the Emperor
was most glad of his death; the first, because he held him besieg'd; the King, in that he
was deliver'd from a capital Enemy; or the Emperor, for being rid of a banisht and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Prince, that lay upon his hands, and was a burthen to him; though he had
only nourisht him with promises, and nothing else. These scurvie despites proceed too far;
am sure mine never did, nor ever shall make me do any thing contrary to my duty, or to
the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>judice of my honor. If I was young, and that the King would not make use of
my service, the world is wide enough, I would seek my fortune elsewhere; but never
at the expence of my Prince, nor at the price of my own honor. The King having receiv'd
my Letter, sent me in answer a great many good words, for they cost them nothing; the
end will shew whether the Province will be better govern'd, and his Majestie better serv'd,
and whether they who have succeeded me (though they are great persons, and great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains)
have done, or shall do hereafter better than I.</p>
            <p>But to return to the place where I left off; my Wife came to fetch me from <hi>Marsac,</hi>
from whence she carried me in her Litter to <hi>Cassaigne</hi> near unto <hi>Condom,</hi> where to refresh
me I was for three weeks together so crucified with the Cholick, that it had like to have
cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d me of all other discases. In this condition I had the comfort of Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi>
my Brother, who never left me till he saw me out of danger of death; and several Lords
also both Catholick and Hugonot came to see me. Before Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> arriv'd at
Court the Queen dispatcht away Monsieur <hi>de Beaumont,</hi> Steward of the Prince of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>'s
Houshold, by wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m she sent me word, that in case I was in the Territories of the
Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> I should forthwith retire, and put my men into Garrison. See what
a sudden change was here! I askt him if there was a Peace concluded, to which he made
answer, no; but that it was hoped there suddenly would. <hi>Why then should the King,</hi> said
I, <hi>put his Army into Garrison? Is not the Country already sufficiently ruin'd and destroy'd?
If I do this when the Peace shall come, and that we are to disband our Horse and Foot, not one
of them but will plunder his Host for a farewel, seeing themselves dismissed without money.
Seeing then it is so,<note place="margin">The Army dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded.</note> that they are order'd to be put into Garrisons, I will even disband them
for all together, and send them every man to his own house.</hi> To this end then I desir'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Valence</hi> to write, and sign a Letter (I being in no condition to do it) to Monsieur
<hi>de Gondrin</hi> forthwith to dismiss the Army, both Horse and Foot, and that every one in
four dayes should be retir'd to his own home; which was accordingly perform'd. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Beaumont</hi> himself carried the Letter to Monsieur <hi>de Gondrin,</hi> and five weeks after
the Queen sent to me to disband the Army, which I had done before, and by so doing had
sav'd the people above 500000 Livers, as the Country it self will witness. I had sav'd the
pitiful 4000 Francks that I had from the King untoucht, saving a hundred Crowns, that
I took out to give Captain <hi>Montaut</hi> to defray his Journey to Court. And thus it was
that I robb'd the Exchequer, and poll'd the People. Such about his Majestie as favour
the Hugonots, do not care how deeply they charge me with Calumnies; but I would have
the world to know, and do here declare, that in so many years that I have commanded,
and in all the great Employments wherein I have been I could never enrich my self 20000
Francks, and yet they stick not to affirm, that I have pill'd and poll'd 300000 Crowns.
I could wish it was true, provided it had been from the Hugonots our Enemies. God be
praised for all. These slanderers shall never have that advantage over me as to make me
hang down my head, but I will walk with my face erect, like a man of honor. The

examine their accounts, where if he find any one single Lyard converted to my profit, his
Majesty does not do well if he do not bring me to my Trial. It is no wonder his Majesty
is so ill serv'd, as 'tis reported he is, considering he makes no exemple; he is then to blame
himself, and not those that do it. And as to Impositions and Taxes upon the People to
enrich my self, and to fill my own Coffers, his Majesty in this case ought yet to be more
severe against me than in the other, by how much the people are more to be pittied than
the King; who if he want money knows how to make his people find it. 'Tis a priviledge
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:105656:203"/>
our Kings have so soon as they come out of their Page-ship, as one said of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth;
which makes me conclude, that the King ought to inflict a more severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon those who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lea his people, than if they purloin'd from his own Exchequer.
The Commissioners have given an account of all sorts of men who have rais'd money, let
them look if they can find me in their Papers, and if any be come into my purse. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I have dispos'd of some Hugonots Estates, who pretended to sit still at home, but were
worse than the others wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were in arms: neither was it reasonable, that they should be
better used than the poor Catholicks, who were gnawn to the very bones; and had I not
done it, the Gentry would have taken it ill, and the common Soldier would have revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for where there is nothing to be got but blows men will hardly go volunteer to the
Wars. Moreover they would have said I had held intelligence with the Enemy, by which
means I should not have had a man to follow me; and I had rather have died than to
have had such a repute. Had the King's Officers seized of these mens Estates, they would
have extracted no less than a million of Francks: but there was juggling amongst them,
and they held intelligence with one another. I have had my share; but it has ever been
fair prize, and onely taken from such as carried Provisions and Merchandize to the Enemy;
and yet I do believe all I made bold with being put all together, would not amount to above
3000 Crowns. Would to God that all the Chiefs of <hi>France</hi> had gone as roundly to work
for the service of the King and Kingdom as I, and that by war they had desir'd to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
peace; which if they had, not a man in the Kingdom would have dar'd to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
himself a Hugonot. But I shall leave this unpleasing discourse.</p>
            <p>A little while after the Peace was published, the articles of which were very much to
the Enemies advantage.<note place="margin">The Peace published.</note> We had beaten, and beaten them over, and over again; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they had evermore such an interest in the King's Council, that all the Edicts
continually ran very high in their favour. We got the better by arms, but they alwayes
over-reached us in those confounded writings. Ah, poor Prince, how wofully are you
serv'd, how ruinously are you adviz'd! If your majesty take not heed, your Kingdom
from the most flourishing, will be made the most miserable that ever was; which though
it was in the Reigns of your Grandfather and Royal Father, assaulted with many and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Enemies, and continually engag'd in war, wherein I have ever faithfully serv'd, yet
matters still went on in excellent good order, and Commands were not prophan'd, as in
these dayes. I pass by the injury your Majesty does your self, in giving your Enemies
so great advantages by these fine Edicts. I shall not meddle with the corruption of your
Courts of Judicature, nor the abuses in your Treasure, I only beg leave to say something
concerning the ordering of your <hi>Militia;</hi> for should I plunge my self further into what
has caused the ruine of your Kingdom, I should be forced to speak too loud, and that of
no little ones.</p>
            <p>I know, Sir, very well, that your Majesty will not do me the honor to read my Book;
you have other employment, and your time is too precious to be lavisht in reading the life
of a Soldier, but perhaps some one who shall have read it, in discourse may give your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
some account of what it contains. For which reason I have assum'd the boldness to
direct this short discourse I am about to make to your Majesties observation, and I beseech
you take a little notice of it, forasmuch as therein are laid open the causes of those
disasters I have seen happen in our Kingdom within these fifty years; in the beginning of
which I first took up arms in the Reign of your Grandfather, King <hi>Francis</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
during whose Reign a Custom was introduced, which I conceive to be very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to your State. Your Majesty may alter it, and in so doing do a great right to your
self and your Kingdom, as to the concern of arms. A young Prince, as you are, for birth
the greatest and the first of Christendom ought evermore to learn of old Captains. Your
Majesty is naturally martial, and have a genero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s heart, and therefore will not, I hope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
the advice of an old Soldier, your Subject, and Servant. I remember the time when
your Majesty took a delight to talk with me in private, then when you went your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> and then very well perceiv'd that your discourse exceeded the capacity
of your age, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o such a degree, that I dare be bold to say, might your Majesty have
had your own way, all things had succeeded a great deal better: for though you had
done nothing but only shewed your self, and have let your people see, that you was in
person in your Army, you had at least gain'd the hearts of many, and astonisht the rest,
and consequently had, without dispute been much better serv'd in this your Majesties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer
Age. I do believe it was one of the greatest errors they made you commit (for it
was not your Majesties fault that you was shut up when your A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mies marcht.) The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of your Kingdom are a good and an affectionate people, and rejoyce to see their King,
so that your presence would have inspir'd a great many, and particularly of our Country of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:105656:204"/>
               <hi>Guienne</hi> with wiser and more loyal Councils than some of them have since embrac't. But
I proceed to my discourse.</p>
            <p>Sir, when your Majestie conferres the place of a President, a Chancellor, a Lieutenant
Criminal, or any other Office of Judicature upon any one, it is evermore with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
that they shall not execute any of these Charges till first they shall be examin'd
by your Parliaments, which are full of wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and learned men: and oftentimes your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stie
gives order, that they shall first be examin'd by your Chancellor, before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves before the Parliaments, which are to determine of their Capacities, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no they be sufficiently read in the Law, not to be in danger of erring in the Arrests
and Judgments they are to make in their Administrations, that so right may be done to
those of your Subjects to whom it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all duly appertein. This, Sir, is a good and an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
way of proceeding, for you owe us Justice impartial, and according to the weight
of the Ballance. 'Tis a right to which we are born, and the chief thing you owe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
to all; and therefore it is admirably well done, to make them pass those strict
and severe Inquisitions that are requir'd in the Chambers of your Parliaments assembled.
Yet can it not be ordered so, that Justice in all things is alwaies duly executed.</p>
            <p>You ought, Sir, to do the same in all other Offices and Commands you confer in your
Kingdom;<note place="margin">Disorders in the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> through the defect of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> and yet I see that the first that makes suit to your Majestie for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a place, a Company of Gens-d'arms, or of Foot, or the Office of a Camp-master,
without considering what loss or detriment may thereby ensue, either to your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or your Kingdom, you easily grant it, perhaps at the recommendation of the first
Lady that speaks for it, and that perhaps your Majesty has danced with over night at a
Ball; for whatsoever affairs are on foot, the Ball must trot. Sir, these Ladies have too
much credit in your Court. O how many mischiefs have, and do daily arise, from having
so lightly conferr'd these Commands! And although your Majesties proceeding be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and just in exposing your Officers of the long Robe to the utmost test, it is not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of so great importance to your State. For what loss can you sustain if they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant?
it falls not upon you; for he that gains the Tryal though contrary to Law and
right, pays you the same duties that he did who is nonsuited in his cause; by which means
you lose nothing of your Revenue, it is still in the Kingdom; and what imports it to you
whether <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> be Lord of such, or such a Mannor so long as you have your Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farm
rents still duly paid you? We are all your Subject: But the error and ignorance of
Governors and Captains who obtein Places and Commands with great case, at the first
word of the first that asks, is infinitely prejudicial to your Kingdom, and herein I am
very confident all the great Captains and men of honor that are zealous for your service will
be of my opinion.</p>
            <p>If your Majesty give the Government of a Place to a man of no experience, and who
has never been in such a Command before, see what will follow. First it is an old saying,
that <hi>When the eye sees what before it never saw, the heart thinks that which before it never
thought.</hi> If therefore a Siege be clapt down before him, how is it to be expected that he
should disengage himself? how is it possible he should understand and discover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of the Enemy, on what part they can or will assault him? which there is a way to do
without a Spy, as I have made it to appear by what I did at <hi>Sienna.</hi> How should he
know how to fortifie and secure himself, and in short do a thousand, and a thousand
things that will be necessary to be done, if he have never before been engag'd in such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs?
Such as have been ten times besieg'd are apt enough to be startled at it, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so astonisht that they know not where they are. Now when your Majesty hears
that your place is going to be beleaguer'd, you will presently fall to raising an Armie, as
you have good reason to do, not daring to rely upon the small experience of this young
Governor, and perhaps shall be constrain'd to go in haste in your own person, or at least
to send one of my Lords your Brothers; where either the Town must be lost, or you must
hazard a Battel, where your self, or one of your Brothers who shall command your Armie
may be slain, together with several Princes of you blood, and a great number of your best
Captains. Consider then, I beseech you Sir, the mighty loss and misadventure that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon your easie conferring such a Command upon a man, without first know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he is able to do. For if he is a man of experience, and that he has manifested
himself in all places where he has been under good Leaders, to be a man of courage and
understanding; so soon as he shall enter into the place, he will presently fall to consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the strength, and weakness of it, recollecting what he has seen done elsewhere,
where he has been engag'd under another,<note place="margin">The diligence requir'd in a Chief</note> and what he has seen such and such a Captain
do upon the like occasion; and thereupon will suddenly take order for the defects of the
place, and begin to fortifie. He will also demand of you an Engineer, will enform you
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:105656:204"/>
of the Ammunition both of Victual, Arms, and Artillerie that he has found there, and
will never cease solliciting till you have supplied him with all things necessarie, knowing
very well what an inconvenience the loss of the place would bring upon you. When so
soon as your Majestie shall have furnisht him with all he desires, and that by his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
he shall have provided against all the defects of the place, he may then know what
he has to trust to, and shall have leisure to consider what he has to do, without precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which I have ever observ'd to be very dangerous in war, unless it be in an affair
that requires extreme hast and diligence.</p>
            <p>And herein two things present themselves to your Majesties consideration; the first,
that when your Enemy shall have heard of the valour of your Governor, and his great
experience, together with the great foresight and diligence wherewith he has been careful
to remedie the defects of his place, and the good discipline he there maintains; is it to be
supposed, that he will venture to attacque a man qualified with the forenamed virtues?
I do believe there is no A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ailant in the world but would think of it twice before he would
once resolve to do it,<note place="margin">That the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attacque him,</note> and if he call a Council about it, he will find that hardly one old
Captain will advise him to go on to his own ruine; and if the Chief be a circumspect and
experienced man, the counsel of the young hot-headed fellows must not be preferr'd to
that of the old Soldiers, for they better understand the business of the world than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do: and are unwilling to hazard the honor they have got; forasmuch as men look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the last of our actions, without much regarding what they have perform'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
So much concerning the first. Now the second thing that presents it self to your
Majesties consideration, is, that your Majestie reflecting upon the valour of the person
you have entrusted with defence of your place, his diligence, and experience, will be at
quiet within your self, knowing very well that such a man will do no unhandsome things,
but will be tender of his own honor, as well as careful of his trust: by which means you
shall have time to raise your Armie at leisure, and shall come to encamp your self in an
advantagious place, where if your Enemie come to assault you, he shall be defeated; and
on the other side, if he offer to assault the Town, you lye so close in his Rear, that let the
Breach be never so wide, he dares not go to the assault, forasmuch as whether he enter or
no he is certain to be defeated, for you surprize him in disorder; which will make him
very warie of attempting any thing, where his ruine is so manifest before him; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force him to raise his Siege, and betake himself to some other Enterprize, or else come
to assault you in your Fort; which also he will have a care of doing, as was the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> at the Camp in <hi>Provence,</hi> at the time when your Majesties Grandfather was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in the plain field, and that the Enemie made a shew of attacquing <hi>Marseilles.</hi> You
are evermore to take heed of committing errors in the beginning of a War; for if your
affairs have once a disrepute upon them in the beginning, your Majestie may be assured,
that your Soldiers will lose courage, and every one will seek an opportunity to run away,
insomuch that you are never to hope your Army shall do any thing to purpose after. Of
which I shall give your Majestie some Exemples, that you may see of how great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it is to have a good Governor in a Town of War. Of these Exemples, the first shall
be <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated before <hi>Nancy.</hi>

<hi>René</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> never dreaming that he would come to besiege
that place; by which means it was totally unprovided, both of Victuals, Ammunition,
and Men. King <hi>René</hi> had with him five or six <hi>Gascon</hi> Gentlemen (for these Princes of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> have ever had a great kindness for our Nation) namely Captain <hi>Gratian Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerre,</hi>
a poor Gentleman of this Country call'd <hi>Pons,</hi> another call'd <hi>Gaian,</hi> and another
whose name was <hi>Roquepines;</hi> the others were slain during the Siege, where these brave
<hi>Gascons</hi> did so valiantly behave themselves, that with some of the Country people that
put themselves into the Town, and some Gentlemen of the said Country, they defended
the Town, and endur'd the last extremity of famine, by that means giving King <hi>René</hi>
leisure to go himself into <hi>Switzerland</hi> to fetch his relief. King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh of
<hi>France</hi> would not openly assist him, by reason of the League he had contracted with the
Duke; but (as you Princes ordinarily do) he favour'd him understand, and disbanded
four hundred men at arms, that were advanc'd as far as <hi>Pont St. Vincent,</hi> within two
leagues of <hi>Nancy;</hi> so that when the Duke saw the <hi>Swiss</hi> coming upon him, he raised
the Siege, and there lost both the Battel and his life. Had <hi>Iohn d' Albert</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>

the Chief, who may make every one to fight, so much as the very Children, which will
make an Enemy very unwilling to attacque him. Behold then, Sir, how much it imports

do nothing without the other, and together must bring you back an account of what
is to be done for the ordering of the Battel, both Horse and Foot, after having viewed
the situation of the place, and the Grownd where the Horse is to be drawn up, and the
Foot also; and being agreed together, are to bring you back a report of all; whereupon
you shall in your Council conclude what you have to do: but you are of necessity to
ground your resolution upon their intelligence, which if they be not men of experience,
O Sir, how many Errors will they cause you to commit! It is therefore very necessary
that the men who discharge these Offices should have three qualities; of which the first
is a long experience; for if they be men long beaten to the practice of Arms, and that
they have been eye-witnesses of some miscarriages in the Armies wherein they have serv'd,
provided they retein it; that very observation will make them circumspect and careful
of falling into the like error. The second quality requir'd in men that are entrusted
with these Offices, is, that they be bold and adventurous (for your Mareschaux and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
de Camp, of all others must not be Cowards) or at least if they are not more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
than ordinary, (for I do not desire they should be <hi>Rowlands)</hi> they must not be afraid
of blows; for if these men be timerous, you are not to expect that your Army should do
any thing to purpose; by reason that they will evermore quarter your Army in fear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and consequently alwaies encamp at a disadvantage; by which means if your
Adversary General be a man of Judgment, and practis'd in such affairs, he will easily
discern your Armie to be in fear, as I my self have often judg'd in exercising this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
by the meer observation of the Enemies manner of encamping, and have seldom
been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceiv'd. Which is a thing of all others of the greatest danger, forasmuch as nothing
so much encourages both the Officers and the Soldiers of an Armie, as to know that their
Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> marches and encamps in fear. The last qualitie requir'd in this sort of Officers,
is, that they be circumspect and diligent; which three qualities will render them perfect
and comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Quarters, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hew their reasons why they take them up in that place, and
are likewise to appoint to what Post the Cavalrie is to retire in case of a Charge, whether
to the Avant-Guard, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the Battel, though it ought more properly to be to the Avant-Guard,
by reason that the Cavalrie is a member belonging to it. It is also necessary that
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:105656:206"/>
they judg well of the Enemies Avenues, and accordingly where to plant the Artillery,
where to encamp the Battel, and where the General shall take his place; and in case of
an Alarm, where to plant the Guard, and where to place the Centinels; in short, all
things pass through their care and conduct.</p>
            <p>When these, together with him that commands the Army shall be perfect in all this,
and shall have order'd all things as they ought to be, they can never be surpriz'd: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they shall so well have provided for all things necessary, that not a man in the
whole Army but will know what he has to do; which being granted, every one will confess
that Army cannot possibly fall into any disorder: for all the losses that such bodies usually
sustein proceed only from negligence and supineness. This good order in quartering ought
evermore to be observ'd, whether far off, or near to the Enemy, and also upon a March,
which being done, the Army can never encounter any accident or novelty that can discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, when the Enemy shall be near at hand: but if they shall deferre to do it till ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
requires, they will not find the Soldiers either so ready, or so well dispos'd; and
besides it sometimes falls out, that they think the Enemy at a great distance, when he shall
rise earlier than they, and come to beat up their Quarters. Moreover they ought in such
a case to maintain a better intelligence betwixt themselves than upon a march, and then the
Master of the Ordnance is to be joyn'd with them, and indeed upon these three persons
next to the General the loss or gain of a Battel depends. Judg you then, Sir, whether these
Employments are to be dispos'd of with so great facility, since the loss and overthrow of
your Armies proceed from their insufficiency or negligence. When ever your Majesty or
your Lieutenants shall make Election of such persons, your hearts ought to tremble with
fear at so unadvised a choice.<note place="margin">Captains of Foot.</note> And you ought to consider of it more than once.</p>
            <p>You have, Sir, next your Captains of Foot, to whom you give Commissions at the fancie
of a Monsieur or a Madam, who recommend them out of a desire they have to preferre
their own Relations and Creatures, and to oblige others. From these Commands ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd,
almost as many mischiefs may proceed as from the former; whether it be at the
defence of a Breach, or in leading a Foot Company in a day of Battel, or in any other
Enterprize of importance to your affairs: for if he who takes upon him such a Command,
is not such as he ought to be, he will be defeated through his own fault, and all the men
lost that are under his Command, where the damage and dishonor will be yours, and the
foldness and courage of your Enemie will every day encrease. Of which your Majestie
both has seen, and do now see the Experience. At the time when I first entred into arms,
the Title of a Captain was a Title of honor, and Gentlemen of good Families were proud
of it: But now-a-daies every Plow-boy and Carter that has commanded but in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of a Corporal takes upon him that Title. You will say, Sir, perhaps, that we who
are your Majesties Lieutenants are in fault for this, but you must pardon us if you please:
for it proceeds principally from you, who have begun to conferre these Commands upon
little people, so that now the Gentlemen disdain them. In your Grandfathers time the
Foot Companies consisted of a thousand men, which was a noble Command, and that
was no small ease to your Treasure, there being not near so many foot Officers requir'd
as I have said elsewhere: but now it is a very great disorder, and for which your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
would do well to find out some remedy, that so many Captainets may return to be
common Soldiers. And the same medly is at this day observ'd amongst your Knights of
the Order, which is a very great confusion.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, what does all this mean? but that to determine of differences and Suits in
Law your Majesty makes all your Judges to pass a strict Examination, though you your
self can lose nothing by the sentence, let it go which way it will; whereas where it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
concerns your own life, and the lives of my Lords your Brothers, and of all the
Princes and great Captains of your Armie, and consequently the ruine of your Kingdom,
your Majestie without any manner of difficulty, or consideration, conferres Commands
and Governments upon the first that make suit for them. Sir, there is an old saying
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Si le Fol un conseil te donne,</l>
                     <l>N'en fay refus pour la personne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>If the Fool good advice deliver,</l>
                     <l>Slight not the counsel for the Giver.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
Which I bring in here to excuse the advice I intend humbly to offer to your Majestie, and
which you ought to take in good part from me, who am at this day the oldest Captain in
your Kingdom; and who from the passages I have seen in my time, ought in reason to
have gain'd some experience for the time to come. The Counsel that I will presume to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:105656:206"/>
give you, is, that your Majestie would take exemple by the Examination whereby the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of your Parliaments are compos'd, where the several members are first to present
themselves before your Chancellor, your President and Counsellors, to be examin'd of
their sufficiencie, who if they thereupon be found incapable, they are sent back to studie
till they be wiser, and have rendred themselves worthy of the Employments to which
they pretend.</p>
            <p>Before then, Sir, you dispose of any Command, upon which so many inconveniencies
visibly depend, never conferre it at the importunity of any man alive, till first you have
put the person upon his Examination, remanding him before your Doctors, which are the
old Captains who have gain'd experience by a long practice in Arms. You may have
some old ones, who have not much stirr'd from their own Houses, I do not take such for
old Captains, but worse than those the Chancellor sends back to studie: for it is a saying.
<hi>Too old to mend:</hi> but I mean that you should call to be assisting at your inquisition such
as have ever follow'd the wars, and that are markt for such with a great many Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs,
that is to say, with Harquebuze shots, or cuts, and slashes with the sword upon
his face and bodie; which are signs that he has not alwaies sate idle by the fire side. To
this end, Sir, 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it you should have a Chancelor; and Sir, it is most reasonable that
that Chancellor be the Monsieur your Brother, although he be yet very young; for in
three or four years that he has born Arms he has won two memorable Battels, so that
with the good understanding and judgment he is Master of, and being descended of so
good a Race, it is impossible but he must have retein'd a great deal: for he has heard
great Doctors in our Faculty dispute before him. Your Majestie must therefore have no
other Chancellor of Arms but him; you shall still, Sir, be superior, for no one can take that
from you, and 'tis you onely that can confer honor upon others. As God has made you to
be born a Prince to command so many millions of people, he has also distinguisht you by
some particular Endowments from the rest of men. When then any one shall make suit
to you for any of the foremention'd Commands, your Majestie would do well to assemble
your Chancellor and your Doctors; and if you be there present in person, it would be better
if your Majestie would take the pains your self to interrogate them if they know the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in question, where he has serv'd his Apprentiship, and under whom, (for oftentimes
<hi>Like Master, like Man)</hi> and what act of honor he has perform'd? I doubt not but these
old Cavaliers will frankly tell your Majestie the truth, as knowing very well of what
importance it is to have a Captain a Fool, a Coward, or a Novice; and according to their
characters and opinion you may conferre upon him the Command he pretends to; for
he has then passed the inquisition.<note place="margin">A pleasant sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> And that your Majestie may be deliver'd from importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
do, Sir, as I did once at <hi>Alba</hi> in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Every day my horses were borrowed
of me (for we had a little kind of a Truce) This vext me, and I knew not how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
it: but at last I commanded my Trumpet to go and make proclamation throughout
the Town from the Governor, (which was my self) that I had made an Oath never any
more to lend my horses, and that therefore I had caused it to be thus proclaimed, that no
one might be ignorant of my vow. After which I was no more importun'd. Do you,
Sir, the same; some day in a great Company declare openly before all the Lords and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of your Court, that you have taken an Oath never to dispose of any Command or
Government, but by the advice of your old Cavaliers and Captains. This will presently
be spread abroad; for what you Kings and Princes say and do disperses it self with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous
swiftness; and this will also produce another great effect, which is, that such as
are freshmen in Arms, knowing they cannot get in at the Window, will endeavour to
signalize and make themselves known to such as are to open them the door, and every
one will contend who shall do best.</p>
            <p>O if your Majestie will but please to do this, how many brave Captains will you have
in a little space! you will have more valiant Leaders then are again to be found in all the
Kingdoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> And this also will produce two things, which of all others you
ought most to desire in your Militia; of which the first is, that when this Governor or
Captain shall have been preferr'd by the testimony of your old Cavaliers, given either to
your Majestie, or to the Monsieur your Brother, he will look upon it for so great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
that he will determine within himself, if he have never so little courage, rather to
lose a thousand lives, than be guilty of the least cowardize, or commit the least offence:
for he will evermore think, that should he misbehave himself, he should do an injury to
those who nam'd him for the Employment he has obtein'd, and that your Majeste might
justly reproach them with their oversight in that nomination: by which means they will
endeavour to do the best they can that they may obtein honor, and that your Majestie
may preferre them to a better Command; knowing that they must again pass the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:105656:207"/>
to arrive at it, and the examination of your old Captains, where if they shall have
behav'd themselves amiss, they will evermore make a true report, and will be asham'd to
advise your Majestie to create such a one Maistre, or Mareschal de Camp, whom they
have seen misdemean himself in the quality of a simple Captain.</p>
            <p>The second advantage that will derive it self from this strict way of examination, is,
that you will hereby stop the mouths of those importunate Lords and Ladies, who upon
so light foundations make suit to you for Commands, upon which so many mischiefs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
being assur'd before hand, that your Majestie will not grant them without the
parties being well examin'd before your Chancellor and Doctors, but will refuse them, as
you would do him that should ask of you the Office of a Councellor of the Parliament
of <hi>Paris</hi> before he has passed the Test; for the Court would not admit him. I have
hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that formerly your Father hearing that they had refus'd to admit one, who by some
Lady was recommended to them, should say, <hi>that one Ass might very well pass amongst
so many Spanish horses:</hi> but they would not believe him. Sir, put those by whom you
desire to be serv'd to the Test. I once saw a Gentleman (as I remember he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l)
whose custom it was when any servant came to make him a tender of his service,
he would presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly put him to trial, and putting a sword into his hand, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to defend himself, without permitting him nevertheless to thrust at him,
where if he found him a man firm, and resolute, he would presently entertein him; if
otherwise, he would tell him he was not for his turn. By which means he had evermore
brave and resolute men about him, for every one knew his custom, and no one would
offer himself but he was stout and hardy; for he was a rude Gamester. This was an
Examination practis'd by a Subject of yours, and a Law he establisht within himself, for
every man is a King in his own House; as your Grandfather was answer'd by the Collier.
Establishing this severe Inquisition of the merits of men, all <hi>Europe</hi> would presently know
it, and so many importunate Suitors will be astonisht at such a Law, and will think of
nothing but how to learn, instead of courting Monsieur or Madam, and you will be rid
of these impertinents whom you send about their business, and the other may go render
themselves worthy before they offer to pretend to Employments too big for them, and
that till they have given a better account of themselves, they cannot honestly pretend to,
because they do not deserve them.</p>
            <p>There will also another conveniency arise from this way of proceeding, which is, that
those you choose and honor with these Charges and Commands will hold them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from your self,<note place="margin">The Character of a little Monsieur of the Court.</note> or your Doctors, and not from the Ladies and the little Monsieurs
of your Court, who better understand how to set the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inger of their Watches to the hour
of the day, than to level a piece of Canon against a Tower, or so much as to discharge
a Musket, and yet by their haughty carriage, and stately motion, a man would think
that all should tremble before them. I once heard one of these pretty fellows talk at such a
rate, as if he had almost himself alone carried away the honor of the Battel of Monsieur <hi>de
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iron,</hi> and that Monsieur <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> nor even the Monsieur your Brother had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
comparable to him. Now, as I was saying, these Gentlemen who shall have the
honor to hold their Commands immediately from your self after this manner, will think
themselves much more highly honour'd; wherefore, Sir, in truth these are things you
ought more to desire to see regulated, and to have a more especial regard unto, than all
the rest that concerns military discipline, by how much all the Events of War, whether
good or evil, under God, depends upon the choice you shall make of men of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>I shall not here speak of Generals of Horse, nor Colonels of Foot, by reason those are
two Employments that are only to be conferr'd upon Princes, or men of very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
quality, who though they be young and of little experience, it imports not much,
provided the Camp-Master be an experimented man. And pursuing this method, your
Majesty will soon see the confusion that is crept into your Armies vanisht and gone;
and the ancient splendor and beauty of your Companies of Gens-d'arms restor'd. One
thing I perceive, that we very much lose the use of our Launces, either for want of good
horses, of which methinks the Race visibly decayes, or because we are not so dextrous in
that kind of fight as our Predecessors were; for I see we quit them for the German pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols,
and indeed fighting in gross Battalions, these are much more ready than Launces
are; for if they be not fought in file the Launceers are apt to encumber one another; and
also that open kind of fight is not so safe and certain as in close Bodies.</p>
            <p>To return to my discourse; you may please to take notice, Sir, that all such as desire to
advance themselves by Arms, will covet to be brought upon the Chequer of Examination.
And in my opinion it would be well and prudently done of your Majestie to keep a List
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:105656:207"/>
of all the brave and qualified men you have in your several Provinces, to the end, that a
vacancy of any Command falling, you may think of those persons, and worthily supply
it: by which means such as know themselves to be in your List will be highly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and endeavour with all the power they have to do you some notable piece of
service: and such as are not in, will expose themselves to a thousand dangers to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. This Book you should call the Book of Honor, and when you hear any one highly
applauded, after having examin'd the particularities of his Exploits, your Majestie would
do well to give publick Order to have his name entred into your List. I remember I have
heard when I was very young, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth did after this manner, especially
by those of the long Robe, and that the Office of Chief Justice of <hi>Agenois</hi> (a place of
great profit and honor) being vacant, he remembred himself of a good Lawyer, who had
made him a very eloquent Oration at <hi>Orleans,</hi> whose name he had set down in his List,
and in pure Gift gave him the place. He likewise did the same in all Employments;
and I have seen the same way practised by that great <hi>Odet de Foix,</hi> under whom I serv'd
in the beginning of my Arms: he knew the names of all the Captains and remarkable
persons; and when any one had perform'd any signal Exploit, he presently bookt him
down.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, withal you must oft turn over this Book, and not content your self with
taking the names of such persons only, but employ and advance them according to their
quality and desert, and encourage them by some gracious expressions in their favour; or
if he be a poor Gentleman give him money, which if you please to do with your own
hand, five hundred Crowns will be better taken than two thousand from the hands of
a Treasurer; for something will evermore stick to their fingers. One time King <hi>Henry</hi>
your Royal Father, and my good Master (whom God absolve) had order'd me two
thousand Crowns, and he that was to pay it, was not asham'd to detein five hundred:
but he met with a Gascon that was not wont to be so serv'd, nor to pay such large Fees.
He knew I would complain of him to the King, and was more overjoyed that he could
perswade me to receive it, than I was of the receipt. If your Majestie would give with your
own hand, these tricks would not be put upon men of desert. It was said in your
Grandfathers time, that his Predecessor alwaies did so, and had a Chest full of Baggs
stuft with Crowns, in some more, in some less, which he himself distributed according
to the quality of the person, or of the service he had perform'd. I know some will tell
you that this is too much below a King; but Sir, do not believe them, for these are the
people that would have the moulding of all the Paste, and would that your liberality should
pass thorough their hands, to the end that they might nim from your bounty. Only
one thing give me leave to tell your Majestie you should not give all to one, nor to a few
persons; I beseech you, Sir, pardon my plainness, you have given one Gentleman of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>
enough to have satisfied fifty pretenders. I will not say but that the man was
brave and valiant, but there were who deserv'd it as well, or better than he; and who
notwithstanding had nothing at all. Your Majestie may please to take what I say in
good part: I have one foot in the Grave, and 'tis the affection I bear to your Crown, that
prompts me to say what I do. I am Neighbour to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but he never had other
than <hi>Flours-de-Lis</hi> from me. I could say a great deal more, if I durst, for in truth there
is but too much to say, and but too many things to be reform'd. I must now speak a
little with your Majesties permission to the Monsieur your Brother, your new Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
in arms.</p>
            <p>'Tis to you then (my Lord) that I address my self, and I should be sorry this Book
should go out of my hands without some honorable testimonie of your Grandeur. You

that God has so liberally conferred upon your Royal Family. O (my Lord) you have
great reason to think, and to assure your self, that Almighty God has design'd you for

as all the rest depend upon men of the long Robe. Of such there are a great
many in the Kings Council: you have nothing to do with these people, neither indeed
is it proper you should; for <hi>too many irons in the fire never do well,</hi> and it is an old saying,
<hi>All covet, all lose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If your Highness will please a little to reflect upon what I take the boldness to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
before you, you will find that it will be necessary, seeing you are in so high a Station,
to weigh and consider what it is that may help to maintain and support you in so great
and so honorable a Command, than which nothing can be greater. Shall it be from
these young Captains that you are to expect it? no certainly; for in these kind of people
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is no manner of experience, but rather levity and folly. Shall it be from men of
the long Robe? You are yet less to expect it from them than from the other. They will
talk like fresh-water Soldiers; they meddle but too much that way, and upon the
Green-Cloth will be prating of Arms, that they no more understand than the Carpet
they prate upon. From whom then? It is from the old Captains who have been exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in Arms, and have passed the rude trial of Battels, Combats, Skirmishes, Sieges,
and Aslaults. They will have cause to remember what they have seen, and will no doubt
be mindful enough of the losses they have sustein'd, as also by what error and default the
misfortune befell them. If they have been well beaten they will have cause to remember,
and if they have been victorious they will hardly forget it. If you take advice of such
men you cannot fail of keeping up your greatness, and of encreasing your reputation and
renown: for of such you will learn to know how rightly to command, and shall retein
from them what they shall represent before you, when giving an account of what they
have seen. You cannot employ your time better than to learn prudence to such a degree,
that Posteritie may triumph in your Name; and I know you are of too good a Race, not
to covet that your renown should flourish after you are dead.</p>
            <p>There may peradventure be some old Captains about you, who have neither done nor
seen any great matters; for having lov'd their Houses and their Riches better than the
exercise of Arms. Truly (my Lord) there are two many Gentlemen of this humour, and
the King would do well to degrade such dunghil-bred Gentlemen from all Nobilitie, who
can command nothing but their Hounds and Greyhounds, whilst others are seeking dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the field, and think it sufficient that they can wind a Horn. There is also another
sort of men, who for want of understanding cannot retein what they have seen. They
can perhaps say I was at the Battels of <hi>Cerizolles</hi> and <hi>Dreux, Iarnac</hi> and <hi>Moncontour,</hi> but
they are not able to give any account how Monsieur <hi>d' Anguien</hi> won the first, and how
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> sav'd the second; the Errors the Admiral committed in the two others,
your Highness noble resolution, and finally all that passed, with the reasons both of the
one and the other, nor any thing of all this; so that you would say they had never heard
talk of it, no more than the most stupid loggerheaded Lancequenet that was there. These
are not the men you are to rely upon. You are not nevertheless to reject these people,
for you are to make use of all sorts of men, especially in matters of war.</p>
            <p>The men you ought to have about your person, and of your Cabinet Council, should
be such old Captains as have reputation to be men without fear, vigilant, and prompt of
execution. Such a Captain there may be, as may have done one brace thing in his life;
but who by his slowness may have lost a hundred fair opportunities, where honor and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:105656:208"/>
might have been obtein'd. Yet will I not say that you ought absolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
these people: I am not so imprudent as to intend any such thing; for so peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I may singe my own wings, though what I am you will see in my Book. I dare
presume to say, that at this time good and valiant Leaders do not grow by clusters, nor
are to be sold by the dozen. You should, Sir, do something for every one of what degree
soever; not for all alike, but according to every man's merit and renown. I know some
will tell you, that if you draw so many about you, they will put you upon making great
demands of the King; (for Soldiers are bold beggars) and that peradventure his Majestie
may take offence at it; but for this there is a remedy good enough in the old Rule.</p>

            <p>By speaking them fair, and vouchsafing obliging language, you will entertein them
in hopes that you do not forget them, but that when an opportunitie presents it self,
you will be ready to do them the best Offices in your power. A kind reception, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
smile, a friendly embrace, will keep them in breath. But if there be such a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
importunate fellow, that will not be satisfied with your gracious answers, you may
conclude, that that man neither serves the King nor you heartily, or out of any great good
will or affection to your person. Such people will never do you any good; and if the chance
of war do not of it self free you from them, there are waies enough to shake them off;
and whosoever he is that serves his Prince more out of avarice than affection, is unsound
at the heart: For an avaritious servant when he sees he cannot satisfie his appetite of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will desire to change his Master, thinking to get more by another, and to that end
will corrupt others by the complaints that he will daily make to the rest, of the ill usage
they receive. Avoid then (my Lord) having to do with such kind of people, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before their venom have poison'd the rest: for such men do all they possibly can to
make their Prince hated, to the end that they may cover their own private malice under
the colour of a publick Odium, and such are easie to be known. Such I have known,
and such you daily see, who although they bow under the burthen of the Kings
bounty never cease asking, nor ever will.</p>
            <p>Moreover (my Lord) to nourish the good will, and cherish the affection of Gentlemen
and Captains, you may do well sometimes to write to them, that they may be certain they
are in your favour and remembrance; for this will make them believe that you have a
desire to perform something more and greater than before, and that you intend to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
your fortune. And from this I will tell you what will follow, they will shew your
Letters to their Relations and Friends, who so soon as they shall see them, and that you
have such a one in so great esteem as to honor him with your Letters, they will lay out
all they can wrap and wring to put themselves into equipage to follow him, by which
means one servant will bring you twenty or thirty more, out of the hopes they shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that in doing you service, you will be as gracious to them. And this will cost you no
great trouble, your Secretaries will ease you of that, and but waving one hours recreation,
you will sign more Dispatches than would serve the whole Kingdom. If it be to a man of
very great qualitie, a word or two under your own hand in a Postscript will be no great
trouble: but then it must not be too common, at the same time, nor in the same terms;
a fault that I have evermore observ'd in the Secretaries of Princes, and particularly those
of our own Nation: for they communicate their Letters to one another, and finding them
all run in the same stile, make afterwards no great account of the favour.</p>
            <p>If (my Lords) you shall not please to do as I advise you,<note place="margin">That a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Captain sees that you make no account of him, nor have him not in your remembrance,
he will think you are satisfied with the fortune God has already bestowed upon you, and
that therefore he is no more to hope that you shall have any ambition to be greater than
you are; but that every man must think of retiring to his own house, without caring any
more for Arms. And after a Soldier, let him have never so little a Competencie to live
upon, has once begun to rellish the pleasure of his own House, his Wife, his Hawks, or
his Hounds, and that he is once suffer'd to take that bent, it is a very hard matter to
draw him out of the Chimney-corner to go again to the Wars, and to perswade him to
forsake his soft and warm feathers, to lye abroad upon the hard and cold Turf; and if
you get him out with much ado, it will be with a very ill will, and he will be alwaies

a man has once or twice heard them rattle about his ears, he cares not so much. There is
nothing so prejudicial to War, as to let Soldiers and Officers lye idle and rust. Hang up
your Headpiece, or your Cuirasse against a wall, and in a little space i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cobwebs: it is the same with men of war, if they be suffer'd to lye still and do nothing.
Wherefore your Highness ought to have a special care of this; for keeping your Captains
waking with your Letters, and some little benefits from the King, you will hold every
one in expectation, and ready to march so soon as his Majesties Summons, or your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
shall be brought to them. To this end give your Secretaries order to put you in
mind, for otherwise the Ladies, or the delights of the Court, will put it out of your head.
You are young, and 'tis sit you should taste the pleasures of the world; it is but reasonable
you should know what they are; we have done it before you, and those who are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

            <p>By this Alarm you shall give your Soldiers with your Letters, you will discover to all the
world that you will not forget the facultie that God has given you, nor suffer your Talent
to lye idle; and every one who has an inclination to arms will resolve to attend you to the
utmost stretch of your fortune. You will make it appear, that since God has alreay laid
his hand upon your shoulder, you will trie if he will not lay it upon your head also: you
ought to have an opinion that he will be pleased to do it, and to take the verse in the
Psalm for your Motto. <hi>Coelum Coeli Domino: Terram autem dedit fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

poor Gentleman, and have not the spirit of a King, yet had God pleased to preserve

both which I should have thought well laid out for the purchase of honor. Had my Son
liv'd I do verily believe he would have brought about the design, that the Admiral knows
he had in his head, and that he may acquaint your Highness withal. You are young,
your Brother has the great piece, you are to go seek your fortune elsewhere, and instead
of being a Subject, make others Subjects to you. Since then such a poor fellow as I am

heard) have by their virtue arriv'd at Empire, what are you to hope for who are the Son and
Brother to the greatest King in <hi>Europe?</hi> you ought to look for no less when occasion shall

contented, but still to push on his fortune; the world is so wide there is enough to conquer;

His Majestie will help to set some foreign Crown upon your head. If then God shall
do you the grace to put an end to these miserable domestick Broils, set your designs on
foot, and trie to immortalize your Name. Employ those many Servants you have in
conquering something; and seeing my age, and the wounds I have receiv'd will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

to stop the Career of your Arms, but still to attempt greater and more difficult under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
taking the device of the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> who cut out so much work for your
famous Ancestors. In case you cannot arrive at the utmost aim of your Ambition, you
shall at least advance the better half way to your desires. I have no hopes, being a maim'd

            <p>Behold here (fellows in Arms) you who shall read my life, the end of the Wars in
which I have serv'd five and fifty years together that I had the honor to be in Command
for the Kings my Masters. From which services, that I might not forget them, I brought
away seven Harquebuze-shots for a <hi>Memorandum,</hi>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:105656:209"/>
Kingdoms, which I esteem more than all the riches in the world; and by the Grace
of God, who has ever been assisting to me, I will carry this reputation along with me to
my Grave.<note place="margin">Miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</note> This is a marvelous contentment to me when I think upon it, and call to
mind how I am step by step arriv'd to this degree of honor, and thorough so many dangers
am come to enjoy the short repose that remains to me in this world, in the calm and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of my own house, that I may have leisure to ask God forgiveness for the sins I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Oh if his mercie was not infinitely great, in how dangerous a condition were all
those that bear arms, especially that are in command; for the necessity of war forces us in
despite of our own inclinations to commit a thousand mischiefs, and to make no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the lives of men than of a Chicken: to which the complaints and outcries of the
people, whom we are constrain'd in despite of us every day to swallow up and devoure, and
the Widows and the Fatherless that we every day do make load us with all the curses and
execrations, misery and affliction can help them to invent, which by importuning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and daily imploring the assistance of the Saints, 'tis to be fear'd lye some of them
heavie upon our heads. But doubtless Kings shall yet have a sadder account to make than
we; for they make us commit those evils (as I told the King in discourse at <hi>Tholo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and there is no mischief whereof they are not the cause: for seeing they will make warres,
they should at least pay those who venture their lives to execute their passions, that they
may not commit so many mischiefs as they do. I think my self then exceedingly happy,
in that God has given me leisure to think of the sins I have committed, or rather that the
necessity of war has enforc'd me to commit.<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>de Montluc's</hi> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> For I am not naturally addicted to mischief;
above all I have ever been an enemie to the vice of impurity, and a sworn adversary to all
disloyalty and treason. I know very well and confess, that my passion has made me say,
and do things for which I now cry <hi>Meaculpa;</hi> but 'tis now too late to redress them, and I
have one that lies heavier upon my heart, than all the rest. But had I proceeded other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

have clapt too his Gates against me, had I not alwaies had the Canon at my heels; for
every one had a mind to Lord it. God knows how fit I was to endure such affronts; but
all's done and past; my hand was ever as prompt as my tongue, and it was but a word
and a blow. I could have wisht, could I have perswaded my self to it, never to have worn
a sword by my side, but my nature was quite otherwse, which made me carry for my
device, <hi>Deo Duce, Ferro Comite.</hi> One thing I can truly say of my self, that never any
Kings Lieutenant had more commiseration of the ruine of the people than I, in all places
where ever I came. But it is impossible to discharge those Commands without doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
unless the King had his Coffers cramm'd with Gold to pay his Armies; and yet it
would be much to do. I know not if those that succeed me will do better; but I do not
believe it. All the Catholicks of <hi>Guienne</hi> can witness, if I did not alwaies spare the people:
for I appeal from the Hugonots, I have done them too much mischief to give me any good
testimonie; and yet I have not done them enough, nor so much as I would; my good
will was not wanting. Neither do I care for their speaking ill of me, for they will say as
much or more of their Kings.</p>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:105656:210"/>
to do whenever an opportunity shall present it self.</hi> Sir, this is your Majesties promise, and
a King should never say or promise any thing but he will perform.</p>
            <p>I do not then by any means reproach my Misters; and I ought also to be satisfied,
though I am not rich, that a poor Cadet of <hi>Gascony</hi> is arriv'd at the highest Dignities of
the Kingdom. I see several at this day who murmur and repine at their Majesties; and
for the most part those who have done little or nothing make the greatest complaints. In
others who have really deserv'd something it is a little more pardonable: all that we have,
of what degree soever we are, we hold it of the Kings our Masters. So many great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Lords, Captains, and Soldiers, both living and dead, owe to the King the honors
they have receiv'd; and their Names shall live by the Employments they have receiv'd
from the Kings they serv'd, and were not only enterr'd with those honorable Titles, but
have moreover honour'd those who are descended of them, and mention will be made of
their virtue whilst any Records of honor remain in the world. I have listed a good
number in my Book, and have my self had Soldiers under my Command, who have
been no better in their Extraction, than the Sons of poor labouring men, who have liv'd
and died in a reputation as great and high as they had been the Sons of Lords, through
their own virtue, and the esteem the Kings and their Lieutenants had of them. When
my Son <hi>Marc Anthony</hi> was carried dead to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope and all the Cardinals, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and all the People of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Honor done to</hi> Marc Anthony de Montluc.</note> payd as much honor to his Hearse as if he had been a
Prince of the blood. And what was the cause of all this, but only his own Valour, my
Reputation, and my King, who had made me what I was? So that the name of <hi>Marc
Anthony</hi> is again to be found in the Roman Annals. When I first entred into Arms out
of my Page-ship in the House of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> there was no other discourse but of the great
<hi>Gonsalvo,</hi> call'd the great Captain. How great an honor was it to him (which also will
last for ever) to be crown'd with so many Victories? I have heard it told, that King
<hi>Lewis</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being together, I know not at what place, but it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
where they had appointed an Interview, these two great Princes being sat at Table
together,<note place="margin">Honor done to the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gonsalvo.</hi>
               </note> our King entreated the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to give leave that <hi>Gonsalvo</hi> might dine
with them; which he accordingly did, whilst men of far greater quality than he stood
waiting by. So considerable had the King his Masters favour, and his own valour made
him. This was the honor he receiv'd from the King of <hi>France,</hi> who in recompence for
his having depriv'd him of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> put a weighty Chain of Gold about
his neck. I have heard Monsieur <hi>de Lautrec</hi> say, that he never took so much delight in
looking upon any man, as upon that same. O how fair an Exemple is this for those who
intend to advance themselves by Arms! When I went the second time into <hi>Italy</hi> as I
passed through the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> every one ran to the windows to see him that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<hi>Sienna,</hi> which was a greater satisfaction to me than all the Riches of the Earth.
I could produce several Exemples of French men, of very mean Extraction, who have by
Arms arriv'd at very great Preferments: but out of respect to their Posteritie I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;
but it was the bounty of their Kings that so advanc'd them for the recompence of
their brave services.</p>
            <p>It is then just that we confess, we could be nothing without their bountie and favour;
if we serve them, 'tis out of obedience to the Commandment of God, and we ought not
to try to obtein rewards by importunities and reproaches; and if any one be ill rewarded,
the fault is not in our Kings, but in them who are about them, that do not acquaint them
who have serv'd well, or ill; (for there are many of both sorts) to the end that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
largess should be rightly placed. And there is nothing that goes so much to the
heart of a brave and loyal Subject, as to see the King heap honors and rewards upon such
as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have serv'd him ill. I am sure it is that that has vext me more than any disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my own. I have often heard some men say, the King or the Queen have done
this, and that for such a one, why should they not do as much for me? The King has
pardoned such a one such an offence, why does he not also pardon me? I know also that
their Majesties have said, <hi>They will no more commit such over-sights, we must wink at this
one fault:</hi> but it was the next day to begin the same again. However a man ought never
to stomack any thing from his Prince. The honor of such men lies in a very contemptible
place, since they more value a reward or a benefit than their own reputation or renown,
and are so ready to take snuff if they fail of their expectation. And moreover (as I have
already said) they are commonly men that have never strook three strokes with sword,
and yet will vapour what dangers they have passed, and what hardships they have endur'd.
If a man should strip them naked, one might see many a proper fellow that has not so
much as one fear in all his body. Such men, if they have born arms any while, are very
fortunate, and at the day of Judgment if they go into Paradise, will carry all their blood
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:105656:210"/>
along with them, without having lost one dram of their own, or having shed one drop
of any others here upon earth.</p>
            <p>Others I have heard, and of all sorts of men, even to the meanest, complain that they
have serv'd the King four, five, or six years, and notwithstanding have not been able to
get above three or four thousand Livers yearly Rent: poor men they are sore hurt. I speak
not of the Soldiers only, but of all other conditions of men his Majestie makes use of. I
have heard my Father, who was an old man, and others older than he, report that it was
a common saying at Court, and throughout the whole Kingdom in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Twelfth.
<q>
                  <l>Chastillon, Bourdillon,</l>
                  <l>Galliot, &amp; Bonneval,</l>
                  <l>Governent le sang Royal.</l>
               </q>
and yet I dare be bold to say, that all these four Lords who govern'd two Kings, put them
all together never got ten thousand Livers yearly Revenue. I have formerly said as much
to the Mareschal <hi>de Bourdillon,</hi> who thereupon return'd me answer, that his Predecessor
was so far from getting 3000 Livers a year, that he sold 1500, and left his Family very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous.
Should any one ask the Admiral to shew what his Predecessor, who govern'd
all, got by his favour, I durst lay a good wager he could not produce 2000 Livers yearly
Revenue. As for <hi>Galliot</hi> he liv'd a great while after the others, and he peradventure might
in that long time take together three or four thousand Livers a year. For what concerns
<hi>Bonneval;</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bonneval</hi> that now is, and Monsieur <hi>de Biron</hi> are his Heirs, and I
believe they can boast of no great Estates. O happy Kings that had such Servants. 'Tis easie
to discern that these men serv'd their Masters out of the love and affection they bore to their
persons and the Crown, and not upon the account of reward; and I have heard that they
evermore rather begg'd for the King's own Domestick Servants, than for themselves.
They are gone down to their Graves with honor, and their Successors are not nevertheless
in want.</p>
            <p>Since I have spoken of others, I will now say something of my felf. Some perhaps after
I am dead will talk of me, as I talk of others. I confess that I am very much oblig'd to
the Kings I have serv'd, especially to <hi>Henry</hi> my good Master, as I have often said before,
and I had now been no more than a private Gentleman, had it not been for their bounty,
and the opportunities they gave me to acquire that reputation I have in the world; which
I value above all the treasure the Earth contains, having immortaliz'd the name of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc.</hi>
And although during the long time that I have born arms, I have acquir'd but very
little wealth, yet has no one ever heard me complain of the Kings my Masters: marry I
have spoke at mouth of those about them, when in these late Troubles I was calumniated by
them, as if I could have done all things with nothing. Believe me the wounds I have
receiv'd have administred more comfort than affliction to me; and one thing I am sure of,
that when I am dead they can hardly say, that at the Resurrection I shall carry all the
blood, bones and veins I brought with me into the world from my Mothers womb, along
with me into Paradise. As for Riches I have enough. It is true, that had I been bred
up in the School of the Baylif of <hi>Esperon,</hi> I should have had more; the story is not amiss,
and therefore I shall insert it here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth going to <hi>Bayonne</hi> lay in a Village call'd <hi>Esperon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A pleasant sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff of <hi>Esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> which is nearer to
<hi>Bayonne</hi> than two <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Now upon the great Road betwixt these two places, the
Baylif had built a very noble House. The King thought it very strange, that in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
so bare and barren as that was, and amongst Downs and Sands that would bear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
this Baylif should build so fine a House, and at supper was speaking of it to the
Chamberlain of his Household; who made answer, that the Baylif was a rich man:
which the King not knowing how to believe, considering the wretched Country his house
was seated in, he immediately sent for him, and said to him these words. <hi>Come on Baylif,
and tell me why you did not build your fine House in some place where the Country was good and
fertile?</hi> Sir, answer'd the Baylif, <hi>I was born in this Country, and find it very good for
me. Are you so rich,</hi> said the King, <hi>as they tell me you are? I am not poor,</hi> replied the
other, <hi>I have (blessed be God) wherewithal to live.</hi> The King then askt him, <hi>how it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he should grow so rich in so pitiful a barren Country. Why, very easily Sir,</hi> answer'd the other, <hi>because I
have ever had more care to do my own business, than that of my Master, or my Neighbours.
The Devil refuse me,</hi> said the King (for that was alwaies his Oath) <hi>thy reason is very good;
for doing so, and rising betimes, thou couldst not choose but thrive.</hi> O how many Sons has
this Baylif left behind him to inherit this virtuous humour! I was never any of those.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:105656:211"/>
I do really believe, that there is never a little Pedlar in the world, who, having trotted,
run and moyl'd as I have done, but would have enricht himself to a Merchant. And
there is never a Treasurer nor a Receiver (let him be as honest as he would) in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that had had so much money pass through his hands, as has done through mine,
but more would have stuck to his fingers. I have been seven or eight times Captain of
Foot, which is none of the worst Commands for getting of money; and I have known
several Captains in my time, who have enricht themselves meerly out of their Soldiers
pay. I was not so ignorant, nor so raw a Soldier, neither did I want dexterity, but that
I could have done the feat as well as they; neither was it any such hard matter to learn,
for with a good Quarter-master, and some few other little helps the business had been done.
I have since been three times Camp-master, in which Employment God knows I might
have had Skip-jacks enow to have made Muster, and intelligence enough with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries.
I could have discover'd when any thing was to be got, as soon or sooner than
any man in the Army, I had nose good enough. I was after Governor of a place, where
I could have had fourscore or a hundred men at my devotion to have passed Muster, as
Messieurs les Govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urs know well how to do: by which means, having been so long in
these Commands as I have been, and made so many Musters as I have done in my life, with
a little good husbandry, Good God! what a Mountain of Gold might I have had! I
never think of it but it makes me wonder at my own honesty, that could resist so many
temptations. I was moreover the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Sienna,</hi> and another time at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talsin;</hi>
where I had wayes enow to have lin'd my pockets, as others in the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
have done: for it had been no more but to have had intelligence with three or four
Merchants, who should have affirm'd that the Corn of the Garrison had been bought by
them, and taken up upon their Credit, and it had been done. God knows what profits
are made of these Magazines. I could then have made demands upon the account of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,
and have deputed some who would have been ready to have taken the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon them, to have brought in a hundred or two hundred thousand Francks in
Debentures. But instead of this his Majesty owed us five payes when we came out of
<hi>Sienna,</hi> whereof I found means to acquit him of three so soon as we came to <hi>Montalsin.</hi>
Afterwards the second time that I was sent thither, in the place of Monsieur <hi>de Soubize,</hi> I
stay'd six weeks by the Kings Command at <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pope, and his Majesties Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
and Agents. It was at the time when the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> made war with his
Holiness, and all the Sea-coast was ready to be abandon'd, and <hi>Grossette</hi> was not able any
longer to subsist, having not a grain of Corn, no more than the other Garrisons. I found
at <hi>Rome</hi> some <hi>Siennois</hi> Gentlemen, that marcht out of <hi>Sienna</hi> with me, who brought me
acquainted with a Banquer call'd <hi>Iulio d' Albia,</hi> a <hi>Siennois</hi> also, who upon my own bare

the Barrel, conditionally that I should monthly pay him 600 Crowns at every Muster.
This money I could no way raise but out of the deductions I reserv'd from the Musters,
and instead of putting it into my own pocket, I accordingly paid him all, the last pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only excepted; for there was no more money, nor means to have any; so that we
made no Muster. I might have made my advantage of this, for I furnisht several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that stood in need, according to the authority I was invested withal; and I sav'd half
the Corn, which I lent to the Country people, who were more distrest for bread than the
Soldiers. There it was that I began to play the Usurer; but it was at the expence of the
King's Conscience; for, for every Muid that I lent them then, I receiv'd two at the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest;
and indeed it was double worth at the time when I lent it, and yet a penny of this
profit never came into my purse, for I left it all to the King. I stay'd yet seven months
longer in these parts, without receiving so much as one Pay; during four months of
which I made my men live of twenty ounces of bread a day out of the profits I made of
the Corn, saving as much as in me lay my Masters money. The other three Months I
paid the Soldiers with good words, and the liberality of my Bonnet, as I had done at
<hi>Sienna.</hi> Some time after <hi>Don Francisco</hi> arriv'd, who found Corn yet in the Magazine.
I moreover dealt with the Dutchess <hi>de Castro,</hi> Wife to the Duke who was slain at <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi>
who knew Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother, at the time when he was in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Pope <hi>Paul Farnese.</hi> Pope <hi>Paul Caraffa</hi> had made a Prohibition, that no manner
of Grain should be carried out of <hi>Romania;</hi> but this Dutchess under hand permitted cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Merchants to bring it by night into our Territories, where our merchants met, and
bought it of them. I carried this practice very close, of which I could have made a very
great advantage to my own private profit; but never so much as one Liard came into
my purse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:105656:211"/>I could have brought the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any Country equal to it,<note place="margin">The fertility of <hi>Guienne.</hi>
               </note> either in Riches or Conveniencie of Living. And having such
an Employment, I could have had intelligence with the Receiver of the Province, (those
kind of men desire no better) and have stuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my own Coffers; for what upon Musters,
Garrisons, and Equipages of the Artillerie, I could have made infinite advantages. How
many Impositions might I have laid upon the Country? for the King had given me power
to do it, which would have turn'd to my particular benefit: for although his Majesty
in that Commission doubtless intended those Levies for his own service; I could, if I
would have put the charge upon him, and have converted a great part of them to my
own proper use. I could if I would have fir'd Towns, and have sent a <hi>Will with the wisp</hi>
up and down to the Towns and Villages to whisper the principal Inhabitants in the ear,
that they must either give me money to free them, or that otherwise I would cause them to
be undone, and come quarter Soldiers upon them, who should eat them to the very bones:
for they know men of our Trade are seldom weary of ill doing. I could also have sent
to tell the Hugonots, who liv'd at home under the protection of the Edict, that unless
they greased me in the first, I would cause them all to be ruin'd and pull'd in pieces;
and what would they not have given me to have secur'd their Lives and Estates? for they
did not greatly confide in me, hearing how I had handled them before. But instead of
making use of such Artifices of these to enrich my self, I let the Captains and Gens-d'arms,
and others who serv'd the King, and askt it of me, take all; reserving very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to my own benefit. And even that which I had at <hi>Clairac</hi> I took by the King's
permission. Let others therefore rest content. If God would please to let me be once cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of this great Harquebuze-shot in my Face, I think yet, that should the War break
out again, I should be one to mount to horse; and I think it is not far off; for so long
as there are two Religions, <hi>France</hi> will evermore be in division and trouble. It cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
be, and the worst on't is, 'tis a War that will not be ended of a long time.
Other quarrels are easily compos'd, but that for Religion has no end. And although the
Martial sort of men are not very devout, they however side, and being once engag'd
stick to their Party. In the posture that affairs now stand, I do not think we are at an
end. However I have this satisfaction in my self, that I have to my utmost opposed it,
and done my best endeavour to settle the peace of the Kingdom. Would to God that all
those who have been in Command had conniv'd no more than I. But we must let God
work his own will. After he has sufficiently scourg'd us for our sins he will burn
the Rod.</p>
            <p>And now, you Lords and Captains, who shall do me the honor to read my Book,
let me beseech you not to read it with prejudice, but believe that I have deliver'd the
truth, without depriving any one of his due and merited honor. I make no question
but that some will bring some things that I have here related into dispute, to see if they
can catch me tripping in point of truth; forasmuch as they will find that God has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more accompanied the fortune of any man, for the Employments I have gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
than he did mine. But let me assure such, that I have omitted an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of passages and particularities, by reason that I never committed any thing to writing,
nor ever kept any memorial, as never suspecting my self to become a Writer of Books. I
ever thought my self unfit for that Employment, but in the time of my last hurt, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my sicknesses I have dictated this that I leave you, to the end that my name may
not be buried in oblivion; nor so many other gallant men, whom I have seen perform so
many and so brave exploits:<note place="margin">Negligence of Historians.</note> for the Historians write only of Kings and Princes. How

no notice of at all, no more than of the valour and gallant behaviour of a great number of
your Fathers and Kindred, whose names you will find here. Do not then think it strange
if I have been so fortunate as I have written, for I never minded any thing but my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and have ever acknowledg'd that all my successes came from God, into whose
hands I ever resign'd my self and all my affairs; although the Hugonots were pleased

I can say with truth, that upon sight of the Enemy I have found my self so possest with
fear, that I have felt my heart beat, and my limbs tremble (let us not make our selves

it from no other but thee alone. If thou hast this day appointed me to die, grant that I may

I ask thee not my life, for I desire nothing but what pleases thee. Thy will be done, I resigne

I declare and protest in the presence of God and men, that I suddenly felt a heat creep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
my heart and members, so that I had no sooner made an end, but that I found my
self quite another man than when I began. I was no more afraid, and my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

your hands) to do me right, and declare whether what I have here deliver'd be true, or false;
for you have been eye-witnesses of part of it; and I fancie that after my death you will

whether whenever there was a debate about any Execution, I did not alwayes think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

impossible to be effected. I undertook it, and brought it about, having evermore
that stedfast assurance in God, that he would not forsake me, but open the eyes of my
understanding to see what was to be done to make my Enterprize succeed. I never thought
any thing impossible but the taking of <hi>Thionville,</hi> of which the honor is to be attributed to
Monsieur <hi>de Guise</hi> alone, and in truth there was more of fortune than reason in that success,
though the said Sieur <hi>de Guise</hi> was ever confident he should carry it, and so he did.</p>
            <p>Fellows in arms, how many and how great things shall you perform if you put your
whole trust in God, and set honor continually before your eyes? discoursing with your
selves, that if it be determin'd you shall end your dayes in a Breach' tis to much pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to stay behind in the Graffe.<note n="*" place="margin">A brave death illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates a man's whole life.</note> 
               <hi>Vn bel morir,</hi> (sayes the Italian) <hi>tuta la vita honora.</hi>
'Tis to die like a beast for a man to leave no memory behind him. Never go about to
deprive another man of his honor, nor ever set avarice and ambition in your prospect:
for you will find that it will all come to nought, and end in misery and disgrace. I do
not say this that I have any mind to play the Preacher, but meerly out of respect to truth.
How many are there in the world, who are yet living, and whom I shall forbear to name,
that have had the reputation of valiant men, and yet have been very unfortunate in their
undertaking? Believe me the hand of God was in this, and though they might implore
his divine ayd, their devotion was not right, which made the Almighty adverse to them.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:105656:212"/>
If therefore you would have God to be assisting to you, you must strip your selves of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
avarice, and rancour, and be full of the love and loyaltie we all owe to our Prince.
And in so doing although his quarrel should not be just, God will not for all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his assistance from you: for it is not for us to ask our King if his cause be good or
evil, but only to obey him. And if you are not rewarded for the services you have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
you will not stomack your being neglected, by reason it was not your intention
nor design to fight upon the score of ambition and greatness, nor out of a thirst of riches;
but upon the account of fidelity, and duty that God has commanded you to bear to your
Prince and Sovereign. You will rejoyce to find your selves esteem'd and belov'd by all
the world, which is the greatest Treasure a man of honor ought to cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. For great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and high Titles perish with the body, but a good Reputation and Renown are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
as the Soul. I now see my self drawing towards my end, and languishing in my bed
towards my dissolution, and 'tis a great consolation to me, that in spite of Death my name
shall live and flourish, not only in <hi>Gascony,</hi> but moreover in foreign Nations.</p>
            <p>This then is the end of my Book, and of thus far of my life, which if God shall please
longer to continue to me, some other may write the rest, if ever I shall again be in place,
where I shall perform any thing worthy of my self; which nevertheless I do not hope for,
finding my self so infinitely decayed, that I never again expect to be able to bear arms.
I have however this obligation to the Harquebuze shot, which has pierced through and
shatter'd my face, that it has been the occasion of writing these Commentaries, which I
have an opinion will continue when I am dead and gone. I entreat all those who shall
read them, not to look upon them as proceeding from the Pen of an Historian, but of an
old Soldier, and a <hi>Gascon,</hi> who has writ his own life truly, and in the rough stile of a
Soldier. All such as bear arms may take exemple by it, and acknowledge that from God
alone proceed the successes or the misfortunes of men. And seeing we ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to him alone, let us beseech him to assist and advise us in all our afflictions, for in
this world there is nothing else, of which the great ones have their share as well as the
meanest of us all. Wherein he manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed from his correcting hand, and who stand not continually in need
of him and his divine assistance.</p>
            <p>Do not disdain, you who desire to follow arms, instead of reading <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi>
and <hi>Launcelot du Lake,</hi> to spend sometimes an hour in reading what I have done, and in
taking notice of what I have been, in this Treatise that I leave behind me. By which
means you shall learn to know your selves, and betimes to form your selves to be Soldiers
and Captains; for you must first learn to obey, that you may afterwards know how to
command. This is not for silk-worms, and spruce Courtiers to do; nor for those that are
in love with their ease, but for such as by the ways of virtue, and at the price of their lives
will endeavour to immortalize their names, as I hope, in despite of envy I have done that

               <p>Now I ever said with my self, hearing news from Court (for I had yet some corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence

and saw very well that there was some mischief a brewing. The King by his Letters,
which I have yet by me, and also in discourse to several of my friends, was pleased to
declare, that he was no way dissatisfied with me, that he desir'd to manifest how much
I was in his favour and esteem, and that my own indisposition had been the only reason
of his putting the Marquis <hi>de Villars</hi> into my place. I was content to believe it to be so;

and so wise a man, and a man so well beaten to the affairs of the world should commit so
gross an error. He paid dear for it, for it cost him his life, and many others. And indeed,
to speak the truth, he had brought great troubles upon the Kingdom; for I know that

would I have given ear to him, he would have told me all. I acquainted the Queen
with every syllable of it; but she enjoyn'd me silence. She did not then think that things
would have come to that pass, that they afterwards did. I know very well, and it is very
well known to all the world, that she was accused for the cause of the Commotions, that

<hi>Germany,</hi> to shew them, and cause them to be printed and published in all places:
which nevertheless did not much advance his affairs. The said Lady the Queen being at
<hi>Tholouze,</hi> did me the honor to talk with me above three hours upon that subject,
and said a great many things to me, that I shall be so wise as to keep to my self. So it is,

But I shall wave this discourse (for perhaps I say too much) and return to my former
subject.</p>

The rest turn'd Catholicks, or at least seem'd to do so. For my part I did them no harm
on my side; but they were every where used exceedingly ill. I then thought that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Army, which at that time lay before <hi>Rochelle,</hi> was design'd for something else than to
go into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and then sounded the bottom of the Design: but I could not imagine
why they had only wounded the Admiral at first, having the design that I afterwards
saw they had. For had all the Hugonots the next day resolv'd with the great ones of their
Faction, it had been easie for them to have retir'd from <hi>Paris,</hi> and to have put themselves
into some place of safety: But they were blinded, and God depriv'd them of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
I shall not here take upon me to determine whether this proceeding was good
or evil; for there is a great deal to be said on both sides, and besides it were now to no
purpose, for it would do no good. Those that follow after us may speak to better effect,
and without fear. For the Writers of this Age dare not speak out, but mince the matter;
for my part I had rather hold my peace, and say nothing.</p>
               <p>Though I had at this time no other Command than that of my own House and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
yet was the Queen pleased to do me the honor to write to me, and to send me word,
that there was a dangerous Conspiracy discover'd against the King and his Crown, which
had been the occasion of that which had hapned. I know very well what I thought: 'tis

God knows whether I did not send the Queen my advice touching this affair. At the
Voyage of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> and afterwards at her coming into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> I had proposed it to
her, to make her self Mistress of it, without noise, or breeding the least disturbance; and
by what I gather'd from Monsieur de <hi>Iarnac</hi> (to whom I discover'd my self a little, and
not too much) I think there would have been very little difficulty in the business. She
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:105656:213"/>
was evermore afraid of renewing the War; but for so delicate a morsel one would not
have been nice of breaking the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been to much purpose for them to have complain'd. There would have been wayes enow
found out to have appeas'd the people; for what could any one have said, if the King
would have built a Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This City has furnisht the Hugonots with means to renew the Wars, and will still
do it, if the King does not take it from them, to which end nothing should be omitted.
For thorough the conveniencie of this City they manage the intelligences they have in

I was astonisht to see so many men, so many minds; for they were strangely divided
in their inclinations, and a great many there were who would have been sorry the Town
should have been taken. The Siege was great and long, and many handsome actions
were there perform'd, but <hi>well assaulted, better defended.</hi> I shall not take upon me
to give the Narrative of the particularities of this Siege, for I was no more than a private
person, and I will speak ill of no one. The Monsieur that commanded in chief at this
Siege, and has since been King, knows very well, that having done me the honor to talk
with me, and to ask my advice, I told him frankly what I thought. By this Leaguer all
men who were present at it, and those who come after us, may judg, that places of such
importance are either to be taken by famine, blocking them up, or foot by foot with time
and patience. There was here a great fault committed, in hazarding so many men in
Assaults, and another greater in keeping so ill watch, that supplies of powder came in by
Sea, as they continually did: but to tell you my opinion, (which was also that of a great
many others) they had been our own in spite of the best they could have done for their
defence, and must have come out to us with Ropes about their necks; for the Succours the
Count <hi>de Montgommery</hi> brought them were retir'd, and we were upon the point to grapple
with them, for they were reduced to the last necessity of all things. But at the same time
Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother was in <hi>Poland,</hi> to labour the Monsieurs election to that
Kingdom,<note place="margin">The Monsieur elected King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </note> as he did. And I think the glory of that business is due to him: but it was also
the cause that every one thought of entring into Capitulation with the Rochellors, as at
last they did. The Deputies of <hi>Poland</hi> there came to salute the Monsieur for their King,
and every one retir'd to prepare himself to see the Solemnity of this new Crown; so that
after having lost a vast number of men at this Siege, we left the Rochellors still in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their City. It seem'd by some words the Monsieur cast out at his departure, that
he was not very well satisfied with this new Kingdom: for my part I think it was a great
honor both to him, and to us all, that so remote a Kingdom should come to seek a King
in ours. Monsieur <hi>de Valence</hi> my Brother got a great deal of honor in this Negotiation,
and his Orations are very fine, I make no doubt but he will insert them in his History.</p>
               <p>During these unhappy Wars, and this Siege, where I lost several of my Kindred and
Friends, the Admiral <hi>de Villars,</hi> who was the Kings Lieutenant in <hi>Guienne,</hi> did in my opinion
the best he could; and in truth there was not much to do, for the Hugonots were squandred
here and there like a Covey of flown Partridges. But having taken a little heart by the
length of this Siege, they made some attempts, which made me for my last misfortune,
to lose my Son <hi>Fabian</hi> Signieur <hi>de Montesquien,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fabian de Montluc <hi>

give him this testimony, that he was loyal and brave; and I verily believ'd that the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for his death would have ended my dayes, but God gave me courage to bear my loss;
not with that patience I should have done, but as well as I could.</p>
               <p>In the mean time all <hi>France</hi> was full of Triumphs to honor the departure of the new
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> whilst I remain'd at my own house, without other company than my own
sorrows, saving that sometimes I was visited by my friends, and the Gentlemen of the
Country. The King about this time made a new removal, which was very prejudicial to
the Province of <hi>Guienne.</hi> Those who follow after us will learn to be wise by the oversights
of others; and the error that his Majesty here committed, was, that he divided the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Gvienne</hi> into two parts, wherein he gave all on this side the <hi>Garonne</hi> towards
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:105656:214"/>
                  <hi>Gascony</hi> to Monsieur <hi>de la Valette,</hi> and that on the other side to Monsieur <hi>de Losse.</hi> This
was a very great mistake in the Kings Council; and more especially in the Queen, who
would again divide it into three parts, to give one to Monsieur <hi>de Gramont.</hi> 'Twas pitty
that so many wise head-pieces had not taken notice what inconveniences had already
accru'd by giving so much power to Monsieur <hi>d' Anville</hi> before, by reason of the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
there had been betwixt him and me, of which I have elsewhere given an account;
and seeing all the forces of the whole Province, under one head, had enough to do to
cause the King to be obey'd, what was to be expected from them, when separated, and
under several mens Commands? This sows jealousie and dissention amongst them, which
in the end grows to absolute breach; and all at the expence of the King and his people.
The effects soon discover'd themselves; for Monsieur <hi>de Losse</hi> undertook the Siege of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi>
a pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>de la Valette</hi> was also present, but it was only in the quality of a looker on: where in the
end he did nothing worth speaking of; neither indeed am I at all concern'd in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
so that what I say is only to enform the King, that to be well serv'd he ought never to
divide a Government, but commit it entire to one Lieutenant only. His Kingdom is wide
enough to satisfie the ambition of those who are greedy of Employments; and, with his
Majesties pardon, they ought to stay their time, there will be enough for all.</p>
               <p>Some time after we heard so many strange things, that me-thought I saw the Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes

others to examine. A little while after, news came of the Kings being sick, and of several
great persons at Court being committed to prison, which made me think my self happy that
I was so far off; for a man is often trapt when he least expects it, and when he knows no

                  </note> In the end of all, news came of the death of the King, which was in truth a

out of his own Kingdom. Wherein if the King of <hi>Poland</hi> would have joyn'd with him,

would have bowed before them, and the Empire would again have been restor'd to the

in the Kingdom; for instead of composing all differences and disorders in the State, and
establishing peace and tranquility amongst us, which at that time had been a very easie
matter to do; they perswaded him to resolve upon a War. And they yet perswaded him
to a greater inconvenience, for they made him believe, that entring into <hi>Dauphiné</hi> all places
would immediately surrender to him, whereas notwithstanding he found, that every
paltry Garrison made head against him: but I have nothing to do to give an account
of those transactions. At his coming he was pleased to be exceedingly gracious and kind
to me; and yet he was not so to all; and indeed I observ'd him to be much alter'd in his
humor, from what he was wont to be. There were there some publick Councils held, but
there were also others that were private, and very closely carried.</p>
               <p>Now his Majesty calling to mind the services I had done for the Kings his Grandfather,
Father, and Brother; some of which he had heard of, and others had himself also seen,
he was resolv'd to honor me with the Estate of Mareschal of <hi>France,</hi>

in honor, since he could not do it in matter of wealth and estate. Having therefore caus'd
me to be call'd for, and being come, to kneel down before him, after I had taken the Oath,
he put the Mareschal's Staffe into my hand: Which having done, in returning my most
humble thanks, I told him, <hi>That I had no other grief in this world, but that I had not ten
good years in my belly, wherein to manifest how much I desir'd to be serviceable to his Majesty
and Crown in that honorable Command.</hi> Having receiv'd his Commands, and those of the
Queen, I return'd into <hi>Gascony</hi> to make preparation for war, for all things tended that

way: but I very well perceiv'd by the tediousness of my Journey, that I was rather to
think of dying my self, than of killing others: for I was no more able to endure long
Journies, nor to undergo any great labour. And moreover I very well foresaw, that the
same would happen betwixt the Kings Lieutenants and me, that had hapned before betwixt
me and the Mareschal <hi>d' Anville.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometime after the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> writ me a Letter, that the Hugonots were
playing prancks upon the River <hi>Dordogne,</hi> that some course must be taken with them, and
that therefore they entreated me to draw a little nearer to them, that some order might
be taken to prevent them from proceeding to greater mischief. I hereupon accordingly

<hi>de Merville, de Monferran,</hi> and <hi>de Gourgues</hi> came to meet me, and there propos'd to me
a great many things. I was not to seek in my answer, neither did I want sufficient excuses,
particularly that some promises that had been made me had not been made good; to which
I also remonstrated to them my Age and indisposition; and moreover the said Sieurs <hi>de
Merville</hi> and <hi>de Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them withal with the Oath I had made never more to bear arms; but in the end I
could not deny them, and they made me break my Oath. They being then return'd to
make preparation for the attacquing of <hi>Gensac,</hi> I went thither. Presently after Monsieur
<hi>de Monferran</hi> brought a brave Troop of Gentlemen out of his Government, (as also seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

de la Marque,</hi> and <hi>de la Devese,</hi> there went on in their Doublets only, with their Swords
in their hands up to the very Gates of the City, which was very madly done of them, for
the Harquebuze shot flew very thick; but they did it in emulation of one another, and
to shew that they were men without fear:<note place="margin">Monsieur <hi>de Monferran</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Monferran</hi> receiv'd a Harquebuze shot quite through the body, of which he died; which
was great pity, for he was a Gentleman of extraordinary valour, and mightily belov'd
of the Country, which will find a great miss of him.</p>
               <p>The Enemy seeing themselves coopt in after this manner, and the Canon ready to play,
sent out a great Rogue, whom they call'd Captain<note n="*" place="margin">Or Cooper.</note> 
                  <hi>Tonnellier,</hi> but a very good Soldier,
as it was said, who capitulated and surrendred the place; in which Monsieur <hi>de Rausan,</hi>
Brother to Monsieur <hi>de Duras,</hi> was placed Governor. I must now give an account of an
accident that befel me at this Siege, which had never hapned to me before. After the
death of Monsieur <hi>de Monferran</hi> I thought fit to dispose of the Command he had in the
Army to Monsieur <hi>de Duras,</hi> conceiving that he being a Gentleman of so good a Family,
as he was, he would be very well accepted by all: but every one was not well pleased with
my choice.<note place="margin">The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</note> From which another mischief also arose, which was, I was told, that the
Gentlemen who were come along with these Messieurs, to serve me upon this occasion, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
complained of some words which I had spoken of them, as false as the Devil himself.
The words were unhandsome and dirty, for which reason I will not blot my paper with
them; but they were all in so high a mutiny upon it, that they were ready to mount to
horse, and leave me engag'd with the Canon. I therefore sent to entreat them to do me
the favour as to take the field bettimes in the morning, where I had something to say to
them; which accordingly they did. I was so early that I went by Torch-light, so impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
I was to ease my heart; where the Gentlemen being all drawn round about me, with
my hat in my hand, I spake to them to this effect.</p>

Countries: others also that are here present, I make no question, have heard talk
of me, of my chollerick disposition and hasty humour; but I assure my self not one of
you, as many as you are, ever knew, or ever heard, that I was of a detractive or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
nature; and although I am not without my faults, yet have I never been guilty
of that. How comes it then to pass, that you have done me the wrong to believe that
I should be so indiscreet as to speak of you with such contempt, as I am told has been
reported to you? Believe me I am so far from being guilty of such an injury to you who
are Gentlemen, that I would not have spoken such a word of the meanest Soldier in
the Army. I have ever lov'd and honour'd the Gentry, for under God it is they who have
help't me to that honor and reputation I have acquir'd amongst men. You know very
well, Gentlemen, that in the quality I now stand I am out of Combat, and therefore
shall not give the lye to any; but I do assure you it is nothing so, and that I never ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:105656:215"/>
such a syllable; neither would I have done it for the world. Methinks at this
age, and after having seen so much as I have done, I should know what it is to live in the
world, and be careful of offending so many persons of honor, and Gentlemen of good
and noble Families. Now (Gentlemen) I have understood the resolution you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to retire to your own houses, for which I am very sorry; as also that you dislike
the nomination I have made of Monsieur <hi>de Duras.</hi> Wherein I shall so far comply
with your satisfaction, as not to impose him upon you contrary to your liking, and
seeing you are dissatisfied with my choice shall no more name him to you. His Majesty
shall appoint some other in the place of the late Monsieur <hi>de Monferran,</hi> whom I lament
from my soul. In the mean time, Gentlemen, do not deny me this one favour at least,
to convoy the Canon to some place of safety; which if you shall not think fit to do
for my sake, who have so many years been your Leader and Captain, yet do it for the
affection and service you owe to the King your Lord and Soveraign. As for my own
part, I will also go retire to my own house; for my age, my wounds, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
will no longer permit me to bear arms, nor to undergo the labours requir'd
in war. Love me alwayes I beseech you, and remember your old Captain and fellow-Souldier.</p>

               <p>This Remonstrance of mine gave satisfaction to all, insomuch that they all told me
with one voice, <hi>that in truth this story had given them very great offence, it being reported
to them by one that carried the name of a Gentleman: but they now believ'd nothing of it,
that they were my servants, and ready not only to convoy the Canon, but also to follow me
wherever I would please in command them.</hi> I thought fit to commit this passage to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to the end that those who follow after may learn how to behave themselves upon
the like occasion. Had I upon the instant known the man that had raised this fine
report of me, I doubt I should have shew'd him a scurvy trick: but the Canon was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
back, which they attended till they saw it lodg'd in safety, and so we took leave of
one another, and departed every man to his own home.</p>
               <p>I had not been long at my own house before I had every day very strange news brought
me from Court, and of great designs that were laid by the greatest men of the Kingdom:
but when I heard that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> made one amongst them, and was stoln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from Court without taking his leave, I from that time forward concluded that <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi>
was again to suffer many miseries; for that he being a great Prince, young, and who
gave visible hopes of being one day a great Captain, would easily gain the hearts of the
Nobless and the People, and would keep the rest in awe. So God help me a thousand
mischiefs were eternally before my eyes, so that I was often in mind to withdraw my self
to avoid the affliction of hearing so continual ill news, and of seeing the ruine of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country. To which end a certain Priory was evermore running in my head, that I
had formerly seen situated in the mountains, part in <hi>France,</hi> and part in <hi>Spain,</hi> call'd

               <l>Invincible au travail, apres Fonterabie</l>
               <l>Ie vis ô grand malheur, la route de Pavie,</l>

               <l>Avec le fer au poing i'ay brise mon tombeau.</l>
